To give you an idea of what he is like, I will take it from the Road Rovers Wiki just in case you do not know the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A Golden Retriever mix from the United States; Hunter is the leader of the Road Rovers. His naivete and literal thinking aside, he is a confident and serious leader who finds time to add humor to a situation. His primary superpower is super speed, though he also lists such abilities as super generosity, super forgiveness, and super super luck. In addition, at the end of \"Reigning Cats and Dogs,\" Hunter (in canine form) displays the ability to spit a tennis ball with the force of one of their blasters. His two main catch phrases are, \u201cI would not have predicted this,\u201d and, \u201cYet another unexpected twist,\u201d which he uses during plot clich\u00e9s. He seems to understand both Shag and Muzzle.' (Shag and Muzzle do not talk normally so if they show up on Hunters story, make sure any other Rovers around do not understand them..or just give them gibberish to make third-wall jokes via Hunter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what do you want to do from Hunters point of view? I do not mean 'I' ' and we', just That the story follows Hunter from this point on.</span></div></div>",

But how do I do make sure weird boy does not do anything bad without other comrades finding out.\" He then looked at his reflection in the bathroom mirror and snapped two fingers together when he told himself, \"Wait that is it.

He knew that he wouldn't have enough time to truly enjoy himself since he figured Exile was most likely trying to figure out some way to get to him. But maybe if he was lucky he could at least his new and improved self while standing in front of building or something. Once the giant Doberman had taken only a few steps though his left twitched when he heard a young man's voice as it shouted, 'Someone, please help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, sounds like somebody is in trouble.\" The black and light brown furred dog said under his breathe as he took a few more steps forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this the giant anthro saw a young man who looked to be in his early 20's being pinned up against a nearby brick wall by a rather large (well human wise) mugger. He then made sure to quiet his steps as best his could when he saw the older looking man put a knife to the young man's throat and told him, \"Just give it up kid. No one's going to save you. You might as well just give me your money. This way you'll walk out of this alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said earlier sir. I don't have any money.\" the brown haired young man pleaded, while Blizt saw him look away from the other human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman heard the man let out a bitter chuckle as he said, \"Well, then I guess I'll just have to kill you and be done with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\" The giant anthro stated, followed by letting out a low and soft growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah and who.....what the heck!\" The man shouted, before he dropped the knife in fear upon seeing the giant dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown eyed giant smirked when he saw the mugger look up at him in pure and utter fear. And once he had seen him run far away he bent down and looked at the young man while asked in concern, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe brown haired young man nodded slowly obviously still in utter shock from seeing a giant anthro dog walking around. At first Blitz though that maybe he should just leave the young man and be on his way. And yet for some reason the Doberman found himself wanting to make sure that human knew that he meant him no harm. And so he placed his hand down towards the young man and waited for him to get on it. To the giant dog's relief the young man slowly began to make his way towards his hand before climbing onto it. And as he slowly began to raise his hand upward his asked in a hushed tone, \"So what's your name little human/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm name's Alex. Who, or what are you?\" The small human asked once he was close to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the Doberman to smirk yet again when he told him, \"My name is Blitz and I'm one of the Road Rovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Road Rovers? Do you mean you were one of those humanoid dogs that drove around the city every now and then?\" Alex asked, when amazement clear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep that was us. And to be honest I wasn't always this big. But's a different topic all together.\" The giant anthro stated, before he saw the human stare at him before quickly looking away. This prompted the dog to turn his head a little to the right when he added in a question, \"Um is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nto his surprise he saw a light blush show up on the human's face while he admitted, \"I'm sorry for staring. It's jus that.....you have an amazing body is all. Although I'm sure the other Rovers have pretty good body's too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well most of us do.\" Blitz commented with a grin on his face. He proceeded to bounce his pecs a little before he flexed his right arm and kissed the large bicep. He then smiled warmly down at the small human who had staring him the entire the time. After he done this though the giant Doberman thought that what he was doing was a bit odd since he had never been one to try and impressive another male. And yet since he hadn't had any luck was a female yet why not try something with the same gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Blitz, is everything ok?\" The brown eyed human asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yes everything if fine. He responded back with as he began to walk down the road. While he did this he went on with, \"So um you wouldn't happen to know any place that you and I could talk without me having to talk quietly would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yes I do. If you keep going down this road there should be a beach that is a good distance away from the city. And at this time of night no one should be there. I would know since I go there from time to time.\" The young man stated, as Blitz kept on walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the Doberman's new height and size it did not take long for him to get to the beach.

Not only did he exceed Blitz in height, but the naturally broader frame of Huskies also made him quite a bit bigger, which only served to further exemplify his extraordinary physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky suddenly stumbled to a stop as he caught sight of Blitz, his eyes widening in an expression of surprise, relief and what appeared to be anxiety.  He quickly rushed up, the heavy pounding of his footsteps reverberating throughout the clear sea air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blitz! There you are!\" He furiously barked out, the bass and volume of his voice causing Alex to instinctively flinch. The Husky snarled something in a language he didn't understand, but the harsh tone and enraged expression left no doubt that the phrase was most certainly not a compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking, you idiot?! As if people weren't going to panic at a giant dog-man walking around! How tall are you anyway? It must be 30 feet!\" He growled, diverting to look himself over for a moment. \"Must make me about 40 feet.\" He mused, before shaking his head and continuing, the volume of his voice rising back to its previous volume of an enraged bellow. \"How did, how could you think this was a good idea? And we've still got that huge hole in your roof at Headquarters, how are we going to fix that without giving this all away?!\" He roared, his face contorted into a snarl or furious rage, to the point where even Blitz looked as if he was struggling to hold his composure, although Alex had to admit, it was nothing short of truly heroic that Blitz had stood with his back ramrod straight throughout the whole of the massive Husky's outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous Husky closed his eyes and inhaled, his cavernous chest expanding impressively, to the point where Alex could have sworn he heard the thick armour he was wearing let out a low groan of protest. The Husky exhaled and opened his eyes to continue his furious tirade. Then he caught sight of Alex and his eyes widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi there.\" He managed to spit out, grinning up at the huge Husky bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blitz.\" He started slowly, cautiously. \"You, you've...\" He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja. This is Alex. I scared off some fool who was trying to mug him, just by standing there!\" Blitz boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Blitz, you, what if he talks?\" He cried, to which Blitz raised his other paw reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, even if he did, there's no evidence, right? No one would believe him, and he'd have to make sure he left out the mugging, so that'd be another problem for him. Trust me, it'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky put a huge paw to his snout, furrowing his brow for a moment before he let out a sigh. \"Alright. Fine.\" He conceded. He removed the paw from his snout and looked down at Alex. \"Hello there comrade. My name is Exile, you may know of me? I'm a Road Rover, like Blitz. Um, sorry about that, I sort of misplaced my temper.\" He grinned nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you lost your temper.\" Blitz corrected, to a quizzical look from Exile. He shook his head and motioned for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, it's alright. I remember you, you guys were a lot more active in my younger years. Uh, how did you get so big though?\" Alex interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, um...\" Exile started, his ears flattening against his skull. \"Well, um, you know how I have vision powers to go along with my strength, da? Well, this morning, I woke up and I find I have new vision powers!\" He beamed. \"I can make things and people bigger or smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" Alex breathed. \"That's incredible. I'd ask how, but considering you're walking, talking superpowered canines...\" He trailed off, taking in both of their forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them chuckled lightly, dispelling the tension that had been present. \"Da. It is true. But, I'm afraid I can't keep to chat. Blitz, please, we have to go back to Headquarters! If the others see we're missing, if they haven't already, they'll ask questions, and there's the hole in the roof...\" Exile pleaded with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz let out a sigh. \"Look, Exile. If I go back, I'll have to shrink. I don't want to shrink! I feel incredible! I feel like I could bicep curl a mountain range!\" He grinned, flexing a bicep in response, the huge, solid muscle swelling outwards, straining the softer, more flexible fabric of his armour, which audibly groaned in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile averted his gaze for a moment as he admitted. \"Da. I usually feel big and powerful, comes with being a Husky, living in Siberia, and just really being big and powerful, even before super strength comes to play.\" He paused. \"I usually feel hot, sweaty and large, but now I feel hot, sweaty, giant, and well, unstoppable!\" He smiled softly, which faded as quickly as it appeared. \"But, I can't stay like this. We can't stay like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can't we stay like this just a bit longer?\" Blitz asked. \"I never even got to get to know Alex here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, I could come back here tomorrow, if you'd like? I can meet you here Blitz? I'd hate to be a bother.\" Alex interjected, eliciting a thoughtful expression from the towering Doberman as he pondered his options.</span></div></div>",

And knowing how the anthro husky could be when waiting for an answer Blitz let out a sigh as he looked back down at Alex and said, \"Yeah, I think that'd be best, Alex. We'll just meet here again tomorrow.\" Although upon thinking about being a giant during the day caused the anthro dog to become nervous as he quickly added, \"But let's meet here at the beach at night. Just so we don't have to worry about people seeing me at this size and freaking out over it.\" However, this expression didn't last long though as he went on with, \"Although being even bigger might be really nice....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comrade.....\" Exile warned, with eyebrows narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I get it. We have to go.\" Blitz exclaimed, before he used one of his huge fingers to gently stroke the human. He then bent down and placed the young man onto the sandy ground and then stood up onto his full height. He then grinned down at the human and bounced his pecs again and continued, \"So I'll see you tomorrow, Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right, I'll see you tomorrow night, Blitz.\" Alex replied, to which the two giant anthro canines walked back towards the HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he walked away Blitz looked over his right shoulder and saw the human stare at him to which he found himself winking at him and then swaying his hips thus making his two large and firm buttcheeks move from side to side. But after doing this the giant Doberman found himself blushing since he honestly wasn't for certain why he was acting like this. But there was just something about the young man that the Road Rover really liked. Although due to their increased size the gaint dog did not get much time to think these new feelings over as both and Exile made it back to their Headquarters in no time. And upon doing so the two made sure they were both on land before the anthro husky used his shrinking eye beam to shrink both of them down to size. But not before they made sure to fix the holes that had been put in Blitz's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those two things had been done both of the Road Rovers had a day that went by like normal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exile ran a paw over his muzzle as he thought back to the whole mess Blitz had gotten them into. He looked over at the Doberman from across the table, who was currently downing a Peppermint Milkshake, although the expression in his eyes belied his casual, relaxed posture. It had been an incredibly stressful time while the pair frantically raced to repair the holes in the roof of his quarters. They'd been extremely lucky they not only had Blitz been standing away from pipes and wiring, but that they could salvage a good deal of the roofing from the roof it had been pushed up into and the floor it had fallen to, or else their entire plan would have collapsed right then and there. As if that hadn't been difficult enough to handle, they'd had to scramble to figure out a way to make the ceiling look as if it hadn't just been smashed through by a Doberman, who, not even including a humanoid posture, sentience, and superpowers, had grown to a size that shouldn't have been possible. It had been more of a dash-slap job, or however it went, rather than a professional job, but a bit more work should sort it. He hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and looked down at his coffee. He couldn't find the stomach to drink it, not after how his heart raced when the Master had stopped by to ask about some odd environmental readings that he'd finally decided he should check out after explaining something about programs and variables. He still wasn't convinced that the Master really believed them when they insisted that it had to be a fluke, but after checking in and seeing no outside light streaming in and that the room temperature was not, in fact, the same as the outside, even if it was a little cool, he had finally seemed mollified, leaving with an apology and a perplexed expression at his tablet. He grimaced at the thought, hoping that was the end of his suspicions. However, there was still the issue of Blitz planning to go and meet that Alex again. He looked back up at the Doberman. \"Blitz.\" He finally said, after a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz paused, setting his drink down on the counter and swallowing his mouthful of beverage. \"Ja?\" He replied, ears perked. \"Listen, I need to ask you something.\" He said, but Blitz frowned, raising a paw and speaking before he could continue. \"Look, Exile, I'm going to stop you right there. I'm willing to have a nice, polite chat with each other about anything, except for enjoying that growth so much. Ja, I loved it. I adored it. But, if you're about to ask me about it and harass me over it, I'll go enjoy my drink elsewhere, ja? I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but I just want you to keep that in mind.\" He explained. Exile clasped his hands together, bracing his elbows on the counter and leaning forward. Interesting. He hadn't been going to mention that, but Blitz certainly seemed a bit insecure, or maybe anxious was the right term, about it. \"Nyet, nyet, it is not that, well, it's kind of that, but not about the growing and getting big part in particular.\" He reassured him, to which the Doberman instantly seemed to relax, his shoulders dropped and he exhaled through his nose. \"Alright then, that's good to hear. What was it you wanted to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky paused, trying to think of the best way to phrase the question while still getting to the point. \"Well, it's about that human. Alex.\" He explained, to which Blitz cocked his head in confusion. \"What about him?\" He asked warily, to which Exile frowned, considering his response. \"Well, you seemed very eager to talk to him again. What is up with that? I thought you were interested in Colleen?\" He asked, briefly considering taking a jab at her rejections. While they were typically a bit aggressive, and maybe a bit too violent at times, they were sometimes also highly amusing to listen to and watch. However, if he did so, and Blitz took offense, which was all but guaranteed, then he might just shut down or walk away, and he'd lose his only chance to find out what he wanted to know. Blitz was quiet for a split second longer than usual before he replied, although he felt that it was a bit too quick at the beginning as if he'd scrambled for an answer. \"Uh, well, he's an interesting fellow, I don't know him too well, but I want to. I mean, I saved his life, and he was really grateful, and I enjoyed his company.\" He replied, nodding at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile was silent as he mulled over Blitz's response. He nodded while looking directly at him to signify he had heard and understood his response and wasn't simply ignoring him. It almost seemed as though Blitz really was interested in getting to know Alex better. He was no interrogator but the look in his eyes that he had attempted to hide and his tone of voice told him everything he needed to know. Blitz seemed genuinely interested in Alex. Exile refused the urge to put his head in his hands or growl. It wasn't that he was opposed to the idea of Blitz making friends, Blitz could absolutely do with someone to help bring out his more positive attributes. It was more the fact that Blitz was trying to make friends with a human. Again, that would be fine, except for the not inconsequential fact that he was a Road Rover, and their headquarters was supposed to be more or less secret to prevent retaliation. He tried to think of how exactly he was going to tell Blitz that he wasn't sure this was a great idea without sounding like he was being rude or insensitive. That would probably just get him an angry glare and a biting remark before he stalked off in a foul mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comrade...\" He started hesitantly. \"I do not wish to intrude or be a problem, but, well, er, don't take this the wrong way, but are you sure about this?\" He asked, quickly continuing at Blitz's surprised expression. \"I mean, it is you meeting a human, which is fine, except we don't really know anything about him. Are you sure this is a good idea? So many things could go so badly wrong, especially when we take my, um, well, growing and shrinking powers into the photo?\" He asked. Blitz furrowed his brow as he rolled his eyes. \"Ja, Exile. I know we don't know anything about him really, that's literally the whole point of me going out to meet him. Furthermore, I'm sure I can trust him, I mean, I saved his life. He was about to get stabbed by a mugger when he didn't have any money on him. What if he got stabbed in the lung? In the heart? What if it cut an artery or something? He would have bled to death long before an ambulance could ever arrive. I'm pretty sure he's fine.\" He explained curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile promptly raised his hands in a placating gesture. \"Whoa, easy there Blitz, I didn't mean it like that. Look, I just want to make sure that you're not going to end up making a mistake.\" He explained, before quickly realising that might rile his temper. \"Um, and I also don't want to wind up causing bigger problems with my new tricks.\" He said quickly. Blitz frowned, looking into his milkshake for a few moments. \"Look, I get that.\" He finally admitted. \"But, well, uh, look, I'm sure I'll be fine. And, you know, you're the only one who can actually make people grow or shrink, so it's sure to be just fine. I mean, don't get me wrong, being so big is amazing! I get to show off how big and strong and handsome I am!\" He boasted, his back straightening as he smirked proudly, flexing a bicep confidently, drawing a slight grin from Exile in response as a bit of Blitz's self-assurance came back. \"But, you're the only one who can make me bigger, so if you're really, really, really sure that that's not a good idea at some point, you don't have to. Remember, no one knows about this except us.\" He reminded him, before grimacing slightly. \"Although, I guess you'll have to say something sooner or later.\" He pointed out. Exile grimaced this time, knowing he was right. He'd never be able to hide this forever, surely. They'd only gotten away with it by sheer luck. \"Master would want to know how it works. I'm not supposed to have this power, or I wasn't supposed to at least.\" He admitted sombrely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, the conversation had been turned around on him. Now, what was he going to do? He wasn't in the mood to get into an awkward conversation on something as serious and important as that. Thankfully, however, he was spared from that as Blitz decided it was time to take his leave. \"Well, I should leave you to it, that's some pretty serious stuff to think about, I'll let you think in peace.\" He said, surprisingly softly and civilly. With that, he gulped down his milkshake, and Exile watched as Blitz strolled over to the fridge and promptly made himself another milkshake, before leaving in the direction of his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile went to lean back, before remembering that he was sitting on a stool, not a chair. Grinning sheepishly at the near-miss, he pushed himself up and decided to go sit down in one of the chairs. It was quiet in here, and right now, that was exactly what he needed. He grabbed the back of a chair and began to pull it out when he nearly leapt out of his armour when a near deafening squawk hit his ears. He yelled in surprise as he whipped around, looking for the source of the noise, bringing his hands up when he realised that he was holding the back of the chair in his hand. He blinked down at it, turning to see that he had accidentally torn the chair in two. He chuckled in embarrassment as he realised that his superhuman strength had simply torn the metal apart without even trying. He looked up to see what the source of the noise was and noted the police scanner lying on the end of the table. Someone must have left it on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He stepped forward, reaching for the switch when a voice spoke from the scanner. \"83-32, we have reports of a 10-33 approximately two blocks from your location. That's a 10-33. We have reports that there is at least one occupant still in the house. Fire and EMS are en-route, head to the scene for traffic control. All other units in the area, standby for a more precise address and prepare to assist if requested. Over.\" Exile grimaced, taking a moment to hope that whoever was in that house would be okay, before the scanner came back to life, the dispatcher providing the address. He grimaced again. It was close by. Very close by actually. It would take maybe 10 minutes to get there by car if he hurried. But, the Fire Department had it under control, surely? They may be superheroes, but there were still emergency services, they could take care of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the address came over the scanner. Exile growled, a deep, rumbling growl of frustration. Of course it was so close by. The emergency services could surely take care of it easily. It was a house fire. It wasn't Cano-mutants tearing tanks apart and shrugging off machine gun fire. It probably wasn't a major criminal plot. It was a simple house fire. But he was so close, and it would be wrong to just go to bed and go to sleep while someone choked in their own home, waiting for help as the flames crept closer and the smoke grew thicker, blacker, deadlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered softly as he shivered. He could start fires easily himself, his heat vision could literally melt metal. He knew far better than many of the sheer destructive potential of fire, and how dangerous it could be. He shook his head. He should go. He was only going to hate himself if he didn't, and he wasn't going to get anything done standing around like an idiot. But first, he had to be prepared. He quickly ran through a list of what to take. He'd need a mirror to let him grow himself, he had no idea if it would work if he just focused his power on his arm or something - or why it reflected in the first place now that he thought about it, although that was a question for later- but he couldn't chance it. He'd naturally need SCBA gear, his super strength and vision powers didn't make him immune to smoke and toxic fumes. Ah, and he'd need to figure out how he was going to get there. He could run at breath-taking speeds to most people, but he was nowhere near as fast as Hunter, so a vehicle it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed to his room, pulling open the vanity drawer, pushing things out of the way until he could grab hold of a handheld mirror. It was a very ornate piece, clean glass surrounded by gleaming golden metal which was adorned with exquisite, detailed patterns - snaking spirals and rolling waves. It was gorgeous. So much so that he almost didn't want to take it, but the thought of someone dying because he wasted time on something so petty immediately shot that idea down. Slamming the drawer shut again, he took off for the vehicle bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping through the door, he made a beeline for the lockers, almost yanking the door open before thinking better of it. He didn't want to waste time by tearing the door off and fumbling in an attempt to put it back. Grabbing the SCBA gear, he hoisted it over his shoulder, turning towards the vehicle bays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw made him freeze. Blitz was standing next to the Street Rover, a thoughtful look across his muzzle. \"Blitz?\" He asked, furrowing his brow. The Doberman let out a gasp as he whipped around. \"Ah, Exile! I was thinking of going out, although now that you're here, if it's not too much trouble, could I bother you... Hey, what's with the oxygen tank?\" He asked, trailing off mid-sentence as Exile stepped closer, allowing him to get a better look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my way to a fire, someone needs help.\" He explained, to which Blitz's eyes widened slightly. \"Oh. I see. But, can't the Fire Department take care of it themselves? Unless there's canomutants there, they shouldn't need our help, and are you sure about going alone?\" He asked. Exile blinked. Blitz was seeming rather... not quite caring, but certainly less self-centered than usual. He shook his head and cleared his thoughts. There wasn't time for that now. \"Da, but I am going anyway. I want to help, besides I will be fine on my own.\" He reassured him. \"Before I go, what was it that you wanted anyway?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz looked away for a moment. \"Ah, well, you see, I was going to ask if you could, you know, make me a bit bigger again, but I guess you're in a rush so...\" He trailed off as Exile frowned a bit. Of course. It made sense, of course Blitz would want to be bigger. He felt a flicker of annoyance, although his more rational side conceded that he enjoyed being huge too. He was already a real powerhouse, he was reminded of his size and powerful build every time he slipped into his armour. Being so much bigger amplified all those feelings, and he could only imagine how much greater the amplification was for Blitz. At least he wasn't trying to block him from leaving. \"Well, alright, I can make you a bit bigger, but I'm only doing it for a few seconds.\" He answered, his tone leaving no room for argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz raised his hands in reassurance. \"Well, I mean, I'd love that ja, but if you're really in a rush...\" He started but trailed off as Exile narrowed his eyes in a way that almost made him look intimidating - although the Husky's natural bulk was part of the reason too - before a thick purple beam came from his eyes and hit the Doberman square in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz let out a gasp as his entire frame began to surge upwards and outwards, rising higher by the second.</span></div></div>",

However, after doing so the anthro husky couldn't help but let out a groan of annoyance upon seeing now a forty foot tall Blitz standing in the vehicle bay. Or at least that's what Exile thought would be the case. But thankfully unlike in his bedroom the anthro doberman seemed to be prepared for the growth as he was knelling down on the ground. But while he did this the still normal sized Rover saw his now giant companion grin down at him while he flexed various muscles that were underneath his green shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once Exile had made his way to the Street Rover and had gotten into it he saw Blitz carefully get out of the vehicle bay and then stand outside of it when he told him, \"Hey, thanks for doing this for me, Exile. I didn't think you'd grow me this much. I'm glad that you did since now I can show off for Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da, da, just promise me you'll be careful, and you won't be a weird boy.\" Exile replied, as he turned on the Street Rover and then drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Exile drove off Blitz just scoffed and crossed his arms over his massive chest when he remarked back out loud to himself, \"Tch, of course I'll be careful. I just hope everything goes okay for you, snowball.\" The giant doberman then shook his head as this wasn't the time to be worried about his comrade since he knew the anthro husky could handle himself in any situation. Besides he had other things to do. And so with these thoughts in mind the black and tan furred anthro canine removed his green shirt and brown pants to reveal a red speedo underneath the pants. To which he then flexed various muscles again and added in a comment to himself, Ja, I knew wearing this under my clothes was a smart idea. Plus I bet Alex will like this, maybe? But I won't know that until I go and see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this Blitz picked up his clothes and then got into the water and headed towards the beach where he and the human had ran into Exile last night.

And once the beam touched the fire that was on the outside of the home the flames instantly vanished with only smoke remaining. But Exile made usre that all of the flames where taken out on the outside of the home before he put his hand on the door handle and began to quickly turn it while he thought to himself, \"<i>Alright, now these flames are gone it is time to deal with any flames are in the inside of this person's home. I just hope I am not being too late in saving whoever lives here.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam continued to cough as the smoke completely covered his line of sight from end of his bedroom to the other. And to be honest the young man wasn't even for certain where this fire had started from. But to fair that didn't matter right now as all that mattered was getting get out of the house alive. So the human carefully made his way to his bedroom door and opened it only to see more smoke. However, to his surprise Will could swear he heard some heavy footsteps coming the first floor of his home. Which meant that someone must have shown up to get rid of the fire. But sadly due to the amount of smoke the young man had been dealing with he found his senses starting to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right before he blacked out completely he yelled out, \"Hey! I'm up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExile's right ear twitch when he heard the voice of a young amn call out for help and then the sound of someone falling down up on the second floor. This prompted the anthro husky to work even faster and harder as he made sure to get rid of the rest of the flames that were coming form the home. The worst of which was in the kitchen as the oven was completely in flames. And upon a closer look Exile saw that it seemed like there was a leak in the gas line for the oven. But along with that, there were a few outlets where sparking too here and there. But Exile made sure to handle each and every issue before he ran upstairs and let out a gasp upon seeing a young man laying head down in an open doorway in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon reaching the young man Exile carefully turned him over and made sure that the human still had a pulse. Which to the Rover's relief the young man was still alive. However, due to all of this smoke the anthro husky wasn't sure what to do. On the one hand Exile could easily carry the human out of his home without any issues. But on the other he grow himself to make it easier to keep the young man away from breathing in any more smoke and to also protect him from any other flames that might still be lurking in the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Exile knew he had to act quickly to which he decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exile grimaced at the thick black smoke that billowed in through the door. Reaching forward, he slammed it shut with a paw, hoping it would give him a few moments more to devise a strategy. Obviously, he needed to get out as quickly as possible. Just because he had managed to put the fire out, it didn't magically clear the smoke away, and given how that was what usually killed people in fires, getting him into fresh air was the top priority. Glancing down at the man, Exile yanked his SCBA mask off. He was immediately stuck by the intensity of the smoke. As if he didn't have enough to deal with, he already felt like he was nearly roasting with the sheer heat. At the best of times, he was still usually hot, his thick fur and his sheer bulk saw to that. He shook his head and growled before slipping the mask back on and drawing in a few breaths of air, preparing himself before he pulled the mask off again and placed it over the mans head, forcing oxygen into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept the mask over the man's face for a few more seconds until he couldn't hold his breath any more. With his lungs burning with the need to get all of the carbon dioxide out of his system, he yanked the mask off and put it back over his face. As he secured the mask again, he hoped that would at least keep him from dying before he could even get him outside. He crouched down and grabbed the man under his arms and began to pull. It was easy given his strength, the man weighed almost nothing to him. As he dragged him across the floor and out the door, he let out a gasp as he felt the floor beneath him buckle alarmingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the man and leapt back into the room, grabbing him by the ankles and dragging him back with him. No more than a few scant seconds after that, the hallway floor caved in. Exile flinched as a rush of heat suddenly struck him. He immediately curled around the man to protect him from the backdraft he feared was coming, but thankfully, there was no fireball. Tentatively looking back, he could see the floor had been more or less burned through from below, judging by the scorch marks on the walls, and it looked like there was traces of some sort of gas explosion. He could see that there was no chance of getting the man across the gap. The entire floor was gone. He had to get him out somehow. He scowled in a mixture of anger and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless he had a stride of about 12 feet he was never going to make it across that gap. Exile froze, a thrill running through him as he was struck by the realisation that he actually could have a stride of 12 feet, and even more! He reached for his pocket and yanked the mirror out. Unsure if the mask would interfere with his vision, he pulled it off, grimacing as he did so and blasted his vision into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis powerful frame began to bulge outwards, swelling larger by the second. As his ears crept closer to the ceiling he could feel the floor beneath his feet struggle under his weight. A soft creaking sounded out which rose into a series of sharp, harsh cracks. He quickly stepped over to the door and realised that his ears could brush the underside of the top of the doorframe. Then, a couple of seconds later, his ears were pressing into it, and then they were flattened against his head. He ducked through and, as gently as he could, lowered himself to the floor below. As he dropped down, he stumbled. His foot had punched straight through the floor. He gawked at the sight, startled by his tremendous weight. He pulled his foot out and staggered back, letting out a gasp as he hit the wall behind him and dented it, although that was putting it lightly. The wall had nearly collapsed under him, with huge cracks spreading through the plaster. He pulled forward and turned to face the dent, to find his ears brushing the little bit of the walkway above. He stooped down to look up and realised with a start that he was already 10 feet tall, rapidly going on 11. He frowned at the smoke above. He'd been lucky so far, but he didn't want to risk it. He looked down at his mask and used his vision on it as well, growing it up to where he could take a few more deep breaths. After a few long, precious seconds of this, he pulled it off and glanced back at the ornate mirror in his hand. Another use of his vision, and he was growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he glanced up from the mirror slightly, he was startled to see what little remained of the floor above drop down to be level with his nose. As he watched, he could see the floor sink lower and lower with every passing second, going from being level with his nose to being level with his chin. A moment later it was level with his neck, and a moment after that it was level with his muscular chest. He shook himself from his daze. Now was neither the time nor the place to get lost in his growth, as incredible as it was. He glanced down, past his thick, powerful legs, to see the floor, 14 feet below. He could feel the floorboards beneath his huge paws groan and warp, straining under his weight. He felt a pang of anxiety as he wondered if the house had a basement. He couldn't even begin to estimate his weight, but he was easily more than twice as tall as he usually was, so if he was correct, he had to weigh at least a ton now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought up a hand and ran it over his muzzle, before he found himself in a coughing fit. He crouched down, ignoring the distressing groans of the floor beneath his immense bulk and reached up to wave the smoke away as best he could. He stood back up, raising a hand up and staring in awe as his hand touched the ceiling. He barely had to reach up. He was massive now, a literal giant. Yet he was still getting bigger. He shook his head in muted awe, looking towards the door to where the victim was lying. He brought up a bulky arm to reach for him, only to pause as he tried to stick his hand through and realised that his arm was, quite literally, too big to fit through. The thick, muscular limb simply couldn't properly fit through the doorway. He'd grown to get him out of the house, and now he couldn't get him out of the room. He withdrew his arm, barking out a curse. His thoughts raced as he tried to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl of almost pure frustration, he reached forwards and jammed his fingers into the doorframe. He was just about to violently pull his hands apart before he realised that he was putting his strength into focus. If he tried to violently pull the wall apart with his full strength behind it, he'd probably utterly atomise the entire building, if not the whole street effortlessly. With a much more gently hold, he prised the doorframe apart with his hands. Huge, intimidating cracks shot out from the doorframe and spread through the plaster as the wooden frame splintered and fractured instantly, laughably pathetic in the face of such sheer power. The ceiling jolted as the wall crumbled under his grip, leaving a large hole. Large enough to get at least one hand through to the man easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving a hand through, he gently grabbed a hold of the man, curling his hand around him gently. He was grateful that he was suffering from smoke inhalation and not something like a broken bone. It meant that he could afford to be ever so slightly less careful in moving him and put more focus into simply getting out. As he withdrew his hand, he pulled the smaller man through and leant in, his massive muzzle gently brushing over him. He was still alive as far as he could tell, thankfully. He glanced down, considering shrinking and pulling him out, but then realised that that would involve keeping him inside while he readjusted him from simply holding him in his hand to dragging him, and he wasn't sure if he had time for that. Shaking his head again, he smirked lopsidedly for a moment, before the smoke hit him again. He looked into the mirror again and focused. Going up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enormous frame seemed to surge outwards, his body practically piling on mass as he shot up several inches in mere seconds. His stance widened to accommodate his greater size, which sent his boots smashing through the floor, drawing a startled gasp from his muzzle. Thankfully, it seemed the house didn't have a basement, because he knew that if it did, he would be standing in it. Well, he would be sort of standing in it. His legs would be there, while his upper body would be racing towards the top floor. As he was thinking about that, his ears flicked reflexively as they brushed against the ceiling. He flinched and dropped lower to the ground, nearly dropping his SCBA mask. He snatched it up before it could hit the ground, but as he did so, they crash of his oxygen tank scraping against the wall behind him rang out. He grimaced as he stood back up, looking over his shoulder to see the gash in the plaster. Glancing back at the dent he had left, he could clearly see where his tank had been shoved into the wall, given it was deeper than his body's imprint, which while not as deep, although still impressively, or perhaps intimidatingly deep, was much broader. As he stood and reached his full height, his head gently pressed into the ceiling. He made to reach up with one hand before realising that he had his hands full. Shaking his head he decided the best bet was to just stand there and literally outgrow the house while ensuring the resident's safety. He placed the man up against the armour of his mighty chest as the ceiling began to quietly groan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exile gritted his teeth as his ears flattened against his head. His growing frame was placing more and more stress on the ceiling by the minute, the quiet groaning slowly rising into distressed creaks. As he kept growing, dust began to rain down on top of his broad shoulders as minute cracks began to spread through the plaster. The creaking and groaning was suddenly inter-spaced with a harsh, sharp crack of breaking timbers as the ceiling slowly began to rise around his head. One of his ears twitched, which sent it carving straight through the plaster as if it were a knife through hot butter, sending a drizzle of plaster dust down onto his head. He ducked lower, gently ruffling his fur to dislodge the dust before bringing his head up again, smacking into the ceiling. However, there was no pain this time, as if his substantially greater size also conferred greater physical resilience. The ceiling however, fared significantly more poorly than the Husky, cracking open in the face of so much Husky, exposing the attic above. Exile tilted his big muzzle up, grinning slightly at how trivially easy it was to utterly destroy the plaster and how easily the beam his nose had smacked into had snapped without even using just a part of his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked rapidly, trying to clear his eyes from the sting of the smoke, he looked around to see if there was anything of note. There was nothing much of interest, a stored Christmas tree here, an old armchair there, nothing to particular catch anyone's interest. Assuming, of course, they overlooked the enormous Husky's head bursting through the ceiling below that was now occupying about a third of the attic and was still getting bigger. Glancing down, Exile caught a glimpse of the man through the smoke, drawing a sigh of relief. He was still protected from the heat by his hand, but the smoke was still a major issue. With his mask and mirror held in his other hand, he looked back up to the ceiling as his ears began to brush up against it. It wouldn't be long now before he was literally too big for the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little smile crossed his face, a sense of finality blossoming in his cavernous chest as his ears were pinned flat against the roof, plaster being gouged out with no effort on his part whatsoever. The ceiling let out a distressed groan before his ears smashed through, tearing the ceiling apart further with their twitching. His head bumped into the ceiling, utterly pulverising it. A booming crash caught his attention. Quickly looking down, he found his broad, muscular shoulders had smashed through the ceiling below, the silver gleam of his almost futuristic armour easily distinguishable from the dull beige of the flooring. He brought up a massive hand and waved the smoke away as best he could again, granting another glimpse of the man. Squinting, he leaned in as close as he could, given that his muzzle alone was taking up almost half of the attic. He was still breathing. Thank Mother Russia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tilted his head back up, it smacked solidly into the roof above. He jumped at the impact, grimacing slightly as the cacophony of tiles being knocked loose and shattering against the ground outside rang out, easily audible over the groaning timbers and creaking pipes now that the roar of the flames was no more. He shook his head, forcing his thoughts back on track. This was probably - hopefully - the best way of getting the man outside and into fresh air safely. Well, as safely as could be given that he was literally growing through an entire house. Besides, it was far too late to back out now. His ears crashed through the roof, poking out into the cool air outside. With a renewed thrill, he curled the hand with the man in it to his chest and reached up with the other. The bulky, muscular limb smashed through the ceiling as he braced it against the roof, before pushing. The roof utterly disintegrated under the force, letting in a blast of clean, fresh air. For a moment, Exile was terrified that he had just set it up for a backdraft or flashover or something like that, but thankfully, there was no rush of flame or heat or anything. He let out a deep, heaving sigh of relief. He looked down at the mirror and let out another blast of vision, deciding it was time to get out of here, and he'd much rather step out of the house than burst through a wall. That was far too risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the purple beam reflected from the mirror into his chest, Exile let out a gasp as he nearly dropped the mirror and his mask and tank. Stumbling slightly, his massive, muscular frame tearing the building apart where he crashed into it, he reached out and quickly dug his free hand into the building to steady himself. The house crumbled around his touch, the drywall reduced to dust in his expanding fingers as the building shook violently from the sheer force of the impact of his footsteps. He had to be at least 30 feet now, possibly even 40. How much did he weigh now? He must have been a ton at 14 feet, over twice his original weight, and doubling in height causes weight to increase by eight times, so he couldn't even imagine how much he weighed now. It must have been several tons by now, at the very least. Looking down and taking in the destruction he had caused so easily without even trying to, he let out a muttered curse of awe. Looking back up, he started as he realised his muzzle was now outside. He was taller than a two story house at this point, and he was still getting bigger. As his shoulders raced past the roof, he brought his hand up and held the man to his chest. He was so tiny now, he was barely three times the size of one of his fingers. Glancing down again, his jaw dropped as he realised that his huge chest was now level with the hole in the room, his huge, firm pectorals rapidly rising past the roof, which sank further and further down past his abdominals. He took a quick look back at the man. He was barely twice the size of a finger now. He was growing faster. He had to be at least 50 feet tall now, if his measurement was right, and he was rapidly approaching sixty. A solid one hundred feet should be enough for him to simply step out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over the wreckage of the house, he could spot the street, the distinctive flash of red of the Street Rover easily visible. As he looked, the flash of red continued to shrink as his viewpoint rose higher and higher by the second. A tremendous crashing sound snapped his attention to the house again, fearful of a structural collapse. With all the fire damage, a seventy foot tall dog-man could only be anything but good. Thankfully, it was only his waist rushing up through the hole, his bushy tail smashing through the roof and a section of wall behind him with trivial ease. He was almost at a hundred feet tall, already he was quickly reaching up to eighty feet, and his knees were already pushing past the roof. Now that the thrill of outgrowing the house had faded slightly, he could feel the internal walls caving in under the force his feet were exerting as they bowled over and crushed whatever furniture was in his way. He let out a chuckle at the sensation. It was almost like his feet were being tickled. Snorting with amusement, he shifted, shaking his whole body as he looked around, noting that no one was in sight, and if anyone was around, they were very well hidden. All he could hear was the groaning and cracking of timber and squeal of bending metal. Looking down, he had to estimate he was a solid hundred feet tall now. Ninety had come and gone without him even noticing. Letting out a breath of amazement, he gingerly lifted one of his thick, muscular legs out of the house, tentatively planting it down in the yard. He grimaced at the feeling of the earth giving way beneath his weight. He bit his lip, recalling the groaning of the floorboards beneath his weight. He was glad the house didn't have a basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing the same again, he turned, noting how the house was so tiny now, it was like a doll house. Glancing down at the man, he audibly gasped. He was so small, he wasn't even half the size of one of his fingers now. He looked around, never mind the house, the entire neighbourhood was tiny! He was a literal giant, he was several times the size of a house. It was a thrill like he'd never experienced before, no wonder Blitz loved it so much. He almost wanted to stay like this, but there was time for exploring possibly physics-defying sizes later - never mind their powers in the first place, naturally. He had work to do. He turned his gaze back to the man, and then to the mirror. A blast of green light shot forth from his eyes. First responders would be here any minute no doubt, he could hear sirens in the distance. He only hoped they hadn't seen him. But before they got here, there was still work to do to help this man.</span></div></div>",

Sothe Road Rover, just shook his head as he figured that he must of been seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the gaint anthro dog was borken out of his thoughts even more when he heard Alex's voice as the human asked, \"How Blitz, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?

And in a speedo no less...\" The human commented, as the huge anthro dog saw a light blush form on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the young mans' words Blitz couldn't help, but grin as he asked him, \"Yeah, I bet it was quite the surprise for you.

However, when one of the firefighters had asked the anthro husky where the giant hole came from the Road Rover had to tell them a lie. Although thankfully it wasn't a big one since he explained that when he was getting the young man out of the house the wood and what not seemed to give way due the fire from earlier. In truth in that some kind of right. However, he was the only one that knew that it was he himself who had caused those tow huge holes in the human's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the heavily muscled husky made sure to keep telling himself that he did to save someone's life. And that in truth he didn't want to destroy the young man's home. It was just out of his hands due to how much smoke was inside the house after he had gotten rid of the fire. And yet in the back of his mind Exile knew that he enjoyed being that huge, his muscles just massive. Although these thoughts lead him to think on Blitz as he hoped that he comrade wasn't getting into sort of trouble due to his increased size. However, compared ot him when he was at 100 feet Blitz would of been very small. Plus he knew he mostly wanted to \"impress\" that human named Alex. So he highly doubted the Doberman would do anything that would bring attention to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while he was lost in his own thoughts the huge husky saw from the corner of his eye that the young man was started to stir. See prompted the Road Rover to sit up straight as the human started to slowly turn his head to his direction.

Instead of becoming a complete cano-sapien, he is stuck at someplace in between. Shag cannot speak English clearly and is only vaguely humanoid. He has super-strength and stores equipment (among other things, including weapons, lunch, furniture, and on at least two occasions even fellow Road Rovers) in his copious fur, but is also a complete coward. He has an unfortunate tendency to hold his rocket launcher backwards, leading Hunter to remark at one point, \u201cThis is precisely the reason they don't normally give bazookas to dogs.\u201d In one episode, Hunter reminds Shag to turn the launcher around before he fires it, causing him to hit his target (although the launcher, for some strange reason, fired from both ends).'</span></div></div>",

This is an interactive where they can go on adventures, spar, have sex, vore, shrink, whatever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am keeping it RATHER light; No anal vore or bloody deaths. No deaths of the RR's themselves, or any scat/piss fetishes. M/M and F/F sex is fine, along with M/F. Unbirthing, and humans are okay. It will always take place from the view of a Road Rover so Hunter can get it on with a human female in either cano-sapien form or full animal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep the Road Rovers rather true to character. The rules CAN be bent a little (Like Colleen is always forgetting Blitz's name and that he is around. Blitz can then get revenge on Colleen via sex and such.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add, but make sure that you actually add content! Also, please add your ideas PAST the 'Other' options! Go into 'Other' for the character of your choice, Then put in, for example, 'Hunter shrinks Exile' as an option to leave room for others. The first contributer did not do this properly but I am leaving it since he was nice enough to add at all.</td>",
