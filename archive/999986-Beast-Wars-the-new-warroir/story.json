Come on!\" He said as Blackarachnia nudged you in his direction.<br>\r\nHe pushed you onto a table, surrounded by gadgets and gizmo's alike.

We need to show this to Megatron, he will be most pleased with this new 'Upset'.\" He finished with another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackarachnia started to drag you away, towards a wasteland of sorts. Eventualy she gets tired of dragging you, and in your free time, start to fiddle with your Spider-legs. You notice that your red legs were actualy coivered in very tiny metal 'scales'. Interested you move one leg to your front and focus on the red scales. They all immediately opened, and a blue light glowed along the entire leg. Swinging it around it scratched a tree, slicing a gash in the side. Staring in awe at your weapon, you fiddle even more and find that you had amazing control of the scales,from opening the very tip, to the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to find out more you start looking for new weapons, coming to you clawhand a simple thought and it turnes into a wierd looking gun with Electricity crackling inside.

After a pause she turned to you, angrier than a hornet in a fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-He...Touchy trigger.\" You mumble<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nThe look on her face changed insantly to a smile,<br>\r\n\"Haa!!! Yeah, I recomend you watch that from now on-\" She turned around, an evil aura formed around her, \"-Or you won't be firing it ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou faltered, triping on air.

You don't have much time, if you wait too long to get out of here you will be surounded by Maximals. I wasn't the quietest battle ever you know. Shooting another blast of lightning at him you try for the door Only to find that the bigger of the remaining Maximals was standing in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way, Rino boy!\" You call as you shoot a blast of lightning at his spark chamber, knocking him straight onto Stasis-Lock. You look to find the other two Maximals comming down the hallway, guns drawn. A green double laser shot past your head, as two more smaller laser blast shot in front of you. Forgetting about thwe Maximals you focus mainly on your mission, pulling you options up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can try to fight them all off....HeHe, good luck doing that one......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can flee by using the walls and ceiling in your Beast mode, but that would make you drop the Spark....<br>\r\nYou suddenly were jolted from your thouyghts as all three of them got a shot at you simultaniously, sending the Stasis-Lock warning across your visual-screen. Cripled, you hold onto your damaged area's, thinking quickly, you only saw one way out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn-it!!!!!!\" You yell, transforming into your spider form. You zoom up the wall, avoiding the blast of the Maximals, you slip right out of the base, and start your trek back to the Predacon base. A blast from the Maximal ship, reminded you of the dangers of lingering in their range. Thus, you scurried off faster than you ever thought a spider could move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you could hear the Maximals laughing at you, as you tripped avery 4 or 5 steps. <br>\r\nDude......You were missing a leg after all.....</span></div></div>",

Amazed at the beauty of it, you had never seen anything like it before...you think. Laying your head down, you realise that some white thing had started to rise in the opposite dirrection. It was magnificent, it looked almost silvery in color. Watching it for what seemed like hours on end, your ear twitched as you heard a sound coming from behind you. You crawl towards the tall grass beside you, as you focus on some creature walking towards the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked...wierd, you couldn't even describe it. Some metal like skin and it walked on two legs. You crouch down lower too avoid detection, and continued to watch the creature.

Immediatly pulling out a weapon of some sort.<br>\r\n\"Come out now or beware the consequenses!\" It yelled<br>\r\nIt's voice was male and he looked more friendly than enemy. Seeing as you note the difference from having a weapon to not having one you step out into the open.

You were damaged by the crash, please forgive my idiocy and follow me.\" He asked offering a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then an explosion erupted from the ground and you dodge over to the right.<br>\r\n\"Aww...Lookes like we were too late, Wasspinator thinks that we should kill them now and tell megatron later.\" A flying one said. The other two shot lasers at you and your friend. You dodge left and right, avoiding the shots. While your friend got blasted in the chest and fell to the ground, twitching as sparks ran along his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodge more and more and charge the attackers, clamping down with your jaws on his shoulder and ripped a chunk off. You jump off and go for the flying one. Ripping a wing off, you watch as he flew randomly into trhe horrizon. A blast nailed you in the side and sent you flying. Feeling the pain fly through you body, slowly get back up and noticed that all the enemy's were gone. You walk over to you friend and plop him onto you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...you, the....base is that...way.\"He said through gritted teeth. You start to limp towards the direction, and after a grueling 4 hours you both make it to the base. A gun homed in on you, but quikly dropped as the woman looking figure came running out followed by like 5 more of them.<br>\r\n\"Silverbolt!\" She yelled.<br>\r\nYou collapse to the ground as a warning flashed in front of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........Stasis-Lock..........</span></div></div>",

In little bitty peices, You soon realized that theat thing in the mirror was your reflection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing at it, you wonder at you new visage... A wolf body but with some, 'Modifications'. You looked like a black wolf, but your body looked half machine and half wolf....How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you perplexed your new room, your new look, and the fact that you had no idea were you were, A door behind you opened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Spider walked partialy inside the door, and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to train,...Mut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled at the term she used. You didn't know what it meant, but something inside of you told you that it was rude...</span></div></div>",

You opened your mouth to answer..<br>\r\n\"Yes..\" A low, Barely audible wisper was heard. Apparently you could speek, but it would take a while for you to be able to speak full sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now in order to Transform, you need to say the key words, 'I am Transformed!' But, that is not all. It requires a decent amount of concentration and focus to achieve this transformation.\"<br>\r\nThe Rat said A-Matter-Of-Factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Ratrap, Blackarachnia, And I'm Optimus.. We have another member, he is a Bat, so dont go attacking him.. He is new too.\" Optimus anounced.<br>\r\n\"S-...Swindle...\" You whispered your name.<br>\r\n\"Swindle? Oh, that must be your name!

He was stunned at his reflection. His entire body was now covered by some kind of metal skin. He saw that his new form was a purple dragon with black stripes on. To make things worse Swindle's head was not alone, there was another head on the side of his. The head had its own long neck that was attached to the same body. The head was still unconscious. It looked similar to Swindle's but a female version. <br>\r\nHer green eyes slowly open, she was just as shocked as Swindle. She quickly pulled back causing them to almost fall over. There was a power struggle as both tried to pull apart, it lasted a few minutes but they came to the conclusion that they had equal control over their body. The female head quickly regained composure and said \" This is an interesting predicament, my name is Nighbird.\" . Swindle could sense and evil presence within her. \" I am Swindle. \" , he responded. \" Let's transform and see what happens. \", Nightbird said licking her lips. Swindle agreed. <br>\r\nThey both had to admit that transforming felt a lot different now. In the place of the dragon stood a two headed humanoid. Each of their heads now had its own visible characteristics . To Swindles surprise there body was mostly female, it had a muscular physique. The body had purple skin and black markings, it even had built in heels in the feet. \" Not what you expected...\" , Nightbird said. \" I didn't it would be so feminine, it just feels weird. \" , Swindle said. \" Get used to it, cause we are stuck this way. I am just glad that I am familiar with this physique, but it have a manly feeling to it but I wouldn't mind having an antenna. \" , She said licking her lips. It took them a few minutes but they managed to stretch the wings out on their back and took flight. While flying they saw a group of transformers , but who were they?</span></div></div>",
