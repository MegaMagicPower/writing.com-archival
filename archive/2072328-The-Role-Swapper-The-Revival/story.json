He was going to need a new transmission, but there was no way he could afford that on his meager salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Roy went to put on his work uniform. His shift started in just under an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had always figured that by the time he was twenty-three his life would be better than this. He'd done well in high school, gone on to college... but now somehow things had fallen apart for Roy. He still shared a tiny apartment with a roommate (his best friend Jack). He himself had no girlfriend. And the best job he could find was slaving away as Assistant Manager at the local Burger Bonanza establishment. In essence, he was a glorified burger flipper, working alongside teenage kids and high school drop-outs, earning little more than their minimum wage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate my life,\u201d Roy reiterated, sliding on his Burger Bonanza uniform shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't,\u201d said a strangely familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy spun around and was greeted by his own spitting image \u2013 only better dressed and more confident and happy-looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Roy sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I'm you of course!\u201d said the doppelganger. \u201cOr rather, I'm apparently a considerably more successful version of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndulge me for a moment,\u201d replied his twin. \u201cI'm you \u2013 from an alternate reality. And from the looks of this dump, I'd guess my world is at least four or five-hundred years technologically more advanced than yours. Does this place even have running water and electricity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d scowled Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where I come from, we've got a lot more,\u201d continued Roy's double. \u201cAnd I'm a much more successful version of... well... you! I'm an independently wealthy scientist and inventor. And right now, I'm using one of my latest inventions to explore and chart some of the nearby alternate universes. There's an infinite number of parallel realities out there, you know. Your world is... oh, let's see... QLX-0948-Kappa-Delta-IV, from the Negative Purple-3 Spectrum, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d muttered a thoroughly confused Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, brother,\u201d said Roy's duplicate with a sympathetic smile. \u201cI hate seeing myself like this. Especially since I know what a brilliant genius you're capable of being, if only given the proper chance. I've got to get going \u2013 lots more realities to map, y'know. But before I go, let me leave you with a little gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Other Roy rummaged around in a belt pouch for a moment, finally retrieving a thin, rectangular object that vaguely resembled a high-tech cellphone of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made this,\u201d said the Alternate Roy with a proud smile. \u201cTotally unique item. I think you may find it extremely useful in these barbaric, backwards, dark ages. It's a Role Swapper. It actually alters reality and re-writes history! With this, you can re-create your own personal history and give yourself the sort of life you deserve to have. Just point it at a target and press the button on the left... then point it at a second target and press the button on the right. The Role Swapper will re-write history so that everyone believes the two targets were actually each other! The only person immune to this memory-rewriting-feature will be yourself... or whomever is holding the device. So don't let this little beauty fall into the wrong hands! And once you've swapped yourself into a life story you're happy and content with, it'd be best to destroy the machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d muttered a thoroughly confused Roy, accepting the gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, buddy, I gotta go!\u201d said Future Roy. \u201cBut best of luck with this thing. Hang in there and believe in yourself! Like I said: I know from firsthand experience just a brilliant and visionary genius you have the potential to be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Parallel Reality version of Roy abruptly flickered out of existence leaving the Original Roy standing in his cramped little bedroom, still half-dressed in his work uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I should test out this crazy gizmo,\u201d Roy mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Roy select as his target?</span></div></div>",

She spent basically all of her free time over here at the apartment, completely devoted to Jack. Sarah was smart, pretty in that \u201cGirl-Next-Door\u201d way, and had a much better job, as a junior librarian at the university library. Roy knew that early in the morning, she'd be in the apartment's kitchen busily making coffee and breakfast for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy quickly finished dressing himself in his fast food uniform, then crept out towards the kitchen. Sure enough, there was Sarah, already fully dressed, and busily frying an egg for Jack while he took his morning shower. She had the small, portable TV in the kitchen switched on and was absent-mindedly watching some gossip show about celebrity trivia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dark, shoulder-length hair carefully styled in a bit of a bob. She wore a light blue, long-sleeved blouse with a blue sweater on over it. She had on black, professional looking women's slacks, some dark nylon socks, and a pair of sensible, brown shoes with a slight wedge heel to them. Although she wore glasses, they weren't too terribly thick and just looked \u201ccute\u201d on her. She'd already put on a modest amount of makeup this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stealthily aimed the device at the back of Sarah's head and pushed the left button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy knew he needed a secondary target to complete this supposed Role Swap. So to test out the device, he selected his target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?</span></div></div>",

Somehow it seemed to fit her considerably smaller frame. She no longer wore glasses or make-up, and her hair was much shorter and parted the same way Roy always combed his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurriedly, Roy glanced down at himself. He was now wearing Sarah's blouse, sweater, slacks, nylons, and shoes. In fact, he could even feel the constricting fabric of a bra on under his clothes. Yet his body appeared to still be his own. He could still feel his manhood in his pants, although he could tell he was now wearing some kind of silky panties instead of his boring, regular boxers. His hair felt longer and shaggier as he looked around the room... and he noticed suddenly that he was wearing glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Sarah!\u201d called out the real Sarah, now entering the kitchen. \u201cBreakfast sure smells good. Jack's a lucky guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d mumbled Roy. \u201cMorning... uh... Roy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a panicked Roy noticed Sarah was now holding the little, futuristic techno-device in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay... ah... Roy,\u201d said Roy. \u201cWhat's that, uh, little thing in your hand? May I see it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the real Sarah say?</span></div></div>",

She frowned at the little technological gizmo in her hand for a moment, then passed it over to Roy. \u201cSure, Sarah \u2013 you can see it. In fact, you can have the thing. I don't even remember picking it up. You have any clue what it is or where it came from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm... uh... no, Roy,\u201d replied Roy. \u201cI think... maybe it belongs to Jack. I'll give it to him later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy quickly slipped the thin device into the pocket of his slacks. He was surprised at how much smoother and silkier the pockets of Sarah's slacks felt compared to his old pants pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I'd better get to work before I'm late!\u201d said Sarah's body, still firmly believing she was really Roy. \u201cTell Jack I'll see him later tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He continued shoveling eggs into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm serious,\u201d Roy insisted. \u201cI am not Sarah. I'm Roy \u2013 your friend and roommate... and a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, what the hell are you babbling on about?\u201d said Jack with a tired, frustrated expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy knew his roommate wasn't much of a Morning Person. Maybe this wasn't the best time to tell him this news. Oh well, thought Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's this little gizmo,\u201d Roy said, pulling out the high-tech gadget from Sarah's slacks. \u201cI got this from a visitor from an alternate reality. A real, life, genuine parallel earth! He was an alternate version of me, a brilliant inventor in his own world. Anyhow, this device can switch around people's 'life roles,' whatever that means exactly. I've only experimented with it once \u2013 on me and Sarah. It zapped us into each other's clothes, and she wound up believing she was really me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid Roy put you up to this?\u201d sighed Jack, turning his attention back to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Roy,\u201d insisted Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you still look just like Sarah to me,\u201d mumbled Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen perhaps a demonstration is in order,\u201d said Roy. \u201cOh... but you wouldn't be aware of any changes would you? Just like Sarah, you'd only remember the new reality. But... hmmmmmm... what if... what if we held hands when I use the device?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, all right,\u201d sighed Jack impatiently. \u201cIf it'll keep you satisfied, I'll play along with your little game. But hurry it up, Sarah. I still gotta get dressed and go to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it seemed a little fruity, Roy grasped Jack's hand firmly and looked for a target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about... oh perfect!\u201d said Roy. \u201cHow about us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding Jack's hand, he fired the device once at Jack and once again at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, nothing happ--... OHMIGOD!\u201d screamed Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no longer sitting at the table but was now standing up and wearing all of Sarah's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy, now sitting down and wearing nothing but a towel, smiled a toothy grin back at his roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d he said. \u201cTold you I'm really Roy. Well... everyone else now thinks I'm you. And they'll all think you're Sarah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d said Jack, still staring down at himself. He was physically the same, but now wearing Sarah's glasses, a bit of makeup, all her clothes... even his hair had grown out into the same style she wore. All of the clothes now perfectly fit his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me?\u201d laughed Roy, eating a spoonful of Jack's plate of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChange us back this instant!\u201d yelled Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you say, 'Sarah,'\u201d laughed Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy grasped Jack's hand again and quickly fired the device off in quick succession at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantaneously, Jack found himself again seated at the table, clad in nothing but a towel, and munching on a fresh mouthful of eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough that still leaves me playing the role of Sarah,\u201d muttered Roy. \u201cBut I figure I'll switch myself back with her after she's done working my shift for me today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Jack thought about what he wanted to do, his first thought was to make Roy do something he hated to do, go to the gym and make him do whatever intense cross fit or insane workout they had going on.  Or he could give Roy a teste of his own medicine.  He could use the remote on Roy (with Roy's knowledge) and swap him with Sarah's pet mouse Minnie, or maybe something else, he didn't have an idea set in stone.  But one thing was certain for Jack, no way was going to let Roy enjoy his 'day off' while Sarah slaved away, he was going to make Roy suffer a little bit.</span></div></div>",

Crossing the room to the window, he was pleased to see that the parking lot was its usual bustling self today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's gaze shot immediately to a pair of college girls in skimpy exercise clothes jogging along the sidewalk, as it usually did when they were out. Roy had never met the girls, but he recognized them well; he liked to peek out every morning and watch them as they jogged by. So had Jack, before Sarah had started hanging out here every morning. They were two of the hottest girls Roy had ever seen, and they liked to wear very revealing outfits... not just when they jogged, but also when Roy had randomly seen them out and about town. This morning, the brunette girl was dressed in a sports bra and spandex shorts, while the blonde was wearing a halter top and very short shorts. Roy grinned; the thought of switching Jack with one of these girls was irresistable.</span></div></div>",

He stumbled for a moment, caught off-guard by the motion of his legs; fortunately, his host's momentum carried him forward and allowed him to keep pace, and Roy was able to find his footing quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at himself. He was dressed way less conservatively than Sarah had been; his pink halter top clung tightly to his torso and left a lot of skin exposed, while his shorts barely covered everything they needed to cover and showed off his hairless, clean-shaven legs. Neat, shoulder-length blonde hair swung into his view. Roy was surprised for a moment to see that his hair had changed color, but then he realized it must have been dyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt a little self-conscious in this outfit, but when he looked over at the person jogging next to him, he realized that Jack had it way worse. Jack was practically naked in his sports bra and tiny shorts. The outfit looked absolutely ridiculous on Jack's masculine body, and it took a lot of effort for Roy to keep himself from bursting out in hysterical laughter.

He had the other girls body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lady was the picture of fitness. Her legs were long and tan, she was toned, and looked over all great. He also noted that he was alot shorter than he had been, going from 6' 5'' to 5'1''. He saw he had the device in his hands, and that it had some strange message on screen. \"Error, and error has occured because of: Overuse with the same subjects.

That could make it harder. \"Oh, well\" he says heading back down the street. \"Where are you going?\" you ask, wanting to head back to your building to start fixing things. \"Well, we got to get back to campus, class start soon, duh,\" Jack tells you, as he rejoins you. \"I've got to stop by our dorm to pick up some stuff,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the device makes even more noises, looking it up you see that it......</span></div></div>",

This is a really swell gift from my stupid double from his stupid alternate universe. I'm now trapped in the body of some strange woman named 'Tonya.' And my best friend Jack has become someone named 'Janet'... and he actually believes he's really her! What can possibly go wrong now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at the device, still smoldering ever so slightly. The tiny LED screen was now flashing a new message: \u201cEnergy depletion. Micro Tokamak will require 72 hours to recharge reserves. Do not attempt usage before then. Have a nice day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeventy-Two hours thought Roy. That's three days. Would he have to spend the next three days as this strange woman named Tonya? The only thing he even knew about her was her name... and that she went jogging with this Janet woman. How was Roy supposed to live Tonya's life for the next three days?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, reflected Roy. The earlier error message said the longer he stayed like this, the more he'd start acquiring the memories and personality of this body. After 72 hours, would Roy even remember being Roy? By the time the device was fully re-charged and capable of undoing all these swaps to put everything right again... would Roy even want to swap back? By then, he'd know all about Tonya's life \u2013 to the point that he'd probably be thinking and acting just like her. And the odds were pretty slim she'd want to use the Role Swapper to willingly trade lives with some guy who worked at a fast food restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said come on, Tonya!\u201d whined the body of Janet (inhabited unknowingly by Jack). \u201cI said class is starting soon! Are you coming back to campus with me or not? We still have to get changed and then get to class. We're gonna be late, Tonya! What's the hold-up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be best, thought Roy, to just go with Jack. At least he had all of Janet's memories right now. He could guide Roy around a bit... at least until Roy's mind began to inevitably get flooded with Tonya's memories and personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I'm coming Jack... uh... Just a minute,\u201d Roy stammered. \u201cJust a... just a minute, Janet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, thought Roy, while in Tonya's class he could write himself a detailed note explaining everything. Then seal that into an envelope and put it, along with the device, someplace where only Tonya would find it three days from now. Then, he supposed, the best he could hope for would be Tonya actually believing the wild story in the note. Was it worth a shot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This lady's body seemed to be built to run, as he wasn't even winded. He wasn't used to the looks he was getting from guys, and there was the awkward sensation his new areas gave him. Soon he arrived on campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around and observed the scene, he spotted Jack, heading into a dorm. He decided to follow him, er, her. Man, this was getting confusing, really confusing. As he entered, he feared if he could find his room. But to his surprise, he found it with ease. Upon entering he spotted Jack in the bathroom included with the room. At least it wouldn't be hard to keep an eye on him. Looking around he saw a desk. Clearing some stuff off he placed down the little do-hickey. He searched through some draws until he found a screwdriver and some other tools, but as hard as they were to find, and how dusty they were they didn't get much use. As he looked at his toolkit, a thought occurred to him. What if even opening the thing, made things worse, like switching him with someone on the other side of the world. He could end up in China, Australia, or some other place. Or somewhere on campus. Only he might not remember, who he ever was. Or everyone around him could change, but he would stay as this lady, and the remote could be destroyed in the process. He had to be extra careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his eyes fell on a pile of books. Oh man, he thought. I need to get to class! I studied all last night for that big test. Dr. Green had said that test would probably take us all week, and it's only Monday, it was going to be one of the longest weeks of your life. You always had Janet to help you through it, ever since childhood. Hey! Wait a minute. Roy realized what he was doing and became scared of what would happen if he didn't change back. It wasn't bad yet. But it had only been about an hour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was being torn. He wanted to fix this remote, he knew it was in his mind somewhere, but what about that test? He needed to clean up and get to class real quick. But wait. What if he didn't gain this lady's knowledge in time? He would bomb that test and possibly ruin her life!

Looking at his own body, Roy's suspicions were confirmed: he was wearing the sports bra and spandex shorts of the brunette girl. Apparently the two of them had switched after all. The device lay between the two of them, and it was giving off an alarming amount of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past Jack, however, Roy realized that wasn't all that had happened. The parking lot was as busy as ever, but the people there weren't dressed at all like they had been a moment ago. The chaos in the parking lot was almost too much to take in at first. There was a cute Asian woman with big hair and and a t-shirt with the American flag; there was a heavyset American-American woman in a girl scout uniform holding the paw of a dog that appeared to be dressed in women's clothing and walking on just its hind legs; there was a middle-aged woman in a cheerleading uniform; there was a young girl in a skirt suit holding a leash that was attached to a naked blonde woman crawling on her hands and knees.

And then he frowned.. his voice had sounded strange. Thin, high-pitched. Almost... like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith sudden horror, Roy turned his gaze downward and gasped as he took in the shape of his body. He didn't see his own body dressed in Sarah's clothing, as he might have expected, and as he had just a moment before. No... his body looked strange, warped to his eyes, like it had been twisted as in a funhouse mirror. Roy blinked, and then, suddenly, he made sense of the picture before his eyes. The bulges of his chest, the curve of his waist, the flare of his hips... he wasn't some sideshow freak with a twisted body. He was a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his hands, which looked smaller and smoother, and then tentatively placed them over his new chest. It was a familiar sensation on his palms as he cupped his new breasts with his hands--no different from caressing a girlfriend's body, although it was strange to do it from this angle--but it felt whollly unfamiliar from the inside. His breasts felt heavy, swollen, and oddly sensitive to his touch, even through the fabric of his sweater, his blouse and--he took in a sharp breath--his bra. He lifted his breasts and felt the strange sensation of his flesh shifting and squishing, and then he let go and felt as his breasts fell and were caught by his bra. Then he ran his hands along the curve of his waist and hips, and at last, he slid them down to his crotch and felt both the lack of his penis and the presence of something now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth?\" he said... and then he stopped as he realized he recognized his new voice. It wasn't just a random woman's voice... it was Sarah's! The device had turned him into Sarah, both in life AND in body now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked up angrily at Sarah, who looked much taller now... although Roy realized that it wasn't that she was taller; it was that he was shorter. He began to open his mouth, intending to demand that Sarah change him back, but he stopped himself. As long as Sarah was holding the device, she had total control over his fate, and judging from the slightly sadistic grin on her face, Roy had a hunch that he needed to be careful about what he said over the next few minutes. There were worse things in the world, after all, than being a young, pretty, healthy, relatively successful woman...</span></div></div>",

No he was in a stalement with Sarah. Then<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pointed the device at one of the lacy pink bra, Roy flinched in terror, certain something horrific was about to happen to him. Would he turn into an actual bra? Would someone try to WEAR him? But a moment later, Roy still found himself standing in the same place, in the same position, still wearing Sarah's clothing. But... something DID feel different. Something important. He could sense it. But... what was it? He couldn't quite put his finger on it. It was like it was just out of his reach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened?\" he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked at Sarah, who looked at him expectantly, and then down at the device in his hands. He thought about just grabbing the device and hoping he could use it to switch back to his old life before Sarah could react... but for some reason, the thought of returning to his old life seemed... distasteful. He should have wanted his life back, but for some reason, he didn't anymore. And then he realized why: he didn't want to be a man anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had spent his entire life as a man, and it had suited him just fine. He had never given much thought at all to the idea of becoming a woman. Why would he? Men were men and women were women and that was the way things were, and being male had always been comfortable enough for him. But now, the thought of becoming a man again... it felt uncomfortable. Unpleasant. Almost repulsive. Men were crude, clumsy, and unrefined. They were aggressive, they were idiotic, and they were slaves to their penises. Roy didn't want to be like that. He didn't want to be a man. Not anymore. He wanted... he wanted to be a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device... the bra. Roy looked over at the bra... or at what had once been the bra. Now it was an undershirt, a men's undershirt. The device must have somehow... transferred the feminity of the frilly, girly brassiere into Roy. Physically, Roy was unchanged. Looking down at himself, he still saw a flat chest beneath Sarah's sweater and a bulge in her pants. But mentally... mentally, he was a woman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No. Mentally, SHE was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy closed her eyes and tried to take this all in, tried to understand the magnitude of what had happened. On some level, Roy was the same person she had always been. She still felt like Roy, still felt like herself. She didn't feel like a different person. But on a different level, she WAS a different person. She had changed... completely. Fundamentally. At the very deepest level of her being, Roy was a woman, and that changed EVERYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she suddenly felt the need to go shoe-shopping or talk like some sterotypical valley girl. She wasn't some shallow, vapid bimbo, some man's fantasy of what it was to be a woman. She was just a woman, plain and simple. It was a matter of identity. It was something deep, something nuanced. Roy didn't know what all had changed... that would have to sort itself out later. All she knew, for now, was that she felt like a woman and she didn't want to be a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Sarah... and as she felt different, so did Sarah suddenly look different to her. A moment before, when Roy had looked into Sarah's eyes, all she had seen was a threat. Sarah was a competitor, a danger, a rival for her life. Sarah's gaze was still unnerving... there was something cruel in her eyes. And... something else, too, something Roy hadn't noticed before. She was eyeing Roy with just a trace of lust, like any man looking at any woman. But Roy saw something different in Sarah now... she saw fear in Sarah's eyes. Sarah looked afraid, and confused. And Roy understood why... Sarah had just been told that she wasn't really the person she'd thought she was. That must have shaken her entire sense of herself, just as the changes to Roy's mind had shaken her own sense of identity. Sarah didn't want to believe that she wasn't the real Roy, Roy realized... but she must have beleived it, at least a little. And just as Roy had seen Sarah as a threat a moment ago, Roy realized that Sarah must have been afraid of Roy as well. After all, Roy had been begging to take her life and identity away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Roy know all of this? How could she read so much in Sarah's eyes? As a man, Roy hadn't been an especially intuitive person. But now, she felt like she could read Sarah's face like a book. Was it just because Roy didn't want her male life back anymore, and so Sarah no longer represented a usurper? Was that why she could look past the fear in Sarah's eyes? Or was this some deeper capacity for empathy that Roy now possessed, now that she had the mind of a woman? Was this, so to speak, women's intuition?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not a woman. I'm a man, Right. What was my name?\" Roy Thought<br>\r\nA few minutes later Sarah, looking now like Roy, walked out of the apartment.<br>\r\n\"See you later Sarah\" Sarah called to Roy. <br>\r\n\"Enjoy your life\" She muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.k. See you later Roy\" Roy called back.</span></div></div>",

That doesn't make me a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Roy, in stunned confusion. \"Of... of course it does. I mean... look at us! Sarah, I've got a penis... and I strongly doubt you have one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" said Sarah's body. \"Of course I don't have a penis. Not that it's any of your business, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... doesn't that prove you're female?\" asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Sarah... I'm starting to believe parts of your story,\" said Sarah's body. \"You're acting way too weird for the normal Sarah I know. I don't remember using this little high-tech gizmo on you. But since you know all about it, and you're acting so crazy all of a sudden... well, the only logical explanation is that I used this device on you already and something happened. I just don't remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Roy tried interrupting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on just a second,\" continued Sarah's body. \"I'll try to explain as best as I can. I suspect your memories got re-written somehow... or maybe you're actually from another parallel universe, just like the clone of me who gave me this device in the first place. Anyhow, in this reality biological gender doesn't determine your sex. I mean, just look at the two of us! You were born male and I was born female. But my folks wanted a boy, so they named me Roy and raised me as a guy. I've always thought of myself as a dude. Everyone's always treated me as a dude. I like girls, but I don't want to be one. So I don't wear dresses, skirts, and shit. And yes, I have these tits. But I'm not going to be all fruity and wear a bra! That's just crazy. Some day, I'll save up enough money to have surgery done and get them removed. But in the meantime, they're no big deal. Lots of people out there are like us. You've never told me you're story, Sarah. But I'm guessing your parents wanted a girl. So when you were born physically male, they just named you Sarah and raised you to be a girl. You've always been treated as a girl for as long as I've known you. I mean, you're dating my roommate Jack. He treats you like a girl. I don't know what the two of you do in the bedroom -- and that's none of my business anyhow! But you obviously like guys, Sarah. And you wear women's clothing and use the ladies room out in restaurants and stuff. All your friends act like you're just a regular, ordinary girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, before I used that device on myself,\" said Roy. \"I was YOU. I mean, I was Roy Milford, not Sarah Howard. And reality was WAY different. Men were men and women were women. I mean, yeah there were transvestites and transsexual people. But it wasn't, y'know, like an everyday normal occurence. And you and I were DEFINITELY not transsexuals. You were a normal, biologically female girl... and I was a dude! Physically and mentally and everything, I was a guy. And was Roy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry Sarah,\" replied Sarah's body. \"But you're not Roy anymore. And history has apparently been totally re-written from the weird, boring reality you remember. You're now Sarah -- a biologically male girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" pleaded Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Sarah, I understand you're pretty confused,\" continued Sarah's body. \"And I do believe that obviously SOMEthing happened to you, or at least to your memories. If you want, we can experiment with this little high-tech gizmo -- I'd love to try it out and see if it works. Maybe we can somehow use it to make you biologically female, to match your identity and be the woman you remember from that past reality you're from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that woman!\" protested Roy. \"You are! I'm the real Roy and you're the real Sarah -- the biologically female Sarah, I mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I already told you,\" said Sarah's body. \"I don't want to be a girl.

As crazy at it sounds, there's no way you could know about this little gizmo otherwise. I haven't had a chance to even test it out yet, much less tell anybody else about it. But I have to tell you, Sarah -- I don't see you as a dude. When I look at you, I see someone 100% female. You've got boobs from where I'm standnig. And I sure don't see breasts on me when I look down. So that part of your story is still pretty crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, crazy or not, it isn't what I see!\" protested Roy. He gestured at his flat chest, still wearing Sarah's clothes. \"I don't see any breasts here at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down,\" said Sarah's body. \"Like I said: I believe your story.

And you're Sarah, but you're standing there wearing my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go look in the mirror,\" suggested Sarah's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy reluctantly walked from the small apartment kitchen into the living room. He looked into a cheap, decorative mirror hanging on the wall and was shocked at the sight of Sarah Howard's very much female body staring back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you see?\" Roy asked with hushed awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's body leaned forward and peeked in the mirror. Roy caught a glimpse of his own male reflection in the mirror as she bent forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Sarah's body. \"That's us -- looking 100% normal. That isn't how you see reality, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" sighed Roy glumly. \"And I keep telling you, I'm not Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirror suggests otherwise,\" laughed Sarah's body. \"But hey, don't get all upset. Like I said: I believe your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll switch back with me?\" Roy asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance!\" laughed Sarah's body again. \"I don't want to be you.

First, you can accept your new fate and start living the life of Sarah Howard. I know it seems weird to you... but everyone sees you as Sarah already. That'd probably be the simplest solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my other choice?\" sighed Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can use my little high-tech toy to switch you into somebody else's life,\" said Sarah's body. \"Just not me! I may not be the original Roy Milford, but it's who I am now. All my memories are of always being Roy. I don't want to become a girl, no matter what you say.

But I have the mind, the personality, the experiences of Roy \u2013 that's who I am! Now, make up your mind: do you want to stay as Sarah Howard? Or would you like me to use this device to put you in somebody else's life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...\u201d started Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Sarah flatly. \u201cAbsolutely no. No ifs, no ands, no buts. I am not switching lives with you. I'm Roy Milford from now on. End of story. I sympathize with you, and yes \u2013 I even believe your story. But I'm not going to become Jack's girlfriend just because that's what you remember from some kooky alternate history that no longer exists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed silently and fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme think for a second,\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled patiently at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the harm in letting her keep his old life? After all, that was what started this whole mess in the first place. He'd hated being Roy! Granted, he hadn't exactly planned on becoming his roommate's girlfriend... but fate works in weird ways, right? Perhaps it was for the best that returning to his old life was completely closed off to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo should he let Sarah change him into somebody else? Hmmm, that seemed a little drastic. Things had gotten pretty messed up after just ONE of these role swaps. Neither of them really knew much about this weird gizmo. It would probably be best not to tempt fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Roy could pretend to be Sarah Howard. It was what everyone else in the world seemed to perceive anyhow. He certainly would NOT be having sex with Jack, though! Which meant in the long run, Roy would either have to ask Sarah to swap him into a different life role... or he'd have to break up with Jack (and probably become a lesbian!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's it going to be?\u201d asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we make a deal?\u201d asked Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends,\u201d mused Sarah. \u201cWhat's the deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll stay as Sarah Howard,\u201d replied Roy. \u201cAt least for awhile. I think we both agree that device needs a lot more testing and... I dunno, fine-tuning I guess. Look at the mess it's gotten me into it. I'd advise you not to use it on yourself, 'Roy.' And I'd rather you not use it on me... at least not until we've got a better grasp on how to work it properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Sarah slowly. \u201cThat makes sense... and?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, later on, once we've worked the bugs out of the system and know how to use the role swapper,\u201d continued Roy. \u201cThen, at that point, I reserve the right to take you up on your earlier offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I switch you into the life of anyone you want except me?\u201d asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Roy. \u201cCan we agree to those terms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith one stipulation,\u201d answered Sarah. \u201cI want your solemn vow that under no circumstances will you touch this device without my express permission. I'm serious here, Sarah! I want to trust you on this... but... well, you seem so adamant on stealing my life and becoming me... well, I'll trust you and agree to this whole scheme if you promise me not to use this device without my specific say-so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine, you win!\u201d sighed Roy. \u201cOkay \u2013 'Roy,' I give you my solemn word of honor that I will not attempt to use that device without your permission. You really want to be Roy from now on? Okay, I surrender my rights on that life. Just promise me that if I change my mind about being the new 'Sarah Howard,' that you'll still be willing to switch me into a different life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a deal,\u201d smiled Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the mismatched couple nervously shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

And miraculously, they all appeared to be re-sized to fit Jack's considerably larger frame. He was also wearing Sarah's glasses and had a modest amount of makeup on his face... some lipstick and a bit of eyeshadow and mascara.

There were several times while he was on shift that he was tempted to use the Role Swapper, just so he wouldn't have to flip a single burger for the rest of the day. Of course, having not spent the proper amount of time, in his opinion, experimenting with the device, he just didn't want to risk fouling things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was off for the rest of the day, it was time to call up his friend Stacy. They had been close friends since they had met during their freshmen year in high school. Like so many other guys in his position, however, he had quickly become \"like a girl friend\" to her thus killing any potential for them to go out. Of course, even with him having the unrequited love issue with Stacy, she was still one of the few people the Roy emphatically trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy collected his cell phone from his locker at work and checked to see if she had responded to his text message earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey you! Sure, I am free tonight. Just come on over when you get off shift. I still have a clean shirt that you left over here the last time you came over, so you won't have to smell like burgers all night. The only thing is that mom said you have to leave by 11 tonight. She was pissed that you slept over her last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short trip, Roy found himself ringing Stacy's doorbell. Having expected him around this time, Stacy answered the door without much of a wait and invited him up to her room. Roy still felt a pang of regret as he followed her up the stairs of the two story home. A few inches shorter than Roy, Stacy stood at 5'5\" and had strawberry blond hair that fell to a little past her shoulders whenever she wasn't wearing it in a ponytail like tonight. She was dressed modestly, as she was home for the evening, wearing a simple baby doll t-shirt and a comfortable pair of jeans. Stacy's 17-year-old sister Ashley ignored them both as they walked by the threshold of her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was this surprise that you said you just HAD to show me tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn't say a word as he closed Stacy's bedroom door behind them. Taking a moment to gather his thoughts, he told her the details of what had happened to him that day, the visit from his alternate self, swapping the roles of his roommate with his own girlfriend, and his decision to share the discovery with her. She was in disbelief at first, but Stacy knew Roy wasn't prone to hyperbole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only problem is, up to this point, you haven't really experimented with the device except for the one time, and that time you were the only one that noticed anything was different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty much it in a nutshell. I afraid to use it by myself though. I keep expecting something to go wrong the first time I try to just play around with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's only one thing to do. We need to do a little bit of testing. You were the only one touching the device when you used it earlier, so that is the most likely reason that you were the only one who noticed the changes. That being said though, you still don't know exactly what happens if you were to swap with someone. Hmm... I think I have an idea.\"</span></div></div>",

I'd be lucky if I could remember their names!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine... but... ok what if there's a way we can swap lives without changing ourselves physically?

That's why we swapped lives, but we also look more like each other now as well, but not completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was clearly too distracted by the feeling of having breasts to really pay close attention, so just nodded and agreed. \"Well, that sounds like it makes sense... What's the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! And if we both focus on swapping lives in the same way, we shouldn't get any weird side effects like the first time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a flash the swap was over, and Roy didn't feel any different, except he was once again sitting back where Stacey was a moment ago. His body was still female, as far as he could tell, and at first glance nothing had changed. He looked over to Stacey who looked more or less the same as well, like if she had been born male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's it... did it work?\" Roy asked, still finding his higher pitched voice a little strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... we switched seats again, so maybe that's an indication that our lives swapped again? Hold on let me take a look at you.\" Stacey said as she moved closer for a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe once again made a close inspection of Roy's body, first looking at the tag on Roy's bra. Then she asked him to raise his arms up in the air, and she ran her fingers along his skin, searching for scars. It gave Roy a shiver up his spine, as he realized his skin was now way more sensitive than he was used to. In his mind he was loving that Stacey was touching him, but he kept being reminded that this wasn't how he wanted it to happen. This seemed so clinical and cold, like he was a test subject. And plus Stacey looked very male right now, which wasn't really appealing to Roy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are you going to touch me all day? Did you find what you were looking for?\" Roy asked, getting a little uncomfortable with all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey stopped and backed away suddenly, \"Oh... sorry I guess I got carried away, I... Yeah. So basically your bra says you're still a 32D and I used to wear a 36DD so, you still have the boobs you would have grown if you'd been born female, I suppose?\" Roy just shrugged, staring down into his cleavage, so Stacey continued. \"And I found no sign of my scars on your body anymore... they seem to be back on me again. Your hair color is brunette, similar to your old hair, but looks like female-you likes to style it more femininely. But it's cut above the shoulder, whereas my hair used to be much longer... Honestly, Roy, this is incredible, like, I'm not seeing any resemblance to my old body in you anymore. You look like ... well if Roy had a twin sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't even know what to say. This is... not really what I expected this role swapper would be able to do. How do you think people would react if they saw me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stacey wasn't really paying attention anymore. She was already inspecting her own male body, and her male voice made a very unmasculine squeak when her hands found something in her pants that was not usually there. She quickly moved her hand, hopefully before Roy noticed. Beyond that she noticed that she had a pretty slim athletic male build, and her hair was kept short and neatly groomed, unlike Roy's old hairstyle. Her face clearly would have been covered in a beard if it wasn't all shaved away. You could see the five o'clock shadow around her lip and chin. She rubbed it and felt very short stubble which made her groan in discomfort. She went to reach for her purse to find her compact mirror...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's my... Oh yeah I guess male me doesn't wear a purse huh... or have makeup mirrors or any of that.\" Stacey mused to herself. That's when she finally took a moment to look around her room. It was still basically the same room with the same furniture (it had never been super girly anyways), but any hint that a girl lived there was gone. There were no bras hanging from the closet doorknob, there were no hairproducts on her nightstand (except for male branded styling lotion, so clearly she was still taking good care of her hair)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Roy and Stacey could investigate any further, there was a sudden knock on the door, and then a woman's voice muffled through it. \"Stevie, it's getting late, you should probably make sure your friend gets home safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stevie?\" Stacey blurted out, wondering who the hell that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother opened the door and peeked inside, but luckily Roy had already put his top back on. \"Sorry, Stephen, I know you're too old for that nickname, I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose?\" Roy perked up wondering if she was referring to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I thought that was your name, I'm sorry! You must be one of his other friends? I'm sorry I get Stevie's friends mixed up sometimes. But I mean it, it's getting too late for you to stay here, I don't want another repeat of last time he had a girl sleepover. Do you have a ride, sweetie? I'll call you an Uber if you don't... it's not safe out there at this hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just blinked, and thought <i>an Uber? Stacey's mom never treated me this nice before, she would just kick me out and assume I got home safely.</i> But he quickly realized she saw him as a vulnerable young woman and it probably made sense for him to not walk the streets alone at night anymore. \"Oh no, it's ok, I have my own car I can take home... thanks for offering though.\"</span></div></div>",

Plus he was so disoriented from his body changing so much that he still hadn't quite gotten his bearings yet. He made sure that he grabbed the swapping device before he left though. He was about to put it in his pocket when he realized his skinny girl jeans did not have deep enough pockets to fit anything substantial in. So he sighed and resorted to putting it in the purse he was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stac- uh, Stephen, call me later ok? When you have some time to talk?\" Roy said awkwardly as Stacey's mother stood there really trying to get him out the door. \"Right uhh... see ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone said their goodbyes and the door closed behind Roy. He took a moment to rustle through his purse to find his car keys, but then heard some muffled words from the inside the house. \"That <i>was</i> Rose wasn't it? I thought I recognized her. That girl is so sweet and you two always get along. When are you going to ask her out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Stacey's male voice sounded muffled, yet annoyed, through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt all the blood rush to his head with embarrassment, having overheard something like that. He wasn't used to suddenly being in this situation, and the full reality of it didn't hit him until now. He rushed into his car and quickly locked the doors, feeling quite vulnerable on a cold dark night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, this really happened didn't it?\" He muttered to himself, while he looked in the rear view mirror at his new reflection. \"Really could be my twin sister couldn't I? This is incredible..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his wallet inside his new purse and inside was a driver's license that read \"Rose Milford, F, 5'9\" 130 lbs, Blue Eyes, Brown Hair\" and born 23 years ago. It all looked very familiar except the name and the gender marker... and the photo. On the license was a photo of Rose, smiling as nicely as one can for a DMV photograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day... this device is just... wow. Imagine how powerful it must be if it can change so much. With just a simple thought and the press of a button it rewrote history in a way I never even imagined. Now I'm... Rose? I hope Stacey's willing to swap back soon, cause... yeah.\"  Roy said out loud to himself, still fascinated by the sound of his own voice. Of Rose Milford's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rose' took a deep breath, and drove home, trying not to think too hard about all the weird stuff going on.</span></div></div>",

But before the night got too boring, a thin slice of light appeared on the closet door. A man somehow stepped through the impossibly thin light and appeared in the bedroom. It was the same Roy as before, who originally gave him the role swapper. He was holding some new device this time and began scanning the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, another person stepped into the room through the beam of light, a woman this time. She was shorter and smaller than Roy, but had long jet black hair and an unfamiliar face. She was also carrying a scanning device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman joined him in scanning and quickly stopped and smiled, \"Oh look what we have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy walked over to the sleeping girl in the bed, and sighed. He tapped a few buttons on his device's screen and sighed, \"Looks like another one... And so soon! It's only been like, less than 24 hours and this Roy's already gone and turned herself female. Somehow managed to tap into the deep reality features as well, probably by accident. Looks like this one still occupies the same life, despite the obvious changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Roys just aren't meant to stay boys. The numbers prove it. Far more of them end up as a Rachel or a Sarah, or a Stacey... or a Rose in this case. Far more than stay male in their own life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or an Asuka, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirked, proudly, \"Exactly. At least 73% settle on a female life or even body when all is said and done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alternate dimension Roy sighed and turned off his scanner. \"Alright, you've made your point. Let's just hurry up and leave. There's still 43 more to check in on today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly took his leave through the beam of light, and the woman turned to follow him. She stopped short of the exit, however, and walked back over to the sleeping girl.  Her device lit up again, and she aimed it at Rose, pressing a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, that should help. Roy rarely warns anyone of the possible mental side effects involved with being involved in a two-way swap. And we need to help make sure branches don't repeat themselves too closely. Don't worry, I was where you were once, but this will work out as long as you stay true to yourself. And I'll be keeping an eye on you. Asuka always watches over her sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman calling herself Asuka leaned over and kissed Rose on the forehead, before stepping out through the portal. The light closed behind her, and the room was once again plunged into darkness. Rose began tossing and turning throughout the rest of the night...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy found himself standing in darkness. However, standing may not be the best word for it, because there was no floor to stand on. There were no walls, no windows, no lights, no sensation of up or down. He would move, but everything seemed slow, like trying to run underwater. He went to touch his chest but found there was little physical form. Things weren't quite tangible, almost like his hand went right through himself, but there was some weak resistance pushing back where his body would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he reached for his pocket, if he had one, but he didn't know what he was searching for. But there it was. A physical tangible object in his hands, which he remembered was the device given to him by another version of himself. It was the only thing that felt real, even more so than himself. As he gripped it in his hand, suddenly the world felt like it was coming into focus. It was like gravity existed again, and a dim light began to shine from somewhere above. It illuminated around him, and he realized he was in his room. But it all seemed unstable as if the walls were shaking on the molecular level. He looked up and there was no ceiling, only the dim light from nowhere. It cast a pale orange glow on everything, muting all other colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" He went to say, but everything came out muffled and unintelligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his body, but saw only formless unstable matter in the rough shape of a human being. But the role swapper was still in his hand, or what he assumed was his hand. But strangely enough, he noticed a new button on the role swapper. It was big and round and impossible to miss. So he couldn't stop himself from pressing it to find out what it was. He heard a creak, the first noise in this place yet, and noticed the door had opened partially, but he could not yet see through the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Roy tried to say, though no one would ever hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously he opened the door all the way, and inside was another room similar to his bedroom, but was lacking all of the furniture except for one thing. A mirror on the wall. His room normally didn't have a mirror on the wall, as far as he could remember, but he looked into it anyways. Staring back at him, was Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, I'm me again.\" He said, noticing that his words were clear now, and he could feel physical form again. \"But where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Roy noticed that the other end of the room had two doors. He tested the doorknob of the right door, and it was unlocked, so he stepped through without thinking. Inside was... an exact copy of the room he was just in. There were two doors on one end, and a mirror on the wall. This time the reflection was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I'm Rose again?\" She asked herself, once again hearing a feminine voice coming from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose turned towards the door she entered from but found that the door was no longer there. A black abyss that went on forever stared back at her. Suddenly her vision narrowed and she felt like she was falling, but she was simply sitting on the floor where she fell. There was something through that door that defied sanity. There was nothing through that door. No air, no vacuum, no energy. It was the absence of space and time, in any dimension. It wasn't just emptiness. It was simply: null.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one heard Rose's cries of terror as she backed away from the abyss, crawling with her hands. She had to look away, or her sanity would cease to exist. Slowly she managed to pull herself to her feet, and with shaking hands, opened...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vaguely remembering that the right door made her turn into Rose again, she decided to try the left door this time. There was little time for hesitation since her heart was still pounding and she just wanted to get away from whatever was behind her, or wasn't behind her. Quickly Rose opened the left door and was about to step through, until she realized there was no floor. Through the doorway was a neon pink line extending straight outwards, off into the horizon until it could not be made out anymore. However, everywhere else, was simply darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose carefully tapped the pink line with her foot, checking how tangible it was. However, the instant her foot made contact with it, she felt her whole body twisting and warping until she couldn't even consider it a body anymore. It all happened in a fraction of a moment. Her warped body was sucked into the line, and she felt herself rocketing along at such unimaginable speeds that time seemed to cease having meaning. By the time she was able to process what was happening, she somehow sensed that she was rapidly approaching something, a fork in the line. A nearly imperceptible thought to turn right was all that was needed to send her careening down a different line from the junction. She felt herself being pulled along helplessly, but realized she also had some amount of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fork in the line approached, and she took a left, then another right, and another. It seemed to go on forever, until one time she chose to turn right one too many times, and was immediately thrown back into what felt like the third dimension, or it was at least more than two dimensions, she was fairly sure. She was flying through the void, unsure what kind of body, if any, she currently had. Her attention was focused on the new perspective that filled her vision. She could see the line from 'up' here, and it was no longer pink. It seemed to change purple, or green, or blue, or even colors that there is no name for. She saw the line branching again and again, off into the distance. It started forming a massive tree of lines until the branches were so far away that they blended together into a single rainbow spectrum of light at the far end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment Rose realized that she was beginning to move closer to the tree, of her own power. She had some control over which way she flew, and she felt curious to get a closer look at the lines. There were pulses of light racing along them, and each one taking different branches. One of them, in particular, drew her attention, because it appeared to be carrying more pulses than any of them around it. The color began shifting, turning a dark shade of red. Then the light dimmed, and flickered out. A massive branch of the spectrum snapped off and 'fell' away into the abyss, dark and lifeless. She looked back at the tree, and more branches were dimming, and then falling off. Only a fraction of the originals remained, and it sent Rose into a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew herself down to the 'edge' of one of the branches, where things had begun dying off. Zooming closer and closer, she found herself floating above a replica of Roy's bedroom. Inside was a regular Roy, walking towards one of the two doors out of the room. He looked completely oblivious to the fact that flames were spewing from under the door. He opened it and flames engulfed him as he stepped inside, and turned to ash. Rose quickly flew away from here, horrified at the sights before her. She tried looking at other rooms, and most showed a Roy, in one body or another, being killed horribly when they stepped through a door. Some doors unleashed a flood of water or blood, that quickly filled the room. Some doors Roy stepped through and just fell endlessly into an empty abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more towards the center of this tree, Roys were choosing doors that lead to new rooms that had never been entered before. New branches were formed on the tree, as the pulses raced up and away from the decaying limbs. Rose followed the new lines further and further, watching some of them become dead ends, while others continued on. But the farther she went, the fewer lines remained. Until at last, a single line was still forging a new path ahead. Slower than all the others, with only a single pulse driving the growth. But it was sure and steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose nudged towards it to see what was happening inside, but the line didn't seem to get any closer. In fact, she felt like she was falling away from it. Falling in a world without gravity, but still the sensation of falling. Falling, falling, falling, until at last, peace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy shot up out of bed with a blood-curdling scream, still feeling like he was falling. He was breathing quickly and looking around in a panic, but all he saw was the same room that he fell asleep in. Everything seemed-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Rose are you alright?\" Jack said, bursting through the door. His roommate had a poor sense of personal space, but at least seemed concerned. However, when he looked into the room, he quickly turned away and continued holding the door open. \"Shit sorry... I just heard a scream... Didn't know you were...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Roy wondered, slowly coming to his senses. He wasn't sure what Jack was so embarrassed about, until he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his chest were Rose's pair of perky B cup breasts sitting prominently out in the open, for the world, or at least Jack, to see. It took Roy a second to process everything, but eventually, he pulled a blanket over his chest. \"Shit, Jack! Fucking knock next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I was just worried, you're all good yeah?\" Jack said through a tiny crack in the door this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick look around Roy concluded, \"Yeah... yeah I'm fine. Hell of a nightmare though. Sorry about all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack left him alone long enough to think about everything he'd seen. The dream was still vivid in his mind, all of it. The parts where he was Roy, and the parts where he was Rose, and then seeing some sort of cosmic light show. It was a bit much for him to comprehend right now. He felt like it was important enough to write down before he forgot it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better not just be a result of estrogen in my blood... Is this shit normal for women? Jeez...\" Roy said naively to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dream written down, he headed to the bathroom to brush his teeth. Immediately the first thing he noticed was every time he moved the toothbrush side to side, his breasts would jiggle back and forth. It was incredibly distracting, but he kept doing it. This resulted in the longest teeth brushing in Roy's history of brushing his teeth. When that was finally done, he began examining his reflection subconsciously. Rose looked similar enough to Roy that it was a little creepy seeing the similarities in an obviously female body. With the right catch of the light, he could see his old face in that reflection, and then a few degrees to the left and it would look like a cute girl again. Though the lack of any facial hair, even stubble, added further to the femininity. Roy used to be lazy about shaving, and would often have some shadow there. Part of him was glad that he didn't have to shave his face at all this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm Rose. I guess. For a while at least. It doesn't seem so bad. Wonder how long Stacey... or Stevie, is willing to put up with random erections before she wants to back out on this.\" Rose said, practicing using her new voice, and attempting to get used to her new name and gender. \"I might as well get used to being treated like Rose if I'm going to go to work like this...\"</span></div></div>",

After the crazy dream last night, Rose was still a bit rattled and decided to leave the swapper alone for the time being. Instead, she got to experience her first day on the job as Rose. She still had her usual job at Burger Bonanza, but the customers were overall more polite to her than usual, but it was hard to tell. At the same time, however, her boss was even more critical than usual. Pointing out every little flaw in the way she worked, when normally as Roy, she would have been able to get away with a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now was not the time for her to get all bent out of shape about something like this, not when she got to look forward to meeting up with Steven, or whatever he called himself now. It was enough to get her through the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose showed up at Steven's house as soon as she left home and changed out of her work clothes. She decided on wearing something from Rose's wardrobe, which she still had a hard time accepting was her identity now. Rose didn't even exist until yesterday, and now here she is a real person with real possessions. Nevertheless, she showed up in a tank top and cardigan, with skinny jeans and sneakers, and thought that it all went well together. It wasn't overly feminine, and she was comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, uh Rose?\" Steven said when he opened the door to let her in. \"Is that the name you ended up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's official, Rose Milford. How was your day, <i>Stevie</i>?\" Rose teased as she followed him up to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... that name is so stupid, if you're gonna call me my new name at least just call me Steve or something. Everyone else does, except my mom apparently.\" Steve sighed, flopping down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, Steve. How was your day? Was having a sausage swinging between your legs as fun as you imagined?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it was pretty good I guess. Work was average, and no one tried to hit on me... well at least no guys. So that's good.\" He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'At least no guys'? What's that mean? Did some girl flirt with you at work today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a coworker. She used to be a friend of mine but I guess now our relationship is a little more complicated. We're not a thing or anything, but she's sure a lot more... friendly now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew... and that's a good thing?\" Rose wrinkled her nose at the thought of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve laughed, \"What? I thought you liked girls, what's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do! But a coworker doing that seems a bit weird, while at work. And I thought you liked guys?\" Rose pressed, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I dunno. So how was your day as Rose?\" Steve asked, and an awkward silence followed. He added, \"Looks like you're settling into being a girl just fine. I'm surprised actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? I mean, I guess it seems to be easier than I thought, so far. I thought it'd be weird, but it just feels normal?\" Rose said, wondering why she felt that way. \"But I guess it wasn't all that great. My boss was constantly trying to overexplain how to use the ice cream machine, as though he hadn't already seen me use it a thousand times before. I swear he was just looking for excuses to nitpick me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like your first dose of mansplaining,\" Steve said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I don't think it was anything like that just... Idk he's kind of just a fucking douchebag I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve just laughs, \"If you say so. Also, it's really cute when you swear... Uh I mean, shit. Like what I mean is I'm not used to hearing your voice sound the way it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose feels her cheeks flushing briefly before shaking it off, \"Cute? Are you sure you're into guys? That sounded like flirting to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he just sat there and stared into empty space for a moment, before replying, still flustered. \"Look I didn't... I wasn't trying to... Ugh.\"</span></div></div>",

A tomboy, Rose never spent much time on hair, makeup, etc. when she could help it. On the walk to Burger Bonanza, a man took the time to make his opinion on her ass loudly known. Men! Why the last time someone had done that to her, she'd...she'd... wait, she'd never been a she before today. Something snapped in the intrepid protagonist, and the mind of Rose became Roy again. Roy looked at his body. It was definitely the same one as the night before. As he tried to come to terms with his new state, he noticed the leering man was coming closer. It was best to put off investigation until he got to Burger Bonanza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork was..different. Roy always thought of himself as, if nothing else, a good assistant manager. He was fair, defended everyone when the manager was too harsh and tried to keep everything running smoothly. Rose, it seemed, was more indirect. the first time he told one  of his part-timers to take out the trash, she blinked and said, \"excuse me?\" \"You heard me. We're getting on the full side. Can you take it out for me?\" \"Yeah, you just...I don't know, normally you ask us to do things. I don't know, it's weird hearing you tell me to do something.\" The rest of the day went on like that. A fry cook stared at his chest for a whole conversation and completely ignored what he had said. Turns out, Rose would usually leave sticky notes for him to avoid talking in person. A female employee took his hand to show him something, and another talked to him like an old friend instead of a boss. In general, both men and women acted more comfortably around Rose than they ever had with Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround lunchtime, Roy heard a ring from the purse. Taking out the phone, Roy saw that \"Stephen Donaldson\" was calling. Stephanie. </span></div></div>",

Roy and Stacy would both hold the device as they used it to swap him with Stacy's sister, Ashley. In her opinion, it meant that only one of the two of them would be involved in the trade, so if anything went wrong, Stacy would still theoretically know what was going on and be able to change things back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quick breather, both of them crept over to Ashley's room and fired the device at her. It was only a moment before they were back in Stacy's room with the door closed behind them. Roy looked like he might back out of the experiment for a moment as he hesitated to fire it at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's now or never right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Roy, I'll fix it if something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the device in their hands together, they aimed it at Roy and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy blinked for a moment as he knew something had happened. One moment he had been standing in Stacy's room with the Role Swapper, but now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around what was obviously Ashley's room. It was a modestly decorated room for a 17-year-old girl. There weren't any boy band posters hanging on the wall, but pink was definitely in play here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what really interested Roy wasn't the decor. Biting the bullet, he finally looked down at himself to fully gauge the damage. He was definitely supposed to be Ashley now. What was once Ashley's white spaghetti strap shirt and orange shorts clung to his body like they were made for him. It didn't take long for him to notice his legs were shaved now, and apparently Ashley had painted her toes to match her shorts because that's what he saw when he finally looked down at his feet. At the same time, his hair must have grown out to match Ashley's except it was still in his original brown color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy turned to walk to the door when he felt that something was off. Feeling a moment of panic, his hand moved to his crotch to see if what he thought he felt was correct. It was flat! Pulling his new shorts down, Roy was stunned to see that Ashley's panties were completely smooth in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a girl!\" Roy said a little too loudly at first, before realizing he should keep it down. Roy quickly pulled up his shorts. He had to get back over to Stacy's room... now.</span></div></div>",

Roy and Stacy headed back to Ashley's room for a tad of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap Roy! It really worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding, but that's not the half of it. I'm a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way of really getting across how bad it was to Stacy without showing her the damage, so without another thought, Roy dropped his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?! Awesome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ya. It's hot,\" she added with a wink. \"Makes sense though considering the role you took. Roy, I hate to break it to you, but you're definitely my sister now. And as much as most of your body didn't need to change, there was one thing that had to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Jack and Sarah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy, did you see either of them naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sarah was in the shower as Jack, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you only saw her as well as you could through a shower curtain. Her and Jack had probably swapped in that department too, you just couldn't tell at the time. But hey, on the bright side, how many guys can say they've been a real girl before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Roy had already pulled his panties and shorts back up. Jeez, was he really thinking of them as his panties? Ashley's.... Ashley's panties and shorts. He finally realized he forgot to ask Stacy where the role swapper was. She pulled the device out of her pocket and filled Roy in on what happened after he swapped places with her sister. Apparently, as they swapped places, Ashley appeared in Roy's clothes with his haircut, but only Stacy was holding the role swapper after the swap occurred. Stacy speculated that had either of them used the device by themselves, it would have stayed in their possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She also asked me what it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... so even though we swapped places, she didn't know anything about the device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy explained that Ashley had no memory of the role swapper's existence, probably a safety feature to make sure a person who didn't know about the role swapper to begin with wouldn't inadvertently gain knowledge about the device. Stacy also mentioned that she probably needed to get back to Ashley now before she thought something was wrong. After all, she thought she came over to hang out with Stacy tonight. Right as Stacy was about to leave the room though, her mom called up from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stacy, I got called back in to work tonight. Your friend is going to have to go home now. I don't want him spending the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I guess that's it for tonight. I've only been here for a half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's okay. She's sending my friend Roy home, not my sister Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... wait, I can't stay like this all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, it's Friday night. Ashley won't have school tomorrow morning. We'll be able to spend all night together, and we can swap you back tomorrow. Come on Roy... it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at himself. Was he really willing to stay as Stacy's sister for the night just so he could spend a few more hours with her?\"</span></div></div>",

You saw how my mom treated you,\u201d said Stacy. \u201cShe really thinks you're one of her daughters. And she believes Ash is actually Roy! It's the perfect chance for you to have a little vacation. Honestly, you've seemed so burned-out and stressed about stuff lately. Stay here tonight, hang out with me... we can give each other makeovers and have an old-fashioned, girls only sleepover. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for a guy! Even though you... uh... technically aren't a guy anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy laughed good-naturedly and that cinched the deal for Roy. He'd always been a sucker for her pretty, happy laughter and her sparkling, cheerful smile.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Originally written by Missingenuous)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nagging doubt crossed Roy's mind for a moment as he marched back to Ashley's room. He hesitated for a second before deciding to reach into Ashley's dresser to find the aforementioned \"PJ's\" that Stacy wanted him to wear. Of course, when he thought that his chances of staying with Stacy overnight were over after the last incident, Roy opened the drawer to see what he could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBras, panties, stockings, lingerie of all types met his eyes. A quick dread of being a pervert crossed his mind, but then he reminded himself that technically, these were all his at the moment. Roy searched the dresser high and low, but it seemed like most of the things in there were either workout clothes, which wouldn't count, or lingerie that would make any average boy blush. As he pulled out one number that more closely resembled dental floss than underwear, he felt himself do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't this girl have any sense of moderation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick knock came at the door breaking Roy's concentration. \"Are you finding everything all right in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, just a minute, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy finally settled on the most modest thing he could find that even resembled a nightgown. He couldn't have told anyone what it was accurately. To him, it was a short, light blue, kind of dress that was see-through for the most part with the exception of a few rows of lace that crisscrossed his bust. That's when Roy finally noticed that, although it was quite small, and barely amounted to anything, he did indeed have a bust. Two tiny globes sat on his chest where they really shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good grief... I don't know whether I'm happy that these breasts are virtually non-existent or that I'm mad that apparently the Role Swapper is just too lazy to do more than just barely enough for me to fill the role I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy noticed that the \"nightgown\" just barely covered his new privates, and even then, he we need to wear some sort of underwear underneath it other than the red ones that Ashley had originally been wearing. Not far from where the nightgown had been stored, he found what had to be a matching set of panties; if you could call them that. Besides two triangular patches that covered his nether-regions on the front and back, there were only two small string on opposite sides of the underwear to hold those patches together. This was definitely a skimpy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wandered over to Ashley's full length mirror in the corner of her room. He was shocked to see what the few changes that the Role Swapper did do to him, had a huge overall impact making him look a LOT more like a girl than a guy. Only his face really gave it away that he wasn't supposed to be this way. Closing his eyes tightly, Roy tried to imagine what the real Ashley would have looked like in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn usual feeling stirred in the pit of his gut, and he felt warm in places that he knew by all rights that he shouldn't have. Roy opened his eyes before his thoughts became any weirder than they already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Here's the moment of truth...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Originally written by Missingenuous)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Roy! Look at what you did to yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at this point, Roy was at his wit's end. Here he was, now the sister of his crush thanks to the Role Swapper. Robbed of his manhood. Dressed in possibly the shortest nightgown possible thanks to Stacy's demands, and she's giving him crap about it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the most decent nightgown she had. Everything looked like it belonged in a Frederick's of Hollywood catalog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Which dresser did you look in? The one next to her mirror or the one in her closet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, there's more than one dresser? Hold on, I'm going to go get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roy could turn around, Stacy threw her arms around him in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay just like that missy. It'll be okay. Besides, you're actually kind of cute dressed like that. Promise you won't change and I'll slip into something nice for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Stacy just offer to get half naked for him? Again, Roy had a bit of a short circuit. Now that he's for all intents and purposes, Stacy's sister, Ashley, he was getting to see more skin than he's pretty much gotten to see up to this point. Sure, at his age, he's been lucky enough to see a couple girl's naked in person. But, THIS was Stacy! That awkward feeling in the pit of his stomach came back, and he felt that same urge down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't just stand there in the hall Roy. Come on in. It'll only take a moment to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I stay out here or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You're my sister. There's absolutely nothing wrong with you seeing me change clothes. It's not like it happens everyday, but it's no big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sheepishly entered the room as Stacy turned to her closet while simultaneously tearing off the shirt she was wearing. Already this way too much for Roy. Curiosity started to get the better of him regardless of how much he tried to advert his eyes. It seemed like forever that Stacy stood there rummaging through her clothes for the right outfit; an eternity as Roy's last bit of chivalry started to burn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was apparent that Stacy had found the outfit she was looking for, she popped open her bra and tossed it aside like nothing. Roy nearly let out a short squeak as he was caught unaware by the act. At that point, he finally plopped unceremoniously on Stacy's bed and covered his eyes with both hands. Roy was dying from passing up this scene, but everything that had happened up to this moment had finally become too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy heard a soft giggle as obviously Stacy had finally noticed his struggles. There was a gentle tug on both of his hands as Stacy uncovered his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adorable Roy. Even now when everything is laid out on a platter for you, you try to be the perfect gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was stunned as he took in the sight before him. Stacy's nightgown was the perfect combination of blue and pink. It perfectly accented her curves in every single way possible. It took all of his might to try and not kiss her on the spot. Of course, it took a lot less might when he remembered how Stacy had always rebuffed his advances up to this point. It also didn't help to know that he was not at all anatomically suited to do half the stuff he wanted to do to her right now. Regardless, Roy just sat there for in the moment and took in the sight. He wanted to remember this forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... umm... we're both dressed now Stacy. What... uh... did you have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

My mom even thought so when she saw you. I'll bet if we looked at old family photos, we'd see your face on my sister's body in even single picture. So what would happen if we took some pictures of you like this right now... then looked at them later, once you're Roy again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I guess I don't know,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI suppose the pictures would change back to show Ashley's face after she and I swap back... I mean, wouldn't they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d said Stacy. \u201cBut I'm intrigued to find out! You brought this little gizmo over here because you wanted someone to help you experiment with it and figure out how it works. So that's what I'm doing. Let's try to document some proof that this swap happened. Then we'll see what happens to the proof after we switch you and Ashley back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay...\u201d Roy said hesitantly. \u201cI'm just... well... the thing is... Stacy, I still feel kinda embarrassed about this. I'm not sure I feel comfortable posing for pictures in your sister's underwear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, get over it you big baby!\u201d laughed Stacy good-naturedly. \u201cHow many times do I have to say it? YOU are Ashley right now. You're wearing your own underwear, missy. With the exception of you and I, everybody else in the universe firmly believes you are a seventeen-year old girl. Everyone else remembers you always having been Ashley. You're not just borrowing her clothes or something \u2013 you switched lives with her. That means everything that is Ashley is now you. So stop pouting, strike a pose, and let's take some pictures!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Go and sit over on the bed and let me grab my camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy slumped his shoulders in defeat as he made his way over to the bed. The words, \"Why did I agree to this?\" played in a continuous loop in his head as he plopped down onto Stacy's queen size bed. It was then that Roy saw Stacy bending over to reach into her camera bag. \"Right, THAT'S why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Roy. Before we start getting into the fun shots, we're going to take a couple survey shots. The whole point of this is to try and gauge just how much of you changed when we used the Role Swapper on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt drove Roy crazy at just how analytical Stacy could sound at times. He guessed her being a hardcore science major could explain a part of that. At that point, Stacy slowly and methodically documented Roy's condition. She took close-ups of his toes, his legs, his torso, not quite so close-ups of his more feminine body parts. Roy felt like quite a piece of meat after she had him stand up, turn around, open his mouth, and on and on it went. After what seemed like an hour (more like 20 minutes), Roy could tell Stacy had satisfactorily finished her photographic survey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Roy. Are you ready for what I found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply nodded and Stacy went into a detailed description of what she noticed. With only a few major exceptions, Roy's changes were more detailed than he thought. Although his voice and face remained largely what they originally were, most of the rest of him had become a version of Ashley's body. The most obvious features were his female genitals, his shaved legs, long hair, and painted nails. Less obvious were his small breasts (could they even be considered an A cup?), his just slightly feminine hips and butt, and the fact that he had a dental filling that Ashley had complained about having to get a few months prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So at this point, I'm far more Ashley than myself, physically that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about the sum of it, although I imagine from what I can tell, the only reason you changed so much with the swap is because you swapped with my sister. Had you swapped with another guy, there's really no reason physical changes should occur. The device only did what was necessary to make you my sister, and then stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hey... do you think the Role Swapper has a setting that controls the severity of the changes? Maybe what happened to me was just due to some default control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a really good question, Roy! You're really smart for a girl,\" she quipped as she stuck her tongue out at him playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Ha...\" Roy returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyways, now that the scientific part of the photo shoot is over, it's time to have some fun. Strike a pose, sis!\"</span></div></div>",

Show me what you can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took a deep breath and started trying to mimic a few poses that he could envision off the top of his head. Of course, being his first time doing anything like this, he was quite terrible at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Okay, you're just thinking too hard Roy. Clear your mind. Just do what comes naturally. If you feel like spreading out on the bed, spread out on the bed. If you want to gaze lovingly at me, gaze lovingly at me. Whatever comes to mind at each specific moment, just do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say gaze lovingly at me?\" The thought crossed through Roy's mind like mana from heaven. Instead of focusing on the models he had seen in the past, he started thinking about Stacy. How would he like to see her pose? Roy started to move gracefully from pose to pose, one moment laying out on the bed with his legs kicked up behind him, the next, letting the strap of his nightgown hang off one shoulder as he sat up and leaned in front of the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued in this manner for quite a while. The whole time he was posing for Stacy, Roy couldn't take his eyes off her. Why in the world could he never break through the \"friend\" barrier? If there was one thing that he had decided through the events of the day, he would use the Role Swapper to do whatever it takes to win Stacy's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was perfect! I have to hand it to you. At first, it seemed like there was a real disconnect, but by the time we were finished, there were some amazing shots in there. You're a natural!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so the one thing I'm a natural at is being a female model. Where did I set my man card? I need to turn it in to you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy laughed at his statement. \"Roy, I hate to break it to you, but you turned that in the moment you swapped with Ashley. But don't worry about it, you've been fantastic so far tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what she said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy narrowly ducked a pillow that came flying his way. Seeing an opportunity, he grabbed the very same pillow that Stacy had tried to assail him with, and lightly smacked her with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're on missy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a pillow of her own, Stacy swung mercilessly back at Roy and a good old fashioned pillow fight ensued. Back and forth, blows were exchanged while Roy and Stacy laughed at the ridiculousness of the fight. After about 5 minutes of fighting, they collapsed on the bed together in a heap. Breathing heavily from the exertion, they just laid there for a bit in an unexpected embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finally calmed down from the pillow fight, Roy opened his eyes to see Stacy gazing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how glad I am that you stayed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy couldn't hold back from blushing at her comment. His emotions were all in a jumble as he couldn't quite control how he felt right now. What he really needed was a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we had a photo shoot, and a pillow fight. The night's still young mam. What should we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Let's order some pizza and watch a movie or two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing with her idea, Roy looked up the number for the nearest pizza delivery place and gave it a call. He was a little weirded out at first when the guy who answered kept politely calling him mam with every other sentence. Of course, Roy returned the favor when he was asked what name the pizza would be under. The guy on the phone was quite puzzled at first when Roy used his name before remembering that he probably should use Ashley for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the phone call, Roy went into Stacy's living room where she had pulled out a blanket and was laying on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! It's colder down here than upstairs. Where can I get a blanket to wrap up in?\" Roy admittedly was a lot colder than he normally would be considering the fact that he was in a pretty skimpy nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well there are a couple in the hall closet over there. Of course, I was figuring we could just share one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy didn't have to repeat herself or try to coerce Roy into sharing a blanket with her at all. When he got over to the couch, it was obvious that Stacy wanted him to sit in a certain spot. He was a little nervous when he figured out that she wanted to snuggle with him. Seriously, the second I am back to being a proper guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had a hard time concentrating during the movie as Stacy cuddled him under the blanket. Well, cuddling is one way to describe it. It really varied from one minute to the other. There was a squeeze here, a squeeze there. One or twice she traced her fingernail across his skin. There was even a good couple of minutes that Roy was in heaven as Stacy absent-mindedly rubbed her hand up and down his shaved legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the doorbell rang that Roy came completely back to his senses. He gently got up from the couch as Stacy let him out from under the blanket. Roy grabbed the money that they had set aside for the pizza and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing in the world could have prepared Roy for the delivery man's reaction upon seeing what he thought was a scantily clad teenage girl answering the door. Realizing his faux pas, Roy concealed himself partially behind the door as he handed the delivery man the cash and took the pizza box from him. Closing the door, Roy turned around to see Stacy nearly bursting at the seams as she was trying not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny...\"</span></div></div>",

Not too long after they had finished eating a couple slices of pizza each, Stacy had dozed off during the film. After all was said and done, Stacy had ended up laying partially on top of him. Roy looked at her for a moment and she seemed blissfully asleep. If only this could happen to him more often. If only this could happen when he's not her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached for the remote to turn the TV off, Roy accidentally stirred Stacy from her slumber. \"You're really soft...\" Stacy murmured, very obviously half asleep. Roy was about to respond when Stacy slowly moved her arms around his neck and gave him a gentle peck on his lips. He was absolutely floored at this point. For Stacy's part, she just gave what sounded like a soft purr, and snuggled back up to him as she fell asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly crap!

At the same time, most of those outfits were ones he'd rather avoid this week if he had his way. Thinking about a couple things he saw in her dresser the night before, Roy quickly dug through it and found a black t-shirt from a dance camp Ashley had gone to and a pair of red sweatpants. \"This should do the trick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Roy started to slip off his nightie... ASHLEY'S nightie... he noticed that he could probably use a quick shower first. Smoothing the sheer pj's back into place, Roy stepped out into the hall and headed back to Stacy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacy, I'm going to pop into the shower real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, just don't get your hair wet. We'll have to spend a bit of time fixing it back up if you do. Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy popped out of her room for a moment with a clip in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around real quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his back to Stacy, Roy felt her take hold of his now shoulder-length hair and clip it up so that it was off his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go. Now get in the shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that comment, Roy felt Stacy deliver a quick pop to his bottom to get him moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of his current circumstance, Roy couldn't help but be happy about the amount of attention that Stacy had been showing him since he came over yesterday. Finally getting into the bathroom, Roy locked the door and started to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer nightie came off quickly enough, but Roy hesitated before dropping Ashley's panties. Up to this point, except for a brief moment when he changed outfits last night, this would be the first time that he'd have a good chance to see himself naked. Roy slid the underwear off his hips and turned to face the mirror. What he could see was vastly more female than male. Sure he still had his face, and he was rather boyish in his figure. Much to his distress, however, he was more obviously a boyish girl than a girlish boy at this point. His \"A\" cup breasts and the small slit between his legs were the biggest pieces of evidence for that argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Stacy would want him to not take too long in the shower, he turned on the water and only waited a few seconds for it adjust to the right temperature. Once in the shower, Roy did his best to ignore the changes that he had undergone the night before. He avoided getting his hair wet, and spent most of the time just trying to get himself appropriately clean. It was only when he brushed by his small feminine fold that he finally got distracted from the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took a long look at his new vagina. Between magazines and movies, he'd seen one plenty of times before. But here in the flesh, was a completely different story. Especially when it was HIS vagina. At first, Roy's investigation of his new anatomy was purely clinical. He leaned over carefully, to avoid getting his hair wet, and watched as he used his fingers to probe the mound of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new sensations that started to emanate from his vagina rocked him momentarily. \"Wow, that's something else.\" Not paying attention to what he was doing, he started to think about all of the attention that Stacy gave him last night. Why was she so affectionate this weekend when usually she's so careful not to send me the wrong signals every other day? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's mind wandered as he started to get a warm feeling in his gut. He kept thinking of what he wanted to do to Stacy if he could ever get her to go out with him. Roy's probing intensified and he felt something building inside him that he couldn't describe. It was so much different than anything he had ever experienced before. He knew instinctively that something was coming. The male in Roy wanted to stop, but part of him didn't care at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe precipice was there before him, and Roy knew he was about go over the edge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp knock rattled the door, and Roy came back to his senses, panting heavily in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash. Don't use up all the hot water. I thought you said it was going to be a quick shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sa... sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I mean, yes, I'm okay... I'm... getting out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tried his hardest to calm down between comments. He was almost there, and now his entire body was on edge. His first female orgasm... well almost. He had been interrupted right before it came. Even then, Roy was a bit shaky as he turned off the water and toweled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sufficiently drying off, Roy wrapped the towel around his waist and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy! Err, ASH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy pushed him back into the bathroom and closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't wrap your towel like that Roy. You're a girl! You can't just go running around topless in the house, even if it is just me and mom here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Stacy unwrapped the towel briefly exposing Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Roy. It's nothing I haven't seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's not fair. I should be able to see you naked if you're just going to strip me anytime you want.\" Roy was floored for a moment when he realized he said that out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... you're having a rough week. I could probably arrange that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy, the look on your face was PRICELESS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hopes of Stacy being serious were immediately crushed with that statement, and Roy pouted for a second at his situation. Stacy, meanwhile, wrapped the towel around Roy a second time; this time, though, it covered his chest as well as his crotch. Roy thought it made him look like he was wearing a dress, but tried not to focus on it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now go get your clothes on. I'll be out in a second. I might as well clean up too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy lingered for a moment thinking he might catch a glimpse of Stacy naked, but was shooed out of the room after it became obvious that he was lingering. He headed back to Ashley's room, and got dressed in the outfit he had selected.<br>\r\n(I rephrased the first option)</span></div></div>",

As far as he knew, he was sufficiently stuck as Stacy's sister for a week, but that didn't mean he couldn't take a bit to kick back once in a while. Stacy didn't mention there being any important plans for today, so as far as he was concerned, he could totally veg out if he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Roy heard Stacy leave the bathroom as she had finally finished showering. Maybe she'd agree to just take it easy on him today and not fill up their schedule too much. True they could always play with the Role Swapper some more, it was working just fine, but it was obvious that Stacy wanted him to stay as her sister while Ashley (thinking she was him) was stuck halfway across the country. Any playing with that device would be limited to experimenting on other people, and with his current predicament, he wasn't so sure how he felt about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened after a little bit more time had passed, and Stacy entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, dressing down a tad today Roy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't sure what you had in mind, so I went for comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, but at some point, you should try to see what it's like to wear some of the stuff we girls do while you have this chance. At least right now, no one is going to think any differently if you walk around in a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed knowing that he wasn't going to be able to escape this week without getting stuck in a skirt at some point. Still, it didn't have to be today. Stacy agreed that Roy had been through a lot and since there wasn't much of anything going on, they spent most of the day hanging around the house. Stacy mentioned she had a paper to write anyways, so she was going to need some time to herself regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, Roy finally started to get a bit restless. He had gotten himself keyed up a bit earlier during his shower and didn't do anything about it then. That plus a lack of distractions around him (there wasn't much on TV and Ashley's reading material wasn't exactly his normal fare) led him to get quite a bit antsy. He really wanted to get out of the house, but as far as he knew, Ashley didn't have a car, which meant that now HE didn't have a car anymore. He headed back over to Stacy's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacy, are you at a point where you can stop? I really feel like doing something right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I can be free in about 15 minutes. What did you have in mind?\"</span></div></div>",

That was a bit too much. Sure Roy had a bad case of cabin fever, but the whole point of being Ashley in the first place was to spend more time with Stacy.

For a second there, I was imagining how awful it was going to be if I had to go to the prom as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy just smiled evilly at Roy. \"Oh, you misunderstand. I was just joking about Ashley having a date. Her boyfriend broke up with her a couple weeks ago. I wasn't joking, however, about the rest of it. The prom IS this Friday, and you WILL be making an appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the emotional roller-coaster for Roy continued. Prom. His own prom had been an unmitigated disaster. Everything from trying to find a date, to the event itself were painful experiences for Roy. Now, he was going to have to go the prom again. This time, as a girl. Roy wanted to say, \"What else could go wrong,\" but he knew that as soon as he opened his mouth, that something else probably would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so I guess I'm going to the prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!

Digging through Ashley's closet, Roy settled on a pair of black flip flops before flopping himself back on the bed to finish waiting for Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly for Roy and nothing else of note happened until he and Stacy were about to walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget your purse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just one of those phrases that Roy had never expected to have tossed his way.

He knew that he was taking yet another step down the road to womanhood by participating in the timeless ritual of finding the perfect prom dress. Roy couldn't think of where to start looking first, so Stacy took the lead and led him into the nearest department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the Junior's department, Roy had a hard time taking in the fact that he was going to have to leave with one of these dresses. It didn't comfort him in the least to see that there were plenty of other girls (\"other\" girls?) who were here for the same reason. Roy's head almost started spinning as Stacy bombarded him with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a favorite color?\" \"Short or long?\" \"Strapless okay?\" \"How about a halter top?\" \"Do you like this bodice? What do you think of this fabric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through the selection for a while, Roy noticed Stacy had collected multiples of a couple dress designs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you grabbing duplicates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's just because we don't know your exact size yet. You're going to have to try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt his heart drop for a moment as he figured out that this wasn't going to be a quick and easy process. His only moment of excitement came when he walked into the dressing area and started noticing several girls cute girls around his age were in there with him. This was forbidden territory for sure, but all they noticed was another girl walking into a dressing room rather than a guy who was barely a girl biologically due to the Role Swapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying on each dress was a chore in and of itself. It wasn't so bad getting undressed and maneuvering the dress into position. It was having to hold it in place while walking out of the dressing room only to have Stacy zip him into it so he can model it in front of the three panel mirror. He then would have to get unzipped and once again walk gingerly back to the dressing room to change dresses. This was a tedious unnecessary process to Roy, but he was stuck, plain and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling on which dress he liked the most, Roy was stunned when Stacy took it up to the cashier only to ask her to put it on hold for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Putting the dress on hold for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just buy it and leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy! You can't just settle on the first dress you find. We're going to go to another store and see if you can't do better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy screamed on the inside. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of trying on prom dresses, he found himself finally purchasing a dress. Stacy applauded him on a hard day's work and gave him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to look great Roy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy could feel himself blush momentarily as he was once again getting a larger amount of affection from Stacy than he was used to getting. The cashier finished ringing up the sale and handed Roy his prom dress inside a protective bag. He was still stunned that he had his very own prom dress now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was something he would have loved to have seen on any other girl. It was burgundy with a beaded, lace up bodice. Its skirt was actually rather short, but even though he had wanted to wear something a little longer, Roy ended up deciding to go with this one after he tripped over another dress's hem earlier. He couldn't help but wonder how good Stacy would've looked in the dress instead of himself. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.landy-bridal.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/P/R/PR2612a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.landy-bridal.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a prom dress in hand, Roy and Stacy took a moment to eat at the food court before doing anything else. Roy suggested they do something fun like catch a movie, but Stacy shot down his idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done here at the mall yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But we just finished buying my prom dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely correct.

He chuckled out how easily he was assembling the outfit, must be Ashley's role making it easier to blend in. He then took some tan sandals and his outfit was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was a bit proud for doing all by himself and decided to show Stacy. \"How do I look? I'm following your suggestion and I'm hanging out with Megan at the mall today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looked up to see him in the outfit with a small smile coming across her face, \"Nice, you look good, 'Ash'. It's probably for the best anyway since I am going to be busy all day with this paper. Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you enjoy working on that report.\" Roy said a little sarcastically. Roy collected Ashley's purse and waited for about half an hour for Megan to arrive. Megan mirrored Stacy's reaction except with a little more girly enthusiasm and they proceeded to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there, the first thing they did was...</span></div></div>",

She had expected to see her sister Ashley standing there, or at least Roy if the swap had failed.  But instead there was a boy she'd never seen before.  He had dirty blonde hair and was dressed like a normal guy.  Stacy had never seen him before, but something about his face looked strangely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, sis?  What the hell am I doing in your room all of a sudden?\"  The boy asked.  He definitely looked younger than Roy, maybe about Ashley's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy squinted her eyes at him, \"Uh... sorry what?  Sis?  Who are you exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed, \"Not this again, pretending to have amnesia?  I'm your brother Alex, duh, I shouldn't have to tell you that.  If you're trying to get out of your chores by pretending to lose your memory, Mom isn't going to believe you this time, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...?  Shit... Uhh, bro?  Wait here ok?\"  Stacy told him as she hurried with the remote towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm going back to my room...\"  Alex muttered as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacy practically sprinted into the living room, she saw the front door open, and a tall brunette girl just about to head out the door.  <i>I hope this isn't who I think it is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy wait!  Something went wrong with the remote!\"  Stacy called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette took a second to react, but finally stopped in her tracks, turning around.  \"Huh?  Who's Roy?  You ok Stace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy's fears were confirmed.  The cute brunette standing there definitely had a resemblance to Roy, but she was undoubtedly female.  Perhaps what Roy would have looked like had he been born a girl.  She was a little shorter than Roy used to be, but still taller than Stacy, and she had Roy's same color brown hair, but long and straightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... not you too.  Look we gotta swap you back, you're all mixed up now!\"  Stacy blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was interrupted by her mother who overheard her, \"STACY!  What have I told you about using that language in the house?!  First you sneak your friend Rachel into the house without asking, and now this?  It's a good thing she was just leaving, right?  I have to go to work and I don't want you two having the house to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis 'Rachel' shrugged, \"It's ok Stace, don't worry.  Everything's back to normal anyways, we can hang out tomorrow, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah ok, tomorrow, here let me show you out.\" Stacy nervously looked at her mom and decided to head outside with 'Rachel' to speak to her in private with the house door closed.  \"Back to normal?  No way, so you still know about the remote?  Things are definitely not normal, you're a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stared blankly at her, \"Uhh, am I not supposed to be?  This seems pretty normal to me.\"  She said as she cupped a rather full breast right in front of Stacy, without even batting an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!  You were supposed to be a guy!  I screwed everything up!\"  Stacy stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Stace, nothing's screwed up.  And if this is your way of saying you like guys...\"  Rachel leaned forward and surprised Stacy with a brief kiss on the lips.  \"I uh... I'm sorry that was stupid of me, I gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was blushing furiously, and quickly darted down the street towards her car.  She drove away while Stacy was still standing there in shock with the remote in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened...?\"  Stacy mumbled to herself, looking at the remote.</span></div></div>",

Scrolling through her pictures, she saw the same pictures she had taken back in her freshman year of high school with Jason Pryde, her first boyfriend. But there were also pictures of her with Katherine Todd. Katherine was a nice girl, but she was a lesbian. And it looked like, to be modest, Stacey had been spending a lot more time with her in this version of history. For some reason, when Looking at a picture on her bedside table, she saw a picture of her sister turned brother hugging her.

I </i>refuse <i>to live in a world where I'm shorter than my little sib</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey checked her phone. Luckily, \"Rachel\" Harper was in her contact list, just like Roy had been.

When you and Alex traded back lives, it swapped you genders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe so-called Rachel giggled. Giggling wasn't good. \"We went over that already, girl. Listen, I'm sorry I freaked you out. If you want to talk about the kiss, let's be adults and talk about the kiss.\" \"You're not listening. Listen, if you switched me and my dad and we weren't aware, I'd think I was a man, right?\" \"Sounds right.\" \"And if you tried to convince me I was a girl?\" \"You would think that you were-ooohhhh. I see. That's freaky to think about.\" \"But you get it, right?\" \"I need you to tell me exactly what you remember.\" \"Okay. so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And that's when I decided to call you.\" \"That's a hell of a story. I believe you. But why would it have changed our genders in the swap back? The memory thing makes sense, but that's inconsistent with everything we know about the device.\" \"It was brought to you from an alternate version of yourself from an alien universe! We'll need lot's more experimenting before we know <i>anything</i> about the device.\" \"Fair.\" \"Okay, I'll try to meet up with you.

But it was time for Ashley- er, 'Roy'- to leave, and I couldn't let her suspect this thing was anything special. Don't worry, though. I don't want to lose track of Ashley any more than you do, and we'll get her back. It'll have to wait, though. Your father will be home soon, and I do have to get supper started.\"<br>\r\nStacy was now even more confused. What was going on? Then she realized what had happened. Ashley didn't know about the device, even though she thought she was Roy; similarly, Roy did still know about it, even though he thought he was Mom. Not only that, but he still remembered that he and Stacy had used the device to swap Ashley and Roy! It's just that he thought Linda had been in Roy's role at the time of the swap, not himself. Well, Stacy thought, that would certainly make things easier to fix if she could talk about the device with 'Mom.' She wondered if she should try to explain what had happened, or if she should just play along until she got her chance.</span></div></div>",

He instantly realized he had messed up, but wanted to check to see what the result of his error was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy rushed back into the kitchen to see just what had happened to Sarah.  He was shocked to see she was no longer wearing Jack's dirty old clothes, and looking like she hadn't showered in weeks.

Her skin even seemed paler, and more porcelain-like, lacking any blemishes. Her clothes weren't super feminine, still resembling Jack's old clothing.  However, her T-shirt was now bright white instead of grey and was cut to fit her female body very snugly.  Her jeans, which used to have holes in the legs, were now spotless and looked brand new, even lacking any artificial 'stone washed' look.  Overall, she just looked very very clean and pristine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack seemed largely unaffected.

After all, he was still a Burger Bonanza employee, and life as one Burger Bonanza employee wasn't much different than life as another. Roy had to remember to respond to Jessica's name instead of his own, but that was about it. He spent five hours flipping burgers and assembling sandwiches, frying potatoes and mixing salads, and at the end of the shift, he didn't any particular insight about Jessica or what it meant to live as a woman. All he really learned was that thong underwear was really uncomfortable, brastraps pinched, and Malcolm Schmidt, the pimply sixteen-year-old who'd started a week ago, was completely incapable of speaking to a pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the strangest part of the day was seeing Jessica run around pretending to be him. Jessica, as Roy, was working the counter, while Roy, as Jessica, had been assigned to work in the kitchen, which means the two of them weren't interacting directly most of the time. But Roy could see Jessica, and he could hear her from here... and seeing her act and speak like a man, seeing her beautiful hair cut short like a man's... it wasn't exactly a turn-on. Roy still found her incredibly attractive to look at... but it was disconcerting to hear her and to watch her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hot on Milford?\" said Meredith, a middle-aged woman who usually worked the drive-through, as she passed Roy at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Roy said, a little startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy,\" Meredith said. \"I keep catching you staring at him. You got a thing for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, no,\" Roy said, blushing. He felt completely flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrrre,\" Meredith said, and laughed as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tried not to look at Jessica after that. But he could still hear her, speaking with flat, masculine inflections, and it was bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica's five-hour shift was over, Roy gratefully stopped by the locker where he'd stashed Jessica's purse and clothing and ran to the women's room. Ducking into a stall again, he quickly changed out of the Burger Bonanza uniform and into Jessica's street clothes. The jeans took a little effort to squeeze into, but otherwise, Roy didn't have much trouble with the clothing... though he was sure it would be a different story when he had to wrestle with her bra later on. At last, flashing a smile at Jessica's sexy reflection, he left the restroom and headed out to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had watched Jessica cross the parking lot enough times to know which car was hers: she drove the aging red sedan which was currently parked behind the dumpster. It was the perfect car for a Burger Bonanza employee, especially one who was still in high school: boxy, practical, and spotted with rust. Taking Jessica's keys from her purse, Roy jumped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath. He was alone, finally, and free to explore Jessica's life. He'd been itching to get to the end of Jessica's shift; few five-hour shifts had felt as obnoxiously long as his had today. Reaching up, Roy folded down the visor mirror and stared in wonder at Jessica's reflection. \"Hi, sexy,\" he said, and watched in amazement as Jessica's lips mirrored his words. He tried to imitate Jessica's smile... the broad, sweet, cheerful smile that had enchanted Roy for two years now. His heart fluttered as he watched Jessica's reflection grin. \"I can't believe it,\" he whispered as he stared in worshipful awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the mirror, Roy buckled his seat belt. He moved the seat back a little bit and adjusted the rear and side mirrors... it took a lot of adjusting, as Roy was almost a full foot taller than Jessica. Once he was satisfied, he put the keys in the ignition and started up Jessica's car. As he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street, Roy smiled in anticipation. He had a whole life to explore.</span></div></div>",

Roy supposed he would have to figure all that stuff out by himself. Pulling over to the side of the road, he fished through Jessica's purse until he found her driver's license. Thank you, DMV. He looked over the address... he had a sort of idea where this was. Satisfied, Roy replaced the license and continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Roy some time to find his way to Jessica's house, but at last, he pulled into the driveway of her pleasant suburban two-story home. He turned off the car and began to get out... then he caught himself and reached back in for Jessica's purse. It would take him a while to get used to keeping track of this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tried the front door... when it didn't open, he tried the keys on Jessica's keychain until one of them fit the lock. He turned the key and the door opened, and he stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, loser,\" a male voice said as Roy closed the door behind him. Roy looked around and spotted a teenage boy, maybe fifteen or sixteen, sitting on the living room couch with a game controller in his hand. This must have been Jessica's brother Steven... Roy had heard Jessica talk about him, and he knew they didn't get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Steven,\" Roy said. He looked around the house to get his bearings... he was standing in a foyer that opened onto the living room on one side and a dining room on the other. There was a stairway directly in front of him. Roy guessed Jessica's room was up there, so he started up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, woah,\" Steven said. \"You know we aren't supposed to wear shoes in the house. I'll tell Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed and took off Jessica's shoes, placing them in a pile of shoes next to the door. He was so glad he didn't live with his family anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the stairs, Roy saw an intimidating number of doors down the upstairs hallway. Which one of these belonged to Jessica? No way to find out except to try them all, Roy supposed, so he opened the first door down the hall. The room on the other side was dark and gloomy, messy and covered in comic books and a teenage boy's clothes... obviously Steven's room. Roy shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next door was open already. Roy saw a girl inside, maybe eight years old, playing with a set of Barbie dolls. This must have been Jessica's sister Maggie. Maggie looked up and smiled. \"Hi, Jessi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Maggie,\" Roy said, smiling. At least the whole family wasn't antagonistic to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next door was the bathroom, but Roy finally got lucky with the door after that. Jessica's room was bright and open, decorated in pink and scattered with sunlight. It was almost as much of a mess as Steven's room, but it was clearly a teenage girl's mess, with magazines on the bed and girl's clothes scattered on the floor. It wasn't super-girly, which made sense; Jessica wasn't a super-girly kind of girl. The walls were decorated with posters of female actresses and musicians, and the dresser had pictures of Jessica with her friends. There was a small vanity with a ton of makeup on it... Jessica's stash, Roy supposed, which she used liberally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sat down on the bed. So here he was, in the very heart of his crush's world. Since he was Jessica now, he had free reign to explore her room so he could learn more about her. And, he realized as he caught sight of Jessica's reflection in the vanity mirror, he had free reign to explore her body now as well. So what should he do first?</span></div></div>",

He wanted to know more about Jessica... that was why he was here, after all. It was tempting to spend a few minutes--or hours--in front of the mirror, but the thought of it frankly felt a little creepy. Roy wanted to see Jessica with her clothes off, sure, but he wanted to see it with Jessica inside her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and besides, there was plenty of time to gawk at Jessica's body later if he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked around the room, trying to decide where to begin. He settled on his first target quickly: if teenage girls were anything like teenage boys, the best place to look to find out about their fantasies was to look at the stuff they hid from their parents. So, getting down off the bed, Roy knelt down and began to feel around under the bed. He hit paydirt fast; his hand brushed over a shoebox. Pulling the shoebox out, Roy saw it was filled with a stack of magazines. What kind of magazines were they?</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure what he'd expected to find, but it certainly wasn't this. He took out the magazine on the top of the stack... it was an issue of Playboy! He flipped through the magazine with a thumb painted with sparkly purple nail polish and saw page after page of naked women. Why on earth would Jessica have this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the next magazine in the stack... it was an issue of Hustler. Then one of Big Boobs Monthly. Magazine after magazine of straight male porn... Roy was stunned. He couldn't imagine why a teenage girl would have this kind of stuff... had Steven stashed it here for some reason?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToward the middle of the stack, Roy found a magazine that, at last, shed some light on why these magazines were here. This one wasn't a porn magazine... it was an issue of a magazine called \"Lesbian Times\", with a picture of two women kissing on the cover. The magazine looked pretty respectable... it was a serious magazine about lesbian issues, not a cheap porn magazine like the other issues. Roy took a deep breath as realization sunk in. Jessica must have been a lesbian...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was shocked. He'd had no idea. Jessica had never let on at work that she might be lesbian... she talked about boys all the time, and she'd even dated a few in the two years that she'd worked at the Burger Bonanza. Though, Roy realized, it had been a while since she'd had a boyfriend... something that had given Roy hope that he might win her over. Perhaps she had just come to terms with her sexuality recently? She wasn't out as a lesbian at work... was she out to her family? Her friends? Or was Roy the only person in the world who knew this about Jessica? In any case, Roy felt his heart sink as he realized that, as a guy, he had officially no chance with Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr... did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jessica really was a lesbian, she would never be interested in Roy as Roy. But... what if Roy wasn't Roy? What if he was a girl? What if he spent some time figuring out what kind of girl Jessica was interested in, and then used the remote to switch lives with her dream girl? Roy wasn't sure he was comfortable being a girl... but he'd been dreaming about Jessica for years. And after alll, he'd survived close to six hours as Jessica so far. Maybe it was worth becoming a girl part-time, or even full-time, if it meant he got to be with the girl of his dreams...</span></div></div>",

He had been fantasizing about being Jessica for too long to give up on her now. He'd never had a chance with Jessica as himself, so he'd tried to keep his feelings for her in check, but... Roy had to admit it. He loved Jessica. She was sweet, smart, funny, and absolutely beautiful. Roy had never felt the same way about anyone else as he felt about Jessica. He couldn't pass up the chance for a relationship with her... even if it meant becoming female. Being a girl would be strange, but... it couldn't be that much different than being a guy, could it? Having been a girl for a few hours now, he hadn't seen any overwhelming differences between life as a girl and life as a guy. And it wasn't like people would see him crossdressing, right? They would see him as a girl, and so it would be natural for him to dress like a girl, act like a girl, pretend to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a little troubled at the thought of leaving his life behind, but... well... his life wasn't really working out for him, was it? If he switched lives with a girl Jessica's age, it would give him a second chance to make something of his life... or, at least, his new life. Jessica was eighteen... as an eighteen-year-old girl, Roy would be five years younger, and with the knowledge of the mistakes he'd made, Roy could make sure he didn't make them again. And he'd have a chance to relive college... Roy had loved college. It had certainly been better than life in the \"real world\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Roy reasoned, as he took the device out of Jessica's purse... as long as he had this device, he could always switch back to his own life. He could spend his days as Roy and then spend his nights with Jessica as a girl. Or something like that. He could work out the details later. In any case, if being a girl full-time was too weird... well, it didn't have to be full-time if he didn't want, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Roy had a goal: he was going to become Jessica's dream girl. But first he had to find out what kind of girl that was. Looking through porn magazines wasn't going to tell him that; he had to find a way to get inside Jessica's head. Maybe Jessica kept a diary? Or maybe Roy could scour Jessica's computer for information... maybe there was something in her e-mail or browser history, or some files she'd downloaded, that would offer Roy some clues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should he start?</span></div></div>",

That was where she would record her most private thoughts, and so, presumably, that was where she would talk about her sexuality, her feelings about women, and the kind of woman she was attracted to. Roy had a younger sister, so he knew a little bit about girls and their diaries. And one thing he knew was that, if Jessica had a diary, she would keep it hidden. So, he would just have to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Roy checked under the bed again, but he didn't find anything else there except for a dirty t-shirt and a couple of socks. Then he checked beneath her pillows... it wasn't there. He tried the drawer in Jessica's bedside table... there were a couple of cheap romance novels there, and a copy of one of the Twilight books, as well as half a dozen pens in various colors, but there wasn't a diary. He continued to go around Jessica's room, looking for likely hiding spots, but without much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Roy's eyes fell on the dresser. He remembered a female friend from college mentioning that, when her little brother used to steal her diary, she started hiding it in her underwear door, with the assumption that her brother would be too grossed out by the thought of his sister's underwear to look there. It was a definite possibility... but was it right for Roy to look through Jessica's underwear? It felt a little sleazy. But, on the other hand, he was Jessica now, so it was technically his underwear drawer now, right? And after all, he was already wearing one of Jessica's thongs... Roy decided to go for it. He opened the top drawer in the dresser and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawer was filled with bras and panties in a wide variety of colors. Pink, yellow, red, green, black, white, and a number of patterns. The fabrics looked relatively simple; some of it was silky, but none of it was lacy; most of it just looked like plain cotton. There were a lot of thongs like the one Roy was wearing, but there were also some more modest pieces as well... thank goodness, Roy thought. If he was going to spend much longer in Jessica's life, he wanted to wear some more comfortable underwear. Roy hesitated, then reached into the drawer, feeling around... and then his hand hit something solid and rectangular. He pulled it out and smiled and he saw it was a small lavendar book with a floral pattern around the edges, with the words \"My Diary\" in elegant script on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sat down on Jessica's bed and opened the diary. For a moment he hesitated... should he really intrude on Jessica's privacy like this?</span></div></div>",

It was a little bit of an intrusion, sure, but it was the only way Roy could find out more about Jessica and the kind of woman she was attracted to. And if it meant he could become Jessica's dream girl and start up a relationship with her--if it meant he could make Jessica happy by courting her and loving her and giving her the girlfriend she wanted--wasn't it worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy started reading the diary from the back, with the assumption that the most recent entries would tell him the most about what was going on in Jessica's head right now. The first few entries he read--which were written with attractive penmanship and in a variety of colors--were relatively uninteresting. In them, Jessica complained about her job at the Burger Bonanza, fretted about her upcoming physics test, and talked about her brother, who sounded even more annoying than Roy had realized. Roy read the Burger Bonanza entries especially closely, hoping to find some reference to himself, but Jessica never mentioned him, which he found a little disappointing. Though perhaps that was for the best... he didn't want to find out that Jessica hated him or something, did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, in an entry dated about a week and a half ago, Roy found an entry that interested him. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so lonely sometimes. I have this huge secret, but I don't know if I can tell anyone about it. I wish I could come out to my family and friends, but I don't know how they would respond. No, scratch that... I know how my parents would respond. I've heard them complaining about gay people for years... they believe that gay people are all perverts and sinners who are going to burn in hell. I don't know if Steven feels that way too, but he doesn't really have any reason to side with me, not the way we get along. And my friends all make fun of gay people; they would freak out if they found out I was gay. Monique is the only person who knows I'm a lesbian. And she's great about it... since her brother is gay, she's very sympathetic. But I need someone else I can talk to... it's so hard to hide my feelings from the whole world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed as he read the entry... he felt sorry for Jessica. He'd had no idea how much turmoil she felt... she'd always seemed so carefree. He had a lead, though... apparently this friend of Jessica's, Monique, knew Jessica was a lesbian. Roy quickly formed a plan... he would get together with Monique, then switch with her. As Monique, he could ask Jessica--or, rather, Monique as Jessica--what kind of girl she was into. Then he could track down a girl who fit Jessica's description and start pursuing Jessica. It seemed like a perfect plan, although it might take a little careful acting on his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he should keep reading the diary first, though. It had already paid off... maybe he could find something else in the diary that would be useful.</span></div></div>",

Better to take a more direct approach and ask Jessica about her feelings as Monique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tucked the diary back in Jessica's underwear drawer, then picked up her purse. Taking out a shiny pink cell phone, he flipped it open and began looking through the phone's menu. After a couple of minutes, he found the address book and pulled up the name \"Monique\". He called Monique's number. The phone rang a couple of times, and then a girl's voice said, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Monique,\" Roy said, \"it's Jessica.\" He was surprised how easily that had fallen off his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl,\" Monique said, \"what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we should get together today,\" he said. \"I kind of want to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Monique asked, a note of concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Roy said, \"I just want to talk about... um... you know... my... feelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh,\" Monique said. \"Sure, sweetie, let's hook up.

It had little decorative rose petals painted across it and stood on a decorative pedestal that resembled a pillar from a Roman temple. The faucet itself was sparkling, gleaming chrome metal \u2013 and was also thin, delicate, and feminine looking. Above the sink was perfectly clean mirror, oval-shaped and bordered with a thin, gold frame etched with an intricate design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, Roy turned and looked back to the kitchen door waiting for the new Jessica Draper to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally passed through the door, Roy discovered that Jessica had become...</span></div></div>",

And it can...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d cried Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the truth is  I am you.

It switched us around. You're the real Miranda and I'm Roy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda shot Roy a look of disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow else would I know all of this?\u201d said Roy. \u201cJust look at us I'm a guy... and you're a girl! I know you think you're really Roy Milford and I'm Miranda Milford. But look at us: you have breasts and I don't. Yet, I'm the one wearing a bra... doesn't that seem weird to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh think again!\" said Miranda. \"I believe your story, I really do.  There is no way you could know about this little gizmo otherwise, but I have to tell you Miranda when I look at you I see someone 100% female. You look exactly like Miranda from where I'm standing, and I sure don't see breasts on me when I look down.  That part of your story is still pretty unbelievable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, crazy or not, it isn't what I see!\" protested Roy. He gestured at his flat chest, still wearing Miranda's clothes. \"I don't see any breasts here at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down,\" said Miranda. \"Like I said, I believe you. Somehow, this device got used on you... and probably on me as well. I don't remember it happening, but it's the only logical explanation for you being all hysterical.  You think I have your body and you have mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" sighed Roy. \"You're still not getting it. I am Roy, but I'm standing here wearing Miranda's clothes. And you're Miranda, but you're standing there wearing my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go look in the mirror,\" suggested Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked each one of the mirrors in the car and was shocked at the sight of Miranda staring back at him in each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you see?\" Roy asked with hushed awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda leaned towards Roy and peeked in the mirror. Roy caught a glimpse of his own male reflection in the mirror as she went towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Miranda. \"That's us -- looking 100% normal. That isn't how you see reality, Miranda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" sighed Roy glumly. \"And I keep telling you, I'm not Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirror suggests otherwise,\" laughed Miranda. \"But hey, don't get all upset. Like I said: I believe your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'll switch back with me?\" Roy asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance!\" laughed Miranda again. \"I was perfectly happy being Miranda but the last thing we should do is to switch places again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then what are we supposed to do?\" cried Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" said Miranda. \"The way I see it, we have three options. First, you can accept your new opportunity to restart and live the life of our sister Miranda Milford. I know it seems weird to you... but everyone sees you as Miranda already and you'd have the chance that we had dreamed of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my other two choices?\" sighed Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can use our little remote to try and switch us back, although I'm unsure of how easy it will be to get Miranda back.  With us switching the remote could simply change us back, or we might run the risk of losing Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could also use the remote to switch you into somebody else's life,\" said Miranda. \"I may not be the original Roy Milford, but it's who I am now. All my memories are of always being Roy. I'm not that eager to become a girl again so soon, much less 'little miss perfect'.  If you'd like we could explore using the remote for a while, and then maybe I'll consider going back to being Miranda.\"</span></div></div>",

I was a bit late this morning, I forgot something at my parents house.\" Roy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy went and chatted a bit more with Jessica before heading back into the kitchen.  After a while it was Roy's turn to watch the counter, as Roy was eager to try out some swaps to entertain himself while at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too crowded today but Roy still saw a few opportunities.  There were what looked to be boyfriend and a girlfriend, a Mother and her 10 year old son who were just walking in the door, as well as Jessica's brother and sister.  Roy started by targeting the mother and son with the remote.  In an instant the mother showed signs of her son's energy, whilst her son became more calm and acted more mature for his age.  The mother quickly came up to the counter and started to order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two Fish fillets and one cheeseburger please.\" The mom eagerly told Roy, jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother you can have only one.  You wanted to go on a diet, remember?\" The son said to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Please Please can I have an extra one? Just one!\" The mother asked her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you are going to beg, now pay the nice girl!\" Her son replied, as the mother handed Roy the money.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then looked towards the boyfriend and girlfriend.  He aimed the device at the boyfriend and then again, this time at the drink the girlfriend had ordered.  Roy wondered what would happen.  As far as he could tell the drink didn't look any different, still had the same Burger Bonanza logo on it and everything.  As she was drinking her soda, she seemed to stop every so often and take out her compact mirror, smiling whenever she did, almost like she was checking herself out each time.  When it was all done, she ran right passed Roy and towards the ladies room.  Roy finally had his eye on Jessica's brother and sister pair when Jessica came out in front.  Roy swaps the brother and sister, however nothing seemed to visibly change.  Roy thought that it might just be because they shared similar interests and waited for Jessica to stop talking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nah that'd be too much for right now...\"  Roy went up to his room to figure out an idea of what to do.  Looking out the window, Roy saw his friend Rebecca with whom he was friends with for years.  It was one of his few friends that he keeps in contact with constantly.  Now Roy just needed to figure out what to try it on, looking around his room he found his Wireless Xbox controller on his desk. Roy wondered what would happen if he went and used that in the swap. He took the controller with him towards the window, he used the remote setting the first target as his controller.  Roy saw Rebecca starting to head back inside her house, he quickly aimed at Rebecca and set her as the secondary target.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were no immediate effects on Rebecca, however the controller seemed to be entirely different.  Instead of an Xbox button there was a small picture of Rebecca and the color of the controller changed to Rebecca's favorite color. Roy was curious and started to turn on the controller, as it was powering on Rebecca was just about to head back inside when she seemed to just stop in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter waiting for half a minute Roy went and moved the joysticks on the controller.  Rebecca then appeared to match the movements that Roy was making.  Roy went and used the controller to have Rebecca come over for further tests.  As Roy was heading down to meet Rebecca, Roy's mom was heading out the door to drop off Billy at his school and then head to work.  Just like that Rebecca and Roy were home alone, Roy then had a stroke of genius.  He left Rebecca near the front door and raced back up to his room.  He brought back down a headset that plugged into the controller.  He then started talking into it and smiled when hearing Rebecca repeat the same words.  Although Roy marveled at the fact that he now had a \"Rebecca controller\", he wondered what would happen if he turned off his controller.  Would she remember anything? Would she believe it was all a dream?  Looking through his living room window, Roy went and guided Rebecca back to her house. He turned off his wireless controller and left it in the living room before going over to check on Rebecca.</span></div></div>",

Roy went back to his parent's house and saw the painting changed to a single Miranda.

Roy and his mom talked for a bit in the kitchen watching some television, while Roy was busy making lunch for later.  They both saw Billy outside in the backyard getting some volleyball practice done.  Once his mom's favorite show was over, she went to call Billy in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda Billy Milford, that's enough exercise, now come inside and wash up.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly came inside and said hi to Roy and immediately ran up to take a shower.

Miranda was bored out of her mind as she went straight to the television and occasionally talked to Roy.  Roy learned that in this reality, instead of just being a family of Miranda clones, the family now seems to be focused around Miranda.  The three siblings try to play a game of sorts where they each take turns trying to be a single \"Miranda Milford\" at school for fun.  Miranda usually handles the brainy things, Billy handles sports, with Roy doing a balance of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Billy, where is he? he should be heading to school now my off period is almost over.\"  Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than after saying that did Billy come down the stairs in Miranda's gym clothes and carrying her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun at Gym!\" Miranda and Roy said, as Billy headed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy decided to go explore whatever new reality this was for now, seeing as trying to switch back only made things worse.</span></div></div>",

Very funny Miranda.What are you on about?\" Roy asked 'Miranda'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'll prove to you I'm Roy. You secretly envy your roommate for having a girlfriend  and a better job.

Strangely enough, though, Roy found he was still in the driver's seat of his car, and was still looking at a handkerchief on the ground, but something definitely felt off. On closer inspection, he noticed the handkerchief looked a lot more plain, showing signs of age and use, and the initials had changed to \"RM\", Roy's own initials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point when Roy noticed the blonde hair falling into his peripheral vision. Not only was Roy's hair not blonde, it wasn't long enough to fall into view. Quickly diverting his attention away from the napkin and towards his own body, Roy's suspicions were confirmed; the swap had given him his sister's body, although still wearing his Burger Bonanza uniform, while his own body had become the handkerchief. Perhaps this was some sort of fail safe to prevent the user from trapping themselves inside the role of an inanimate object, or perhaps this was just how this particular swap would work, but it was surprising nonetheless. Roy knew the remote would be able to swap life roles, allowing him to become different people, but he hadn't expected to actually end up with someone else's body, let alone that of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy squirmed a little uncomfortably as he looked at his face in the rear view mirror of his car. Going from an adult man to a teenage woman was a jarring transition, to say the least. Although, given what his alternate reality self had told him, everyone would probably think this was normal. He looked down at the remote, and the handkerchief, pondering what to do now. Perhaps he should swap back. He wasn't exactly comfortable in his sister's body, after all. Then again, so long as he didn't lose track of the handkerchief, he'd be able to swap back into his own body any time he wanted, so why rush?</span></div></div>",

After all, he was still physically male. Although he now wore the strange girl's bra, he had nothing on his chest to fill out the cups. However, as Roy inspected himself he realized reality must have been altered to make all this somehow seem \u201cnormal\u201d to the world. No one coming and going through the busy parking lot was gawking or staring at him. And then there was the fact that his hair had magically grown-out into a ponytail \u2013 that hardly could've happened overnight. Come to think of it, Roy now noticed his legs had been shaved smooth. And his ears were now pierced and sported some tiny studs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, reality had been changed so that Roy now occupied the role formerly held by this teenage girl... and she now occupied her life. Their bodies had changed minimally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that he wasn't being viewed as a freak, Roy decided to play along with his new role and explore this girl's life a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d he said to himself softly. \u201cI've still got this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the slim, high-tech device still in his hands... and noticed his fingernails were now longer and painted a bright shade of red-purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the device into his purse, Roy walked off in the direction of the high school. Although the world now somehow perceived him as this cheerleader, he had acquired none of her memories or personality. He hoped to somehow bluff his way through her classes and activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school was just a few blocks away. Roy felt a wave of happy nostalgia wash over him as he arrived on campus. His own high school days had been considerably happier than the past few rough years he'd experienced. It might be fun to re-live being a carefree teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the main school building, Roy spotted a small cluster of girls dressed in cheerleader uniforms identical to his own. They were gossiping amongst themselves, chatting away happily.

His thick legs were now shaved smooth, and he had Tanya's hairstyle, but in the same sandy blond color that had formerly been part of a buzz cut on the football player's scalp.

They still clustered around Steve (who they now thought of as Tanya), happily gossiping just as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy glanced back to where the original Steve had stood. He'd been replaced by a short, athletic woman with dark hair, now in a buzz cut. Tanya's body was now wearing Steve's football jersey and blue jeans, again perfectly sized for her considerably smaller physique. As Roy watched in awe, Tanya physically shoved aside a teenage boy almost a full head taller than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch where you're going, pipsqueak!\u201d growled Tanya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid apologized and scampered away from what he must have thought was the biggest, strongest player on the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

If he was going to explore and live this girl's life, he needed to be where she belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy approached the girls, they acted as if they knew him and was one of them. They even made room for him to join their little cluster of morning gossip before school began. He didn't know anything about any of these girls so he stuck with just listening to them talk. Their chatter was so fast that Roy became quickly overwhelmed trying to keep up with what they were saying. Not that any of it mattered since everything that he did manage to pick up wasn't very interesting to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the bell rang and all of the students began making their way inside the building to their respective classes. Roy had no idea who this girl was that he switched with or what her schedule even was. Not wanting to look dumb in front of a bunch of people, Roy was thinking about using his new device to switch with someone else when suddenly the pretty blonde cheerleader that he stood next to a few minutes ago came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, aren't you coming to class?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first person he was actually talking to since he used the device on the cheerleader he saw from his window. Not only did he switch lives and clothes with her, but apparently he switched names too. At least now he knew her.. or rather his new name now. Roy wasn't very interested in going back to school again. He already went through high school and doing it again didn't really interest him. It seemed like it would be a better idea to just leave and use the device on somebody else. \"Um. I'm not feeling very well right now.\" Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cheerleader didn't seem to buy it though. \"Erin, you love gym and we need to practice our routine for the game later this week.\" she said persuasively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the thought of hanging around a bunch of attractive cheerleaders seemed like something he would enjoy, doing cheer routines would probably be a bad idea. He wasn't very limber nor was he very coordinated. Still, he could at least stick around for a bit until he found someone else to switch with like one of the football players or even a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could decide on what to do, the cheerleader grabbed his hand and led him into the school and down the hallways. Once he got inside the school, he just followed her until he found himself in the girls locker room. Growing up, it had always been a fantasy to be able to sneak inside and watch the girls get changed. Now he could go inside and watch to his heart's content without looking out of place or getting in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, he followed the blonde cheerleader down one of the aisles of lockers and stood there looking lost as she used her combination and opened her locker. As she began changing, Roy used this time to look around and see all of the other girls that were in various states of undress. Some of them were hot and some of them he just wanted to put their clothes back on. But after a few minutes, most of them had already changed into their gym uniforms and began piling out of the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized that he should probably get changed too, except that he didn't even know which locker was supposed to be his or even what the combination was. Luckily another girl came up to him to see what was wrong. She was a cute but petite red head that had to be no taller than 5'3''. She definitely wasn't the prettiest girl in the school, but she had that girl next door look that Roy always imagined his dream girlfriend should look like. She stood next to a locker behind him and appeared to be halfway dressed in her gym uniform since she was still barefoot and wearing her gym shorts and just a bra. Roy briefly was lost as he admired her cute face framed by her shoulder length red hair that probably hadn't been tied into a ponytail yet. It took him a few seconds to realize that she was talking to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to get dressed Erin? Ms. Abbot is going to give us detention if we are late.\"  the redhead asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say. He couldn't just tell people that he wasn't really \"Erin\" and didn't know where her locker was or what the combination to it was. While he was trying to think of an excuse, the blonde cheerleader that he came into the locker room with had closed her locker and was already dressed for gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she wasn't feeling well this morning Megan.\" the blonde cheerleader told the redhead as she left both of them behind to go join the rest of the class outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who Roy now learned is Megan seemed much nicer than the blonde cheerleader he came here with. As chaotic as this morning was for him, Roy was fortunate that he crossed paths with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Erin, I'll help you get ready.\" Megan told Roy as she stepped over to the locker right next to him and quickly opened it up for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Roy wanted to do was find an opportunity to switch out of Erin's life. It seemed like it would be fun at first, but he quickly came to the conclusion that being a high school cheerleader wasn't for him. But every road block he encountered seemed to get cleared for him. He still wanted to leave Erin's life, but it looked like he would have to do that after her gym class. He figured to himself that it wouldn't kill him to do gym one more time and quickly went to his new locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's locker was pretty much what he expected a girl's gym locker to look like. It had a small mirror glued onto the back wall, a sports bra hanging on one of the hook on the side, a couple loose tampons and a set shoes with a gym uniform. Nothing was out of the ordinary except the mirror. The mirror itself wasn't a problem, it was his reflection! As he stared into the mirror, he saw Erin's reflection staring right back at him. Not only did her switch lives with Erin, but he also had her reflection too. Pulling the device out of his now purse, Roy held it in his hands and looked back into the mirror. Erin's beautiful blue eyes stared back with the same shock and confusion Roy now felt. Roy thought that the new device he received this morning was amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the device and thought of all the possibilities of who he could become when Megan came up behind him. \"What is that Erin?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy looked over his shoulder, Megan tried to grab the device out of his hand and accidentally hit one of the buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only exception was the bra he now wore, which felt strangely empty on his flat, masculine chest. But the rest of his new clothes seemed perfectly tailored for him. Additionally, Roy discovered his ears were now pierced, his fingernails were longer and painted, his legs were shaved smooth, and his hair had grown out to the same length as the originally girl... and was, in fact, now styled in a long ponytail, identical to hers but now in Roy's hair color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Roy inspected himself he realized reality must have been altered to make all this somehow seem \u201cnormal\u201d to the world. No one coming and going through the busy parking lot was gawking or staring at him. The girl now upstairs in his old apartment wearing his work uniform hadn't rushed out outside in a panic demanding to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as though, for everyone but Roy, things had always been like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of a euphoric high about his powerful, new-found technological toy, Roy began wandering through the neighborhood. Nobody seemed to perceive him as anything other than a typical, teenage girl. The breeze felt strangely refreshing on his bare legs. In a weird sort of way, it felt liberating to be outdoors, out-in-public, dressed in nothing more than a skimpy cheerleader top and a mini skirt. Additionally, Roy felt powerful as he clutched the high-tech gadget in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few blocks away from the apartment, Roy felt a playful urge to try the device again. He scanned around looking for targets. There were plenty of people in the neighborhood, busily going to work, school, or just out enjoying the weather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should Roy switch now?</span></div></div>",

As free and fun as living the life of a teenage girl might be, Roy had no serious desire to spend a few more years in high school. And, more importantly, Roy was still just experimenting with the device. He hadn't yet decided to make any life swap a permanent matter at this point. He was just curious about the capabilities and limitations of his new, technological toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust across the street, Roy spotted two interesting targets. One, was a very pregnant woman waddling along the sidewalk. She had to be at least eight, maybe nine months pregnant. She had long, curly brown hair and was dressed in a long, flowing, yellow dress made of some flower-print fabric. Her belly was deeply swollen, as were her breasts and hips. Roy wondered what would happen if he were to use the device to swap with a pregnant woman... would he still remain male, or would the device have to change his gender to accommodate a new \u201crole\u201d as an expecting mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the same side of the street as Roy was standing on, he saw an attractive, athletic, trim, female jogger coming slowly towards him. She wore tight-fitting, silver bike shorts than came to down to mid-thigh. She had a hot pink sports-bra stretched tautly across her large, slowly bouncing breasts. Her long, blond hair was tied back in a matching pink scrunchie. Roy wondered what would happen if he were to swap with this woman... as himself, he knew he'd never be able to keep up the pace she were jogging at. If he switched lives with this strange woman, would he become stronger, more athletic, and maybe even lose a few pounds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich target does Roy select?</span></div></div>",

As the light dimmed, in Jack's place, was a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" She said, dressed in Jack's clothes, a t-shirt and pants, but somehow resized to fit her dwindled frame. \"Is that some sort of remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Roy stumbled, and hid the device behind his back. \"It's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my stud,\" Sarah said coming out of the opposite bedroom and positioning a blouse over her body. As Roy's eyes widened, the two girls embraced into a deep kiss, grinding against one another as their lips met! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you sleep?\" The new girl asked, apparently referring to her girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she traced the contours of her lover's lips, elegantly pushing a finger into her mouth. \"I don't know,\" she cooed, shifting from one foot to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Roy cleared his throat, startling his roommate's girlfriend as she quickly detached from her...boyfriend? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy here was about to get a show!\" The girl in Jack's clothes snickered, returning to the cooking at hand. \"Hey man, I got some eggs and such here if you want some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm not really hungry,\" he replied, marveling at the changes that had happened to the cheerleader. Her beautiful long hair was gone, replaced by a curly mop of unruly male fibers that looked in need of conditioning. Not only that, but the raven coloring was gone, slightly lightened into a sharp brown; Jack's usual hair color and style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownward Roy's eyes traveled, tracing the backside of his changed roommate. He may have been dressed the same, but those certainly weren't male curves that filled out his clothes. With each step, Roy noticed that his breasts hobbled around, apparently unrestrained by a bra. Likewise, she probably wasn't wearing the girly equivalent of boxers either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy fingered at the device, wondering what to do next. Should he swap them back before this got too weird, or do something else? The cheerleader with Jack's body was probably already gone by now, heading for the school. Regardless, Roy knew where to find her if he needed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy headed back into his bedroom and leaned his head against the door, pretending to be busy with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night,\" Sarah breathed, shuffling along the carpet as Roy listened in. \"I want some more of that right now,\" she giggled. He heard the other girl laugh as well, as they apparently moved in on each other once again, perhaps wrapping their arms and pressing their females bodies together. The whole scene was perverse, but Roy couldn't take his mind off of it. A part of him wanted to see it; two lesbian lovers hot for one another. It was something he never saw outside of a porno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clasped the remote in his hand, thinking about his next move. </span></div></div>",

He was completely naked below the waist, and his shirt was pulled up to his neck. Strangely, his legs were completely shaven, and his saw pink nail polish on his toes. His roommate's girlfriend usually had pink nails, which means the beam must have bounced off of something and hit Sarah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" the girl standing up said, furiously rubbing between her naked thighs. \"I'm so hot right now, seeing you like that.\" The former cheerleader was fumbling around in a dresser drawer. Her naked breasts jostled as her hands moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Roy spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, babe?\" Jack spoke without looking back. Roy stared at the ample curve of his roommate's new hips and started to question himself. He looked down to see his cock at full attention, gently bobbing back and forth as blood rushed through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Roy felt a trickle of saliva escape his parted lips and he wiped it from the corner of his mouth. He had now taken over Sarah's role, and the cheerleader was still in Jack's life. <br>\r\nThe girl known as Jack pulled out some sort of leather harness from the drawer and secured it over her hips. Then she adjusted it to cover her crotch and smoothed out the straps coming up from her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy watched on with entranced eyes at the feminine beauty before him. He knew that it was Jack, but his eyes told a different story. Even if his roommate was somewhere in there, a personality hidden behind the flesh of a beautiful young woman, he couldn't deny his own feelings. Whether it was leftover attraction from Sarah's relationship, or his remaining lust for the female form, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled out a purple dildo from the lot of assorted items and closed the drawer. Roy knew he was about to get a show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that for?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see. Playing the innocent girl are you? You're looking so fine this morning, and I can't help but feel turned on by the sight of you babe. So, I'm attaching my equipment so that we can go to the next step. I am the man in the relationship, and I just know you love taking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipment? Roy watched on as Jack secured the dildo onto his groin. It was a strap-on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright babe, spread your legs for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's eyes went wide with fright! He furiously clamped his legs together and looked around the room. On the nightstand was a device shaped like a remote. It was the Role Swapper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong babe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Roy grabbed the device. \"I'm just not feeling it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the remote in his hands, Roy pondered what to do next. </span></div></div>",

If everything worked out his only purpose, to the girls here, was to please them as another copy of himself went off to do his daily work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn assumption that was proven as a purpled haired version of himself. No doubt the person who walked out would be a very rigid and personality-less copy but he would resolve that when the time came.

He then guided them to kiss one another as he pulled Jack up and over Sara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down he pressed into Jack as he knew her best.

Police shirt was now far more fashionable and clung to her body nicely while making her badge and police equipment easy to spot and use. She now wore makeup, not much, but just a little flattering touch here and there. Her hair which was previously poorly tied up and poorly managed now beautifully cascaded down her back mirroring the girl in pink's before the swap. Since she was so much taller than the teen slightly leaned in towards her as she confidently continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen however, experienced the reverse. Her heels were now replaced with old tennis shoes. Her skirt replaced with some baggy jeans and belt. Her blouse now had a sickly brownish-beige color as it draped her torso in the most unflattering way. Her small designer purse was now replaced with large lumpy bag that contained what seemed to be variety of books and little else as she had no make or jewelry and Roy could even see a few blemishes on her face.

She was wearing a red sweater and pregnancy pants, her hair was tied and though she was sloven, she did not seem concerned with appearance at the moment. Her gait had a slight trudge due to her current form but she did seem to have a certain confidence to her, an assurance in herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed a little girl being walked with by her father, who was holding her hand.

Looking down, he saw what appeared to be three mounds that had appeared on his body which was now under a sweat shirt. The first pair were clearly breasts, large and snug in sweater, the new sensations nearly distracting enough for him to forget the remaining bulge: a extended belly, clear and matter of fact, the belly of pregnant woman. 'I excited for the twins...' Roy thought for a second before cutting it short. 'Wait, where did that thought come from? And Twins? The role must be filling in the gaps... I guess?' Roy was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed by the sudden shift as he took a breath and took stock of situation, when he noticed his surroundings.</span></div></div>",

He thought maybe there was a way he could improve that without resorting to switching his entire life with someone else.  Like he saw with the cop and the girl earlier, they didn't switch lives, just a part of their identity was swapped.  The cop was still a cop, just a girlier one.  This started him thinking on how he could improve his own life, similar to how he improved that cop's looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy arrived at work just in time, and was immediately put to grilling burgers.  He didn't even have time to say hi to his friend Jessica who was working the cashier, and he'd always had a bit of a crush on.  But he'd have to wait until his break to talk to her, since it was a very busy day.  The whole time he was grilling burgers he was running through scenarios in his head, of how he could use the remote to better himself.  He wanted a better job, a girlfriend like Jessica, all sorts of things.  But he'd only used the remote once, and had no idea how to use it to get what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally break time came, and he wasted no time in stuffing food down his face so he would have a few minutes to mess around.  He saw Jessica in the back, finishing her shift and collecting her things.  \"Hey Jess, good to see you.  Busy day huh?\"  He said to her, immediately kicking himself for being so bad at small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... it was.  Good to see you too.\"  Jessica smiled politely and continued to pack up.</span></div></div>",

What was left was the Bikini model, standing there surrounded by some sand on the ground. She stopped posing and looked around, confused to wear she was. Eventually the buxom model kept walking into the apartment Roy guessed belonged to the cheerleader. Roy eagerly walked into his room to see what had happened to his poster.

He quickly pulled them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile 'Sarah' looked ridiculous with Roy's body wearing a cheerleader uniform minus the top.  Roy quickly grew uneasy at the look of lust in his original body's eyes, as she had no intention of putting her clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?  I thought you wanted this Roy?  Don't I turn you on?\"  She asked, still with the strange slutty bimbo personality from the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!  You don't, stop!\"  Roy cried out, definitely not attracted to his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Sarah was back to thinking this was all normal, and had resumed the seduction she was trying earlier.  Only this time, Roy was the one in the female body, and was really not into it.  As 'Sarah' drew closer, Roy pushed her away, and fired the remote at her.  While she was recovering, he fired at himself, and once again felt himself shifting perspectives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was once again seeing himself from the other side of the room, as he now inhabited Sarah's life.  He looked down and saw his large breasts bare with very erect nipples.  Quickly he covered them up with both of his dainty hands, while quickly looking around for 'his' top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God I need to get out of here, get away from me\u2026\"  Roy said, honestly feeling quite vulnerable as a half-naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed was Roy's old body, which now looked very embarrassed and even confused.  \"Sarah?! What are you\u2026\"  Roy's body stopped midway through his sentence.  \"You said 'Jack's not here'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new feminine Roy finally found the top to his cheerleader uniform, and stretched it down over his impressive bust.  \"Forget it! Just leave me alone\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen our Roy went to reach for the remote\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sorry this is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roy in Sarah's life was agitated nearly to the point of breaking now, \"Uh, what?  No, I need this!\"  He tried to grab it from his old body's hands, but they were too strong.  Roy's original body pushed his female body away easily and clutched the remote harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, this is expensive!  Sarah what the fuck's gotten into you today?  First, you're teasing me for no reason and then tell ME to leave YOU alone!  And then you try to steal my shit?!  Go on get out of here!\"  Roy's body yelled, pushing his female alter-ego through the doorway and slamming the door on 'her' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur original Roy stood there speechless, kicked out of his own room by himself...  He stared at the closed door and wondered just what he was going to do now.  His old body was a copy of himself, and believed the remote was all his, and by all rights it was.  <i>Wait... what if I'M the copy?  That remote put my mind in both of our bodies... and I must have been the one to end up as Sarah.  That means the remote really is his...</i>  Roy began to doubt his own existence, starting to believe that he wasn't even the real Roy.  He thought maybe there was a chance he really was this girl in Sarah's life, just with her mind overwritten by Roy's consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly walked down the short hallway towards Jack and Sarah's room, resigned to the fact that this was now his room for the foreseeable future.  In the bathroom, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, and realized he looked unmistakeably female.  His body and clothes were still that of the cheerleader's, but he was still known to the world as Sarah, meaning he was now a she, and she was Jack's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stared at herself in the mirror for a few minutes before breaking down into tears, questioning if maybe this was who she was all along; wondering if she could trust any of her memories anymore.  Being thrust so entirely into a foreign identity had shattered her psyche, and crying was the only thing she could do.  She leaned her back against the wall and curled up into a ball, tucking her legs together to keep her skirt from riding up.  She was in full-on mental breakdown now, and she only hoped her crying was quiet enough so no one would hear.  The last thing she wanted was Jack coming home and demanding attention, or Roy hearing the crying and feeling sorry for her.  She didn't want to be pitied...  She just wanted answers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Roy and... Roy, put their hands on the remote at the same time.  Male Roy's hand touched what he thought was Sarah's hand, and he blushed nervously.  \"Ah.. sorry... that's mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Roy shook his female head, hair flying to either side, \"No... it's mine, I'm afraid.  I need it to fix something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Roy cocked his eyebrow up, intrigued that 'Sarah' seemed to need it for something.  \"Uh... like what?  Is the TV remote downstairs not working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine... I just need this for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged on it, but other Roy was simply not letting go.  They were equally matched in strength, since though Roy was a man, the Roy in the cheerleader's body was quite fit and strong for an 18 year old girl, and pulled on the remote just as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I put us in this situation I need to get us back to normal!\"  Female Roy blurted out, pulling hard suddenly on the remote, causing it to slip from Male Roy's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Back to normal?  Do you mean you've used this already...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well the cat's out of the bag now, I might as well explain it to him.  If he's really me, then he'll understand.</i>  Female Roy thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah.\"  He began to explain.  \"I used it a few times, and messed everything up.  You see, I'm actually you.  I'm the real Roy.  You don't remember any of it because you used to be Sarah, until the remote put you in my body, and gave you an older copy of my memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Roy stared at 'Sarah' in disbelief.  \"Shit...  you really did use it didn't you?  Sorry to say though, I'm the real Roy.  I mean, I don't think Roy ever had tits, so that would make you Sarah, not Roy.  It must have programmed your mind to THINK you're me.  Unless you're saying that's our real body and we were female all along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Roy looked down at herself and sighed, \"No... you're right about that, this is definitely not my... our real body.  You've got the honor of that.  But my memories are more complete than yours, making me the original Roy.  I bet you don't remember swapping bodies with Sarah and she was completely aware of it.  After we swapped her with that supermodel cheerleader poster, she became a complete nympho and was all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed, \"Yeah I remember the poster part, but I don't remember being in Sarah's body... that's all you buddy... the one with the tits.  But it's really just semantics now, I guess there's no way to prove which of our memories are the accurate ones.  All I know is that the way the Role Swapper works, you take your body with you no matter who you swap with, meaning you're stuck like that, until we get your memories back to being Sarah's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Female Roy had the remote, and clutched it close to her bosom.  \"Hey whoa!  No erasing anyone's memories on my watch!  I agree we need to get Sarah back to normal, but you're not gonna be killing me to do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... you had to make a moral dilemma out of this didn't you?\" Male Roy covered his face in his hands, not sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Roy smiled charmingly with her pretty face, \"I know, right?  But it means I can't do the same to you either, because both ways would be identity murder.  So we're safe from each other as long as we can trust our own morals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded back, and offered a hand for his female half to shake, \"Alright sounds good to me.  We find a way to fix Sarah without destroying anyone's memories.  But we can't keep calling you Roy, you look nothing like a Roy.  Mind if I just call you Sarah for simplicity's sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah....  yeah....  Alright I guess so.\"  The new Sarah sighed, resigned to her hopefully temporary fate.  \"I guess that's who I am either way.  By the way... first thing's first, can I get out of this cheerleader outfit?  I can only pull this mini skirt so far down... it's tiny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled, \"Sure thing 'Sarah'.  But any swap we make from here on out, both of us are touching the remote, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\"</span></div></div>",

I've got a closet full of clothes now, right down the hall\u2026\"  'Sarah' told Roy in a snarky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I just thought, you know, you might want to swap clothes with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head and sighed, \"I don't want that thing aimed anywhere near me right now, not until I sort some things out.  Be back in a bit while I go change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed into her new bedroom, which she realized she'd be sharing with Jack now.  She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirror and saw the same thing as when she looked down.  A high school cheerleader living in the life of Jack's girlfriend, except her mind, was all memories of being Roy.  <i>But the remote can't alter someone's physical body, it just moves consciousnesses around\u2026 right?  That means this IS my real body, and it's my memories that are messed up.  I don't even know this girl's name, and she's not even the real Sarah.  Some girl from the neighborhood or something.  But if I'm right then I am this girl, and my brain is just fucked\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven some time alone to think, 'Sarah' was starting to come apart at the seams.  She knew there was a mismatch between her body and her memories, but figuring out which was real and which was changed, was something even the smartest philosophers wouldn't be able to figure out.  If she couldn't trust her memories then what could she trust?  The other Roy?  He might not even be the original for all she knows\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!  Enough of this self-destructive bullshit, let's just get dressed already!\"  Sarah snapped out of it by hitting herself in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she slipped out of her cheerleader top, which she'd put on just a few minutes ago.  So it didn't surprise her that she wasn't wearing any sort of bra underneath.  When the top finally came off, her ample breasts bounced gently into a teardrop shape thanks to gravity.  Her nipples were perky and pink, and just the sight of it caused a tingling between her thighs.  She saw her reflection blushing deeply in the mirror, the cuteness of which managed to turn her on even more.  She wondered if being attracted to her own body was normal, or if this was just Roy's mind's fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext 'Sarah' slid her skirt off, almost effortlessly, revealing a pair of black boyshort panties that hugged the curves of her butt quite well.  She was completely nude aside from these and decided it was best to take them off as well.  It was her body after all, even if she had no memory of ever having it.  So she was able to justify a peek at her newly acquired pussy.  When the panties came off, she caught a glint of light on her skin, from the moisture building up around her nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing herself in this state was arousing her, far quickly than she ever remembered being excited as a male.  She began to wonder if maybe some of the nympho personality of the supermodel poster was still around in her body.  Just the thought of what this body could do in bed was making her quiver with excitement.  She nervously reached a finger down and probed around between her thighs.  What started as curiosity, quickly became sexual, as she fell onto her bed, shamelessly pleasuring herself to her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she finished, sprawled naked on the bed, feeling like she was simply in heaven.  She'd never experienced any orgasm like THAT before and started to wonder just how many more times she could do that before the other Roy wondered what she was up to.  As amazing as that felt, she knew she had to hurry up and get back to the plan, finding less slutty clothes to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\u2026  Look at all of this\u2026\"  'Sarah' mumbled as she rifled through her new closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found that she now had all assortments of clothing, many of which were quite sultry and seductive.  Tops designed to maximize cleavage, or show midriff, and plenty of mini skirts and dresses that showed a ton of leg; not to mention the rows and rows of high heels and low heels and boots and everything in between, all lined up on the floor.  In fact, aside from the athletic shoes that went with her cheerleader uniform, there was barely anything that didn't have a heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Roy's mind in her head, usually, she would be quite repulsed by the thought of wearing any of this.  But something about her had changed.  Perhaps it was her new identity or the body she now possessed, but wearing feminine clothes wasn't something that she immediately dismissed anymore.  She knew that any of these clothes would look great on her new body, whether she liked it or not, so at least no one would complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a long internal debate, she settled on wearing a dress.  Though in reality, it was more of a long tunic, but she didn't have any knowledge about such things.  She assumed it was a dress because it almost came down to her knees.  It was blue, long sleeved and loose around the waist, hiding her curves, and giving a flowy look.  She slipped it on over her body, after putting on some plain white cotton panties and a white bra that looked like it would hold her breasts in place snugly.  However, once she had the dress on, she realized she could see her bra due to the neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Sarah started all over, finding a new bra that exposed the tops of her breasts and wouldn't be visible.  This time, however, the one she found was a push-up bra, which further emphasized her large bust, with a slight padding that lifted her breasts nicely, pushing them outwards.  Not that they needed padding by any means, since she was easily a DD cup already.  But with this bra, it looked like she had E cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped the tunic back on and seemed satisfied by her look in the mirror.  She didn't want to admit it, but trying on outfits was starting to become enjoyable.  She caught herself smiling at her reflection, and blushed at how cute her face looked with a smile.  It was the first time she looked happy in this body so far\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head to clear her thoughts and went back to the closet to pick out shoes.  It took some time, but she finally found shoes that didn't have a heel, some knee high brown boots that seemed to match her current outfit.  She put some warm socks on underneath and then stepped into the boots, which fit snugly.  The soles barely added an inch of height, so she felt pretty confident that they would be fine to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now she realized that she was already finished getting dressed.  She expected it to be a much more involved process as a girl but started to see why girls liked dresses.  They were easy to put on, and she didn't even have to worry about picking out pants.  Surprisingly convenient.  With her outfit finally sorted out, she started feeling much more confident about being stuck in this body, even if she still remembered being Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can pull this off... it doesn't seem as hard as I thought.\"  She reassured herself with another smile.</span></div></div>",

Roy opened it, still holding the remote.  He looked her up and down and smiled nervously.  \"Wow Sarah... that looks really good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned red, not wanting to admit that she was flattered by his compliment.  \"Ah... thanks.  Yeah, I kinda just picked some clothes that I thought looked good on this body.  My body I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shut the door, and Sarah sat down on the bed, crossing her legs under her dress.  Roy looked at her again, noticing the cleavage she was showing thanks to the push-up bra, and looked nervously back to the remote.  \"Uhh.. yeah.  So you're accepting that this is your body now?  I mean, if I had to be trapped in a girl's body, I couldn't have picked a better one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah glared at him briefly, \"Yeah except you aren't the one trapped in this body are you?  It's not so fun once it's real.  We have this crazy magic remote that can swap people, and yet we can't even figure out how to get me back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...  I mean what is normal for you?  Do you want to be Roy again?  We already agreed that I'm the original Roy, and we can't have two Roys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe folded her arms under her breasts, \"Yeah... we can't.  Maybe I am stuck with this body, I don't know.  But I know we can't leave me in Sarah's life either.  I'm not Sarah in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy simply nods, and looks down at the remote.  \"What about the cheerleader?  That's really her body you have right?  Maybe that's who you really are?  We could swap you back into her life maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but what then?  Now I'm occupying a different girl's life, denying her from existing.  No matter who I am, I'm going to be denying another person's consciousness the right to live in their own body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... it's better than Sarah right?  I mean, Sarah is our roommate's girlfriend, but we don't know this cheerleader girl.  If we had to choose, I would say it's better to choose the stranger, rather than our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now I guess... yeah.  I mean, the Roy from the other dimension that gave us this remote said that I should use it to find a new life to be happy in.  That means taking over someone else's life.  Maybe he was trying to tell us not to be so worried about the morality of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy grinned, \"See? Let's not worry about morals when we can use this remote to its full potential! Next time we see that cheerleader outside, we're swapping you back, alright? At least then we can put Sarah back to normal, and you will be in your original life again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure doesn't feel like my original life to me, but alright. Just remember I'm you up here still.\" She pointed to her head and smiled.  \"I'm just blessed with these awesome tits, that's the only difference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finally appeared to be accepting her new body, realizing that as long as the original Roy existed, she was never going back to that body.  And if she had to be a girl, she was at least glad she had a killer body.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately Sarah is expected to be at work, and is out of sick days, so they have to get female Roy out of her life so she can go about her day.  Male Roy is just lucky that he doesn't have a shift today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, it could be hours before that cheerleader gets home, so let's figure something else out...

Either way, we can't risk that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.  As much as I've grown attached to this girl's outfit, I was thinking we could swap me into someone else's life for now, so we can sort Sarah out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Roy grinned, \"You're really starting to enjoy that body now aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just blushed, \"A little... I gotta admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about we do that, but we can transfer your clothes with you.  Then you won't be missing them.\"  Roy said, patting his female counterpart's shoulder, then quickly removing his hand.  It felt weird making physical contact with such an attractive girl that he knew had a copy of his mind inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really seemed to please her, \"Oh yeah!  This thing can swap clothes too, I forgot.  Technically these are the cheerleader's clothes already, so they match my body perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale Roy just chuckled at how much she was getting into this, but was glad she wasn't acting all depressed anymore.  If he didn't keep reminding himself of who she really was, he might have started developing an attraction to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about her?\"  Roy asked, pointing to a middle aged mother walking to her apartment across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it have to be a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean\u2026 I guess not. I just figured with your body and all\u2026 And your clothes\u2026\" Roy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\u2026 Sorry I'm still getting used to this stuck as a girl thing.  But uh\u2026 no let's find someone else.  She's probably a mom and I don't want to deal with kids.\"  Female Roy said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026  Alright how about her?  She looks like she's in college, probably about my age.\"<br>\r\nHe was pointing to a young woman jogging down the street, listening to music, presumably.  She was wearing exercise clothes, and wore her brown hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 alright let's get this over with.  She looks like at least she has an active lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them grabbed the remote together, and first fired at the jogging college girl.  Next they fired at female Roy.  There was a flash, and suddenly sitting in Roy's room was the college girl.  She now had long blonde hair and was wearing the same dress and boots that Roy's alter ego had picked out earlier.  She was definitely cute, but without Roy's mind in her head, she looked awfully confused as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy? What was I doing in your room again? Sorry I just totally spaced\u2026\"  Sarah asked, now with a new voice to match her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, you were just asking if I needed anything from the store.  You have work in a few minutes, remember?\"  Roy explained, preparing to use the remote again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stood there confused, but nodded, \"Ah\u2026 alright.  Yeah I should get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy fired it at Sarah again, and a second time at the poster showing the original Sarah.  There was a flash, and suddenly the real Sarah was standing there, wearing her original clothing and looking like nothing had changed.  The poster showed the now blonde college girl wearing a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew\u2026\"  Roy sighed, as Sarah left for work just in time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Sarah had left the apartment for work, it was just Roy home alone, waiting for his female half to show up at the door.  But she never showed...  An hour passed with no sign of her, and he began to actually worry.  He knew the swap must have worked, because their target girl had appeared in Sarah's place, and eventually ended up on his wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... what if something happened to her?  We don't know a thing about the girl whose life she just entered.  Guess I should go out and look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy put on some shoes and placed the remote safely in one of his pockets, before going outside for a walk around the neighborhood.  It was already midday, so most people were either working or at school, and the neighborhood was pretty dead.  He walked down the direction the jogger was heading before the swap, but so much time had passed, there was no sign of her.  There were no missed messages on his phone, and he had no idea how to contact his other self.  She just straight up vanished in a stranger's life.  Roy missed having her around and knew something serious must have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for quite some time, he remembered that he hadn't yet tried out the remote on himself.  He still didn't have any memory of the swap his original-self did with Sarah, so to him, this would be his first time. The Roy from another dimension claimed it could help him improve his life, so it surely would be safe to use on himself.  He thought maybe he could kill some time by experimenting with a swap on himself.  <i>Ah... dammit.  If I do that, I'll just end up creating another version of me back in this life, with someone else's body.  I've already got one of those running around somewhere, best not create more.  Why do I have such a soft spot for my clones?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I just mess with these people then?\"  He asked himself under his breath, as he finally spotted a man and woman walking together on the sidewalk ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were exercising, and on this sunny day, the man wasn't wearing a shirt, just wearing a pair of gym shorts.  The girl was dressed similarly, but with a sports bra on, restraining her generous breasts.  Roy smirked as a thought crossed his mind, and he knew just what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two quick shots, the couple swapped into each other's lives.  Now the well-endowed woman was running around completely topless and had a short male hairstyle.  Her tits quickly began to bounce violently, and she stopped running to hold them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh holy shit!  Why did I decide to go running anyways? It always hurts like a bitch!\" The girl yelled out loud, as the man just laughed in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you!  Get a sports bra for those things, and you'll thank me later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no babe, bras are for chicks. Let's just hurry up and get home. I don't know why I let you talk me into this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy could barely contain his laughter, and tried not to stare at her bare chest as they walked past. That sure put him in a good mood, but he'd nearly forgotten about why he came out here in the first place: to locate his other self.</span></div></div>",

She knows how to find me whenever she's ready...\" Roy said as he turned around to head back to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Roy, swapping random people without their knowledge just wasn't all that fun, since he was the only one who could enjoy the results. He was really starting to miss his female counterpart, even though she didn't exist before this morning. At least the two of them could have enjoyed swapping people together. He figured she was bound to show up sooner or later, so headed back home to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with female Roy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, you're awake again. Remember anything this time?\" A soft female voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shook her head, still in a daze, and not quite aware of where she was. She opened her eyes and realized she was lying in a comfortable bed, wearing yoga shorts and a sports bra over her very obviously female form. But pieces of her memory just weren't coming back. Why was she in a stranger's bed? What had happened before this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... why are you asking me if I remember anything?\" Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and saw the girl who was talking. A short redhead about 21 years old was standing over the bed, holding an ice pack and some bandages. The girl placed the ice pack on Roy's head, and set the bandages aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... Wow, maybe you really did hit your head hard huh? I saw you trip and fall while you were jogging, and your head hit the pavement. You're lucky I'm a nurse and you collapsed right outside my apartment. I saw it all happen from the window.\" The girl said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you take me to a hospital or something, do I have amnesia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well physically your head wound is pretty minor, I would barely even call it a concussion. I just didn't want to move you until you were up and awake for real. You passed in and out of consciousness for the past couple hours, and this is the most you've spoken all day. You still never told me your name, remember it yet?  My name is Serena, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy thought for a moment, and came up drawing a blank. She really couldn't remember her name, which used to be Roy, but she never even had time to figure out the name of the current life she inhabited, before hitting her head. Even the fact that she wasn't in her normal body was fuzzy and confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... no I really don't remember my name, sorry. I just know that I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not.. me. I shouldn't be this girl.\" Roy tried to explain, but couldn't really explain the feeling she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt tiny under the redheaded nurse's scrutinizing gaze, but had nothing else to offer her. Serena sighed, \"OK well, do you have a wallet on you? Your ID probably has your name and address and we can get you to someone you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Why didn't I think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached into her pockets, she realized in these shorts there was barely any room for anything.  She had no wallet on her, but there was a small iPhone with earbuds.  Luckily it had a fingerprint reader because she had no memory of any password.  On the home screen it said \"Hello, Erika.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my name's Erika!\" She was so excited to finally learn something new.  However something about the name didn't seem like it fit, but she just blamed it on the memory loss.  \"Maybe the GPS has my home address saved, let me see\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!  Nice to meet you Erika!  Do you feel any new memories coming back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, no, it didn't spark anything actually.  I figured it would, but nothing.  Let's see\u2026 oh!  Yeah my phone has my home and work address on GPS, and I live like just down the street!\"  Erika rejoiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good!  When you're feeling better let's get you home, alright?\"</span></div></div>",

Erika looked unsure, but Serena encouraged her to try the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's locked, though, this doesn't feel right.  Are you sure this is the right place?\"  Erika wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a key on you?  If it works, then it's the right place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika tried the key that was in her pocket, and sure enough, the door unlocked.  She poked her head inside, hesitant to step across the threshold.  It appeared to be an average apartment, one that definitely looked lived in by college students.  There were bottles of alcohol on the kitchen counter, and a box of pizza with a single slice left.  But the furniture was nice, with a matching minimalistic theme which clashed with the messy table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?  Anyone home?\"  Erika called out through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in here!\"  A man's voice called out from another room.  He seemed to recognize her voice at least but didn't bother coming to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Do you think you could help me with something?\" She asked, unsure of what to say to a man she had no memory of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled sigh came from the room, and a moment later a tall man wearing shorts and a dirty T-shirt came out.  \"So what's up Erika?  Oh, who's your cute friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena was briefly flattered by his compliment, but rolled her eyes and pointed to Erika.  \"I'm Serena, and your friend here has some sort of amnesia from what I can tell.  I'm only in pre-med, but I was able to make sure she didn't have a concussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nodded, \"Yep...  That happened.  Hey wait, you said you were a nurse, not pre-med!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wel,l I... may have exaggerated a bit!  I've got training, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment.  \"Wow, so you... don't remember anything?  Does that mean you don't even know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember some things... but bits and pieces.  I remember jogging through this neighborhood, and I remember being really disoriented...  But nothing about this place.  Unfortunately not a single memory of you either.  What's your name?  Are you my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother?!  Haha, na...\"  He paused, looking to Serena who was giving him a suspicious look. \"Babe, it's me!  Your boyfriend, Paul!  You gotta remember me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend...?  Paul?  That doesn't ring any bells.  I don't think you're really my type either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez, that burns babe!  How could you say that?!  You gotta believe me! We're so close, we even live together!  I mean, this is both of our apartment after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika placed her hand on her forehead, \"Well that makes sense... I'm not sure why I'd live with a guy unless we were dating.  I don't think I'd move in with him unless I trusted him absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?  Come here... sweetie.\"  He held out his arms for an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to Serena for advice, who merely shrugged. This wasn't really her problem after all. Erika took him for his word and approached Paul for a friendly hug. He planted a brief kiss on her lips, and grabbed her butt. She assumed this must be her boyfriend, but it still creeped her out a bit, having this stranger grope her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... whoa... can we just stick to hugs for now?  I'm still not even sure who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul removed his hands and stepped back with a smile, \"Sure thing babe, I'll help you get your memory back in no time! That's how it works right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena added, \"Well kind of.  I'm not really an expert, so you should probably get her to a doctor sometime soon.  But from what I've read, exposing her to familiar people, places, smells, tastes, anything could trigger old memories to resurface.  I'm honestly surprised seeing you didn't trigger anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nervously broke eye contact with Serena, \"Well yeah, but I guess we're just going to have to try harder.  I'm sure it's going to take more than just seeing me.  I tell you, she'll remember me in no time.  I'll make sure she's taken care of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika smiled and nodded to Serena.  \"Thanks, Serena, for all of your help!  You have my number, if like, you need to call me or anything.  I think I'm in safe hands though.  Feel free to stop by any time too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Paul nodded, placing his arm around Erika's waist.  \"Come over as much as you want! I'm glad you took care of my girl, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Serena left Erika in Paul's safe hands, but were they really that safe?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Serena was gone, Paul took Erika to the master bedroom which she saw was full of tons of girl stuff, which she presumed were hers.  There were piles of dresses, blouses, and skirts, tons of shoes, and makeup.  ...And a double bed pushed up against the corner.  The first thing that stood out to her was that there was nothing male in this room, at all.  Where did Paul keep all of his clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... we sleep in here.  Like, together?\" Erika wondered out loud as she rifled through the mess of feminine clothing scattered across the bed.  She apparently wasn't all that organized either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah, definitely. Like every day, obviously!\"  Paul responded somewhat confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... where are all of your things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh yeah well, you see.  The bedrooms in this apartment aren't really big enough to fit both of our stuff, so I put most of it in the second bedroom.  But yeah I never actually sleep in there, it's just got my PS4 and stuff, which I play when you have to study in quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika smiled at that, \"Oh that's so considerate of you! I must get pretty busy when I'm studying uh... Wait, I'm majoring in education, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, yeah!  You remembered! Uh... wow that's great, see you're already starting to... remember things huh?  But yeah you always wanted to be a teacher, and you're gonna be damn good at it, trust me.  You teach me shit all the time.  I don't mean math, I mean like, kinky stuff, you know what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her face flush in embarrassment.  \"D-do I?  Well, I don't have ANY memory of that last part, sorry. Look can you not bring up things like that? I'd really rather not think about it. I'll try to remember it on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Paul seemed a bit disappointed. \"So how about we check out my room, maybe there are memories in there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was thorougly bored by Paul's bedroom tour, which consisted of showing off his Playstation and his laptop that he did all his work on.  She felt vague memories of that room, but it felt like a place she wanted to avoid.  They moved on to the kitchen, where Paul quickly grabbed up the remaining cold pizza slice and ate it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... we've got a lot of alcohol.  Friends come over a lot and we hang out.  Your friends, my friends, they're all cool.  You know you always prefer to drink the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fireball whiskey and coke I know.  Oh, how did I know that?\"  Erika was shocked as some of the memories seemed to be of random things, but they were coming more frequently now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you got it!  And I always tease you about how you're such a white girl drinking Fireball, but you down that shit like nobody's business, just sayin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika thought she got the joke, and looked down to confirm she was indeed a white girl.  \"Alright, cool... So is that it? We have parties here and people get drunk, sounds fairly typical.  I can't wait for the party tonight, cause uh... wait wasn't someone going to be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul stared nervously for several seconds before adding, \"Yeah I don't know, but hey you remembered there's a party tonight, awesome!  It's mostly my friends coming, but you're free to invite some of yours, it'll help you remember them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Erika still had the thought on the tip of her tongue.  \"No, no... I mean someone important was going to be there, I feel like there was a reason I was looking forward to this party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe we should just call off the party, you're clearly not feeling well. I mean you lost your memory so you're not in any state to get blackout drunk. What kind of boyfriend would I be if I let you do that in this state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a very good one... But I'm serious, no! We have to have this party, I just know there's something important going to happen.\"  She insisted.  When Paul didn't respond, she added, \"Paul! We're having this party alright? I don't know why you suddenly don't want me to think about partying, when just a minute ago you were saying how awesome it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"Right of course, let's party like there's no tomorrow, right?  We should probably go to the store and pick up some snacks and clean this place up before people get here tonight.  How about you go change and let me know when you're ready?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't the classiest party around, but Erika still wanted to look her best.  Unfortunately she seemed to have some trouble at first applying makeup and picking out the right outfit to wear.  She spent half an hour retouching her eye makeup, retouching, cleaning, and starting over, several times until she finally was happy with it.  It was like she had the knowledge of how to apply it, but her subconscious motor skills needed to be trained all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her makeup was sorted out, she spent quite some time going through her closet for what she thought was appropriate party material.  She found a little black dress that brought back a vivid memory of her first kiss a few years ago.  The dress was slight overkill for a casual party like this, but it wasn't really formal, so she knew she could get away with it.  Somehow something was telling her that this was her lucky dress, and tonight needed to be the night to bring it back out after all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's do this!  I don't know why, but let's!\"  Erika exclaimed to herself, as she just went with the gut feelings of her new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was ready.  Her brunette hair ended up falling to her shoulders in styled waves when let out of its ponytail, something she was grateful she didn't have to spend much time on.  Her strapless dress was definitely the highlight of the ensemble, and thankfully it fit perfectly, even despite her DD cleavage threatening to burst out of the top.  It came down to mid-thigh, a rather sexy length, and she still wondered who she was trying to impress with this.  Finally her black pumps added five inches to her height, which was sorely needed since she was barely 5'3\" without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she left her bedroom, the first few guests had already arrived, and were getting started on a few beers.  A guy and a girl were hanging out in the living room with Paul, and they were clearly a cute couple the way they sat close to each other.  Erika smiled and entered the room feeling suddenly quite self-conscious about her appearance.  The other girl wasn't anywhere near as dressed up, but she seemed impressed by Erika's effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow girl, you are pulling all the stops tonight huh? That dress is drop dead sexy, there's no way he's gonna miss that!\" The young woman on the couch praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Blushed Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul jumped in, \"Yeah how could I miss that? I mean, damn babe, you should wear that dress more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man next to the other woman laughed, \"'Babe'? Wait is something going on that we missed here? You two\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul didn't give Erika much chance to respond, \"Oh yeah!  For quite a while actually!  I didn't know it was a secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika slowly nodded, \"Yeah\u2026 it's no secret right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man shrugged, \"I dunno, it's news to me! Wow, you're gonna have to give me the deets on this later, Paul, damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that man seemed surprised and impressed, his girlfriend with him on the couch seemed concerned.  \"Wait hold on, girl. You and Paul are a thing? And you got all dressed up for a casual party at home? What the hell happened to Brad? You ain't makin any sense girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nervously looked to Paul who seemed to be sweating bullets.  Once again, he interjected, \"Brad said he couldn't make it, something about car trouble, real shame. But yeah, I'm really grateful to have a girlfriend like her who puts this much effort into her appearance, even for things like this!  She really went all out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know what was going on anymore, or who to believe.  Something definitely didn't add up, and she was about to snap.  She looked intensely at the other girl and asked, \"Hey, did you wanna see my room real quick?  I've got some new things I wanna show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Erika had no idea who this girl was, but she seemed to be on her side.  She hoped this girl would be able to make some sense of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to get the hint, and quickly agreed to talk privately in their room.  As the two of them left, Erika once again noticed how awkward Paul looked right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bedroom door shut, the girl blurted out, \"What the fuck is happening Erika? You and Paul? Really? You said just last week how he creeps you out when he gets all flirty, and you called him a 'white knight', and not in a good way. Am I to understand that you gave up on Brad for your weird-ass roommate? YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika couldn't even process all of this information quick enough, \"Hey whoa, quiet down, ok? I don't want them to hear ok? I called you in here to figure out what's going on, myself.  So wait, you said we last saw each other last week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl composed herself again, \"Sorry, this is just absurd.  Yeah, at the last party, you don't remember? You were literally talking shit about Paul, and now this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nearly broke down in tears, \"Oh my god I\u2019m such an idiot, why did I let myself fall into this, I'm just being used!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't making any sense girl, come on.  Are you saying you 'forgot' Paul was a manipulative weirdo and you were just waiting for the lease to expire so you could get the fuck out of this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't hold back the tears any longer, and they completely ruined her painstakingly applied eye makeup.  \"Shit, shit, shit\u2026 I'm a dumbass, why!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, you're not.  Tell me what's up, cause I know you're smart enough not to fall for his shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika sniffled through her tears, \"Look, it all happened so fast, and I thought I could trust him.  I had no one to turn to.  I lost my memory recently, but it's been slowly coming back to me.  He convinced me I was his girlfriend!  I believed it all hook line and sinker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other young woman took a step back, \"Oh my god, you lost your memory, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?!  Or go to a doctor?!\"\"It happened today, there was no time!  I really felt like I needed to go to this party because for some reason I was supposed to meet someone important, and then for some reason I got all dressed up to impress\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, to impress BRAD.  You know, the guy you've had a crush on since high school?  You haven't seen him in years and tonight was supposed to be his first time back in town!  We were all gonna have drinks together and catch up on old times.  There's no way he would have missed this party because of 'car trouble'.  That fucker Paul must have told him not to come, so he could sell his bullshit on a vulnerable girl with no memory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika felt this girl's rage and more, and blurted out, \"I don't know what to do, I still have so many gaps in my memory, I don't even know your name, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Tammy sweetie, I'm your friend!  Look forget about all of this for a minute.  You lost your memory, this is no time for drama..  I bet you don't even know who Brad is do you?  That's not important right now.  What's important is that you try to remember as much as possible.  Not the shit Paul's been feeding you, but your own memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tammy\u2026 Yeah I have been getting memories back all day, but it's all just bits and pieces.  I remember things about the classes I'm taking, and this lucky dress, which might not be so lucky after all.  I remember what kind of drinks I like, and that my favorite flavor of ice cream is uh\u2026 sherbet.  Yeah, I know, right?  But memories of people, like Paul, or you, or even Brad.  They just don't come up.  Even my memory of this party was just, I knew something big was supposed to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!  Just keep trying to remember things!  Let's go back out and see if anyone else has shown up.  I'll stall them while you clean your eyes real quick.  Just play along with whatever Paul's up to for now, and we can nail him on his bullshit once and for all!\"  Tammy said, patting Erika gently on the shoulder.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After spending a few minutes fixing her eye makeup as best she could, Erika finally made it back to the party.  She was still an emotional wreck, but had at least stopped crying, so she was eventually able to compose herself.  However, this didn't last long as when she stepped into the room she saw a man that made her stop dead in her tracks.  He had stunning good looks, with his vibrant green eyes that she quickly got lost in, and a quite athletic body.  She had to remind herself to stop standing there gawking, and sit back down for a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer presence was noticed by everyone in the room, who couldn't help but stop what they were doing to check her out.  She blushed and sat down across from the man she couldn't take her eyes off, and quickly poured out a beer for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Erika! It's been a while, huh?\" The man said, while clearly undressing her with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had taken her eyes off the man long enough, she would have noticed Paul next to her was staring daggers at this man.  But he remained silent for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika didn't know how to respond, but at the sound of his voice, she instantly knew this was Brad.  This was who she got all dolled up for, and was trying to impress, according to Tammy at least.  More memories began to rush in.  She remembered going to her senior prom with Brad, as friends, because he'd just broken up with his date at the time and needed someone else to go with.  She remembered the massive crush she developed on him, and how she always tried to look her best when he was around.  But nothing happened after prom night, and after high school, Brad moved out of town, and they hadn't seen each other since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Earth to Erika?\" Tammy asked, giving her a verbal kick in the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Oh yeah! It's really good to see you Brad! I'm so glad you were able to make it after all! You managed to get here despite the car trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe furrowed his brow, \"Uh, na my car is just fine? I just needed to pick up some booze on the way. I heard you liked doing shots of Fireball. Not really my thing, but figured you'd like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Erika noticed the bottle he was holding, which he set on the table, along with some shot glasses.<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! How did you know that?\" She wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Paul inserted himself into the conversation. \"Everyone knows that, babe. It's no secret.\"  He placed his arms around Erika, as though claiming her as his own. \"So another thing that's no secret, Erika and I are kind of a thing now, have been for quite some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad looked quite surprised, not imagining the two of them would ever be an item, considering how she was way out of Paul's league, and never showed any attraction to him in the past. However, he was even more surprised when Erika squirmed her way out of Paul's arms, pushing herself further away on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who wants to take some shots with me, we've got everything right here!\"  Erika blurted out, grabbing the bottle of Fireball, and completely ignoring what Paul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy jumped at the opportunity, \"Oh I will! Pour one out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika poured three shots, and offered one to Brad, \"You want one? It's your bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's your bottle now, but sure, I'll take one I guess. It's not my thing, but sure.\" He smiled, taking the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the three of them threw back a shot of whiskey, getting an excellent start to the party. Meanwhile, Paul just sat there looking rejected, and embarrassed by the way Erika was ignoring him for Brad. When she began pouring out the second round of shots, Brad went back to his beer, while Tammy eagerly joined in and continued downing more whiskey with Erika.  The alcohol was flowing, and she was quickly gathering up enough courage not to put up with Paul's shit anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, don't you think you're going a bit fast? Why don't you have a beer or something?\" Paul tried to take the bottle of whiskey away, but Erika grabbed it out of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fucking call me babe, alright? I barely know you!\" She blurted out, the alcohol setting off her temper quite fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Paul wasn't about to give up that easily, \"Erika, you've known me for years, what are you talking about? We live together for fuck's sake, how could you say that? You've loved me for a long time now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika took one more shot, and then slammed the glass down on the table, \"Bullshit! I know I've forgotten a lot of things, but I'm not as dumb as you think I am. I remember enough to know how much you've been lying to me, and I do NOT love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul put his hand on her shoulder, but she spun around and slapped him in the face, really feeling the alcohol.  \"Fuck off Paul, seriously! You know what? I'm moving out tomorrow. I can't stand this shit. I don't know where I'm going to go, but anywhere's better than here!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After slapping Paul and yelling in his face, Erika got up and walked out of the room, retreating to her bedroom, not wanting Brad to see her this way. As she was leaving, she heard muffled voices of everyone at the party giving Paul shit for what he was doing, and he seemed to be trying to defend himself.  But she was too emotional to bother paying attention to any of that. Erika slammed her door behind her, kicked her heels off and flopped onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what the fuck did you do Paul? She seems devastated! Clearly she's not into you, so why did you keep making up lies?\" Tammy's boyfriend, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 it's not lies though. I thought she really did like me. Why would she just break up with me like that in front of all of you guys.\" Paul said, continuing to try and spin a new lie, but he was quickly falling apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad just shook his head, \"I don't know, none of this makes sense. But next time she needs to keep this kind of argument in private, I didn't come to a party to deal with this drama\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chugged another beer and sighed, as no one was really sure what to say to that. They all knew Paul was being an asshole, but Erika really lost her cool, and they weren't sure who to blame. Most of them didn't even want to get involved, since it wasn't their problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who knew the truth was Tammy, who said, \"Brad, you know the reason she got all dressed up was because of you? She hasn't seen you in years, and she wanted to impress you. Don't let what Paul did ruin what you think of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me? Well that's flattering\u2026 I mean I used to like her back in the day, and she's really cute. But I'm staying away from this drama, it really doesn't involve me\u2026\" Brad sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night, everyone tried to move on to other things, but the awkward air never really cleared. Eventually everyone made excuses to leave early, and the only ones left were Tammy and John, and of course Paul who pretty much refused to talk to anyone. Before Tammy left, she headed to Erika's room and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026 can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy could hear muffled crying through the door, and she knew exactly why. Through all of that she heard a weak sounding \"Yeah\u2026\" and opened the door to see Erika burying her face in her pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the party's over. Were you really serious about moving out? I think Paul's still in denial.\" Tammy said, sitting on the edge of Erika's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm serious, would you want to live with a creep like him for one more day?\" She said muffled through pillow and tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's probably for the best. Listen, how about you come stay at my place tonight? Then we'll get everything packed up tomorrow, and you can stay with me until you find a new place to stay. It'll be fun, like sleepovers again!\" Tammy said with a smile, trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, as Erika rolled over onto her back and returned a tear-filled smile. \"Thanks, that would mean a lot to me\u2026 I guess I really didn't think this through. By the way, uh\u2026 What happened to Brad? Is he gone already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy nodded, \"Yeah\u2026 I think you kinda blew it with him. He thinks you're a drama queen now. To be fair, to someone who doesn't know what happened, you were pretty much acting like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose I could explain what happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that, sorry. Maybe there will be another chance, but he's gone for now. You really should just get that out of your mind, you still want to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to change and pack some things and I'll be right with you\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

Tammy helped her get everything packed and they left the house within the hour. They left Paul behind to stew in his own shame for how he tried to take advantage of a girl with memory loss. Tammy's boyfriend went back to his own place, leaving her and Erika to have her whole apartment to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a small apartment however, with only a single bedroom.  Tammy apologized, \"Yeah it's my only bed, so I guess I could take the couch tonight and you can have my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? We're both girls, can't we just share a bed? It's big enough for two.\" Erika pointed out, but avoiding eye contact with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smiled, \"Oh yeah? Well if it makes you feel better, then sure thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls hung out in her room for about an hour, helping Erika recover more of her memories.  She began remembering things about Tammy and having been in this apartment in the past.  Her mood definitely began to improve when she felt like memories were starting to come easier again.  Finally though, they both realized how late it was, and Erika was about to pass out from exhaustion and all the alcohol from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think I'm about to pass out\u2026 how about we call it a night?\" Erika mumbled, while hugging a pillow for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy agreed, and stood up to begin undressing, right there in front of Erika. She didn't even seem to think twice about it, but Erika felt like somehow this was wrong. She caught a glimpse of Tammy's bare breasts as her bra came off, and she slipped on an oversized t-shirt that she liked to sleep in. When Tammy turned around, she caught her still staring at her body in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Erika\u2026 you've seen my body before, it's not like I have anything to be jealous of.  You're so much more athletic than I am, look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Erika shook her head, trying to hide her eyes, \"No\u2026 it's not that. You're really pretty Tammy, I'm serious.\" Tammy smiled and thanked her, figuring it was just the drinks talking.  But Erika corrected herself. \"What I mean is\u2026 before my memory loss, was I ever uh\u2026 I was straight right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy simply blinked as she processed the question. A moment later her face flushed red, \"Uhh\u2026 I think so? Are you umm\u2026 Are you trying to say\u2026?\" She suddenly looked very self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I always thought I was straight, but\u2026 the way you undressed just now.\" Erika attempted to explain, \"Look I'm not saying anything, I know you aren't into that, and you've got a boyfriend.  But I felt something for sure! A very strong attraction\u2026 God this is embarrassing\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you were always bi, but you never told me about that. If you were, then you hid it quite well. I never suspected a thing! It's ok if you are\u2026 but it does make things a bit awkward now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, why? It's not like all of a sudden I'm going to try and sleep with you. I'm just discovering these feelings for the first time, and I can't seem to recall any memory of feeling this way about others of my own gender before.  So maybe hitting my head did more than knock a few memories loose\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy laughed, \"I don't think that's how science works, girl, but alright. If you think a bump to the head turned you bi, then that's your business. But I'm not going to judge, let's just get some sleep alright? You can go change in the bathroom if it makes you more comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the revelation that she wasn't as straight as she once thought, Erika leaves to change into comfortable shorts and a shirt to sleep in.  She climbs into Tammy's bed, and makes sure she is facing away from her, just in case she gets any lewd thoughts during the night. She had to do her best not to think that right behind her was her cute friend wearing barely any clothing, and hoped that she fell asleep quickly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a good night's sleep, Erika changed back into the curve-hugging jeans and t-shirt that she wore to Tammy's house the day before. She took some painkillers from the light hangover she was feeling. Tammy was still sleeping, however, and Erika caught herself multiple times staring at her sleeping body, feeling aroused. These feelings worried and confused her, but she couldn't help herself. If she was going to be attracted to men and women equally, then that was just who she was. Eventually, she knew she would have to accept this as fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Tammy finally groggily rolled out of bed, looking like a mess. She looked over and saw Erika reading something on her phone, shocked that her friend was such an early riser, and was already dressed and made up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning...\" Tammy said as she wandered towards the adjoining bathroom to fix her hair. \"Sorry, I slept in, not used to having friends that wake up so early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika just smiled, \"No biggie, I was just reading through my Facebook, trying to learn more about my friends and people I know from school. I started remembering who more of them are now, which is nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, girl. Give me some time to get ready and then we can figure out what to do today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly mid-day when Tammy was finally ready, having slept in quite a bit. She made some quick breakfast for the two of them, and then they knew they had to decide what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this whole moving out thing, you're still doing it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nodded, \"Absolutely! I can't stand being in the same house as that creep anymore... I still don't have many memories of him, but from what I do remember, Paul and I were never close, that much is certain. I don't think he was ever THIS bad, though. He must have seen my amnesia as a chance to take advantage of me after all this time holding back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's disgusting when you think about it that way. He was always a bit weird, but I never took him for the sort to go that far. If you hadn't gained your memories back, he could have brainwashed you into being his loyal girlfriend, maybe even for the rest of your life, who knows? But you know you have friends like me who have your back, and we would have known you weren't acting like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did just that, at the party, thank you! Just the thought of what he could have gotten away with makes me sick. Before you woke up, I rented a moving truck that we can go pick up. I can put most of my things in storage until I find a new place, but I just want it all out of there before Paul gets his dirty hands on anything of mine.\" She said with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, Tammy and Erika went back to her and Paul's apartment and started packing up all of her things. They unloaded mountains of clothes from her closet, packing them hastily into boxes. Aside from her outfits and bathroom effects, there wasn't much else that she owned. Most of the furniture was Paul's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul watched with his hands over his head, as they hauled out her TV and tons of boxes full of her belongings. Erika personally packed up her Macbook as well, since that had all of her photos and school work on it. By the end of the day, they had a truck full of her stuff, and even a dresser and some other bedroom furniture. Some of, like the bed, was too heavy for the girls to carry by themselves, so they just left it behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika approached Paul once everything was ready to go, and gave him a look of utter contempt. \"As you can see, I wasn't kidding about moving out. Consider our friendship done, and I hope I never see you again.\" She handed him a check with the last bit of rent, shoving it in his face. \"Don't try to contact me, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked dejected, as though she was breaking up with him, even though they were never together in the first place. Though in his mind, he'd at least convinced her to be his girlfriend for a day, and his disturbing dreams were crushed. \"Yeah... I understand. You know I'm so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I don't want to hear it! Sorry isn't going to help anyone. The only thing you can do to repay me is never to put another girl through this again. You hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul nodded, and Erika promptly stormed out of the house, hoping never to see his face again. She was about to get in the moving truck when she stopped in her tracks. She saw someone familiar talking to Tammy...</span></div></div>",

She knew this guy must be someone she used to know, and hoped that the memory of him would return quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there you are! It's been over a whole day since you went missing, where were you?\" The man asked as Erika approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow to Tammy, hoping she would know what this was about, but she just shrugged, having no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A day? Went missing? What are you talking about?\" Then she leaned over to Tammy and whispered, \"Hey... Am I supposed to now him?

But they weren't her own memories; they were someone else's. She remembered this man, Roy, extremely well. In fact, she realized these new memories were from Roy's own perspective. She remembered going to work at a Burger joint, dropping out of college, and living with this guy Jack and his girlfriend, Sarah. She remembered her name especially, as though it held more significance than Jack's. Then she remembered the remote, and being visited by Roy from another dimension, and having the remote thrust upon her... him. These were memories of when Roy got the remote. But was she Roy too? How could she be Roy if he was standing right here? She was Erika, and she knew she had plenty of memories from her life as Erika that had resurfaced over the past day. Why was she suddenly doubting herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry what?\" Erika held her head, suddenly getting a splitting headache from the rush of information. \"How can you be Roy... I thought... These memories...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy rushed to Erika's side, holding her by the shoulders, \"Are you alright? Did he trigger more memories?\"<br>\r\n\"Trigger memories?\" Roy asked, \"What's going on? Is that why you don't know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday she was jogging and collapsed in mid run... She hit her head pretty hard and basically forgot who she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was lucky this girl Serena found me, she's a pre-med student and made sure I wasn't in any real danger. Guess my head just got knocked around that's all.\" Erika shrugged. \"But you, I remember you now... And the remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remote?\" Tammy worried, \"What's this about? What do you remember about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Tam, he's... He's a friend; you don't have to worry. We go way back.\" Erika explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded, \"That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come I've never met you? I've known Erika for a long time and never seen you around!\" Tammy challenged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Tammy, I've actually known him a lot longer than I've known you. I got a lot of new memories when he showed up, and I know I can trust him, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... But don't blame me for being jumpy after Paul took advantage of you in your state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Paul?\" Roy blinked, wondering just how much he had missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my piece of shit roommate. Well, ex-roommate now, as you can see. I'm packed up and getting out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... Where are you moving to? Are you moving in with your friend here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy put her hands on her hips, \"Hey, I'm standing right here still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika shook her head, \"I don't know yet, I was just in such a rush I hadn't really thought it through. I was planning on keeping everything in storage until I figured it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy thought for a moment, \"I see... Well, hopefully we can help you get all that sorted out. Until then, we should probably get together soon and discuss some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could guess what he was hinting at, and didn't really feel like Tammy should know about this. \"Right, of course. I was probably going to stay the night with Tammy again, but I could... How about we get lunch tomorrow after you get off work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Uhh... I'll see you then I guess? I'll let you get back to moving... Oh, by the way, you remember my phone number right? Send me your new number when you get the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I do... Yeah!\" Erika was pleased that she remembered another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy smirked, \"This sounds an awful lot like a date! Somewhere fancy I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy!\" Erika protested, \"We're just friends alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just awkwardly stood there, turning a bit red. \"Yeah, just friends. This is just lunch between friends... Anyways, I'll talk to you later I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking back in the direction of his apartment, and as soon as he was out of earshot, Tammy began teasing Erika. \"Totally more than friends right? I mean, he's no Brad, but he seems nice at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tammy! I'm serious. He's like... like a brother to me or something, I guess. It's not a date! Let's get this truck moving already!\" Erika insisted, climbing into the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh... Well if it is a date, promise me you won't let him take advantage of you, ok?\" Tammy asked as she got in the truck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika silently shook her head and drove off.</span></div></div>",

He finally found out what happened to the girl with his memories, who now apparently went by Erika. The swap seemed to have caused her memories to get all jumbled up, and now she has both Roy's and Erika's memories in one mind. She even appears to believe she really IS Erika to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I need to be more careful with this remote. We were just doing a quick swap, and she ended up with amnesia, and then all that drama that ensued afterwards... Hope we didn't screw up the real Erika's life.\" Roy wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the poster on his wall and saw the real Erika's body wearing the clothes of the 18-year-old girl he'd initially roped into this mess. Somewhere out there was a high school girl with the body of a supermodel and is unable to figure out why she doesn't have a cheerleading uniform anymore. The other Roy now going by the name Erika has that girl's real body, but Roy thought she looked better like this than the real Erika anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I should even bother trying to fix this. She's adapting to her new life pretty well. Difficult to imagine she has my memories in there somewhere, and she's still enjoying herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to admit it out loud, but he was growing curious of what Erika was going through right now, living as a woman. He admired how well she was handling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy went to the kitchen to find some food, he realized Sarah had cooked a whole meal for herself and Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Roy! You can have the leftovers if you want, I cooked more than was necessary!\" Sarah called from the living room as she was watching TV with Jack on the couch. Thankfully she was back to normal in her real body, and not acting like a nympho slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're the best, I'm actually pretty starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned around and poked her head over the couch, \"Oh yeah, I noticed you were out most of the day, that's pretty unlike you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shrugged, taking a bit of chicken, \"Yeah I was looking for a friend, she uh... Well, the other day she was a bit drunk, and I wanted to make sure she got home alright. It turns out she's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She? Oh, has Roy got a new lady friend?\" Sarah teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that! We're just getting lunch tomorrow that's all.\" Roy blurted out absentmindedly as he shoveled food into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha, I knew it!\" Sarah laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack chimed in, \"Hell yeah Roy, good job! You've been single for way too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I said it's just a- You know never mind, just watch your damn movie.\" Roy said with a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he patted his pocket, he realized the remote was still there, and Jack was beginning to irritate him...</span></div></div>",

At least nothing that his alternate reality selves hadn't already tried before. He went back to his room with the free food Sarah cooked up, and set the remote aside while he browsed around online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and his phone buzzed with a text. \"Hey, it's Erika :)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, she remembered Roy's number from her memories of being Roy finally. He saved her number and typed up a quick response. \"Awesome, you are still going with that name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ya, it's my name, what else would you call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy 2.0?

Instead, Roy jumped on Facebook and tried to hunt down Erika's profile. He had no last name to go on, but he knew she was a student at the local college, and after some quick Google-fu, managed to find her. Of course, her profile picture showed her current appearance of the 18-year-old girl from down the street since reality was changed on a global scale each time the remote was used. He was able to track down her friends through her profile page and found Tammy, Paul, Brad, and several others fairly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting to try and see if the remote was capable of making swaps of someone's profile on a computer screen...</span></div></div>",

There was a much longer flash than usual, as Roy felt like he was floating through space in a sea of blinding light. When the light finally faded, it took him some time to get reoriented with his new position. Now he was laying back in a bed in a dark room with his head propped up against a pillow.  He discovered he also had longer hair which came down to his jawline and was quite curly. He realized he was wearing little else than a purple silk nightgown and a pair of panties barely constraining his now erect member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at himself, he knew he was definitely still male, but all of the body hair on his legs and arms were gone. When he turned his head, he smiled as his new curls bounced around, and he recognized the hairstyle as Tammy's. It seemed that his little experiment had worked like a charm, and in fact, he also now held the remote in his hand as well.  It appeared to have traveled with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't have to worry Tam, Roy's super nice, he would never hurt a fly!\" A familiar female voice said from right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly jumped out of his nightgown as he realized it was Erika sitting right up close to him, as they apparently watched a movie together on Tammy's TV.  Erika was wearing some yoga shorts and a plain white t-shirt which she was apparently going to sleep in.  She also had her phone up and was texting someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled, \"That's sweet of you to say, Erika. I'm sure he'd appreciate it if he were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to reveal who he was, but Erika responded too quickly, \"Oh that would be weird to say to his face wouldn't it...? God, what's wrong with me, do I really have a crush on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis piqued Roy's attention, \"I thought you said he was 'like a brother' to you. A bit freaky to have a crush on your brother huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was growing awkward from the line of questioning, \"Well yeah... I mean it's more complicated than that. Maybe like an adopted brother? Yeah... I mean we have this bond, but we're plenty different as well. Maybe this won't be a date, and I'm just overreacting for nothing. Maybe he just wants to talk about important stuff, which is fine... Is it weird for me to hope that it's a little more than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sat there silently for a moment, before realizing he was Tammy, and Erika expected a response.  \"N-no, I don't think that's weird. No one is forcing you to see him as a brother, so you should just trust your instincts. If you like him, then you shouldn't be so secret about it. Guys are pretty awful about picking up on hints you know? I bet he'd never figure out that you had a thing for him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true since Roy hadn't suspected this at all. Erika was after all at least half Roy in mind. Perhaps the Erika side was stronger than he thought, and she actually did develop a crush on her old male self. It was weird, but not so strange when Roy remembered she had the body of a 10/10 cheerleader who had zero family relation to him so that wouldn't be weird at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... Ugh! I can't sleep, why can't it just be tomorrow already?\" Erika sighed and fell back onto a pillow.</span></div></div>",

He could probably just drive back to his house, but it was the middle of the night and he figured it wasn't worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll wait until tomorrow I guess...\"  Roy said, laying back on the comfortable bed, right next to Erika. He wasn't sure why he was suddenly nervous seeing her laying there so close, since half of her mind was just like his. But the other half, she was still a mystery. Was this Erika girl someone he could really trust with his cloned mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that Tam?\" Erika mumbled, adjusting her pillow a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing... just thinking out loud. Let's just try and get some sleep alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite saying this Roy found it very difficult to fall asleep, thinking about how he'd have to get back to his normal life, and wondering why on Earth he swapped with Tammy in the first place. But if he hadn't he wouldn't have heard Erika confiding that she had a thing for Roy, as strange as it was. He was at least glad that he got that bit of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roy knew it, he was waking up face down on a silk pillow, and the sun was shining bright through the window. He'd completely passed out at some point, and even drooled on Tammy's pillow a little bit. He quickly rolled over and saw that Erika wasn't even in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, where'd she go? What time is it?\" Roy asked, brushing curly hair out of his eye. \"Crap I overslept...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By now my old life is already at work I'm sure, I just hope Erika's alright.</i> Roy thought, climbing out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Tammy's phone on the nightstand and saw that there was a series of texts from Erika, \"Hey, I know you're a heavy sleeper, but I'm just goin out to get my hair done before lunch... It's not a date alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just laughed, relieved that she was fine, and was taking this lunch thing so seriously. He hadn't intended to make a date out of it, but it turns out Erika was really making it a big deal. He supposed it was time to get back into his own life and prepare as well.  He spent a good while scavenging through Tammy's closet to find something, anything, not super girly to wear. He finally settled on some tight fitting jeans and the least low cut t-shirt he could find.  It was purple, but that seemed to be her favorite color judging by her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Roy had a basic outfit on, he found the keys to Tammy's car and set out to find Tammy living out his life at the Burger Bonanza...</span></div></div>",

There was no answer, however, so he knocked again, and again. Finally, he could hear Jack coming to the door, and Roy instinctively stood up straight and brushed Tammy's curls out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what is- Oh? Hi how can I help you?\" Jack asked with a smile, seeing Roy as a young woman most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Roy here? I really need to talk to him...\" Roy asked with a forced smile.

Don't make this awkward.\" Roy glared at his roommate through Tammy's curly hair that sat on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa hey! I was just curious! Chill girl... Anyways uh... I guess I'll let him know you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make sure he know's it's important!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack threw his hands up and wandered back into the apartment, at a leisurely pace, shutting the door behind him.

He knocked again, but suddenly it unlached, and he saw Tammy standing in the doorway, with his short male haircut, and wearing his clothes. She looked fresh out of the shower, but had at least bothered to dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately when Tammy saw Roy, her eyes went wide. \"Oh my god! Tammy, where'd you get my remote?! I've been looking everywhere for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Roy mumbled.</span></div></div>",

He was back to wearing his looser male clothes and was standing <i>inside</i> the door way, rather than outside. He felt the remote in his hand and looked up to see Tammy standing there in all her glory, looking a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tammy, you alright?\" Roy asked, trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah! I uh... Hey weren't you going to meet up with Erika like, right now? You're gonna be late! Sorry for wasting your time like this, she's gonna be mad at me...\" Tammy apologied.  \"Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy watched as she headed back to her car and drove off. He smiled, but then realized she was right. He was running late for this strange meeting with himself that everyone seemed to think was a date. Maybe it was? He looked down at his clothes and shrugged, feeling like they were adequate. He was dressed pretty casually, but that was what he always wore, so it didn't faze him one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying bye to Jack, Roy hopped in his own car and went to meet up with his other half. Along the way he realized that he may have just killed a clone of himself that he'd accidentally created, and wondered why he was so willing to keep 'Erika' around. In the end, she was just his own mind in some chick's body, the same way Tammy was just a minute ago. But he supposed now it complicated things because she had parts of Erika's memories as well. And he didn't want to admit it, but he actually enjoyed having Erika around. She got along so well with him, because part of her WAS him. And yet, she occupied a stupidly hot female body that she didn't even know what to do with. Roy wasn't about to get rid of that anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he arrived at the restaurant, he found an irritated looking Erika sipping a soda and muching on a sandwich already. She looked up and threw her hands in the air, \"Holy, shit it's about time! What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had braced for more of a backlash than that, but she seemed content that she at least had a sandwich in her face. He shrugged, \"Sorry, work was busy today, and I wanted to make sure I showered all the burger grease smell off me before I came here.. Hope you haven't been waiting too long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika glared at him, \"You know, part of me has Erika's personality, and that makes me quite an early riser... I've been awake for a while now, just trying to kill time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy ordered some food for himself and sat down to join her. \"Well, here we are then... what is there to talk about?\"</span></div></div>",

Not anymore. I've got too many of my own... of Erika's memories to call myself Roy anymore really. We share a lot in common, but I'm my own person now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I guess I can see how that would work. So you really believe you're Erika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I mean sure I'm still trying to recover a lot of my old memories, but they're coming back quickly! They don't feel like someone else's memories. They feel like mine! But I'm still glad to have your memories as well because now everything makes so much sense. I just don't think I could ever be Roy; it's just not who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took another bite of his sandwich before taking the remote out of his pocket and placing it flat on the table between them. \"So what you're saying is, hypothetically, if we destroyed this remote right now, you would be content with this life until you die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika didn't even reach for the remote, and just nodded, \"Yes. In fact, I want you to promise never to use that thing without my permission, alright? This is my life, and I don't want that thing screwing it up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough... but you know, Erika, you don't even have your real body right? That belongs to that sexy cheerleader from down the street. You still don't want to swap anything? I remember you really liked her wardrobe. Her clothes and the original Erika's body is still inside the poster in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... clothes are one thing, I don't know... I'm pretty happy with the clothes I have now, and I did honestly forget that this body was not mine... not Erika's. But over the past few days, it's starting to feel like home. I like it. Still, let's not change anything like that, not right now. I want some time to become comfortable with myself before I do anything crazy. Speaking of which, you haven't been using the remote without me, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled, \"Na, not really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>have</i> haven't you?! What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing major! And besides, I fixed it already, so it's all back to normal. I may have ah... swapped myself with someone else just for a short time. I wanted to see what it was like. But it's all reversed and back to normal now, don't you worry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika glared at him suspiciously, \"Who was it? You sure it's nothing that affects me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nobody! Just some... lady... some stranger. Do I still look like a lady? No, because I am me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... Let's just try not to use it without us both touching it anymore, alright? If I'm not touching it, that thing will mess with my perception of reality! That scares the shit out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded, \"Fine, fine, fair enough. But if you go move in with Tammy or whatever, we're probably not going to see each other much anymore. This remote is going to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that was one of the other things I wanted to talk about.\" Erika said while blushing. \"I was wondering if I could move in with you, actually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nearly choked on his soda, \"Uhh, what? Why? You know my apartment only has two bedrooms, and Jack and Sarah occupy one of them. You would... we'd have to share a bed. You know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nodded, \"Of course I know that... is there a reason you don't want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah I don't know... No reason in particular I guess... It's just kinda awkward. I mean, we're both similar in mind, except you're way more attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked and placed her hand on Roy's across the table, \"I told you, I'm not Roy, I'm Erika. I just happen to know a LOT about you. I know that the reason you chose this body to give to Sarah in the first place is because of how you fantasized about it. And I also know you're a good person, and you didn't take advantage of her even when she had the mind of a bimbo and was all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy gulped nervously, \"Well... yeah that's true... I do find you... incredibly attractive. You know Jack and Sarah will wonder why a hottie like you is staying with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. Tell them we're dating!\" Erika stated confidently as she wiped her mouth clean with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... that sounds like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lie? It doesn't have to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait what are you saying? Are we actually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika stood up from her seat and leaned over the table. She placed her finger under his chin so he leaned up into a kiss straight on the lips. He also got a fairly nice view down a valley of impressive cleavage as she leaned in front of him... \"Welcome to our first date Roy Milford. I wouldn't want you to lie to your friends, now would I?\"</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't want my girlfriend living on the street now would I?\" Roy said with a smirk, and offered her his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his hand and stood up to embrace him.

I had no idea how to talk to people, especially guys, I was just a complete mess.

It seemed crazy that this gorgeous girl with the body of a cheerleader would have been like that, but he'd heard of stranger things before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't popular, but neither was I. And even if you were a bit geeky, you were still adorable,\" Roy said, causing her to pause her story and blush a little bit, lightly hitting his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways\u2026 like I said, I was super awkward, but Roy and I knew each other, he was a grade above me, though.

I'd never been on a date before and starting out like that was just too much for me! Not to mention the way he asked me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy perked up, wondering where she was going with this, \"What? What was wrong with how I asked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a complete dork about it! Don't you remember the whole video you filmed with your friends where you dressed up as characters from Lord of the Rings, and you were like, trying to find the ring for me or something, and then it ended with asking me out! It was weird!\" Erika said, barely able to stop herself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit is this on Youtube?! I gotta see this, please!\" Jack was loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I never!\" Roy denied, \"There's no proof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well not anymore! You deleted it after people in the school started seeing it. You were so embarrassed! I mean, in retrospect it was kind of cute that you went to all that effort to make it, but I was a dumb teenager. For some reason, I decided not to go to prom at all rather than going with a weirdo like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy glared at her, knowing he had to play along no matter how ridiculous the story, \"Yeah well look who grew up and is going out with that weirdo. You're clearly not the awkward girl you once were, and I'd like to think I'm nowhere near as weird as you make me out to be. I'd say in the end I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you're still weird, but in a good way, I guess!\" She teased, \"But if I hadn't skipped prom that year, I might not have had the drive to clean up my image and start working out. So maybe it all worked out in the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying 'my' weird alleged Lord of the Rings prom invitation caused you to rethink your life and become a total hottie? I guess I'll take it as a compliment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just shook his head, \"You're sure there's no more copies of this video around?

You're not that much shorter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean that kind of perspective! I mean, as the girl who you brought back to your room. None of this stuff in here is mine, it's yours. Even though I have all these memories of owning these things.\" Her eyes fell on the poster on the wall. \"That's... me isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poster now showed a college aged girl who had a pretty, but mature face, and deep green eyes. It was the real Erika's original body, except she was dressed in the high school cheerleader's fashion style, and had her blonde hair as well. The new Erika couldn't take her eyes off of the woman, and noted how mature and beautiful she looked. Then she saw her reflection in a mirror and saw her face which seemed familiar as though she had it her whole life, but she knew that she looked more like a seventeen-year-old.  She was cute, but perhaps a little too youthful. A part of her was suddenly jealous of the woman on the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy reminded her, \"Yeah it's Erika's body. I suppose that makes it your body too. You have Erika's memories right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of them. Enough of them to feel like she is who I really am. But I have no memory of the girl in this poster. Erika's.. my memories were overwritten to think that THIS body is my real body. But I'm not a seventeen-year-old am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wasn't sure how to respond to that, so just said, \"No... not really. I mean from what you've told me, you're probably more like 22, closer to my age. But your current body doesn't quite reflect that. Don't get me wrong, you're absolutely beautiful with that body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But... there's a but right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... We have a real thing now, don't we? Are people going to think you're just unnaturally youthful for your age, or are they going to assume I'm sleeping with a girl that's like six or seven years younger than me? I mean you have the body of a high school cheerleader for god's sake, but it's not Erika's body. It's pretty, but it's not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika sighed, \"And my body's also technically under age, but the remote will make everyone think it's perfectly fine, right I got it. The weird thing is that I never questioned this being my body, even when I started remembering being Roy. You have to understand how weird this feels to question everything you thought was reality, is all just things mixed around by some hyper advanced remote control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can use said remote control to fix this, if you want. Remember this thing can do anything!\" Roy said, pulling the remote out of a drawer by his desk. \"I could give you back Erika's body, so you can be 'you' again. Or... you could keep this body if you want, and we see where we go from there? There's unlimited possibilities here!\"</span></div></div>",

Some part of you in there is still me, so I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe accepted it and ran her slender fingers along the buttons. It was such a simple device but capable of so much. She looked up at the poster and knew what she wanted. Erika took aim at the poster and pressed the button, locking in the first target. She then turned it around and aimed at herself. She nodded at Roy for him to take hold, and so he grabbed one end of the remote as she fired at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flash, and standing by the bed was now a more mature young woman dressed very fashionably, and brushing long blonde hair out of her eyes. Erika saw her reflection and smiled, feeling more capable and adult, at least physically. She also noted her new hairstyle and outfit didn't really suit her anymore. Roy had mentioned earlier that the other Roy had picked this outfit out from the cheerleader's wardrobe, and that was her. But with Erika's memories, these clothes really just didn't suit her. But she had an idea of how to solve that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright give me a second.\" Erika said as she began to take her shirt off right in front of Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in a bra, and noted that her cup size might have even gone up with this new body, she couldn't tell. When she set the shirt down, she noticed Roy was involuntarily staring at her chest, and had begun casually unbuckling his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Hold on just a minute! You're gettin the wrong idea here...\" Erika said, almost laughing at how Roy misinterpreted this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed and folded his arms, nearly letting his pants fall to the ground without a belt.  Erika just shook her head and indicated to Roy to hold the remote again, as she fired once again at the poster. This time she fired a second shot at the shirt she just took off, and once again she was wearing the dress she had put on this morning from Erika's actual wardrobe. Her hair was also brunette again, and cut more shoulder length like Erika always preferred.  She spun around and smiled, starting to get used to her new body, which was actually her real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's your decision?\" Roy asked with a smile. \"You look stunning, for real. I guess it goes to show that you don't need to have the body of a cheerleader to be beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Erika's turn to blush, but she pulled Roy in for a kiss. While Roy was distracted, she fired the remote at him behind his back.  \"Oh I don't know if that's entirely true...\"</span></div></div>",

He was still sitting in front of his computer screen, but he noticed the profile page that was now showing was... his own? It said Roy Milford, age 23, Male, and showed a picture of his face. However, it showed Roy's friends and half of them he didn't recognize, many of them girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Roy felt that his body was off, something was definitely wrong. He looked down and realized he had tits underneath a purple silk nightgown and an entirely feminine body. His hair was longer and curlier, and now black, coming down to his jawline. He quickly stood up from the chair, immediately noticing the bounce of his breasts from the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck...?\" Roy said out loud, also hearing how girly his voice sounded now. It didn't have the same inflections as when Tammy spoke, but it was definitely her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring this, for now, he rushed towards the adjoining bathroom. In the mirror, he confirmed that he looked in every way just like Tammy.  Clothes, hair, and makeup included. In fact, as he noticed the light makeup on his face, he also saw his own bathroom full of makeup supplies, and his shower was full of conditioners and fancy soaps that he'd never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I'm really Tammy now, I have her body, and all of her belongings, but I still live in my same apartment? Hold on, am I really still at my apartment? The room looks the same, but what about outside?\" He asked himself, still adjusting to speaking in a higher pitch. His new throat simply wasn't capable of producing the old voice he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down at his new body and decided the nightgown was probably good enough to walk around the house in, as it wasn't very revealing.  And if reality really had changed, then his roommates should think nothing of his new look.  \"Alright here goes.\"</span></div></div>",

She saw Roy pulling his pants up over his feminine posterior, and suddenly Sarah's skirt began pitching a tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Uh... Sarah, do you remember what we were doing?\" Roy asked nervously, unable to avoid looking at the short skirt being lifted up by 'Sarah's penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, you were finding me attractive weren't you?  You like this?\"  Sarah asked in Roy's male voice, but with a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no... I really don't, can you leave now?\"  Roy stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, no?  You wanted this remember?\"  Sarah insisted, clearly remembering the reality from before they were in each other's bodies when Roy was staring at the attractive girl inhabiting Sarah's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah crept closer to Roy, he shook his head 'no'.  Finally, he resolved to use the remote, firing it quickly at the male Sarah in front of him, and then at the poster on the wall that started all this.  With a flash, what was once a poster of the original Sarah, was now Roy's old body wearing a cheerleading uniform and with long blonde hair...  Roy looked back to Sarah and saw that she was once again back to her old self.  Sarah had her original body and clothing once again and was looking bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd I end up in your room Roy? And- OH SHIT?!\"  Sarah panicked and immediately covered her bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy averted his eyes and threw the nearest shirt at her.  \"You ah... you just came in here looking for something to wear while your clothes were in the laundry!\"  Roy quickly lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took the shirt and turned around, slipping it over her head.  It was one of Roy's shirts, but surprisingly it fit perfectly.  That's when Roy remembered all of his original clothing was now resized to fit his 18-year-old girl body.  Clearly, he and Sarah were about the same size now, though Roy had bigger breasts...  All of his shirts, however, were cut in a feminine shape to hug his curves, so they fit Sarah just as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks Roy, I'm glad we wear the same size, even if you are a bit heavier up top.  And it's not like you saw anything you haven't seen before right?\"  She thanked Roy, smiling now that the embarrassing crisis was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank god she thinks the only embarrassing thing that just happened was walking in my room topless... she has no memory of the seductive bimbo she was just a few minutes ago...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy finally smiled and responded to Sarah, \"Oh! Yeah... No problem, you can borrow my clothes anytime, even though they're guy clothes right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, doesn't bother me!  I'll return it when my stuff is out of the wash, thanks!\"  Sarah finally left, buying into the story Roy fabricated.</span></div></div>",

He hurried back up to his apartment and tried barging in, but the door was locked. \"Hey...open the door!\" he shouted out, banging on the door. As he waited for someone to answer he peered down at his 'ridiculous' Goth girl outfit; he felt particularly stupid wearing the girl's skirt and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened, and Roy's eyes widened at the sight of the teenage goth girl standing there...wearing his Burger Bonanza uniform. \"Can I help you?\" the girl asked, as she held the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, erm...there's something of mine in here, a weird looking device\" Roy told the girl, as he tried to enter his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...what do you think you're doing?\" the girl said, moving to block him. \"This is my apartment, everything in it belongs to my roommate or me!\" she stated firmly. \"Who are you anyway?\" she then asked, eliciting a worried frown from Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm er...I'm Roy!\" he muttered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who now had his life, just laughed at him. \"Funny name for a chick isn't it?\" she said.

And, in fact, every swap would just continue to create another Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, shouldn't the goth girl notice the first swap?

Perhaps swapping the girl with the uniform had transferred her goth disposition to the shirt? Roy turned back to the window to check how the swap had changed the girl, but he almost ended up losing his balance in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take him too long to find the culprit. While he'd swapped the girl with one of his other BB uniform shirts, he was already wearing his uniform, so just as the shirt had changed into a copy of the girl's sweatshirt, the uniform Roy had been wearing had changed into a copy of the girl's clothes. He was wearing her black sweatshirt, her gauzy black skirt, her red and black tights, and her black high-heeled boots, the latter of which being the culprit for him almost falling. He was pretty sure he could even feel a bra and panties underneath the clothes, and makeup on his face. Despite the girl he swapped with being younger, and therefore smaller, than Roy was, the clothes seemed to miraculously fit him perfectly, as if he'd been the one wearing them all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anything Roy was expecting, it certainly wasn't this. Mere moments ago, he was a normal guy, dressed in his work uniform, ready to head off for work, and now here he stood, a grown man wearing the clothes of a teenage goth girl. It was a little unsettling, to say the least. He supposed that was the risk he took by trying to swap someone with an inanimate object instead of sticking to person-to-person swaps. Deciding he couldn't exactly go into work looking like this, Roy walked over to the window again, careful not to trip over the heels of his new boots, and looked for the girl he'd swapped with initially.</span></div></div>",

He cursed under his breath. The girl must have walked off while he was busy finding a second target and examining the outfit the swap had put him into. He had no idea who she was, where she lived, or even what school she attended, so the earliest he'd probably see her again to swap back would be when she passed through the parking lot again late in the afternoon. Which meant that until then, Roy's uniform was replaced with that girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, Roy decided he should probably get changed into something more appropriate. Considering both his spare BB uniform shirt, and the uniform he'd been wearing, had changed in the swap, he was pretty sure all his Burger Bonanza uniforms had been turned into a copy of that girl's clothes, but he had other clothes he could wear. Sure, he'd probably cop an earful for showing up the work out of uniform, but it was better than showing up to work as a crossdresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that soon proved to not be an option. Roy opened his wardrobe, only to find its contents had completely changed. Gone was any semblance of masculinity the wardrobe once held, replaced with a plethora of black or darkly coloured women's clothing. The gravity of the situation suddenly dawned on Roy. The swap hadn't just changed his uniform, it had changed all his clothes. He closed the wardrobe again, not exactly keep on searching through this girl's clothes, even though there were probably more appealing outfits than what he currently wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was unsure of what to do, but one thing was for certain; if he didn't leave soon, he'd end up being late for work. As far as he saw, he had two options; he could try to find someone else to swap his \"uniform\" with before he left, or he could head into work like this. For the first option, there were plenty of people out in the parking lot, but finding someone appropriate to swap with could be time consuming. For the second option, it meant letting Jack, Sarah, and everyone out in the parking lot see him like this, but it did mean that he could probably swap with one of the other employees once he was there.</span></div></div>",

The woman was plump and probably in her mid-thirties. She had pretty large breasts bulging out from beneath a tight-fitting, dirty white t-shirt with a big American flag printed across it. It was hard to tell from this distance, but Roy suspected from the way her swollen breasts were bouncing and flopping about that she wasn't wearing a bra. Roy could spot a big of a muffin-top of flesh bulging out between where the woman's shirt ended and her faded, tight-fitting bluejeans began. She had a large, plump, rounded ass and wore a pair of bright pink sandals with a modestly high heel on them. The woman wore far too much eyeliner, lipstick, and eye shadow, and was smoking a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled mischievously, pointed the futuristic device out the window, carefully aimed it at the woman, and pushed the button.

It... really worked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down and took inventory of himself. He was still physically male, but was completely clothed in the strange, trashy woman's clothing.

He wore a pair of tight-fitting, faded bluejeans that showed a bit of a rip in one of the knees. On his otherwise bare feet were a pair of bright pink, high-heeled sandals.

A ring of rose red lipstick was around the filter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I smoke now,\u201d Roy laughed, feeling another wave of a strange, but mostly pleasurable sensation wash over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaitaminute,\u201d Roy suddenly said. \u201cAm I drunk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back into the cab of the rusty pickup, Roy saw the floors were littered with empty beer cans.

Had he really believed he was that redneck woman, Ester... Ester... what had her last name been again? He'd been so drunk, and he'd felt so angry, and somewhere in the middle of it all, he'd lost himself.

Given enough time, would his thoughts, his memories, his whole identity disappear, replaced by that of the person whose life he was living? He shuddered at the thought. In any case, though, he vowed not to do any drinking while he was in someone else's life... and not to swap lives with anyone who was already drunk if he could avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, he was sober. Shockingly sober, considering how drunk he had been just a moment ago. And more importantly, he knew who he was again. He was Roy Milford... even if he didn't look like it to anyone else. He was Roy Milford, and he promised himself he would cling to that fact, no matter what else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he was Roy... but who else was he now? With some anxiety, he looked down at his clothing and saw that he was dressed only in a sleeveless black leotard and a pair of pink canvas shoes. The leotard clung tight to his flat chest and showed a bulge between his legs--a clear sign he was male, although he imagined the crotch would look smooth to anyone else who looked at him--and the low neckline and thin spaghetti straps showed off his broad shoulders and the sparse hair on his chest. His legs were shaved, and his long hair was pulled back into a tight bun. A gust of wind against his back let him know that the back of the leotard was cut low, showing off his back all the way down to a few inches above his butt. He looked and felt ridiculous, though he tried to remind himself that to the rest of the world, he was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman. Again. But at least his memories were intact, so that was a step in the right direction, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked at the pink duffel bag hanging off his shoulder and wondered who he was and where he was off to dressed like this. And then, just like that, he suddenly knew...</span></div></div>",

He'd have to spend the rest of his life married to Leon... smoking Ester's cigarettes... drinking her beer... working at her dead-end job... wearing her clothes! For every day of the rest of his life, Roy would have to put on a pair of Ester Dainsly's underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unbearable thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Roy found himself saying, much to his horror. Again, it was so much easier to act Ester-like while in this drunken stupor. \u201cY'all just take that gizmo away from here! I never wanna see it again in my life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d said Leon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it really ain't yours?\u201d Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCourse not, baby!\u201d said Leon, giving Roy a pat on the rump. \u201cI keep telling ya, you is the only woman for me. Dammit, whys you got to keep being so paranoid and suspicious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Leon,\u201d Roy said, and despite his intense disgust and revulsion, leaned forward and kissed the drunken, dirty, unshaven man who was now his \u201chusband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Officer White. \u201cNow stay out of trouble, both of you!

In a single swift, graceful motion, the officer whipped out a pair of handcuffs and instantly clicked them shut around Leon's wrists, pinning the drunken man's arms behind his back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, Roy started to panic. If he got arrested, the role swapper would be confiscated for evidence. Besides just going to jail (as a woman, no less), Roy could wind up being trapped in the life of Ester Dainsly... at least until this case got settled and he'd paid a fine or served a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, in Roy's sloppy, falling-down-drunken state, it was too difficult for him to act Roy-like and far too easy to react to the whole situation in an Ester-like instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY'all pigs cain't lock me up!\u201d Roy screeched at the officer, and clumsily tried to run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was being too drunk to maintain his balance or being completely unaccustomed to walking (much less running) in high heels, Roy instantly tumbled to the ground and quickly found himself easily handcuffed by the police officer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer then calmly picked up the role swapper device off the parking lot pavement and dropped it into a big manilla envelope. With a permanent marker, he wrote the current date and time on the outside of the envelope and then wrote: 'Dainsly'... Roy's new last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon was put in the back seat of the squad car, Roy (still handcuffed) was put in the front passenger seat. The two sat in silence as the police officer quietly drove them to the local jail to sober up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He quickly spotted a familiar figure \u2013 a geeky, nerdy-looking college-aged girl who frequently passed through the parking lot each day. Roy guessed the woman was nineteen or twenty years old. She had frizzy, long brown hair that was done up in a messy bun today. Wispy strands of mousey-brown hair had already escaped from the bun at the back of her head and waved about in the breeze. She had thick, black horned rim glasses, but an innocent, pretty looking face. Today she was even wearing a bit of lipstick. The girl was dressed in a gray, hooded sweatshirt that sported the \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d logo across the front. She was thin-framed and short, and her modest, small breasts barely pushed out at all from beneath the heavy sweatshirt. She was wearing a black, knee-length skirt, a pair of bright, neon red tights, and a pair of dull brown ugg boots. She had a heavy, blue fabric backpack slung across one shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled mischievously, pointed the futuristic device out the window, carefully aimed it at the nerd girl, and pushed the button.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Originally written by nemryn)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about what would happen, Roy grabbed a bottle of beer from his fridge. He set it on a fridge near the window, pointed the device at it, and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was expecting a flash of light, or maybe some momentary disorientation, but there was none of that. All that happened was, quietly and without any fuss, the nerdy girl replacing his bottle of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Roy a few minutes to recover from his amazement, but he soon did and began to examine the girl. She had shrunk to the size of the glass bottle, and was nude except for a paper label wrapped around her torso. The label read 'Chloe Anderson' in large letters; Roy supposed that had been her name, and it was now her brand. Chloe was standing straight, with her arms at her side, her feet together, and a blank expression on her pretty face. She was perfectly still, not even appearing to breath. Cautiously, Roy reached out and picked her up. She was nice and chilly, just like a beer should be, and Roy noted that her skin had the texture of flesh, but was hard and inflexible. Turning Chloe over, Roy saw that the back of the label held information on her calories and serving size, as well as a small blurb about how she was brewed with only the finest Rocky Mountain spring water and premium hops. Roy also noticed, with some amusement, that she was apparently also available in Chloe Original, Chloe Lite, and Chloe Draft varieties. Turning her back over, he noticed a strange line around her neck; a few moment's experimentation revealed that her head unscrewed off her neck, revealing that her insides were filled with a strange-smelling beer. Roy was troubled by this; was he supposed to drink her? Roy shrugged and put that thought aside for the moment. After all, she was a bottle of beer now, not a human, and beers are for drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished his examination of Chloe, Roy put her back down on the table and went back to the window to see if he could find the beer that had taken her place. He was in luck, for there it was; Chloe had been headed out to her car to get something, but it was the beer bottle that was now returning inside. It was human-sized, of course, and wearing the clothes that formerly belonged to Chloe: black skirt and Battlestar Galactica sweatshirt. Its cap had a design printed on it that resembled the bun Chloe's hair had been in, and below that were the glasses, wedged around its neck, and the lipstick, bright red against the dark glass. It even still had the backpack, although Roy couldn't figure out what was holding it up. He couldn't see the tights or boots, presumably because the bottle didn't need them; it just slid smoothly along the pavement of the parking lot. The bottle looked empty, which made sense, as all the beer was in Chloe now. On its way back in to the building, the bottle was stopped by another girl, who Roy recognized as Chloe's roommate. He couldn't hear their conversation, of course, but Roy noticed that the other girl didn't seem at all confused or bothered by the fact that she was talking to a five-and-a-half foot glass bottle instead of a human girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head in wonder at the strange power of the device, Roy sat down at the table and gazed at Chloe while he pondered his next move. On one hand, he really should be getting to work by now. On the other hand... now that he had this device, work didn't seem really important anymore. Maybe he should call in sick, and see what else this device could do. And then, there was a part of him that really wanted to know what Chloe tasted like...</span></div></div>",

He then took the time to take in his attire, and saw that he now wore the same white dress that the Asian woman had been wearing, the seemed to have been resized to fit his somewhat larger frame. And he even noticed that he was wearing a bra and panties underneath. He then noticed that his hair had grown longer, going down to his mid back, and he assumed it was styled the same way as well with how it seemed to frame his face. He then took note that not only had his grown out, but that he seemed to lack any body hair, his skin seeming to have been shaven smooth. He then took a look over to his window, seeing the same woman now in his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is so weird.\" he commented as he looked himself over. He felt more than a little self-conscious about his current state, but looking around, no one seemed to react or think that anything was strange. As far as anyone else was concerned, he really was the same Asian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took noticed the bag that was slung over his shoulder. Looking through it, he found an ID card. His picture was on it, and it said that he was 21, female, and that his name was \"Asuka Yamada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roy could decide on what to do next, he heard a ringing sound. Looking into the bag where it was coming from, he found a cell phone inside. The screen said that he was getting a call from \"Mom.\" \"I might as we answer it.\" he said out loud before. He hit the button and held it to his ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice on the other end answered, but not in English. But strangely enough, Roy found that he could understand every word perfectly. \"Sorry to bother you after you so soon after you just left, Asuka. Could you do me a favor and call me when you get out of school? I need you to pick up some stuff for dinner tonight.\" the woman on the other end of the line said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom. I will.\" Roy said back, find himself replying in perfect Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" the woman said before she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can understand and speak Japanese now?\" Roy said out loud, this time in English again.

Since he had some time, he decided to think of a possible way to get the device back from Asuka, who currently occupied his life.

Those lines were way too long!\" he complained in Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried two large grocery bags, having gotten quite a lot of stuff, as per his-Asuka's, he corrected himself-mother's request, and was walking slowly to balance them. Despite his trouble of missing Asuka, he was looking forward to dinner. He had never had a lot of the food that he seemed to know that would be made tonight, though he had a vague memory of them thanks to Asuka. If one thing had remained strong in him from when he was Roy, it was his curiosity to try new things, and if he wasn't currently trapped as Asuka, this would have been something he would have looked forward to more throughout the day. And even though he hadn't managed to go through with his plan, he was a little grateful. He was still nervous about confronting Asuka again. Tomorrow, he would have a fresh start, and he could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was suddenly broken from his thoughts as he had walked into someone as he turned the corner, and they both were knocked to the ground. \"I'm so sorry!\" he said quickly. He then noticed that his bags had emptied their contents all over the side walk. Nothing looked broken, but it was still an inconvenience. He quickly started to pick everything up, when just as he reached for one item another hand picked it up and handed to him. Looking up, he was surprised by who it was. There, standing before him was none other than the one who occupied his life, Asuka. Roy nearly froze up, a blush creping over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. Sorry I ran into you. Are you okay?\" Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you. It's alright, it was my fault. And yes, I'm fine.\" Roy replied to each question nervously. His mind was mostly a blank as he and Asuka picked up all the groceries. What should he do? What did Asuka think about him? Those were two of the thoughts going through Roy's mind at the moment. Once everything was picked up, Roy managed to make one comment through Asuka's nervous attitude that was dominating him at the moment. \"Thank you for helping me. Oh, you're were the one from Burger Bonanza today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I saw you there today.\" Asuka replied. \"Do you live near here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my apartment is near here too. I was just on my way home.\"</span></div></div>",

And yet, the longer he was Asuka Yamada, the more her life began to affect him. Her emotions, mostly her shyness, were over running him right now. He wondered how things would be once he finally returned to being Roy Milford.</span></div></div>",

Roy there is a seat free next to Asuka's seat if you like.\"  She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka, believing she is Roy, responded awkwardly, \"Thank you, it smells delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy led Asuka into the dining room and the two of them sat down next to each other, and Roy smoothed out his dress before sitting.  He had never eaten any food like this before, but Asuka's memories told him that many of the dishes on the table were her absolute favorites.  He politely waited for everyone to be seated before putting food on his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigatou Okaasan, itadakimasu!\"  He smiled and thanked his mother in Japanese, before he looked over to Asuka who was completely lost.  She had apparently lost all knowledge of how to speak Japanese, and was looking at the food like it was completely alien.  Roy turned to her and said shyly, \"Oh I'm sorry Roy...  I was just thanking her for the food.  I hope you like her cooking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka turned and smiled awkwardly at Roy, \"No, no, it's fine Asuka.  It all looks so delicious, but I've never had any of this before, I don't even know where to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy noticed Asuka's body was blushing as she said this, which in turn made him blush as well, strangely.  <i>He's actually really cute when he blushes...  She, I mean she's cute when she blushes...  That's Asuka still, not Roy.  Though... I guess in this reality everyone treats her like a guy.</i>  At this moment Roy was extremely confused about being so turned on right now.  He didn't even realize that he'd been staring dreamily into Asuka's eyes for an uncomfortably long amount of time.  Asuka's personality was starting to make him overwhelmingly attracted to 'Roy', and it didn't help that his male body was already very attracted to Asuka's appearance.  Even in Roy's old clothing she looked extremely cute.  Finally Roy snapped out of his daydreaming and noticed some of his family were watching the two of them and one was even giggling quietly.  Asuka looked extremely embarrassed right now and was looking at the food and back to Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, here you should try some of this first.  And this right here is the best sushi you'll ever taste.  My mom makes them better than anyone.\"  Roy said with pride, as if it were actually his own mother he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy filled up Asuka's plate with enough food to get her started, and noticed that the conversation at the table had resumed again.  His, or rather Asuka's, grandparents seemed like very nice people, and many of them were eagerly waiting to see if their granddaughter could actually flirt with a 'guy' at the table.  Of course they didn't even question the fact that 'Asuka' was actually a white guy in a dress and long hair, because the Role Swapper made them all believe that was how Asuka has always been, their cute granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy casually listened to their conversations, which were all in Japanese but he understood every word of it.  His grandfather seemed to be the only one who didn't like 'Roy', because he seemed to oppose interracial relationships.  Roy giggled at the irony of the fact that this old Japanese man was upset that his white male granddaughter was flirting with a man whose life was being played by his actual granddaughter.  Roy blushed when they mentioned the flirting however, and wondered if it was that obvious what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka didn't seem to mind however, as she had begun eating slowly and trying some of the dishes.  She asked for Roy's help again and didn't seem to know how to eat with chopsticks.  Noriko was about to offer him a fork from the cupboard but stopped herself when she saw her 'daughter' holding 'Roy's hand to demonstrate how to hold the chopsticks correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Roy this came naturally from Asuka's memories, but Asuka was completely Roy right now, and was learning all of this for the first time.  Roy wondered just how much Asuka was thinking like Roy right now, and if she knew about the device or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner seemed to be going well, with Roy successfully flirting with\u2026 himself\u2026 with Asuka's shy personality.  Does Roy discover that Asuka knows about the device, perhaps even brought it with her?  Or does the night continue without the interruption of the Role Swapper?</span></div></div>",

However, he feels bad for Asuka who is sitting there not able to understand anything in the conversation, and is wondering what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother Noriko noticed 'Roy's awkwardness, and said in English.  \"Asuka, do you mind cleaning the table and collect all the dishes for me please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka still believed she was Roy, and said, \"Oh, hey Asuka I'll help you with the dishes, if you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled and nodded his head, \"I'd appreciate that\u2026 Roy.\"  Roy still had a hard time calling Asuka by his own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes, the elders continued their Japanese conversation at the table while Asuka and Roy cleaned up and rinsed the dishes for Noriko.  When they were finished, Roy said to his mother, \"Thanks for cooking okaa-san, it was your best yet I think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka also added, \"Yeah, thank you I really appreciate it!  I'd never had any of that food before, but I think I found some new things that I really like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko gave a warm motherly smile in return, \"You're welcome to eat here any time Roy, thank you for being so kind to my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy blushed, \"Oka\u2026.  It's fine.  He was just being nice, no need to embarrass me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko nodded and left the two of them alone in the living room.  They stood there for a moment, and Roy couldn't stand to make eye contact and kept staring at the floor, embarrassed.  However, Asuka broke the ice, \"So, I guess that's it then?  I can go if you want, it was a delicious dinner though, thank you for inviting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to leave, Oh I know!  Um\u2026 Why don't we head up to my room where we can actually talk?  If you want to, I mean if you really have to go you can\u2026\"  Roy stammered out, nervously.  He couldn't believe he was acting so shy around himself, but part it was because Asuka was such a cute girl, even with Roy's hair and clothing, but also Asuka's personality was starting to fall for Roy big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, your mom won't mind?\"  Asuka asked, as her mood brightened at the sound of seeing 'Asuka's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shook his head no, and took Asuka's hand and led her quietly upstairs.  \"I don\u2019t think she'll mind, but let's not take any chances.\"  Roy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe I'm inviting him up to my room.  Mom has been trying to play matchmaker all night, so I doubt she'll mind if we get some alone time.  He's so cute and mom seems to think he's a good person, but\u2026 ugh why do I have to be so nervous around him.</i>  Roy thought to himself in Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached 'Asuka's bedroom quickly, and Roy showed the real Asuka around.  \"Tada~  Here is my room, it's so impressive isn't it.\"  Roy said somewhat sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very clean and had many stuffed toys arranged behind the bed with purple sheets, and overall the room looked exactly like Roy expected an 18 year old Japanese girl's room to look like.  She never seemed to grow out of her stuffed animal phase, but Roy knew many girls never fully did.  <i>I really hope he doesn't think I'm a kid with all these toys laying around\u2026 they're just so cute I like having them around is all\u2026  Why can't a girl have a few cute things in her room?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was beginning to think of himself more and more as a girl every minute, and was already fully responding to the name Asuka at this point.  However, he managed to hold onto his memories of his past life and of the device, and wouldn't let Asuka's personality overwrite that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026 a very nice room, I see you have a computer, and the toys are pretty cute I guess, yeah looks like a room.\"  Asuka chuckled awkwardly as she failed to find something to talk about.</span></div></div>",

He slipped his white dress off over his head, letting his long silky hair fall back into place across his shoulders.  He noticed Asuka had taken her shirt off as well and was of course not wearing a bra, because she was currently in Roy's life.  Her perky breasts bounced the slightest bit as she threw her shirt aside, and Roy looked down at himself and noticed he was already down to bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this, the kissing continued between taking off bits of clothing, but when Roy began to expertly unhook his bra, he noticed he had actually been filling out the bra the slightest bit all along, but he couldn't tell if it was just a slight case of man boobs, but the bra was the smallest possible cup size, so he didn't think much of it.  Asuka took his mind off things by actually pinning Roy down on the bed and licking his nipples.  He let out a moan in his male voice, as his nipples sent a shock up his body, as if they were more sensitive than usual\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had no time to think about it as Asuka reached her hands down and slipped off his panties.  He lay on his back in the missionary position, wondering what Asuka was going to do next.  However, one thing that felt odd was when the panties came off, he didn't feel his erection pop out of them.  In fact, he hadn't noticed an erection all night, and realized there was a wetness between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down and confirmed, he was now a she, with a vagina on his otherwise male body.  Roy saw Asuka had pulled her boxers down, revealing that she was now a he.  Asuka's otherwise female body was sporting a decent sized erection, and she didn't seem to find it odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy panicked and mumbled out between moans, \"NO wait\u2026 what's going on\u2026  Roy hold on a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka looked concerned and stopped before she went any further, \"Asuka?

We can stop if you're not ready\u2026\"  Asuka seemed disappointed to say this but Roy loved how respectful she was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Roy still had Asuka's personality screaming in his head, \"I\u2026 um\u2026 I don't know if I'm ready but\u2026\"  The Asuka in his head was definitely ready, but she reminded him of something he hadn't considered until now.  \"Could you please use a condom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Asuka's body looked relieved and smiled, \"Oh is that all?  Thanks for reminding me actually.  I thought you wanted to back out for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shook his head, \"Nu uh\u2026 Please Roy, I want you inside me before my family suspects we're in here too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka got the hint and quickly found the condom.  She got on top of Roy and gently began easing herself in, until going harder and faster.  They both managed to move their bodies with each other's rhythm, and Roy had to make sure to stifle any moans so the family couldn't hear.  Eventually they both were brought to climax, and Roy arched his back from the surge that went through his body from his first female orgasm.  The feeling shook him to his core, and he basked in the blissful afterglow.</span></div></div>",

But wait no, I gotta remember that's not the real Roy, I am, or at least I used to be.  How the hell did I get a vagina and microscopic boobs?   Maybe in order to switch into the life role of a female, the device had to make me biologically female so things would make sense.  It also seemed to give Asuka a\u2026 penis\u2026 which she used masterfully I might say.  But no, that was weird as fuck, what am I thinking?  Asuka's small Japanese girl body with breasts and a penis is something I never thought I'd see.  And that with her cute short men's haircut, I don't even know what to think anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy's thoughts raced, he, now a she, realized Asuka was cleaning up and already starting to get dressed.   Roy forced herself to sit up and got some tissues to clean her private region, and then grabbed a fresh pair of panties from the dresser.  As she was dressing, she picked up her bra and noticed it was labeled A cup, which was technically the second smallest size, meaning she could have had even smaller boobs than this.  She looked over at Asuka's body, who was still shirtless and figured he must have had C or D cups for his petite body size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had both finished cleaning up and getting dressed, and Roy made sure to fix her long hair so it looked presentable when her mother saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka spoke up as Roy was brushing her hair, \"So Asuka\u2026  I gotta say that was great, you're a beautiful girl and I'd like to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's heart skipped a beat and her face flushed red.  <i>Omigod\u2026 he said I'm beautiful?</i>  \"I\u2026 I'd like that.  Did you want to like\u2026 I don't know go on a date or something to make it official?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that if you want, that's probably a good way for us to get to know each other better without your family always around\u2026  But Asuka, if things go well I'd like you to be my girlfriend\u2026  If it's not too sudden?\"  Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow um\u2026  I mean I guess we did just\u2026  Shouldn't we get to know each other more first?\"  Roy asked, concerned that things were moving too fast for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree that we should\u2026 but I have an idea that can solve that before our first date even happens.\"  Asuka said, pulling a remote out of his pants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's eyes lit up when she saw this, and reminded her that deep down she was still the original Roy that had used the remote to switch lives with Asuka.  However, Roy didn't want to play her hand just yet, and pretended to know nothing about it.  Asuka still seemed to think of himself as the original Roy, and telling him would just complicate things right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?  We're going to get to know each other by watching TV together?  OK\u2026\"  Roy said, pretending not to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly, it's called a Role Swapper, and it's amazing\u2026.\"  Asuka went on to explain what it did, which was stuff that Roy already knew.  \"\u2026 So basically I've only tried it out a couple times and it definitely seems to work, but I've never tried it on myself\u2026  I'd like to try it out with you.  Have you ever wondered what it's like to live someone else's life?  This way we can see how each other lives first hand, and to know each other better that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was torn, on the one hand, she was ecstatic to finally get the opportunity to get the remote back and return to being Roy.  On the other hand, in the past day as Asuka, Roy had already grown fond of Asuka's thoughts influencing his actions, and she was actually somewhat sad to leave that behind.  But in the end, she knew what she had to do.  At the very least she should get her penis back this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that sounds\u2026  far-fetched?  But the idea sounds intriguing, how long would we switch for?\"  Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only until after our first date, where we will go to the date as each other, and switch back the next morning if all goes well.\"  Asuka said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have our date on Friday night?  That's two days as each other, and I have a test tomorrow so try not to mess up my grades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll actually do it then?\" Asuka was surprised it was that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah! This sounds like fun!\" Roy exclaimed, then added, \"That's assuming your remote story isn't completely fake.\"</span></div></div>",

You're about to go into my life, but you should still have your own memories if you hold on while we hit the button,\" the real Asuka said, thinking she's Roy still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready let's do it!\" Roy said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hit the button and in an instant, Roy found himself once again dressed in his male clothing and the familiar feeling of short hair.  A part of him still felt a strong attachment to Asuka now, because of the time he'd spent as her, but he knew there was a strong possibility of doing it again soon.  For now though, he felt his crotch and was relieved to feel his bulge was intact and everything seemed back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka was now in her correct life again, though she still had the memories of the duplicate Roy, and believed that Roy was Asuka borrowing her life.  Either way, Roy thought Asuka's cute face and body fit her role a lot better than he did.  While he spent time in her life, Asuka's personality had helped him fall head over heels for that cute Japanese face, even though she had been dressed as Roy at the time.  And now that he saw her up close, with her long silky hair and adorable white dress, he wondered how on earth this girl didn't have a boyfriend already.  Roy felt extremely lucky to have chosen her at random to switch with on the street this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Asuka, it really worked!\"  Asuka said, feeling up her body.  \"This is so weird, I have my body in your life, but for some reason I have a... vagina!\"  Asuka had her hand up her dress, in a very unladylike fashion.  \"I only tried out the device on other people but I wasn't aware it switched their...most private parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy pretended to be shocked as well, \"This is incredible!  The switch actually gave me a penis, and my breasts are even flatter than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow really?  Come on Asuka you have cute breasts they weren't that flat before.  But you know now that you mention it, I think my breasts actually grew a size.  This bra feels so weird I don't know if I can get used to this.  Let me see...  Do you know how to unhook one of these things?\"  Asuka asked, but then paused and added, \"Oh... this is so weird, it's like I'm starting to get a flood of your memories, like I can even speak Japanese now!  Also the memories are telling me I'm wearing a D cup bra, interesting...  I'm pretty sure my breasts weren't this large before we switched...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughed a little as he realized that Asuka was going through all of the same things he did when he switched originally.  He had to remind himself that this wasn't actually Asuka, because she had a copy of his own mind instead of her own, but he knew that given time, she would recover all of her original memories again, thanks to the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Asuka, you know I think the switch actually stole a cup size from me and gave it to you!  That's why I'm so flat chested as Roy!\"  Roy joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me Asuka? Oh right, I guess I should start calling you Roy for now, so people don't think we're crazy!\"  Asuka giggled, and then blushed in embarrassment at the fact that she giggled.  Roy smiled, knowing Asuka's cute personality was already starting to come back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose your new family is waiting for us right Asuka?  We've been in here an awfully long time, and I think I've outstayed my welcome.\"  Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded, \"You're right, I should get back to them.  I'll see you Friday night I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hey by the way, what are we going to do with the role swapper thingy until the date?  If you don't mind\u2026 I'd actually like to take it with me and learn more about how it works.  I promise I won't mess anything up!\"  Roy asked politely, realizing Asuka's nice personality might have actually rubbed off on him, which might not be a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka thought it over, \"Hmm\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

For the first time in a while Roy had found a girl who was attractive, cute, nice, and very smart.  He didn't want to risk the chemistry they were having by stealing the remote back from her.  He would simply have to trust that the duplicate Roy in her body would be responsible with the remote.

I have Asuka's hairless skin, long flowing hair, and even her vagina!  I don't know if I can get used to these slightly larger breasts, but at least I have bras now to hold them in place.  It's going to be pretty weird getting used to living as a girl, even for a few days.  I really hope Asuka is having the same fun experience in my life right now, she looks so cute even with my male clothes and short hair.

Asuka didn't really have much in the way of sexy shoes either, she noticed, but she was glad to not have to learn how to walk in stilettos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going to her classes Asuka was surprised at how advanced the topics were for a freshman in college, but also how well these new memories were helping her ace all her tests.  <i>Asuka really is a brilliant girl, she must study non-stop.

Her friend's name was Yumi, another Japanese girl who she'd been friends with for years during high school.  Asuka had always been jealous that Yumi was so tall for an Asian girl, standing 4 inches higher than Asuka's 5 foot 2 stature.  To make matters worse, Yumi loved wearing high heels to boost her height up another 4 inches further, putting her at 5 foot 10 in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka, still with duplicate-Roy's mind inside of her body, couldn't help but check out Yumi's beautiful body and her great outfit.  She had always been extremely stylish, wearing all the latest trends that her cousins shipped over from Japan, but always kept it classy.  Yumi's hair was also professionally styled and dyed the cute auburn color that was very popular in Japan these days.  Asuka admired how she always had the perfect mix of cuteness and style, and was feeling a momentary bout of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Asuka you've been acting strangely today, is anything wrong?  You seem lost in thought?\"  Yumi asked as she put down her textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Oh um\u2026 well I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but I've got a date tomorrow night, and I can't stop thinking about it\u2026\"  Asuka said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa this is huge!  Asuka got a date?!  Congratulations girl!\"  Yumi said, a little too loudly for the library.  \"How could you not tell me sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he just asked me out last night, after he helped me carry my groceries home and my mom offered him dinner\u2026  He's a really nice guy but I literally just met him.  He was very gentlemanly though, and cute too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi smiled, noticing how Asuka was rambling on about this cute guy, \"Wow so he already met your parents huh?  He must be quite the catch.\"  Yumi teased.  \"So have you figured out what you're going to wear to the date yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's eyes went wide as she realized this, \"N-No\u2026 I haven't given it any thought yet.  I have no idea what I would choose, since I don't really have any outfits that are good for dinner dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry your outfits are fine.  You have a very cute style Asuka, and you should dress in the way that makes you comfortable for your date.  This guy seems to like you already so I'm sure he won't mind.  But if it's really bothering you, I can lend you one of my party dresses if you really want to wow him.  You should also consider wearing heels more often, they would go great with your short height.\"  Yumi gave some friendly advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis started to get the wheels turning in Asuka's head.  <i>She's right, I should wear something that will really grab his attention.  I mean, hopefully Asuka will be impressed if I can show her that I'm willing to go above and beyond to play the role of the girl on this date.  Asuka will be playing the role of the guy and hopefully she finds me attractive still\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wondering if she should take up Yumi's offer and borrow an outfit for the date, but then a new idea dawned on her.

She looked fairly cute still, but plainer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Asuka saw she was wearing Yumi's stylish dress that revealed some cleavage in a tasteful way.  She was also wearing a pair of 4 inch heeled sandals which she realized would make her look like she was 5 foot 6.  She hadn't realized it yet, though her makeup still had a cute natural style, it had improved to look like she had just gotten a professional makeover, and Asuka's memories started to fill with the knowledge of how to do it herself.  The final change was her hair, which was now an adorable auburn color and styled to be long and wavy all down her back.  Her body didn't change one bit, but the clothing made her feel that much more sexy and confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the advice Yumi, but I think I've got the outfit thing taken care of now.  He'll definitely be impressed with what I have.\"  Asuka said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I was thinking, you have such a more stylish wardrobe than I do Asuka, it would be silly of me to lend clothes to you when you have all of that designer stuff straight from Japan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Asuka felt like she was completely ready for this date, and couldn't wait to see how Roy (who she thought was Asuka adapting to a male life), was going to handle things on his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thanked Yumi for her help, and as they were both leaving together, she noticed that she had started walking in the 4 inch heels with ease, and they brought her to almost an equal height with Yumi now, who was wearing a very low wedge heel.  <i>Switching outfits with her must have given me all the knowledge of how to wear her stuff, including walking in heels which I'd never been good at before\u2026  That certainly is convenient!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka finally headed home, exhausted from a day of hard studying, and flopped down on her bed.  She looked around her room and noticed some differences now.  Her closet which had previously fit her entire wardrobe of clothing, was now nearly overflowing with Yumi's clothes.  <i>Yes, the remote worked!  Looks like I have access to every piece of clothing she owns\u2026  Sorry Yumi, but I'll switch our clothes back after the date is over.  For now I need them more than you do.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found all kinds of outfits, ranging from cute, to stylish, to downright sexy.  Her dresser contained a lot more lacy and frilly lingerie than Asuka ever had, since she usually wore fairly plain underwear.  And then there were the shoes.  Yumi's shoe collection covered the entire floor of Asuka's closet, and nearly all of them were high heels of some kind, except a small collection of flats and tennis shoes for exercising in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to be adventurous tonight and put on one of her new sheer nightgowns to sleep in, which would leave little to the imagination if anyone saw her in it.  It was something the original Asuka would never have worn, but having duplicate-Roy's thoughts in her head, influenced her to start trying new things.  That night she had some trouble falling asleep due to anxiety about her date, but after some tossing and turning, finally drifted off.</span></div></div>",

Anyways I'll see you then!\"  Asuka said as she hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well I guess it's happening, I'd better get ready.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy put on his best clothes, which wasn't saying much, just some clean pressed slacks and a button up dress shirt.  He didn't often wear things like this, but had one for occasions like this or job interviews.  He chuckled as he realized all the trouble Asuka must be going through right now learning how to doll herself up.  The short time he'd spent in her life made him realize that, as cute as she was, she wasn't very experienced with dating or getting dressed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy put the finishing touches and made sure he was at least clean shaven and had a fresh condom in his wallet.  Before Wednesday, he'd never expected carrying a backup condom around would be that useful.  But since he had been the one with the vagina at the time, he was certainly glad he kept one handy.  He hoped tonight would result in using said condom, but a small part of him even wished he could try sex as a woman one more time.  There was just something about it that turned him on and he wasn't sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had everything ready, Roy drove his car down to Asuka's house, and knocked on the door with a handful of flowers.  He figured Asuka would appreciate the irony of the situation, since Asuka still thought she was originally Roy, and Roy was originally Asuka.  <i>Hopefully she'll think that I'm Asuka trying to learn how to be a gentleman.</i></span></div></div>",

Come in come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, Ms. Yamada, it's good to see you again.\" Roy said, nearly swallowing his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh call me Noriko.  I see you brought flowers, very nice of you.  You have no idea how nervous Asuka is about this date so I hope you give her a chance to warm up.   As a mother I know she likes you very much, just don't break her heart ok?\"  Noriko advised.  Roy was relieved that she seemed to be very supportive of this date going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Noriko.  Breaking your daughter's heart is the last thing I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko smiled and nodded, before looking up the staircase and yelling something very loudly in Japanese that Roy couldn't understand.  The only thing he picked out was Asuka's name.  He straightened up his posture and tried to shake the tension out of his shoulders.  The anticipation was killing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a quick response in Japanese, and then saw a pair of legs on high heels descending the staircase, followed by the rest of Asuka's body in a peach colored mini dress that went perfectly with her skin color.  Her hair was styled very different than he remembered, instead of jet black and straight, she must have dyed it auburn and gotten it styled to be wavy and curly like a professional would have done.  Roy had no idea that Asuka had swapped hairstyle and outfits with her friend Yumi.  Somehow he knew this was not her usual style, but assumed she had simply gone above and beyond to improve her fashion sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoriko watched with pride as her daughter caused Roy's jaw to nearly hit the floor, and then she snuck off to let the two meet.  Asuka's hair bounced vibrantly as she took her final steps down the stairs, and her eyes smiled at him with a striking look of confidence that she never had before.  Roy noticed how her makeup accented her eyes, which was something he thought Asuka never liked to do.  She usually wore minimal makeup, and though this wasn't excessive, it was certainly more than she usually wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there 'Roy'!  Speechless?\"  Asuka asked with a smile and gave a little twirl on her heels, which caused her dress to flare out momentarily.  If she was nervous, she certainly wasn't showing it, and even looked like she was enjoying his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka\u2026  I can't even describe what I'm seeing.\"  Roy stammered, \"You're absolutely stunning!   There are no other words\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka seemed to have no problem walking in heels, and stepped over to Roy to give him peck on the lips.  \"Just a taste of what's to come.\"  She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy licked his lips and tasted, \"So\u2026 strawberries?  I like where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka finally couldn't continue her confident woman act and broke down in a fit of giggles for a moment.  Roy smiled at the sign of the personality of the carefree girl he liked, though this confident assertive version of her wasn't so bad either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, strawberries, why not?  So Roy, if I had to guess, I'd say our chariot awaits outside?\"  Asuka locked arms with him, and let him lead her to the car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The couple hopped in Roy's car, and he took them to a nice restaurant that he knew had good food.  It wasn't super expensive, but it was popular enough that he made sure to reserve a table.  When they were seated, Roy caught Asuka staring at him and smiling, and her sweet smile was contagious, he found himself laughing and smiling a lot around her.  Occasionally he would get distracted by the looks Asuka was receiving from people at other tables, and he actually felt a moment of pride.  <i>That's my date they're all jealous of\u2026 how did I get so lucky?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Asuka began to notice those same looks, Roy could tell her confidence was wearing away, and she was beginning to get self-conscious again.  He needed to distract her from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Asuka, I guess you've had a busy past few days?  What's it been like?\"  Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you have no idea, or maybe you do I guess.  It's been so weird having all these memories of this life spring into my head, and I have so many of them now it's hard to tell which are yours and which are mine.  I never thought I'd be this excited about girly things like fashion, but preparing for this date taught me a lot about what girls have to go through on this kind of thing, I admire you for it.\"  Asuka explained, making sure to not talk too loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy still got a bit uncomfortable every time Asuka assumed he was really a girl previously, but he just smiled and nodded, not wanting to reveal any info about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you definitely did something right, you look absolutely radiant tonight.  You have like a whole new style about you, with new hair, new clothes, even heels.  It really suits you and I'm very impressed.\"  He complimented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, so you noticed the difference?\"  Asuka asked, surprised.  Since he hadn't been aware of the wardrobe swap, she wasn't sure if he would think that was normal, but somehow he knew something had changed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.  Don't get me wrong, I think you looked very attractive before, but something about this new look of yours\u2026 is just wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's be fair here, YOU looked very attractive before.  I only stepped into your life for a few days, but you managed to stay cute your whole life.  But speaking of appearances, you don't look so bad yourself, 'Roy'.  I know it's not as hard for a guy to look good for a date, but it's never easy for people who find themselves living in a new life.\"  She complimented him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, thanks\u2026 Yeah I guess it took some getting used to, but your memories helped immensely.\"  Roy lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the personality changes and memories are probably the hardest part to get used to, and at the same time the easiest.  There's so much I don't have to worry about learning because your memories tell me everything I need to know about your life.  Hopefully that's not too much of an invasion of privacy\u2026\"  Asuka said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shrugged, it wasn't his life whose memories she was getting, it was her own, so it didn't bother him one bit.  \"It's fine, like you said this will help us get to know us faster than dating ever could.  I think at this point\u2026 honestly\u2026 I really like you, and think you're gorgeous no matter whose life you're in.  I hope you feel the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know the answer to that, since you have my memories.  When I first saw you, I thought you were one of the cutest girls I'd ever seen, and now that we've switched roles, you're playing a better gentleman than I think I ever could have.\"  Asuka said about Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy chuckled, \"You know though, I think your body suits Asuka's life a lot more than mine does, don't you think?  You're far cuter as Asuka than I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka thought on this for a moment, and then smiled.  \"I don't mean to sound vain but I think I agree with you.  At least in this reality you aren't adopted, since I have Japanese blood the device must have made Noriko my actual mother.  So in a sense I do feel right at home in your life Asuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My god this is just getting so adorably weird\u2026  Asuka must somehow have justified being Japanese as Roy by imagining that we were both adopted since we didn't match our parents race.  I wonder why the remote decide to change our gender to fit our roles but not our race?  Maybe it's easier to explain adoption than a girl with a penis being treated like that\u2019s normal for a girl, so it gave me a vagina when I was Asuka.</i>  Roy continued to muse on the device's capabilities and zoned out staring into Asuka's eyes as their food arrived and she continued talking.</span></div></div>",

She grinned at him and said, \"You think we should try messing with some people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was caught off guard, this wasn't the way she normally acted.  He expected her to be much too shy to even bring the device in public.  But the look in her eye indicated that she wanted to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sure, but as long as we put them back the way we found them when we're done?\"  Roy said, being cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it, if we change anyone they won't know the difference.\"  Asuka said with a whisper.  \"But you're right, we should try to be a little responsible I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about some of those guys over there who have been giving me pervy looks all night?  You saw them right?  Just cause I'm all dressed up doesn't mean I want attention from them.  I dressed up just for you Roy.\"   She said quietly with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy reached out to hold onto the remote so he could see what she was about to switch.  She activated the remote on a tall man with a beard who was sitting at the restaurant's bar drinking a beer with some friends.  He had been giving Asuka looks earlier, but had already moved onto the next piece of meat, a slender blonde woman in high heels who was trying to drink with her own friends, but kept getting pestered by this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch,\" Asuka said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the man was now sitting with his legs crossed on the barstool, with long blonde hair and wearing a tight fitting red dress and pumps.  He had the slightest bumps on his chest from small breasts that were being easily contained by the dress.  The man suddenly looked very annoyed at the bearded woman who was trying to hit on him.  She was wearing his clothing including a popped collar polo shirt and sunglasses indoors.  They noticed the only way you could tell it was a woman, was her facial structure and she had moderately sized breasts that looked weird on a man.  Other than that, the remote had changed her to be completely male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy and Asuka were giggling together quietly at their  table for two as they watched the former bro splash a drink in the former woman's face.  \"I feel bad for the woman though, she didn't do anything wrong.\"  Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, poor girl was just trying to have a good evening.  How about we let her continue her evening by swapping her girl friend with one of the other bros.\"  Asuka fired up the remote and aimed it at the brunette who was laughing at the blonde's bold move splashing the drink.</span></div></div>",

The girl seemed to think everything was fine, and was acting just like Roy would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you shoot it yet?\"  Girl-Roy asked with a sing-songy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no I didn't shoot it yet, hold on\u2026\"  Asuka said as she searched the crowd to find out where the actual Roy was (or who she thought was actually Asuka's real body).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there was a brunette sitting next to the blonde guy/girl who was looking very confused right now.  Asuka didn't want to risk firing the remote from so far, so waved over to the brunette to get her to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you waving to?  Is that someone you know?\"  Girl-Roy was extremely confused at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette walked over and Asuka recognized her face as Asuka's (actually Roy's real face), but otherwise the brunette looked very feminine.  She had small breasts and shaved legs under her mini skirt, and was wearing very high heeled boots.  As she walked, she seemed to have no trouble walking in heels, but was constantly trying to pull her miniskirt down but it would go no further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, Asuka\u2026 good to see you\u2026\"  Roy said to her, with a glance down at the remote that she should do the switch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever inside Asuka was really enjoying this\u2026  \"Hey what's up?  Fancy seeing you here, love the new outfit by the way.\"  She said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy played along, \"Oh yeah, it's a great outfit, so sexy huh?  I bet you'd look good in it if we switched clothes or something wouldn't you?\"  He said with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized the fun was up and should probably fix the situation, she pulled the remote away from Girl-Roy, and swapped the two of them back, though this time she was the only one holding the remote.</span></div></div>",

She had been clinging very closely too him all night, and resting her head on his arm whenever possible.  Roy rather enjoyed the physical contact she was giving, and hoped maybe she wanted more than just dinner tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy opened the apartment door and was met with Sarah and Jack cuddling together on the couch watching a movie in the dark.  Roy turned on the light and they paused the movie in shock, seeing Roy come in with a gorgeous Japanese girl locking arms with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone!\"  Asuka called out.  \"Oh yeah, I'm Asuka, nice to meet you!\"  She said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was the first to pick her jaw up off the floor, \"Hi Asuka, I'm Sarah.  I don't think Roy ever mentioned you before\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy interjected, \"Well we just met a few days ago, but we hit things off immediately, and I think our date went really well tonight.  Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded and kissed Roy on the cheek, not letting go of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took his eyes off Asuka long enough to give Roy a grin and a knowing nod.  \"Nice job Roy, looks like you two get along great.  I'm Jack by the way, I'm his roommate, and Sarah's my girlfriend, but she practically lives here she visits so much.  Welcome to our humble apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack said this, Roy caught eye of Sarah's cat jumping up onto the back of the couch, and Sarah grabbed her before she got hair everywhere, \"Oh sorry Roy I forgot to mention, I brought my cat over for the weekend, since my apartment is getting repainted and I'll be staying here for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I hope Asuka isn't allergic to cats, are you?\"  Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka shook her head, \"Nope, I love cats!  She's so adorable, do you think I could pet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked around awkwardly, and noticed the paused TV, \"Maybe you can pet the cat later Asuka\u2026 we'll let you guys get back to your movie, I didn't mean to disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded, tugged on Roy's arm and the two of them hurried over to his bedroom, and closed the door.  Roy kicked his shoes off and sat down on his bed to relax, when he noticed Asuka was removing her high heels as well.  She padded over barefoot to sit down next to him on the bed.  Without her heels, she was once again the very short girl he remembered meeting not so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat on the bed, she swung her feet back and forth nervously, not looking Roy in the eyes.  She looked deep in thought, and he wondered what was going on in that pretty head.  He took a risk and put his arm around her and pulled her in close the way she liked.  \"What's wrong Asuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\u2026 that's the problem\u2026  I've had more fun this evening as Asuka than I've had in my whole life as Roy, and I don't know if that's your personality influencing me, or if I'm legitimately loving being you.  It feels amazing to be able to get dressed up and grab people's attention.  I'm feeling more and more female every minute of the day, and I'm embarrassed at how much I like it.  Tell me I'm not the only one experiencing this?\"  Asuka asked, with wide eyes looking into Roy's.</span></div></div>",

Asuka still believed she was the real Roy, so he had to explain things as if he was Asuka in Roy's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not alone\u2026  I've been going through the same situation.\"  Roy lied.  \"I've been bombarded with memories of being Roy the past few days, and now I feel like that's who I've been my whole life.  I really love being with you, and by you I mean Asuka.  I think you make a far better Asuka than I ever did, and you're far more attractive than me as well.  I mean think about it:  You're Japanese already, and in this reality you're not adopted, you're the natural born daughter of Noriko.  You have a real mother who loves and cares for you, instead of an adopted white family.  The same goes for me, not being adopted by Noriko, and actually being the natural born son of my mother Helen.  It just makes sense this way.  Your body, your personality, it's all perfect for Asuka, and I've been falling in love with it ever since you became her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded, \"Yeah, that's all true, I agree\u2026  If I didn't know any better, I'd say we were meant to be like this.  But I'm still not sure I'm ready to be a girl for the rest of my life.  How about we forget about this for now, and instead, you show me what it really feels like to be a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka giggled and kissed Roy, unbuttoning his shirt a few times before he got the hint.  Roy kissed her back, and ran his fingers through her auburn dyed hair.  Asuka began slipping out of her dress, until she was only wearing her bra and panties.  Not just any bra and panties, but Roy noticed they were far lacier and revealing than the kind she used to wear.  Between the lingerie, the short dress, and the pumps, it seemed Asuka dressed with the sole purpose of impressing Roy and getting laid tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like the underwear, I wore it just for you to take off\u2026\"  Asuka teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid back on the bed with her hair sprawled out a round her head, and Roy began unhooking her bra while leaning over her body and occasionally kissing her.  Once her perky breasts were free, Roy began kissing and sucking her nipples instead, and rubbing the other with his hands.  Asuka began moaning and couldn't control herself.  Roy was sure Jack could hear across the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Roy managed to slip out of his clothing as well, and Asuka's eyes went wide as she saw his penis come out from under his boxers.  \"Does it always look so huge from this angle?\"  Asuka teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka was still wearing her panties, but instead sat up and knelt on the floor, taking Roy by surprise when she started going down on him.  A jolt of pleasure went through him, as he hadn't expected her to be so willing to try oral\u2026  It took him by so much surprise, that he ended up reaching orgasm quite fast, and he noticed Asuka ended up taking some of it down her throat, but she moved her head when she realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she wiped her mouth clean, she looked up and said, \"Sorry if that was so sudden, I've just  always wanted to try that, or at least Asuka's mind told me I always wanted to try that\u2026 I don't think I did before today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did amazing, let's just keep going.  I'm going to uh\u2026 Get the condom.\"  Roy reassured her, putting on the condom he got earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded and slipped out of her panties, presenting all her female glory before Roy.  She spread her legs on the bed and invited him inside.  \"I want you inside me Roy\u2026 please do this for me.  I want to know how it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka moaned like never before, and had to put her hand over her mouth a few times.  \"Unnhg, oh my god, keep going.  Roy this is amazing.  Roy! Oh god I love you, almost there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes more of this, Asuka finally let out one loud moan and her whole body shook as she climaxed with Roy inside her, clenching her muscles around his penis, causing him to blow his load as well.  The two lovers lie spent on the bed, spooning together with Asuka still impaled by Roy's member.  She was afraid to move and just sat there cuddling with him as they both had no more energy left to continue.</span></div></div>",

I think the main benefit to being Roy is seeing you as Asuka, being so beautiful and perfect.  I'm not even bullshitting, I think you're perfect for that life.  Your body just fits the female role so much better than mine, if you hadn't noticed.  I have no boobs, and no curves.  I'm not even Japanese.  Doesn't it make more sense for you to be Asuka?  Asuka is the girl I fell in love with last night, and I want her to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded and smiled, \"I think you're onto something, since you're being a much better Roy than I could be.  I think we should think on it some more, and spend some more time like this.  We have this device that can change our lives back to normal, but I think neither of us wants to go back to what's normal anymore.  We'll just have to see what happens, and make our decision when we're ready.  So... do you really think I make a good girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy chuckled, \"Are you kidding? Just look at yourself!  The mirror doesn't lie.  You're so completely a girl right now, both physically and mentally.  You're extremely attractive, you're fun to hang out with, and you do these Asuka things that make me smile every time.  Stuff that a guy would never do, and which makes you unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's settled then, I think I'll spend another day as Asuka, and maybe I can 'meet' your roommates some more today!\"  Asuka said cheerfully.  She put air quotes around meet because of course she already had Roy's memories before, and was quite familiar with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally got dressed after kissing a few more times, they were practically inseparable.  Asuka had nothing to wear but the fancy mini dress from last night, and her high heels, so that was what she wore.  Her hair was a mess after all the action last night, but she managed to toss it around to make it something that was somewhat presentable, since Roy had no styling tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the bedroom, and Roy headed for the kitchen to make breakfast.  He noticed Sarah was sitting on the couch with her laptop, and her orange cat snuggling next to her.   Sarah saw the two of them come out and gave a knowing smile to Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhh, how'd you guys sleep?\"  Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka blurted out, \"Oh crap I wasn't that loud was I?\"  And then she covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just laughed, \"Yeah actually, you were.  But it's fine, I can totally understand\u2026  First date and everything right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded, \"Yeah first date, sorry if we made a lot of noise\u2026 things just kinda you know\u2026  Anyways I'm going to make some eggs if you want any?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka rushed over to the kitchen, \"Oh, oh, can I?  To be fair Roy you're not very good at cooking, and I want you to taste my omelet!  Sarah can have one too if she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no thanks, I already ate, you two go ahead.\"  Sarah told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stepped back and let Asuka cook, since she was so eager, and so he took a seat at the counter, noticing that Asuka had left the device on the table since she had no pockets right now.</span></div></div>",

What's the worst that could happen?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sneakily grabbed the remote off the table, and fired it at Asuka who was busy cooking omelets.  He then fired it at Whiskers, making sure to not be seen by either of them.  When he made the switch, the results were completely unexpected.  The cat's fur had gone from orange to a reddish black, and her ears were missing, transformed into slightly hairy human looking ears\u2026  The cat was missing her tail, and something about her face looked a tiny bit less cat-like than before.  <i>That can only mean\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the stove frying eggs was Asuka, but immediately Roy noticed her hair color had drastically changed.  She was now sporting quite an orange ginger looking hair color, which looked odd on a Japanese girl, but somehow worked.  The next obvious thing, she had a tail.  As she cooked, she hummed some song that was in her head, \"Naa, nya, naa\u2026 la la la\u2026\" and her orange fur covered cat tail swayed back and forth to the rhythm.  Her party dress from last night even had a little cutout spot for her tail to fit through so it didn't ride the skirt up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was mesmerized by what he saw, until he noticed Asuka had finished cooking and was setting the omelets on the table.  When she turned towards him, he noticed her orange hair blended in with the pointy ears sticking up over her head which had tufts of orange fur on it.  Under her hair where human ears normally were, was just flat skin, and her cat ears twitched when Whiskers made a slightly human sounding meow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like it Roy!  It\u2019s a bit spicy, is that ok?\"   Asuka asked, tilting her head with a slight inflection on her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took a bite of the food, \"Oh wow, yeah no, it's great!  Like ten times better than what I had in mind, good job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka was beaming with pride, and gave Roy a deep kiss on the mouth.  Roy was surprised to notice that he could barely hear a purring noise coming from Asuka, and his tongue felt some slightly pointy cat fangs among her teeth!  <i>Wow this remote can do some crazy stuff!  She's still more human than cat, but it's almost like it knew how to turn her into a real version of a typical anime cat girl.</i></span></div></div>",

The orange hair he thought was actually pretty sexy on her, and the ears looked undeniably adorable.  The only thing that bothered Roy was her tail kept moving around and occasionally brushing up against him while he sat next to her eating the food.  One time he gently grabbed the tail and stroked the fur, causing Asuka to let out a half moan half meow, and it seemed to be turning her on.  <i>I'll have to keep that in mind for later in the bedroom\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it Roy not here\u2026\"  Asuka giggled, slapping Roy's hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead Roy just kissed her cheek and stroked her hair, tickling her cat ears a little.  Asuka squirmed in her seat and couldn't stop giggling.  \"Royyyyyyyy\u2026 cut it out you know my ears are ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm sorry, they're just so cute\u2026\"  Roy teased.  \"So Asuka, I was wondering if you wanted me to drop you off at home for a while so you could get changed, you've been wearing the same dress since yesterday.  Not that I'm complaining, it\u2019s a great look for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds like a good idea, I could use a shower too.  But where has your roommate Jack been?  I barely got to talk to him yesterday?\"  Asuka smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Sarah walked in and picked up her cat, which had given up most of its catlike features to Asuka, and now lacked a tail, had human ears, and no fangs or claws.  Roy realized Asuka's nails had definitely gotten longer, she never had them manicured before, so she must have gained catlike nails as well.  But they were barely noticeable and looked cute on her hands.  Luckily, the cat named Whiskers, hadn't lost its whiskers, and Roy felt like that would have looked rather strange on Asuka's cute face.  Asuka's eyes stayed human as well, though her eye makeup now had a much more catlike look, to reflect her catlike personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah held her cat up to her face and let it lick her nose and smiled.  \"I'm glad you met Whiskers, she seems to have taken a liking to you Asuka.  It's not every day she meets a cute cat girl like you.  By the way, Jack is actually at work today, so he won't be back till tonight.

He forgot how short Asuka normally was without those new high heels, and he had to really lean over to reach her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started washing Asuka's new ginger red hair, and her kitty ears twitched whenever the water hit them.  Roy rubbed some conditioner through her locks for her, and loved the feeling of her smooth hair.  When it came down to soaping up Asuka's body, she wanted his hands all over her, and the two washed each other.  Roy's hands went all up and down her body, and he felt a very fine invisible layer of hair, which he didn't remember her having before.  That and her hairy ginger bush must have come from swapping with the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly they washed her tail with a special shampoo she never had before, until it was very soft and fluffy.  The two spent extra-long in the shower, feeling each other up, and making out, and Roy still wasn't sure how he felt about Asuka's cat features.  They enhanced her cuteness and made her act more sexy and catlike, but some of the physical changes made him a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower, they helped each other dry off, and Asuka started spending a long time drying and styling her hair after it was soaking wet.  Roy had already gotten dressed and was watching her do this, and was amazed at all the work that went into styling women's hair after a shower.  She had to make sure to not hit her ears with the brush because they were extra sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember you being such a master of hair styling and makeup before Asuka, very impressive.\"  Roy told her.  Asuka just smiled, exposing one of her cat fangs a tiny bit.</span></div></div>",

After Asuka was all cleaned up and fresh, she got dressed in a new outfit, this time a more casual pleated flared skirt and a spaghetti strap camisole.  She put on a pair of wedge heel sandals that brought her height up only a few inches.  Roy noticed her skirt was also modified to have a cutout for her fluffy tail to fit through, with a little velcro strap near the top that she could unhook to take off the skirt without hurting her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got back in Roy's car and they spent the day driving to stores, small restaurant for lunch, and in the afternoon decided to go to the pier to walk the beach and enjoy the fresh air.  Asuka drew attention from people, as you might expect a girl with cat ears and tail to do, but no one gave her more than a double take.  It seemed that in this reality cat girls were a rare sight, but not completely unheard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the pier they walked past a food shack which was selling fresh fish sandwiches, and it caught Asuka's keen sense of smell.  She ran over to get a good look, \"Hey Roy, these smell amazing!  Do you wanna have one?\" she said, already pulling her wallet out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka, we just had lunch like half an hour ago, you're hungry again?\"  Roy asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but I mean these are sooo good.  You don't smell it?\"  she said, already having paid for one and was biting into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just shook his head and passed, noticing the shack owner shrugging.  \"Cat girls are great customers, what can I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka finished the fish sandwich quickly as the two walked down the pier towards the beach.  They spent an hour walking up and down the beach, taking in the sights and watching people play in the water and in the sand.  Asuka made sure to jump away from the water every time a wave came in, she seemed afraid to get her feet wet.  They had a good laugh about it and got ready to head back to Roy's apartment\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was being clingy again and hung onto Roy's arm again as they walked inside.  Her tail was also wrapped around Roy's waist subconsciously, which made Roy slightly uncomfortable.  They were met with the sight of Jack and Sarah in the living room with Jack on his computer and they were both watching a TV show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey guys, we're back!\"  Roy said as entered the apartment and got settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah noticed them first, \"Oh hey!  Are you two still up for dinner later?  You look like you both had a pretty active day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka's cat ears perked up at the mention of food, \"Oh yeah dinner sounds great!  I can help cook if you want me to.  I've been snacking all day but I'm still hungry some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finally looked up from his computer, \"Oh hey Roy, and uhh, Akira?\"<br>\r\n\"Her name's Asuka, not Akira\u2026\"  Roy corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, Asuka.

Leave the poor girl alone!  She's a guest!\"  Sarah smacked Jack on the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\u2026 well, just call when you want to start getting dinner prepared, we're going to hang out in my room for a little bit.\"  Roy said as he put his arm over Asuka's shoulder and led her to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were only planning to be there a few minutes to wind down after their long day, and Roy didn't bother shutting the door.  Asuka put her purse down on the bed and took off her wedged sandals, letting her toes wiggle free as she sat on the bed.  Roy went on his computer to check his emails that he had missed all day, and was completely zoned out for a few minutes.   Out of boredom, Asuka pulled the role swapper device out of her purse, and began fiddling with it, inspecting the little markings and lines that decorated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Asuka let out a cute little squeak as Whiskers the 'cat' leaped up onto her lap, and began rubbing her face on Asuka's legs.  Asuka put down the remote on the bed in order to pet Whiskers, and her cat girl tail began to rhythmically sway on the bed sheets as she scratched behind Whisker's human ears.  Roy could hear purring from where he sat, and thought it was Whiskers, but remembered Asuka had that trait now.</span></div></div>",

In a flash, Asuka now sat on the bed with Roy's body, dressed in her feminine clothing.  She had no idea anything was wrong, and even still had small minimal breasts and a vagina, just like when Roy was inhabiting her life.  Except this time, Asuka's mind was inside.  The device caused duplicate Roy's mind to revert back into Asuka's, but she still had memories of being swapped with Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Asuka's memories, she had bumped into Roy carrying groceries, and introduced Roy to her family.  That night she made love to Roy and then the two of them swapped lives to experience life from the other side.  She thought she had spent the last few days living as Roy, and now found herself back in her own life, though in reality, she hadn't gone anywhere.  She possessed a feminized version of Roy's body with female organs, but she no longer looked like the short Japanese beauty that she was before.  She instead looked like a feminine man with long hair and wearing women's clothing.  But to her and everyone else, this was how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Roy, he now possessed Asuka's body, but with slightly smaller breasts and short hair and a penis.  Roy also had Asuka's cat ears and tail and other features, making him a cat boy?  His face looked like Asuka's Japanese face, but lacking any makeup, and he was wearing his own male clothes.  His mind was left unchanged, and he thought everything was still perfectly normal, that is, until Asuka started acting funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\u2026 hey Roy\u2026?\"  Asuka asked, in Roy's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  What's up?\"  Roy asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Sarah's cat just activated the remote\u2026 We're back in our normal lives again, didn't you notice?\"  Asuka sounded worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  She activated the remote?\" Roy asked, with Asuka's cute voice.  His cat ears twitched as he thought,<i> weird\u2026 I don't see anything different.  She must be aware of the change because she was just petting the cat.</i>  \"I don't see any difference, I'm still Roy, I didn't switch lives\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka heard this and assumed the device had just affected Roy's memory to think he hadn't switched lives, though she was convinced that they had.  However, in reality, the two had only switched physical bodies, while keeping their own lives.  She felt lucky that Whiskers had merely put things back to normal when things could have gone much worse, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Roy's mind was racing with paranoia about what had actually changed if he had no memory of it.  <i>Well I'm confused\u2026 she said we swapped back to normal, but I'm pretty sure I was already normal before\u2026  What did that cat\u2026  Wait the cat?  Roy felt his cat ears with his slender hands.  That's right\u2026  I swapped Whiskers with someone\u2026 wasn't it Asuka?  But she doesn't look like a cat girl.   I could swear I was born as a cat boy but\u2026 maybe the remote DID mess with my memories.  I'm pretty sure cat people aren't normal.  I guess I should fix this and swap myself back with Whiskers.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Asuka wasn't looking, Roy grabbed the remote from Whiskers, and fired it at the cat\u2026</span></div></div>",

He wondered if he should even tell Asuka about the cat thing or not.  However, what Roy didn't know, was the part of Asuka that had been in Whiskers contained part of her physical and mental essence.  When he swapped himself with Whiskers, Asuka's essence was absorbed into his being, causing him to not be the same as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, although before he had Asuka's body, his previously short male hair style was now slightly longer and more feminine, his breasts filled out fully to Asuka's original size, and overall he looked more feminine than before.  Mentally, he started gaining a small amount of Asuka's mannerisms and personality traits, though they were merged with his own.  Little did he know, but he'd just absorbed the part of Asuka that enjoyed being, well, feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like you said Asuka, everything is back to normal again\u2026 right?  So we shouldn't worry about it.\"   Roy said in Asuka's tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka looked at him strangely, \"Yeah but, hey why do you have the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was\u2026 um\u2026 just making sure it wasn't damaged from Whiskers jumping on it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka seemed suspicious, but dropped it, \"Alright\u2026  So now that we're back to normal, I suppose I should go help Sarah prepare dinner\u2026 not sure how well that's going to work out though.  I mean I'll do my best but I'm not the greatest cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled at her, and said meekly, \"Oh, well what if I um\u2026 helped you guys?  I totally want to try to learn cooking the way you and Sarah can.  I'm absolutely awful at cooking, so maybe I could learn a few pointers\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wasn't quite sure why he was saying these things, he'd never had any interest in cooking before.

Roy and Asuka took that as their cue to head back into the kitchen and help Sarah get started.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a recap on swaps so far: Roy was now in Asuka's short Japanese body in his own Roy life, and Asuka vice versa.  Roy involuntarily swayed his hips as he walked, due to his female bone structure, but it all seemed perfectly normal to everyone including him.  Roy's Japanese hair also had grown into a feminine bob cut since swapping Asuka's essence out of Whiskers, and his personality had some elements of Asuka's now.  In contrast, Asuka seemed to have lost some of her feminine personality traits when she was swapped into Whiskers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah saw the two of them approaching and smiled, \"Hey I was just about to start!  Asuka if you wouldn't mind helping me chop these vegetables that would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stepped in quietly, \"Actually, I'd like to help too.  I need to learn how to do these things\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was more than happy to let Roy help as well, and showed him how to chop.  As the three of them cooked, Jack was simply watching them and zoning out back to his computer every now and then.  Roy quickly found he was enjoying this, and Asuka, though she knew what she was doing, was already getting very bored of cooking.  <i>I should do this more often!  Maybe if I learn to cook for Asuka\u2026</i>  Roy thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the three of them cooking, things went pretty quickly, and they soon had a full meal for four.  It was Roy's idea to add an Asian style to the meal, having remembered some of the food Asuka's mom cooked, and he had really enjoyed.  Asuka knew the recipes, but she didn't seem to have the same passion for cooking that she had before.  They called Jack over and everyone started enjoying the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spoke up first, \"Wow this is actually\u2026 surprisingly good.  You said this was Asuka's recipe?  We should have you cook more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka replied, \"Well\u2026 yeah but honestly it was Roy who did most of the cooking, I just showed him what to do.  He really learned quite fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy blushed in embarrassment, \"Well\u2026 I just learned from the best, Asuka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026\" Sarah started, \"You two have been spending a LOT of time together lately.  How was it you two met?  You seem to get along like you've known each other for years\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka smiled, \"Yeah\u2026  Well the past few days have been quite an experience together, we've learned more than we ever needed to know about each other.  I had seen Roy around when I was eating lunch between classes, and when I was carrying groceries home, he helped me carry things like such a nice guy that he is.  I thought he was cute and invited him over, one thing led to another, he was eating dinner with my family.  Then well\u2026 he asked me out on a date and here we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy noted that some of what Asuka just described was not her own memories, but what he experienced when he was in Asuka's life.  He wondered if Asuka was now back to her normal self, and acquired those memories in place of the duplicate Roy that had once been in her head.  Either way, he was glad the duplicate Roy situation was taken care of, and she was back to her own state of mind.</span></div></div>",

The two of them made love that night in each other's bodies, though they still had no idea.  Roy looked like Asuka with a bob haircut and breasts and a full female body, except with male parts between his legs instead.  Asuka looked like Roy with long hair and female parts, and everyone thought this was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them woke up the next morning after a long exhausting night, very satisfied.  They both got dressed and Asuka called up her friend Yumi to meet them for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Roy, are you sure you want to switch with Yumi?  If she gets all your memories, she'll think she's you and she'll think she's dating me\u2026  I don't know how comfortable I am with dating someone else in your life.\"  Asuka asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 what if I switched with you, and then YOU could switch with Yumi?  Then you wouldn't have to deal with your best friend wanting to kiss you all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but then she'd be kissing my boyfriend and\u2026\"  Asuka stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Is that what I am now?  I see\u2026 so you just don't want to be jealous\u2026\"  Roy smiled and kissed her again.  \"Asuka you know I only have eyes for you now.  If you don't want to get Yumi involved, we could swap and I'd be your girlfriend Asuka\u2026  I really want to experience being you again\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

I can't help it if I grew up as a man with a very feminine body\u2026 and you're one to talk.  But\u2026 it's not that I enjoy being a girl, rather, I enjoy being you\u2026  It's exhilarating, especially being you and experiencing the way you feel about Roy.  It makes me very happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 I did enjoy being you, and seeing you in my life was strangely fun, so I guess I see what you mean.  Even still I think I should switch with Yumi so I could go to school with you, and make sure you keep out of trouble!\"  Asuka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at lunch, Yumi showed up and gave Asuka a friendly hug, and introduced her to Roy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instantly, Roy found herself sitting in Yumi's seat, and felt the unfamiliar weight of very long black hair cascading almost down to her waist.  She was wearing a white dress similar to the one Roy first saw Asuka wearing.  Roy felt her body for a moment and noticed she once again had female parts between her legs, and her breasts were bigger than they normally were, probably pushing a DD cup she guessed, though her dress was fit perfectly to contain them.  <i>Switching into a female life always seems to increase my breast size a little bit\u2026 odd.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to Yumi's body who now was nearly flat chested and had short hair, and most likely had Roy's male parts.  The new 'Roy' found nothing wrong with this, and was confused as to why the new 'Yumi' was feeling herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka lightly hit 'Yumi' on the shoulder, causing her to remember to stop feeling herself in public.  \"Well that was a great lunch, but I really have to get going 'Roy'\u2026  Yumi and I were going to spend today studying for chemistry, there's this huge test tomorrow.  But I will call you next chance I get ok?\"  Asuka told the new 'Roy' with Yumi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed sad that Asuka had to leave, but knew that they had a really great weekend together and she had even slipped up and called him her 'boyfriend'.  \"I look forward to it Asuka, I really want to see you again soon, ok?\"  He smiled and gave Asuka a deep passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka blushed fiercely as the body of her friend Yumi practically made out with her in public.  She pulled away and forced a smile, knowing this wasn't the real Roy.  When 'Roy' left, Asuka and 'Yumi' gave each other a look and then fell into a fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god that was so weird, getting kissed by Yumi's body\u2026 I didn't think that was going to happen before we got a chance to switch.  So 'Yumi'\u2026 did you want to switch with me now?  You look beautiful as Yumi by the way\u2026 I'm actually jealous.\"  Asuka said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy blushed nervously, \"Thanks\u2026 but I bet I'll look even more beautiful as you than I do as Yumi.  You're just so much more stylish and pretty Asuka\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in Yumi's life, Roy seemed to have a more passive, submissive personality.  It was likely due to Asuka swapping her conservative wardrobe with Yumi's stylish and sexy one the week before.  Asuka had gained Yumi's confidence and assertiveness when she made that swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they must decide if they want to stay this way or have Roy be Asuka and Asuka be Yumi.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was no longer down to her waist, but was styled wavy and dyed auburn in a very cute Japanese style.  She was wearing the same outfit Asuka was wearing, a flared skirt and camisole that revealed her now very impressive cleavage to the world.  Roy felt taller wearing the wedge heels Asuka had on, but was still much shorter than Asuka with Roy's male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these were the physical changes, but mentally, Roy felt the familiar flood of memories returning to her, this time faster than ever.  It hadn't been this extreme with Yumi's memories, but as soon as she swapped with Asuka, something changed.  The essence of Asuka's personality that had been living inside Roy, was mostly dormant before, but now completely embraced being back in Asuka's life.  Roy felt a surge of bliss as she felt completely at home in the life of Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it feels so good to be back\u2026\"  Roy said to herself.   \"I almost forgot what it felt like to be Asuka, I really love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka, as Yumi, giggled a little bit, \"You're enjoying that way too much, but I think you're right\u2026 you do look even more beautiful as Asuka.  It's so weird seeing you as me, from the eyes of my best friend Yumi.  But hey I guess we'd better get used to this for now!  We're besties!\"  'Yumi' gave 'Asuka' a big hug with her masculine arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two had settled into their new lives, 'Yumi' drove them to Asuka's house to study.  'Asuka' greeted her mother, Noriko, who wondered where Roy was.  She almost seemed disappointed that Asuka had brought a girl friend over, but knew that it was good that Asuka was making friends at school finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went up to Asuka's room and actually studied for quite a while, until the two girls fell asleep cuddling in each other's arms from exhaustion.  They were still dressed when they woke up, but 'Asuka' could tell the real Asuka was a bit weirded out by waking up cuddling with her best friend, since she must have been getting some of Yumi's memories by now.  They didn't talk about it, and got ready to go to school to take the big test.</span></div></div>",

Roy took full advantage of having Asuka's memories to pass the test, because it was all high level science stuff that she would normally have no clue about.  However, Asuka with Yumi's memories actually managed to score higher than Roy as Asuka had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Asuka, I only got like 10 points more than you\u2026 don't feel disappointed.  You did great!\"  Asuka said as Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just feel like I could have done better, I let you down\u2026  If I fail these tests it's your life I'm messing up after all.\"  Roy said in her cute female voice, brushing her long auburn hair aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your life right now, keep that in mind.  I'm having plenty of fun living as Yumi, you should enjoy living as me!\"  Asuka said in a rather feminine way with her male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you're not in my next class, so I'll see you in an hour ok?\" Roy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two parted ways for their separate classes, and Roy once again sunk into the role of Asuka, letting her memories completely take over her actions.  She paid very close attention to the lecture, and took very well organized, neatly written notes.  She then barely felt a vibration from her purse, as she got a text from Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey cutie, you ace your test?\" He wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Asuka' blushed and hid the phone's screen in case anyone saw her.  She felt herself have butterflies in her stomach thinking about Roy.  <i>It's been so long since I've gotten this excited for texts from a guy\u2026  This is like a high school romance all over again.</i>   'Asuka' sighed and realized she was giddy as a schoolgirl around Roy, and already missed him being around.  She had to remind herself that it wasn't the real Roy, it was Yumi's body, but he acted just like Roy\u2026  She didn't even want to acknowledge to herself that she used to be the original Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 I didn't quite ace it, but I passed at least.\"  She typed, and then added, \"You on your lunchbreak?

There was a part of Roy who still saw 'Yumi' as Asuka's body and wanted to kiss his girlfriend, but 'Yumi' wasn't her girlfriend, it was her best friend.  As long as she had Asuka's memories, that's all she could see Yumi as right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm headed back home now, do you want to come over?\"  'Yumi' asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um\u2026 well I was hoping to see Roy later\u2026  I mean\u2026\"  'Asuka' stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yumi' giggled at her, \"Come on, you aren't still obsessing over him are you?  You can spend some time away from him and hang out with me, right?  I mean you remember who we really are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm\u2026 yeah I do.  I just\u2026 I really miss Roy, but I guess it'll be fine.  The only difference is when you're Yumi we can't\u2026 you know?\"  'Asuka' said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake 'Yumi' just smiled and got in the car.</span></div></div>",

They were both girls at the moment, at least between the legs, but Roy still felt that Asuka somehow would do a better job of being Roy than Roy would.  <i>Her body has such broad shoulders and a masculine face\u2026  And plus, in our 'normal' reality she's adopted by her Japanese mother, but in this reality, Noriko is my biological mother, and I don't know if I could give up having a real mom\u2026  If Asuka takes over my life as Roy, she would be a man yes, but she would have a biological white mother as well, and I think that would make her happy\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy snapped out of her pondering finally, \"Yeah\u2026  I really do enjoy being a girl.  I don't know what it is.  Being Asuka is more enjoyable than anything I've ever known, and it just feels natural to me.  When I was Yumi for a brief time, it felt weird, different, but weird.  I wasn't comfortable as Yumi the way I am as you.  I don't even know if I could go back to being myself again.  You realize in this reality I have a real biological mom?  Mom, I mean, Noriko, is so loving and kind to me, and she wants to see us get together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true, you and Noriko do get along really well in this reality.  Probably better than I ever got along with her.  She cherishes you now, proud to have you as her daughter.  And she should, you're perfect as Asuka\u2026  I don't know if I am.\"  Asuka said dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Don't say that, you were a great Asuka!\"  Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026 I was an average Asuka at best.  I never really felt comfortable being so feminine and expected to be cute and dress pretty.  You seem to have adapted to that in a few short days faster than I could my entire life.  People always made fun of me growing up for having such a masculine body for a girl, but in this reality you're cute, feminine, likeable, kind, and still a brilliant girl.\"  Asuka was now on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy embraced her and the two hugged it out for a few minutes.  It was a friendly comforting hug, like the kind Yumi and Asuka would give each other when the other was feeling depressed.  When the real Asuka was finally done crying, Roy wiped her eyes and looked into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asuka, you shouldn't listen to what people like that say.  You were the Asuka I fell in love with.  Don't ever forget that.  It doesn't matter if you're Asuka or Roy, or even Yumi, I still love you.\"  Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Roy, in Asuka's body and life, kissed Asuka in Roy's body and Yumi's life.  Asuka's personality was still present in Roy's mind, and she found it very weird to be kissing her best friend all of a sudden, and pulled away quickly against Roy's will.  Asuka also seemed to have the same reaction from Yumi's personality, and understood why she pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka smiled, \"I love you too Roy\u2026 and I think you're right, about everything.  You are a much better Asuka than I am, and I would be happy to be your boyfriend if that's what you want.  Everything you said is true, I think I do enjoy being Roy, especially if it means having a beautiful girlfriend like you.  But right now, I'm still stuck as Yumi, and we can worry about this later.  Maybe tomorrow I can switch back with Yumi and become Roy\u2026  Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy raised her eyebrows and smiled as well, \"Oh yeah, that sounds perfect.

They went back to school and sat through the lectures which were rather uneventful.  'Asuka' was glad there were no tests today, so she could just relax and think about what they had talked about last night.  She was dreading what would happen that evening when the they swapped Yumi back into her own life.  <i>Will Asuka change her mind and insist that she wants to be herself again\u2026?  I don't know if I want to go back to being Roy anymore.  This life feels so much more natural to me now\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long day of class, the two girls 'Asuka' and 'Yumi' drove over to Roy's apartment to sort everything out.  'Asuka' didn't own a car so they had to take Yumi's, but that was ok with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, 'Roy' answered the door, with Yumi's feminine body and voice, and said, \"Hey Asuka!  Good to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake Roy then pulled in 'Asuka' (the real Roy) in for an embrace and kissed her on the lips.  'Asuka' felt herself getting tingly and wet for a moment, before she reminded herself this wasn't the real Roy.  She pulled away and awkwardly smiled at the fake Roy with Yumi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFake 'Roy' continued, \"And good to see you too Yumi!  What's the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yumi' smiled, \"Hey Roy\u2026  I gave Asuka a ride and she said I should come stay to hang out?  Is that ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure no problem, come inside!\"  'Roy' showed them all in.  It turned out he was the only one home at the moment, with his roommate Jack being at work, and Sarah finally back at home with her cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat down in the living room and 'Asuka' instinctually sat close to 'Roy' with both of their feminine bodies rubbing up on each other.  The fake Roy still looked like Yumi for the most part, aside from shorter hair and male organs, but he still had breasts that were not being constrained by a bra.  The real Roy as Asuka cuddled up close to Yumi's body and they kissed briefly before 'Asuka' realized what she was doing, and went back to simply cuddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to see the real Asuka looking almost jealous of the two lovers, and was gripping the remote tightly.  Roy forced herself to scoot a tiny bit further from 'Roy' in order to show Asuka she didn't mean for anything to happen.</span></div></div>",

I guess we should start the movie then?\"  'Asuka' found herself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned on Netflix and fired up the movie they all wanted to watch.  Yumi gave the couple some space, and watched from the other couch.  Meanwhile, Roy and Asuka were cuddled up lovingly in each other's bodies.  'Asuka' was still under the impression Yumi was swapped into Roy, and kept resisting his advances every time he would try to flirt with her during the movie.  The real Asuka kept pretending to be Roy, and made advances on Roy in her body.  Asuka was surprised at how resilient Roy was being to these advances, and instantly felt guilty at being so jealous before.  Roy seemed very uncomfortable and was avoiding any kind of physical contact beyond cuddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie got more intense, 'Roy' wrapped his hands around 'Asuka' and began holding her tighter, but she squirmed out of his grasp and continued watching the movie.  'Roy' gave up trying to provoke 'Asuka', and simply left her alone for the rest of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, Yumi stood up, \"Wow that was a pretty good movie, thanks for letting me stay and watch.  Hey can I use your bathroom Roy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Roy' nodded, and pointed down the hall to where the bathroom was.  Yumi walked off and 'Roy' put his arm around 'Asuka' again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy\u2026 stop, why are you being so grabby today?\"  'Asuka' complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mistrusted you Roy.\"  'Roy' said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\u2026?  How did you\u2026?\"  'Asuka' was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Asuka.  I swapped back with Yumi when you weren't looking, and now she's back as herself again\u2026\"  'Roy' admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 so how do you have Yumi's masculine body then?  You look and sound just like her.  I don't see anything different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you weren't touching the remote silly\u2026  To you, it all seems normal I guess.  This masculine body is my own that I've had my whole life, but the remote made you think it was Yumi's I guess.\"  'Roy' said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026  I remember you had a girly feminine body, one that I find very attractive.  This masculine body you're in now is nice\u2026 but it's Yumi's body, your best friend.  It just feels weird to be attracted to it.\"  'Asuka' said, shortly before Yumi returned from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thanks for letting me watch the movie with you guys, but I've actually gotta get going.  It's getting pretty late and I have to get up early tomorrow, you know how it is?\"  Yumi said, entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Asuka' began to panic that Yumi was about to walk off with Asuka's 'real' body.</span></div></div>",

'Roy' looked like the original Roy, and 'Asuka' looked like the original Asuka.

Her tears had turned from feeling of betrayal to sadness to joy in a matter of minutes, as she realized the original Asuka had just agreed to stay as Roy.  Something about her personality had come to completely accept being Asuka, and she wanted to stay this way for the rest of her life.  She still had memories of being Roy, but they now felt distant and foreign, and it didn't really bother her one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy\u2026\"  Asuka said, calling him by his new name, \"So you're ok with staying this way?  I mean\u2026 not just for now, but permanently.  I want to be Asuka forever\u2026  Let's embrace our new identities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy, still with memories of being Asuka originally, thought about this for a moment.  He smiled and said, \"Ok, well it's nice to meet you <i>Asuka</i>, my name is Roy.  I'd love it if you were my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend that I love\u2026  With these new identities, maybe we can start again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy leaned in to kiss Asuka, and though they had kissed many times over the last few weeks, to Asuka this felt like her very first kiss with him, and meant the world to her.  The kiss lasted until she almost forgot to breathe through her nose and gently pulled away with a smile and taking a deep breath.  She stood up and silently motioned for Roy to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka disappeared into his bedroom, and Roy gave her a moment before following.  When he entered, he saw she was still fully dressed, but had her panties out from under her skirt.  Her panties were around her ankles as she sat seductively with her legs crossed on the edge of the bed.  She gave him a sly grin and noticed that Roy was already getting very turned on.  Roy sat down next to her and with a distracting kiss, reached under her shirt and unhooked her bra easily, as he had worn bras for his whole life when he used to be Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka giggled at how easily the bra came off, even under her shirt, and scooted up the bed, lying on her back with her legs still together and panties trailing behind.  Roy climbed over her and admired the perfect feminine curves of the skirt around her hips.  The shirt quickly came off, revealing Asuka's perky bare breasts, which Roy began massaging.  Asuka felt herself getting wetter than ever before, now that she knew this is what she could experience the rest of her life.  It was like pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn\u2026 don't rush it, let's take it slow.  We have all the time in the world now.\"  Asuka cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned loudly as Roy pulled her skirt up and began pleasuring her orally, teasing her close to the edge of climax, and then stopping just short.  The teasing was driving Asuka crazy, and she could barely think straight her mind was so clouded by being on the edge.  Roy continued to toy with her for a while, but she loved it, and seeing her like this turned him on so much he was about ready himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen neither could finally take it anymore, Roy undressed himself and Asuka spread her legs.  The two of them then became one in orgasm as Roy pulled out and erupted all over Asuka's chest.  Asuka herself orgasmed in pure bliss and had no cares in the world right now.  After recovering, the two lovers went at it again, and again, until they were both too exhausted to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay together for an hour without saying anything, but just looking at each other and smiling, nearly falling asleep in the process.  Until Asuka spoke up, \"That was the best sex I think I've ever had, both as a guy and a girl, the best ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy smiled, \"You weren't so bad yourself, you cute little minx\u2026  I can't believe how a cute girl like you can be so seductive when you want to be.  Did I use to be like that when I was a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe, it's hard to remember anymore.  I just remember you were irresistibly cute, and you did seduce me once or twice\u2026\"  Asuka giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, I think you make a much better Asuka than I ever did.  I find myself completely smitten with you, more than I ever imagined possible.  I'm absolutely honored to have you as my girlfriend.\"  Roy said, \"And\u2026 you mentioned you want to be Asuka permanently, does that mean you don't even want to use the remote anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?  Oh no, of course we can keep using the remote\u2026 but not right now.  There's plenty of time for that some other day,\"  Asuka said with a cute, heart melting smile, \"For now I just want to enjoy this moment.  I have to get used to my new life, and things are never going to be the same again after today.\"</span></div></div>",

He even managed to find a better job than the burger place, and was making more than minimum wage working as a paid intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka was quite proud of how the new Roy was improving his life, and was almost embarrassed that she hadn't done any of those things when she used to be Roy.  <i>It's not my life anymore though, I should be proud that Roy is improving himself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, their tender moment was interrupted by the unmistakable feeling of being watched.  The new Asuka looked around her boyfriend's room, trying to shake the eerie feeling.  That was when she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Roy.  Or I guess it's Asuka now, cute.\"  Said the voice of Roy sitting in the chair across the room.  His legs were crossed casually and he was dressed in fine men's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka immediately recognized him as the one who had given her the remote when all this started, back when she used to be Roy!  Then a few seconds later, she realized she was lying nude in bed with her boyfriend, and this other Roy was watching her.  She blushed and covered herself up with the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in our room, couldn't you knock?!\"  Asuka cried out rather loudly, clutching the bed sheets to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sat up in bed, instinctively holding his arm out as if to protect Asuka.  However this Roy had no memory of the alternate reality Roy who had given the remote away.  \"Who the hell are you?!  Why do you look just like me, Roy?\"  The new Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternate Reality Roy stood up from the chair, smirking at this new Roy.  \"I guess you used to be Asuka right?  You two make a lovely couple, I must say.  You see I've been monitoring this reality ever since I gave Roy that Role Swapper.  You wouldn't believe how many different ways I've seen that play out.  Very few of them end with happy endings like this.  The alternate versions of me almost always end up screwing everything up and getting trapped as something or other.  You'd be surprised how many of them decide it's a good idea to swap themselves with an inanimate object... Let me tell you, that usually doesn't end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Roy was dumbfounded, and took a moment to think of what to say.  \"So... the remote, it came from you?  You gave it to the original Roy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka nodded, \"Yeah he did.  He told me I could use it to create whatever reality I wanted.  And I'm glad it ended up the way it did.\"  She smiled sweetly at her boyfriend, giving him a peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternate Reality Roy watched with a patient smile.  \"That's sweet, really.  But I didn't come here to perv on you two in the bedroom.  No, that was just random chance.  I actually came because something serious happened, and I might need your help.  Both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka just stared at him, \"Why would you need our help?  Aren't you like some god of the multiverse or something?  Go use your remote to change reality or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly clutched his sides, bursting into laughter, \"Oh wow, you flatter me sweetie, really.  I'm not a god of anything, I'm just Roy, like you were.  I was just lucky enough to come from a reality that had an advanced civilization in it.  One that learned how to monitor other realities and study them.  There's only one problem, many of the realities we were monitoring have simply ceased to exist.  I think one of the other Roys must have fucked up so badly that he affected the whole multiverse.  Entire branches of reality are simply gone from the spectrum.  Yours was one of the few that I could find which still had a working Role Swapper and you hadn't swapped yourself with a spoon or some nonsense.  In fact, it's the first sane reality that I've found which escaped the calamity.  It took me days to reconstruct the link to this timeline just so I could speak with you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alternate Reality Roy was speaking, he paced about the room, and had his eye on the Role Swapper sitting on the nightstand.  He made a reach for it, but Asuka was quicker, snatching it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came back for the device right?  You want to take it back from me?\"  Asuka snapped, clutching it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recoiled his hand, casually placing it on his lips as though he was in thought.  \"Well with the recent multiverse schism, these have suddenly become much higher in demand, but no.  I could just build more if I wanted to.  I invented it after all.  No I wouldn't have anything to gain from stealing your Role Swapper.  You two seem to be very responsible with it.  I actually came to recruit you to work for me.\"</span></div></div>",

Asuka and Roy jumped in surprise, looking around to see if he was still here.  But he had simply disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asuka began putting her bra on, Roy still hadn't moved.  \"Asuka?

If he looks like me, does that mean he also used to be Asuka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka shrugged, stepping into her panties and pulling up her skirt.  \"He's not lying though, this is the same guy who gave me the remote in the first place.

Maybe some other swaps happened that we don't know about, but there's no sense worrying about that now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed and began slowly getting dressed while watching his lovely girlfriend slip into her tight fitting shirt, and fix her hair.  A few minutes later, they were presentable, and Alternate Reality Roy appeared in the room, once again startling them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, can't you just use the door?!\"  Roy barked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Roy simply ignored him and paid more attention to Asuka.  \"So yes, it's true that more  swaps occurred in this timeline than you're aware of, resulting in the bodies you have now.  But ultimately it has made you both happier than you were in your previous lives, so it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka narrowed her eyes, \"How did you\u2026?  Nevermind.  Just tell us what this whole recruiting thing is all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down at the end of the bed, crossing her legs and dangling a bare foot in the air in front of her, while Roy sat close to her side.  They waited patiently for the alternate Roy to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\u2026 well\u2026  With all the problems going on in the multiverse, I am finding it hard to be in two places at once.  My boss may have gotten a bit upset at me for handing out Role Swappers to people in primitive dimensions like your own, and he didn't hesitate to say he told me so.  He doesn't exactly know I'm here right now, and I still need to check up on the remaining realities.  You see it's not healthy for the universe to have so many missing realities.  My boss thinks it\u2019s a bad idea, but in truth, the only way to fix this is to kick start the creation of a bunch of new realities.  That's where you two come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your\u2026 boss?  I thought you were some genius inventor?\"  Asuka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I gotta get investors to pay for my research somehow, so yeah, I don't exactly work alone.  It's not important, I just need you two to go talk to these other versions of us in the multiverse.  I still have a list of many of the possible outcomes that were created, but I'm still not sure which one ended up tearing apart the universe.  If you can encourage these Roys to start recreating these bizarre things using the Role Swapper, I can monitor things from my end.  Then I'll intervene when I find the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026 in the meantime, you just want us to create chaos?  You want us to travel to other dimensions and mess with other Roys?\"  This reality's Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to mess with them, just give them a Role Swapper and set things in motion.  Trust me, the other versions of us will cause more than enough chaos.  Not all of them are as responsible as you two.  And yes, I say you two, even though technically only one of you is the real Roy in this reality.  But since Asuka has done such a fine job taking over as Roy, I'm proud to welcome you into the Roy family.  At least it's not like that one reality where Roy created like 100 clones of himself\u2026\"  The alternate Roy explained with a shrug.</span></div></div>",

Never mind, I wouldn't expect you to understand.  It's all way beyond your current level of science.  Right, well I'm glad to have you on board!  Here, take this case full of all the tools you'll need.  Make sure not to let it fall into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a case appeared in his hand, and he set it on the floor in front of Asuka.  It was about the size of a suitcase, but appeared to be very sturdy and made with some sort of futuristic material.  She picked it up and was shocked at how light it was for its size.  She placed it in her lap and the latch unlocked as soon as she touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been bio-locked to Asuka's life signature, regardless of what form she's currently in.  Sorry Roy, but she's the original Roy after all, and it could only be bound to one.\"  Alternate Roy said with an apologetic smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the case and saw nearly a dozen identical Role Swappers, and another device that didn't look familiar at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the device you'll use to travel to other dimensions.  Find a Roy that is worthy of a Role Swapper and give it to him.  Feel free to observe him or simply move on, your choice.  But what's important is that the multiverse begins to branch out again.  I really appreciate you helping me out with all this.  If you have an emergency there's a hidden red button on that thing which will help me track you to the right dimension.  Thanks again.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuka looked down to inspect the new device, and when she looked up again, the other Roy was gone.  He'd disappeared as quickly as he'd appeared, and now she was once again alone with her boyfriend.  The only evidence he was ever here was the case full of futuristic devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sighed, \"So you're really going through with this?  I thought we were happy with how things turned out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy!\"  Asuka quickly replied, \"I couldn't have asked for a better outcome, becoming Asuka, and having a loving boyfriend like you.  But this doesn't change that.  We can change the world, many worlds even.  And who knows, after this is over, we might get the chance to travel to this universe where we're super genius inventors.  We could learn so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.  You've made your point.  Let's do this then.  Where do we even start now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026 I guess we should get ready to leave, and then hit this button.  Right?\"</span></div></div>",

This Roy was expecting what he wasn't was how much bigger everything was, apparently his body had changed somehow. He turned to the guardian with him and said unexpectedly truthfully \"I have to go to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Baby, Mrs. Thompson and Ronnie should be back soon then I'll take you.\" The woman, presumably Roys new mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute a black woman and girl came out of the store. The girl came up to him standing a few inches taller and the woman said to Mrs. Thompson \"Now Connie has to go, we'll be right back.\" With that Riy followed his presumed mother into the store and where gided into the womans room, as he was guided into a stall he was able to steal a quick look at hhimself. Except for the long red hair he looked like a shrunk version of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember something Sarah had said he pulled the skirt up instead of dropping it and pulled down his flour panties. Shockingly he found between the legs that had always been his own (though lacking the familiar hair) a vagina that hadn't. \"<i>I'll worry about that later</i>\" Roy thought as the pressure got to be to much and he relived himself. After wiping the new addition to his body he pulled up his panties and dropped his skirt and went to wash his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on himself in the mirror, as he washed his hands, the only new details he took in where his eyebrows matched his hair, his eyes had turned green, and his ears where pierced with two silver stars each, one holding a clear gem of some sort on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back Roy now Connie and Ronnie talked for a little while since it was slow. Roy was able to learn some things about his new life as Connie, that they where best friends, where in second grade, that woman was his step mother who he called mama (mom and mommy being reserved for hsi birth mother who was serving in the army) and that his favorite color was green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the occasional customer only so far and Roy found himself enjoying it, though he did use his time to discreetly look for the remote. It didn't take to long to search the whole stand with no luck. After 2 hours things started to pick up, objectively Roy thought that he would probably be doing something similar if he was still Roy, but it was alot more fun as Connie the Girl Scout.</span></div></div>",

She was going to need new appolstry on the back seats, but there was no way she could take the time for that with her busy schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Connir went to put on her work uniform. Her shift started in just under an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie had always figured that by the time she was twenty-three her life would be calmer then this. She'd done well in high school, gone on to college... but now interning while perusing her master's degree and working had left her with little time to even breath. She shared a tiny apartment with a roommate (her best friend Veronica and more frequently her boyfriend Alex). She herself had no time for a boyfriend (not that that's what she was into). And the best job she could find around her internship and schooling was slaving away as cashier at the local Burger Bonanza establishment. In essence, she was a glorified button pusher, working alongside teenage kids and high school drop-outs, earning little more than minimum wage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I hate my life,\u201d Connoe reiterated, sliding on her Burger Bonanza uniform shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't,\u201d said a strangely familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie spun around and was greeted by her own former spitting image \u2013 only better dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been sixteen years\" Connie said to Roy not missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, time doesn't exactly flow at the same speed between realities.\" Roy said sitting on Connies bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you doing?\" Connie asked putting her work shirt over a purple t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I spent what was six months for me overhauling the safty features on this thing.\" Roy said holding up the roll swapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie eyed it briefly before going to sit next to Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't belive you\" Roy said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Connie asked defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy, I mean Connie I first met you as a 23 year old Burger Bonanza employee with a roommate and part of the time the person their dating. After what to you was 16 years living another life, I find you as a 23 year old Burger Bonanza employee living in the same appartment with a roommate and part of the time the person their dating.\" Roy chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment of thinking \"Huh, you're right. But this time around it's different, I'm working part time for spending money while pursuing a degree in engineering with an internship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must not leave you alot of free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm lucky I may have a half hour a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you could use a vacation\" Roy said pulling the Roll Swapper back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moments trepidation she took it. \"And you're sure the improved safty features are enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confident of it.\" Roy said and with a smile he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I only ever used this crazy thing once a lifetime ago, time to test it out.\" Connie said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does she target first?</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a tight, sleeveless cheerleader shell and matching mini-skirt. The many folds of her loose, wrinkled skin were now clearly exposed everywhere. Her hair was still pure white and brittle-looking, but it was now much longer and tied back in a fashionable looking scrunchie. Her face was plastered with lip gloss and sparkly makeup... but she wore a furiously, impatient scowl as she angrily honked the honk and cursed at the slow moving, young woman who had just taken her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird,\u201d said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Originally written by SandySeeker)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked out his second-story apartment window, down into the parking lot below and scanned the crowd for a suitable test subject to experiment on. He quickly zeroed in on a wealthy-looking woman out walking a small, white poodle. The woman didn't look familiar to Roy. He surmised she was perhaps out \u201cslumming,\u201d visiting some poorer neighborhoods to show off her own good fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy guessed the woman was in her early forties. She wore an expensive-looking pink suit \u2013 a bright, pink jacket with a white blouse beneath, paired with a matching, short pink skirt. Her legs were sheathed in unblemished, pure white tights. She clicked smartly along the pavement on a pair of bright pink, stiletto heels. In one hand, she carried a bright pink handbag... in the other, she held the leash attached to the dog. Roy could see an elegant string of pearls around the woman's neck. She was wearing what looked to be gold bracelets and sparkling, diamond earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling mischievously, Roy pointed the device out the window and aimed it directly at the woman. After pushing the button, he pointed the gizmo back at himself and pushed the other button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, he found himself outside holding the lady's purse in one hand and the dog leash in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt... it really worked!\u201d said Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself: he was physically male but now completely dressed in the rich woman's clothes. Somehow, they had all magically been adjusted in size to perfectly fit his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poodle looked up at Roy and barked, eager to continue their walk. Apparently the dog was utterly unaware that Roy was not its original original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a minute, in a minute!\u201d Roy impatiently told the animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill restraining the dog with one hand, Roy dug around best he could in the strange woman's purse. His hands were still large, masculine and a bit hairy \u2013 but his nails had grown out and were lacquered with a thick, glossy coat of burgundy nail polish. He also wore a series of expensive looking gold and silver rings, encrusted with various small diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. A particularly large, expensive looking woman's wedding ring was now wrapped around one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a big of digging through the woman's purse, Roy managed to find a makeup case with a mirror. Holding up the mirror to his face, he examined himself. He was still obviously Roy, but his ears were now pierced and he was definitely wearing expensive looking diamond jewelry. He also wore a thick coating of bright pink lipstick, sparkling gray eyeshadow, and heavy, black mascara. He cheeks seemed to be painted with a combination of foundation makeup and blush, evidently in an effort to hide the middle-aged woman's early wrinkles. Roy's hair had now grown out considerably and hung just above his shoulders. It was carefully styled like a rich, 40-something woman's hair would be. He touched it and found it was coated with a hard, crunchy layer of hairspray to hold everything perfectly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Roy found his reflection resembled that of an older sister or aunt \u2013 obviously related to Roy, but with all the hair and makeup done, he actually looked mostly feminine now. His stocking-clad legs had been shaved smooth too, he noticed. Other than his flat chest, broad-shouldered build, and large, masculine hands, there were no obvious signs he wasn't actually a rich, middle-aged woman now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy could feel he was still physically male where it counted. But he also felt the strange, silky, smooth presence of this strange woman's panties rubbing against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder who exactly I am,\u201d he muttered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poodle barked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy continued to dig through the purse until he finally came up with a driver's license. With some surprise, he recognized the photo in the license was now the face he'd just seen in the mirror. Apparently reality had been altered so everyone believed Roy's body now matched up with this strange, rich lady's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is... Charlotte Veronica Walton,\u201d said Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

How dare you speak of my Beauty as though she were some mongrel!\u201d Roy replied with utter indignation at the manager who had asked that Beauty, the original Charlotte\u2019s dog, be quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that is my family\u2019s patronage that keeps this decrepit neighborhood from complete ruination, you insipient fool. If my precious Beauty is such a bother I would be happy to leave and take with me the grants and loans that have revived this area. Is that what you wish, young man?\u201d The manager, who in reality was much older than Roy, looked completely cowed by Roy. The man attempted to stammer a reply, but all that came out was incoherent, apologetic sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stared the man down as he walked away, he took out the compact mirror in his purse and was met by a face similar to his own, but with more feminine features and the faint lines of an older woman who had taken great pains to stave off age. Roy was slightly concerned by the reflection, but at the same time felt it was more becoming. \u201cLynda, I must visit the powder room after that incident, would you be so kind as to watch Beauty for a moment? I wouldn\u2019t want another simpleton frightening my darling,\u201d Roy asked, and for a moment he was perplexed that his voice sounded different than he was used to but thought nothing of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Charlotte! Would you like me to call a driver in the mean time? After that episode I would like to leave this dreadful place,\u201d Lynda replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sentiment exactly, Lynda, thank you. I shouldn\u2019t be long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy made his way to the bathroom, giving another withering look to the manager as he passed. He huffed as he saw the decidedly simplistic d\u00e9cor in the bathroom but figured he wouldn\u2019t be in there long. Looking in the mirror was a surprise however, staring back at him was someone he could barely recognize as himself. I appeared that the device had continued to work since the original exchange and had turned him into a facsimile of the original Charlotte Walton. He could still recognize his face, as he\u2019d seen in the compact earlier, but the rest of him had changed quite a bit. The pink skirt suit once again contained a decidedly feminine silhouette and it would be impossible to say he wasn\u2019t a woman with the prominent breasts that the pink jacket now covered. The absence of a tent on his expensive skirt  was evidence enough that he was no longer a he in the strictest sense of the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stared in amazement for a bit, but as he studied the image in the mirror he got a sense that this was a much more appropriate body for him The idea of being man, let alone a loser as he had been was simply repugnant. He did feel self-conscious about the spanx he knew contained his belly. It wasn\u2019t easy to stay in shape with all the galas and events he had to attend to after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishing out some make up from his purse he deftly applied a new coat and walked back out to where Lynda was waiting with Beauty. The two chatted a bit longer until a car pooled up to pick them up. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not entirely leave the thought how fascinating it was that he was now considered to be a rich middle aged women. He absently listening to his, or rather his character Charlottes, friend Lynda gossiping about her trip to the Riviera with her husband and her daughters family, while he smoothed the rim of his expensive pink skirt of and wiggled his similarly colored heel resting on his crossed over leg. He took a not that it still felt quite warm even though it was a bit windy here outside at the Cafe. He still couldn't really get to terms that he was actually wearing this stylish and expensive pink skirt suit that literally screamed femininity. He laughed silently in his mind, and to the whole situation and even just the thought of meeting up with Charlottes +45 friend who did not suspect anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda continued gossiping and was now enthusiastically talking about her daughters new husband had become an associate for the law firm her husband was running. Roy scouted the terrain of potential victims around the Caf\u00e9 while he played with the device. There was a construction site across the road with muscular construction site workers dressed in purposeful and somewhat dirty clothing, a group of scrawny student\u2019s mostly male ones but one or two girls sat at a larger table at the other end of the Caf\u00e9, stressed, but not the least well dressed business people hurried passed them on the pavement. He considered for a moment swapping the roles of a well dressed business man in a suit passing by and one of a bearded and sad looking construction worker giving them both an entirely new perspective of life, and perhaps how they cast their votes. Roy smiled for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back his attention to Lynda who was rummaging around in her blue purse. She was quite a good looking woman too, for her age will say. Similarly to Roy, she had a stylish voluminous hairstyle, although a natural blond, as one can expect to find on a rich womans head if dressed in the attire she was wearing. Roy had almost decided now after some more thinking. He wanted to play with two of the students. He had picked out one of the scrawny students, a blond boy dressed in white dirty sneakers, jeans with holes on the knees, and a gray T-shirt with some college name printed in faded letters, and he had also selected one of his friends, a somewhat pretty girl with a dark hair, pony tail, no make up, and dressed in a plain blouse and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynda had searched her purse and by now she had fished up a stylish black leather cigarette case and a black golden lighter, and Roy somehow remembered that Lynda was a smoker. Roy refocused again on the boy and girl students pointed the devices to the boy and pressed. Unknowingly, Roy had, while playing with the device shoot somewhere already once a minute ago, and know when he pressed the button on the device, the boy did not remain the same as he expected until he was going to press the second time aiming at the girl. Instead, the boy was now looking a bit rounder and had a more female but familiar looking face but of course with the same hairstyle. Roy turned back to Lynda, while contemplating what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked to see the boy he just zapped sitting across him in Lynda\u2019s deep blue expensive skirtsuit and, he had Lynda's long cigarette dangling right between his thickly coated red lips which he was now lightening while his cheeks billowed deeply inwards. Sh..t, thought Roy. This was unexpected. The boy let his hand with his manicured nails crowning his fingers move the cigarette to the side of his shoulder while he blow out a long billow of smoke up to the side. He immediately continued to talk about his 5 year old granddaughter and how good stay-at-home-mum his daughter was, exactly like she had been herself 25 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was dumbfounded, and laughed like crazy inside. He watched the scrawny and completely unaware boy in his big blond female hairstyle, his face plastered with make up, dressed in the tailor fitted blue skirt suit and a white silky blouse complemented with all the expensive jewelry like the pearl necklace he had on, and at the same time the boy was smoking Lynda\u2019s long cigarette like it was the most natural thing to do. Roy was very proud, and happy for the slight hiccup. He doubted that the boy even smoked, or perhaps even considered doing it, before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched over towards the students as they took off. The old Lynda brought up a skateboard from underneath the coffee table and as soon as she got out on the pavement she speedily kicked away and waved back to her friends screaming something about the movie tonight. The last Roy saw from her was when she did a skillful trick on the skateboard, jumping from the pavement to the street while twisting the board a full turn around its axis as she then headed around the corner out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the boy in his new life as Lynda and covered in a cloud of cigarette smoke, Roy asked the new improved Lynda if</span></div></div>",

Charlotte, as a 43 year old woman, was not fat, but her buttock and thighs were definitely a size larger and heavier than the teenage boy\u2019s was, and still Roy had seen her mastering advanced skateboard tricks, almost like defying the gravity. The thin teenage boy had fortunately not noted the swap this time either as he become Charlotte Walton. As they had said goodbye, the boy clearly thought about him as Charlotte Walton. He had called for his poodle dog \u201cCome on now beauty, time to go home\u201d, and he had happily walked away in his little pink skirt suit to his new home, marriage and life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy somehow knew that he, as Lynda Johnston, had some errands to do, and stopped at the new outdoor shopping center. Roy steps out, lock the car, and put down his keys in his blue leather purse. Roy looks down at his feet where he finds Lynda\u2019s classy blue heels and his legged wrapped in natural toned sheer hose. \u201cWhat\u201d, Roy exclaim as he discover that his own right hand is clasping Lynda\u2019s cigarette case which he unconsciously must have brought up from his purse when put his car key in it. Damn, this smoking thing is automatic, he reflects. \u201cI can equally well follow it through\u201d Ray thinks, as he takes out one of Lynda\u2019s long cigarettes that he know is marketed for women only and he put it between his pink painted lips. Roy was unaware that he behaved exactly as Lynda, and let Lynda\u2019s cigarette dangle between his lips for quite a while as he rummaged through Lynda\u2019s, no his, purse to locate the lighter. Roy was standing outside an outdoor caf\u00e9 all the time, and got a bit irritated before he finally found his black golden lighter and could lit his cigarette. As Roy filed his lungs with the tobacco smoke for the second time of his life, he accidentally overheard some boys at the caf\u00e9 in their late 20\u2019s. \u201cWow that is a smoking hot milf\u201d one said, \u201cI would definitely do her\u201d another said. Slightly disturbed at the comments, but nevertheless a bit proud as he realized that they meant him, Roy blew out a billow of smoke. \u201cYep, I\u2019m a smoking hot milf\u201d, Roy confessed for himself proudly, \u201cstill got it, despite the age\u201d, mixing his own age with Lynda\u2019s. Suddenly realized the double meaning of the \u201csmoking\u201d thing of the expression and laughed silently inside himself. Roy did not realize it but reflexively he did not just smoke exactly as Lynda, but also walked and moved exactly like her. As he tiptoed down the alley, to the shops he targeted for his errands, he heard some whistles after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got to a nail salon, he threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped onto it with his blue heel. Roy was greeted by an Asian woman who asked him \u201cDo nice nails?\u201d. \u201cEhh yes\u201d Roy responded. \u201cSame as usual\u201d, he said as he thought Lynda went here often. \u201cSame, same, lah\u201d the Asian woman returned and got to work. In the end, Roy's nails was in better shape than ever, but still had the same pink nail color as before. Roy went automatically to the adjacent hairdresser store, and set up a time for his hair the day after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to his new home Brentwood was uneventful, although it required a bit of navigating. The gates opened automatically and he followed the driveway with a row of cedar trees along its sides. As he reached the mansion he thought it almost resembled a small palace. \u201cWow, this lady and her husband are loaded\u201d he exclaimed, realizing that his days working days were over. Roy parked just below the stairs of the huge mansion, and a well dressed middle aged man came down and greeted Roy with \u201cHow was your day madam?\u201d in a polite British accent. This is too good to be true, I even have servants. You remember vaguely that this is Stanley. You take out some shopping bags from the boot, and Stanley drives away and parks your car. Roy walks up the stairs to the building, and as he enter the large hallway, a younger black haired beauty welcome you home too, in a bit of a Spanish sounding accent. This is Maria, our maid you vaguely remember, and Roy find him requesting \u201cMaria, Would you be so kind to bring up those shopping bags in my room, and serve me some coffee at the terrace\u201d. You are flabbergasted at the ordering her around. \u201cThat just came out by itself\u201d, Roy tells himself silently. Still, a coffee at the terrace sounded great in Roy\u2019s mind. Maria takes your bags, and walks up the large curved stone stair. \u201cAnd a small cake also\u201d, Roy routinely shouts after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stops in the hallway and watches himself in a giant mirror giving him a perfect full view of himself. Roy take in every detail, from his feet in the blue heels, his legs in the sheer hose, the blue perfectly hanging skirt stopping just below his knees, his flawlessly fitting skirt suit jacket, and his blue leather purse with the strap over his right shoulder. For the first time, he sees his upper part of the body too. Underneath his jacket is a white blouse in some soft silky material, his hair has the same size and volume Roy saw on Lynda and then the skateboarder boy. Roy\u2019s lips wear a light pink color in exactly the same shade as his nails. Naturally, the rest of the face also wears Lynda\u2019s makeup, well his makeup, thinks Roy. He finally realizes that he got Lynda\u2019s pearl necklace and earrings too. That means that my ears are\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee is ready\u201d, Roy is brought back to reality from his dreamy state, as Maria calls out again \u201cYour coffee madam, on the terrace!\u201d Roy goes through the hallway, passing a small library, and then passes a spacious classical furnished living room with large windows towards the terrace. At the large terrace Roy is welcomed by a splendid view over his green garden and property sloping down to a stream in the distance. As he sit down at the table with a coffee (and the small cake), he again find that he is already holding his the cigarette case in his hand again. Damn, \u201cthis shit is really automatic\u201d Roy utter, as he succumb for a cigarette. Though there is some soothing feel to it, he had to admit, and in his mind he has a vague idea that he took up smoking some 20 years ago at college. Of course this was utter nonsense, he knew, as it was only a few hours ago he tried smoking for the first time in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drinks his coffee and finishes his cigarette, Stanley comes out and reviews the arrangement for the evening in an orderly manner. \u201cWhat arrangement\u201d, Roy thinks first. \u201cSo, your daughter with family comes in an hour, and Harold will be back just barely before they arrive\u201d, Stanley tells you. \u201cAhh, yes Harold, my husband\u201d, Roy remember Lynda mentioning, and Stanley look at you strangely. As Stanley recaps the last details, Maria comes out and cleans the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then thought about a program he saw on TV the other week, about gender equality. This is a too good opportunity to missed, Roy thinks. Suddenly stands Maria at Stanley\u2019s place, in a shorter butler like hairstyle wearing Stanley\u2019s clothes and speaks with his posh British accent. Stanley on the other hand, is now with his longer black colored hair cleaning the last things from the table but dressed in Maria's working clothes with her, but no his, low heeled black pumps, a long black skirt, a white apron in its front, and a white half transparent cotton blouse. Roy can even make out details of Maria\u2019s white lace bra that Stanley is now wearing underneath his blouse. \u201cSo that is all madam\u201d says Maria, to get an affirmation from Roy that everything is in order. Roy nod, and in the meantime Stanley head out in the kitchen with his tray carrying away the plates, cup and things from the coffee Roy just had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy realizes that he is in a bit of hurry now, and head upstairs. Finding the bedroom was easy, and he now realizes that Harold and Lynda, well that now meant himself, did not share bedroom which Roy was quite happy for. \u201cIt is getting better and better\u201d he mumbles for himself. He finds the bags Maria carried up on his bed, and Roy explores the room. \u201cI must check out wardrobe\u201d Roy says loudly to himself, and he opens the door to the walk in closet and look around. \u201cHmmm, I\u2019m definitely a skirt suit lady\u201d Roy state as a fact and smiles after seeing and counting to not less than 17 different skirt suits in all different kind of colors and materials. \u201cPerhaps it is just natural\u201d Roy muster, \u201cLynda\u2019s husband is in the law business, and with his own successful law firm, it is probably a lot of representation dinners and other occasions. Roy sees some other stuff too, but leaves it for the time being. Roy takes a shower, and protects his ladies hairstyle from being wet with a large shower cap. Getting dressed presents no problem apart from which skirt suit to use. Roy ends up in a white silky camisole, and a vintage style sage green skirt suit in wool, and select accessories and shoes to go along with it. He watches himself amazed in the full body bedroom mirror as he put on the pearl earrings and necklace he used earlier today. He even put on the lacy white underwear he found in his shopping bags. Roy checks his slim ladies gold watch. \u201cGosh, the guests are coming any minute\u201d Roy says stressed and rushes down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy sees Harold, Lynda\u2019s former, but now his, 50+ year old husband out on the terrace. He is handsomely dressed in dark dress trousers, a dark brown tweed jacket, white shirt, and a classical patterned tie with some hints of brown details in it. Somehow, Roy remembers a long and happy life with him. Stanley in his new role as a young Latino chick doing his duties as a maid at a rich couple lays his last hand in the decoration and preparation of the table for the family dinner. Roy now decides to</span></div></div>",

Walking out to the hallway, \u201cGrandma, grandma\u201d screams a little girl, dressed in a red-white polka spotted dress and her blond hair is arranged with long blond braided pigtails tied with red ribbons. Roy recognizes her from the photo as Emily, Lynda\u2019s granddaughter. The little girl jumps up and hugs Roy as hard as she can and Roy hugs back to stay in character, but also as he likes the attention. Emily\u2019s parents, Victoria and Michael, greet them too with big smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo good to see you, Victoria tells Roy thinking that he is her mum. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d, \u201cDo you remember this? I bought it at the Riviera last year.\u201d Victoria shows her attire and spins around. She is hot, thinks Roy, and so like her mum in style. Just like her mum, also dressed in a skirt suit, although a more modern one with a bit of sex appeal to it. Victoria spins around again in here shiny black leather heels, black sheer hose, and her tailor made burgundy red colored skirt suit, a lacy black camisole with some shine to it underneath her jacket, and her hands clasping around a tiny shiny elongated black leather clutch purse. All jewelry, from rings up to the earrings goes in gold. One things differ though, thinks Roy, while Lynda is blond, and Roy had his hair in this voluminous hairstyle, Victoria had her dark brown long hair set up in a bun to show off her delicate neck. \u201cYou are beautiful\u201d says Roy, who really mean it, and Victoria hug him and utter \u201cThanks mum! You look great too!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy greets Michael too. \u201cHow are you mum\u201d says Michael with a big selling grin on his lips. Roy utters a hesitant but nice \u201cWelcome. Good to see you again\u201d, as he study Michael that is a bit of a well trained stud. Damn, what am I thinking, Roy stops himself, refocuses and note that Michael wears a nice casual suit with a dark gray jacket and lighter gray trousers. The black shoes and white shirt present no surprises, Roy thinks, but note that Michael's tie goes in an identical burgundy red and match his wife\u2019s clothing perfectly. Roy has a vague memory that Lynda thinks that Michael has a bit of a macho man style to his personality, and Roy can only concur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head out to the patio. \u201cYou Michael sits here beside me, Victoria you sits there right across you Michael, and Lynda you sit here so I can see you beautiful face\u201d. Harold directs the family while pointing with his whole hand. \u201cAnd for you my friend\u201d he bends down and says to Emily, \u201cyou sit at the table end with mum and dad\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eat a great dinner and small talk about everything and nothing. Stanley tiptoeing around in Maria's heels and her clothing, together with the orderly Maria as Stanley, have done an excellent job cooking and serving them thinks Roy. As Stanley now swish swashing around in his black hugging skirt and semitransparent blouse to serve them some desert and coffee, Victoria start rummaging around in her minute clutch purse and pick up a exclusive pack of cigarette of exactly the same brand Roy, as Lynda, is smoking. Damn, does she not have any fantasy or will of her own?, thinks Roy, and is again utterly shocked that he has unbeknownst to himself picked up his own black leather cigarette case again. When did I ever do that, Roy wonders? I\u2019m getting a bit tired of all that smoking all the time, Roy formulate in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for some changes Roy decides, picking up the role swap remote from his purse under the table. First he swaps himself with his husband Harold. Then he swaps his daughter Victoria with her husband Michael, but immediately finds it a bit plain, and subsequently swaps Michael to Lynda\u2019s life, and Harold to Victoria\u2019s life, both ending up with the hairstyles of their new characters. Roy watches in complete and utter unbelief how the new ladies put their cigarettes between their lips, the macho Michael right in the center of his glossy pink lips, and the older Harold likewise between his now burgundy red colored lips. Even to the extent of dangling their cigarettes, Harold in his wife\u2019s daughter\u2019s body imitates her mother Lynda, Roy observes and laughs like insane inside. The two new ladies continue to talk to each other while their dangling cigarettes move synchronized with their lip movements. Roy makes out, from the mumbling only adept smokers normally can comprehend, that they talk about some new exclusive clothing store at the outdoor shopping center. The two men light their first long woman cigarettes in life and let the cigarette smoke fill their lungs for the first time. Macho Michael pouting with his lips as he blows out a billow of smoke to up to the side, and Roy overhear Michael saying as Michael places his cigarette beside his shoulder in a ladylike manner, \u201cYou know Victoria, I really want to buy that new pink skirt suit I saw the other day. My old one is a few sizes too small. Would you be interest of my old one, the size is right for you\u201d, Harold inhabiting Victoria\u2019s life and clothing forms a big red smile on his lips and is delighted at the offer from and accepts eagerly with \u201cOohhh mum, I really love too. Thanks\u201d, and Harold hugs Michael with affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are some lucky guy\u2019s\u201d says Victoria, as she taps Roy\u2019s arm with her elbow. Roy sees her leaning back comfortably and self-confidently in the chair as she fishes up two metal cased cigars from the inner pocket her gray suit jacket. \u201cWant one?\u201d, she offers Roy in Harold\u2019s body. \u201cUhhm no, I\u2019m fine\u201d Roy respond, not wanting to smoke any more. \u201cSir\u201d, says Maria in Stanley\u2019s accent and clothing who suddenly has appeared beside him without a sound. \u201cSome scotch for the gentlemen\u201d, \u201cUhmm thanks\u201d Roy responds and hands a glass to Victoria. \u201cAnd your pipe as you requested sir\u201d, Maria continue. You wanted to say \u201cEhhhh\u201d, but instead you hear yourself stating \u201csplendid!\u201d, and you hesitantly against your will take your pipe to avoid causing any suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy is now really feed up with this idea of smoking and points the role swapping device and shoots. Roy now finds himself at the table end dressed in a polka dotted dress and Mary-Janes of size 9 with some matching white socks. Roy sees that his fingernails bear some remains from some worn pink color he remember painting and kindergarten and he has a plastic bracelet around his wrist. Most curiously, the role swapping device has turned into a toy like remote control in bright red, blue and yellow plastic. \u201caj hjope it worjks\u201d Roy tells himself. He notes that he can\u2019t really formulate the word he wants, as he involuntarily also fiddles with his braided pig tails to make him think better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat dear?\u201d, responds a little girl\u2019s voice with an adult flavor to it? Roy looks up and sees Emily dressed in Harold\u2019s re-sized clothes, the dark brown tweed jacket and black trousers, and you see her with the straight wooden pipe sticking out from the side of her mouth. She looks at you, with a smile and then focuses to light the pipe which she sucks on and as an adept pipe smoker blows out a cloud of smoke. Damn, that look weird you think, and are struck by a bit of bad conscious for the last swap. \u201cYou see\u201d, Emily says to everyone, who then pay full attention to her despite her tiny stature, \u201cto overcome the economic downturn, we need a strong leader, tax cuts and a restrictive spending of government finances\u201d she formulates herself seriously as she gesticulates with the pipe and forming some wrinkles on her forehead in concentration. Roy watch with amazement how the discussion, well more of a one sided argument perhaps, unfold and Victoria in the role of Michael agrees with occasional nods with his, she think, father in law. The new ladies, Harold in sexy statement oriented burgundy red and Michael in mature milf sage green shades, listen intently to the serious talk while occasionally reaching to the table and tapping off the cigarette ash in the crystal glass ash tray. In the end, the ladies revert back to talk about the planned shopping excursion for clothing, whereas the new Harold tells the new Michael more about the political situation and what should be done. \u201cWoaah\u201d, I\u2019m really tired, Roy thinks and finds himself lying down on an outdoor sofa and sticks his polka spotted dress wearing body under a warm quilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u201d, says Roy tiredly, as he hears \u201cTime to go sweat heart\u201d and Victoria, as the man of the young family, tries to lift him. \u201cDamn, you have got heavier\u201d she says, \u201cShhhh, no swearing dear\u201d says Harold standing beside her in his red skirt suit holding his black leather clutch purse straight down with his two hands in front of him. Roy walks to the car half asleep, just to be buckled up in the backseat by Victoria. From the stairs, grandma in sage green colors have lit a new cigarette that he holds at his right shoulder while waving goodbye to us with his left hand, and grandpa in brown waves too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's car ride home suddenly starts, with Ray in the backseat. Victoria is driving and Harold in his red skirt suit can not let his blacker leather clutch go and it rests in his lap. He inspects himself in the passenger seat mirror and skillfully touches up his deep red lipstick. Fortunately, Roy sees that he has the toy like role swapping remote with him, and he then glances into the big plastic bag at his side and sees some garment with a pinkish color to it. As Roy looks back through the back window, he watches the new rich grandparents turn around and walk into the mansion. Roy having a bit of a bad conscious for some of the swaps, \u201cDamn if I had not fallen asleep, I should have corrected it\u201d. \u201cHmm, next time\u2026\u201d, he promise himself in the backseat, before falling asleep again dreaming sweat dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Roy decides to</span></div></div>",

He quickly zeroed in on a wealthy-looking woman out walking a small, white poodle. The woman didn't look familiar to Roy. He surmised she was perhaps out \ufffdslumming,\ufffd visiting some poorer neighborhoods to show off her own good fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy guessed the woman was in her early forties. She wore an expensive-looking pink suit \ufffd a bright, pink jacket with a white blouse beneath, paired with a matching, short pink skirt. Her legs were sheathed in unblemished, pure white tights. She clicked smartly along the pavement on a pair of bright pink, stiletto heels. She was wearing what looked to be gold bracelets and sparkling, diamond earrings. Roy could see an elegant string of pearls around the woman's neck. In one hand, she carried a bright pink handbag... in the other, she held the leash attached to the dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog itself was a short, small creature. Its fur had been carefully shaved into a couple of bouncy, puffy, bouffants. It was yipping loudly and straining against its leash, eager to continue walking through the neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling mischievously, Roy pointed the device out the window and aimed it directly at the loudly yapping poodle. After pushing the button, he pointed the gizmo back at himself and pushed the other button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Roy found himself elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that he was completely nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he noticed was that he was considerably smaller, shorter... and bent over on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking his head around to survey his surroundings, Roy discovered he was outdoors now... naked in the cool, morning air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collar was wrapped loosely about his neck and attached to an expensive-looking leather leash. Roy looked back to see where the leash lead. There, he saw the rich woman from before, now scowling angrily at him and jabbering nonsensically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's she saying, Roy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it dawned on him \ufffd everything he saw was now in muted shades of gray. He was no longer capable of seeing color. He had switched places with the poodle and now possessed its black-and-white vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that was the case, then had Roy also lost the ability to understand and use human speech?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to understand the woman's furious jibberjabber, but it was in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Roy opened his own mouth and tried to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdBark, bark, bark!\ufffd he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an angry huff, the towering woman above him started to press on further, walking ahead of Roy. A moment later, he felt the tug of the collar around his neck... and he was forced to pad along on all fours behind the woman, naked in the great outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n(I added an extra option)</span></div></div>",

As the walk went along, Roy even started to bark out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, as Roy panted to fulfill his role, they arrived at an absolutely humongous mansion, even more so now that Roy was a much smaller... thing than he was before.

He wasn't particularly thrilled with the thought of being a woman, but it was certainly way better than being a dog. A moment later, he found himself standing up again, for which he was very grateful; his hands and knees were really beginning to hurt from having to crawl around on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself and found that he was dressed in the same outfit the maid had been wearing a minute ago: he had on the same short black dress and high heeled shoes, resized to fit his taller, larger, and less curvy body. Then his eyes caught the former maid, who was now on her hands and knees and eagerly chowing down on the dog food she had just placed in front of him. She was completely naked except for her collar, and her hair, which had previously been long and straight, was now short, poofed up, and curled into a rather ridiculous 'do. Roy felt a brief pang of guilt over the maid's transformation into a mindless yapping poodle... but she didn't particularly seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy spotted a mirror across the room and minced unsteadily toward it; it took all his effort to walk in these ridiculous high heels, and he nearly fell over a couple of times. At last he reached the mirror and gazed in awe at what he saw there. A beautiful young woman around Roy's age stared back at him from the mirror. She was dressed in the same French maid dress as Roy, and it showed off her amazing body to perfection: the high hem emphasized her long, shapely legs, and the low necklike showed off her ample bosom. Her face was gorgeous and delicate, and framed by long black hair, and a silly little hat that looked vaguely like a doily was perched atop her head. She didn't exactly look like the porn actresses Roy had usually seen wearing these kinds of outfits... but Roy found her to be better looking because she was a little less curvy, a little less aggressively sexual, and a lot more real. She looked like a pretty woman on Halloween, not like a sex object just waiting to be stripped out of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time Roy had had a chance to look in the mirror since using the device. Was this how everyone else would see him? He tried to imagine himself as this beautiful woman, but he couldn't; his imagination failed him. His image of himself as a guy was far too deeply imbedded in his mind. But as he gazed at his reflection, as the woman in the mirror copied his every little movement, he knew he couldn't deny the fact that this was what he now looked like to the world. He blushed, suddenly feeling even more exposed in this dress than when he had been crawling around naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least he had the device in his hand. He looked down at it, clutched in his left hand while his right hand held a dirty rag, and noted his fingernails, now long and painted a deep red. This was his ticket out of this dress. He began to think up a plan to swap into another more suitable body... but before he could come up with anything, there was a knock and the door swung open</span></div></div>",

The woman from the parking lot who had \"walked\" him home entered the room, dressed now in a more casual outfit of a blouse and slacks. She said something, but Roy couldn't make out most of the words. For a second he panicked, wondering if something wenhad gone wrong and he still couldn't understand human speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm sorry,\" he said, \"could you repeat that?\" He was surprised to hear himself speaking in a thick French accent.<br>\r\n\"I said,\" the woman said, clearly exasperated, \"why aren't you working?\" Roy could understand her this time, but it took some effort... more than it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Ah was, uh, just seeing if this mirror needed cleaning.\" He tried to force himself to speak without an accent, but it was too difficult. Slowly he realized what was going on... the maid with whom he'd switched roles must have been a French woman by birth; she spoke English as a second language. And now, so do Roy. That meant English was harder for him to speak and understand than it used to be. It was just like what had happened with the dog, when Roy had been were unable to speak or understand human language at all. Did that mean he could French fluently now? He'd never been able to get much beyond \"Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir?\" before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at Roy coldly. \"I know what you were doing,\" she said. \"Stop fluffing yourself up in front of the mirror and get back to work, you little floozy.\" Ouch, clearly she didn't think much of Roy. She gave him a hard stare, and then something seemed to catch her eye. \"Yvette, what's that in your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Roy said, looking down at the device, \"um, ah found this while I was cleaning. I don't know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like an invention from my husband's company,\" the woman said, storming over and snatching the device from Roy's hand. \"Did my husband give this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" Roy said, trying to hide his panic over the device being out of his hands, \"like ah said, I found it while cleaning. Ah was going to ask you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll ask my husband myself, thank you very much,\" the woman said. She started to walk to the door, then she turned abruptly. \"Yvette, you're THIS close to getting fired,\" she said, holding her fingers very, VERY close together. \"You give me one more reason and you're out the door for good.\" She looked Roy up and down. \"And I really don't think that outfit is appropriate for work. I don't care what my husband says. Tomorrow I expect you to be dressed more modestly.\" She turned again and slammed the door shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quelle vache,\" Roy muttered when she was gone. And yet, he thought he understood the reason for the woman's anger. He guessed the woman believed Roy--or, rather, Yvette--was having an affair with her husband. And maybe she was... the clues were all there. Roy's slutty outfit and the fact that the woman's husband had apparently insisted he wear it; her \"floozy\" remark; the fact that she believed her husband had given Roy the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had more important things to worry about than the little soap opera that was going on in this household, however. He had to get the device back. He wanted to look for it right away... his position as maid would give him the freedom to snoop around the house a little to find where the woman had hidden it. On the other hand, the woman seemed serious about firing Roy... if Roy did anything at all to upset the woman further, he might get fired and lose access to the house, and thus any hope he had of getting to the device. He might end up trapped as Yvette for the rest of his life! Perhaps it was safer to give the woman a couple of days to cool off before he started looking for the device... he could survive a couple of days as a pretty French woman.</span></div></div>",

But six of one, half a dozen of the other as far as she was concerned. Unless Roy could retrieve that device, he'd be on thin ice here. At any moment, that snooty bitch could fire him... and then what? As far as the rest of the world was concerned, Roy was an attractive, young French woman. He could only speak English through great effort and concentration. What would happen if he got fired while still in Yvette's life role? Where was she originally from? Would he be deported to France? Would he have to go out and get another job as a maid for some different snooty couple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Roy didn't much relish the idea of putting on Yvette's clothes every morning for the rest of the life. Even though Yvette's uniform had completely re-sized itself to fit his physically male form, Roy still felt deeply uncomfortable wearing this strange woman's panties, bra, garter belt, and stockings. Of all the people to switch life roles with, Roy had to wind up as some ridiculously frilly and feminine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...waitaminute, gulped Roy with a sudden, new sinking realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an even worse possibility if he remained as Yvette much longer. Before he even had the chance to get fired, he might have... a rendezvous with the rich lady's husband! After all, he was the reason Roy was dressed like this in the first place! And the woman's husband wouldn't see Roy as a twenty-three year old man in a costume \u2013 he'd see the attractive, young French floozy he's almost certainly been having an affair with! And Roy would either have to oblige him... or probably get fired by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEntre l'arbre et l'\u00e9corce il ne faut pas mettre le doigt,\u201d sighed Roy. \u201cJe dois rapidement trouver cet instrument.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy grabbed his feather-duster and hastily ran out the room, his heels clicking and clattering loudly behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Roy search first?</span></div></div>",

All he had wanted to say was that the rich woman had probably hidden the device in the master bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCe n'est pas difficile,\u201d Roy muttered. \u201cWhy can I not... comment puis-je dire?... zpeak zee English very well no more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt equally awkward with his sudden comfortable, grace in moving about while wearing Yvette's high heels. He had easily ascended the palatial, spiraling staircase with easy, lithe, feminine movements... in spite of the fact that he was clothed in a ridiculously short, tight-fitting, frilly dress replete with stockings and stilettos. The smart staccato sound of his heels clicking rhythmically on the floor echoed through the hall. Roy now moved with a fluid grace that seemed to indicate this was all second nature to him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ'ai besoin de mon vieux corps,\u201d Roy mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tiptoed over towards the door into the master bedroom as quietly as he could in Yvette's clicking heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe... must be...\u201d Roy whispered to himself slowly. \u201cWe must... nous devons \u00eatre tranquilles... we must... be... be... quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nervously tugged at the short hem of his maid's uniform, then turned the knob and entered the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took one look and let out a soft, feminine gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire old apartment \u2013 living room, both bedrooms, kitchen, and bath \u2013 it all could have fit into this one master bedroom, with space leftover!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was more of a suite, Roy reflected. There was a small kitchen area with a well-stocked bar, a sitting room, a private bath, a separate jacuzzi tub area, an enormously deep walk-in closet, and of course a monstrously large bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy found himself contemplating switching places with the rich woman or her husband if he could ever get the device back. These people were loaded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tiptoed inside and immediately went to work, quickly opening desk drawers and rummaging through cabinets in search of the Role Swapping device. He moved as stealthily as he could and tried to avoid making a mess or leaving any visible sign he had been here. Some little voice inside him warned that the rich lady didn't want Yvette in the master bedroom any longer than was necessary to clean the place. Since it was already immaculately clean, Roy wouldn't have a decent excuse for snooping around if he got caught up here. If that rich bitch caught him in here, she probably would fire him right on that spot. And that would probably mean Roy would have to spend the rest of his life with the world thinking he was a young, attractive looking French woman named Yvette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Roy was rummaging through a drawer in the walk-in closet, he heard a sound behind him. As his heart leaped into his throat in panic, Roy spun around and watched the knob on the main doors to the bedroom slowly begin to turn.</span></div></div>",

When he heard a feminine gasp behind him, he knew he was screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yvette!\" Mrs. Walton shrieked. Are you trying to steal from us now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-non, Madame,\" Roy hastily stammered, \"je, je cherchais seulement la--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, you little whore\" Mrs. Walton said as she grabbed Roy's arm roughly and began to drag him out of the closet. \"I've put up with you long enough. I've already lost my husband to you... I'll be damned if I'm going to lose anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madame, please, ah beg you!\" Roy screamed, throwing away all pretense of being a docile, feminine maid now, \"Ah was just looking for, uh, how you call eet--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Mrs. Walton shouted, dragging him out of the bedroom and down the stairs. \"I'm not going to listen to any more of your lies. You're through here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy staggered in his heels as he tried to keep up... maybe he instinctively knew how to walk in them now, but he certainly didn't know how to stumbled backward in them as his employer dragged him angrily through her mansion. His mind raced, and he tried to think up some reasonable explanation for why he'd been searching through the closet, but nothing was coming to mind. And even if he'd been able to come up with something, he knew Mrs. Walton wouldn't listen to him. It was too late for that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last they reached the front door. As a well-dressed butler and another, older, frumpier maid watched in shock, Mrs. Walton threw Roy out of the door and onto the front step. He lost his balance and tumbled to the ground, the tiny skirt of his uniform flying up into a very undignified position. \"I'll contact you tomorrow about your possessions and your paperwork,\" Mrs. Walton said coldly. \"Somewhere far, far away from the house.\" With that, she slammed the door shut. He heard a quiet click as the door was locked, and it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mon dieu...\" Roy whispered hopelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy picked himself up off the ground and straightened his skirt, balancing himself carefully on his stiletto heels. \"Et que peux-je faire maintenant?\" He couldn't recall ever feeling so bleak, so helpless. He was Yvette Dupris now, and his only means of becoming himself again was locked on the other side of a massive, sturdy oak door and hidden inside a palatial maze of chambers, guarded by what he guessed was probably a state-of-the-art security system and what he knew was a very angry woman. And that meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Et cela signifie que je serai Yvette Dupris pour la reste de ma vie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stumbled dazedly down the long brick walk to the street, and tears began to come to his eyes. He let them come. He hadn't cried since he was a child, but he had every reason to cry now. And besides, he was a woman now, right? He had a right to cry in public if he wanted to. No one would scold him now and tell him it was unmanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to take in the sheer magnitude of what had happened to him. He was a woman now, and he would be a woman for the rest of his life, and there was nothing--nothing--he could do to change that now. And he would never be able to see his friends again, never be able to see his family again, because to them, he was a stranger now. A complete stranger. His family--his new family--was probably back in France. And he was unemployed now, and homeless... even working at the Burger Bonanza was better than that. And was he even in this country legally? Would he be shipped back to France? Who knew? Though maybe that wouldn't be so bad... maybe his family there could support him until he... until he figured out how he was supposed to live the rest of his life now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wiped away his tears. Maybe it wasn't hopeless, though. Maybe he could still find some way to get at the device. Maybe he could... break into the house or something. Or talk Mrs. Walton--\"cette bete inferne\", he muttered--into giving him the device along with Yvette's other possessions. Or maybe he could hook up with one of the other members of the household staff and have them get the device for him. Or better yet, Mr. Walton...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was just better to give up now. It was probably hopeless, trying to get back the device at this point. He could probably save himself a lot of time and anxiety and heartache--maybe even legal action--if he just let it go. Perhaps his best course was just to accept life as Yvette. The faster he accepted it, the better off he would probably be. And besides, he was a beautiful woman now. An exotic foreign woman with a resume that included working for what had to be the wealthiest couple in town. Yvette probably even had a nice little nest egg saved up from her time with the Waltons. His looks, his experience, his money... these things opened doors to Roy that he'd never dreamed of before. Maybe he could even work being a woman to his advantage somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, he thought with a bitter smile... he'd always wanted to visit France...</span></div></div>",

To Roy, he was still a 23-year old man who just happened to be dressed like the quintessential naughty French Maid. But he knew from looking in the mirror (and from interacting with the likes of Mrs. Walton) that everyone else saw him as an attractive, young French woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Roy blushed with intense embarrassment at being out in public, completely attired in women's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEt je ne sais pas m\u00eame \u00e0 o\u00f9 je devrais aller,\u201d Roy sighed, again feeling hot, salty teardrops beginning to well up behind his eyes. \u201cWhat am I zupposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Walton had thrown 'Yvette' out into the streets with no purse, no identification, nothing \u2013 just a vague promise to return 'her' paperwork and belongings later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Yvette have another residence or was she a live-in maid for the Waltons? Roy suddenly had high hopes that perhaps Yvette had an apartment somewhere. But how to find it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do I live?\u201d Roy moaned. \u201cJe ne sais pas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew his name was Yvette Dupris. That was a start, at least. If Roy get a phone book, perhaps he could find a listing for Yvette and maybe an address \u2013 some clue to let him know where to go in order to start living this strange, new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked around the neighborhood, trying to get his bearings.

He struck off on foot, his tall, high-heeled shoes clicking along on the pavement. Already, his feet were beginning to ache from wearing this stupid things for just a short while. Roy promised himself a nice, relaxing soak in a bathtub at his first convenience.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully for Roy, that wasn't the case. Perhaps Yvette kept some belongings there for the occasional overnight shift she might have to work \u2013 helping with a late dinner party, for example \u2013 but fortunately for Roy, Yvette did have a private residence of her own. And it was even nearby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of a spring in his step for the first time today, Roy walked back to the circulation desk and returned the phone book, again thanking the kindly library for her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, dear,\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that 'Yvette' was no longer employed by the Waltons, she would need a job. Roy wondered idly about the possibility of applying for work here at the library? He'd always enjoyed books. It would be quiet, inconspicuous work. And he could obviously dress quite modestly at a conservative place like a library. After he got settled in at his new apartment, he'd have to return back here and inquire about any job openings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy happily skipped down the block, around a side street, and towards a large, rundown, old apartment complex. The building looked like it had once been quite stately and magnificent, perhaps back in the '20s or '30s, but had fallen into disrepair in more recent decades. Roy surmised the rent was probably quite cheap, even if this building lacked some of the pleasant, aesthetic qualities of his old apartment complex. Still, he reflected walking up the cracked, marble steps of the structure, this building has a certain unique charm to it. In some strange way Roy felt it suited his new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's happy mood evaporated when he saw the lobby mailbox labeled 'Yvette Dupris' \u2013 it identified him as now living on the top floor of the building... and Roy could see no elevator here in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerde,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWell, 'ow does zee old saying go?...Vous ne pouvez pas toujours r\u00e9aliser la victoire... You can't win... eh... win zem all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's heels clicked smartly on the steps as he worked to ascend the staircase and find his new home. After the long walk he'd already endured, he was surprised to find he wasn't all that winded by the time he reached the top floor. Perhaps he had somehow gained some new physical stamina, energy, and general athletic fitness now that he inhabited Yvette's life role?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he found the door to his new apartment, Roy was confronted with a brand new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJe n'ai aucune clef,\u201d he said simply, staring at the heavy wooden door labeled with his new apartment number and finally kicking it softly with his high-heeled shoe. \u201cI... do... not... 'ave... ze... key.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Did Yvette have a roommate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Roy's question was answered as a pretty, red-haired woman in her early 20s opened the door. Her hair was damp, as though she'd just come from the shower. She was dressed in plain, gray t-shirt and a pair of dark, green sweats. Her feet were bare and sported a cutesy looking coat of shiny, emerald green nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdYvette?\ufffd said the girl with a surprised tone. \ufffdWhat are you doing home already? Is everything okay? Ohmigosh, you look like you've been crying! What's happened?\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put an arm around Roy and quickly ushered him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdI... I... I gets fired,\ufffd Roy stammered, then suddenly the flood gates burst open. \ufffdJe n'ai plus mon travail. Je me sens si perdu! O\ufffd devrais-je aller? Je n'ai aucun argent. Je suis au del\ufffd de triste! Aidez-moi. Je me sens tr\ufffds d\ufffdprim\ufffd. Je ne sais pas j'obtiendrai l'argent. J'ai vraiment des ennuis maintenant!\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout consciously realizing it, Roy was blubbering tearfully in French, telling this strange woman all about how he had been fired today and now had nowhere to turn. Obviously, there was a lot more to the story than just that \ufffd but Roy knew nothing about this strange woman... and even if he did, he figured she probably wouldn't believe his outlandish story of Role Swapping today. Besides which, the trauma of everything Roy had already endured had him in such an emotional state, he didn't care to enter into the whole drama of who he really was and all that had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether the roommate fully understood or not, Roy couldn't be sure. She certainly seemed extremely sympathetic to Roy's plight, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdYou... you got fired then?\ufffd said the roommate. \ufffdOh, you poor thing! It was that awful Mrs. Walton, wasn't it? I knew that job was all wrong for you, Yvette. From everything you've told me, that man was a good-for-nothing sex fiend... and that woman was a conniving bitch. Pardon my language.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdNo, you... you are right,\ufffd said Roy, trying to get control of his hysterical sobbing. \ufffdI... I just... je ne sais pas... comment est-ce que je peux dire?... I do not know what I am... uh... going to do now.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdHey, everything is going to be okay,\ufffd said the roommate, suddenly giving Roy a tight hug. \ufffdAmy is here, and I'm going to take care of my best friend. I'll lend you the money for the rent until you're back on your feet. And if you'd like, I'll try to help you find a new job... something that isn't so degrading.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdYou... you would do zis for me?\ufffd said Roy, choking back another sudden flood of emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdAbsolutely,\ufffd said Amy. \ufffdBut first things first \ufffd you've been dumped. From a job, not a person. But the cure for being dumped or being fired is the same: a big bowl of chocolate ice cream and an afternoon with a sympathetic friend. I'll get the ice cream!\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy bounced off into the kitchen and started busying herself getting out bowls, spoons, and ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdWhy don't you take off that ridiculous uniform?\ufffd she called back to Roy, still in the living room. \ufffdYou don't need it anymore, so we could even burn the damned thing if you'd like!\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughed, \ufffdYes. I zink... uh... 'ow I say zis?... Oui, je devrais aimer changer des v\ufffdtements!...Et oui, je pense que nous devrions br\ufffdler la robe! Oui... uh, yes, I might like to do just zat.\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tiny iota less stressed, Roy stood up and wandered down a short hallway in the apartment. Finding two doors, he wondered which one was now his. Peeking into the first, he immediately saw a desk crowded with various photos of Amy and what he presumed was her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdCe doit \ufffdtre l'autre salle,\ufffd said Roy, closing the door and heading into the other bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The nice, hardwood floor was swept completely clean of dust and dirt... and even appeared to have a fresh shine of polished wax on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy walked over to a modest, wooden dresser that looked like an antique of some kind. It had clearly seen better days but had been carefully repaired to a usable condition. He opened one of the drawers and inside discovered neat, perfectly aligned rows of meticulously folded panties. They were apparently organized by color, ranging from bright, warm scarlets on the left, progressing through the entire spectrum, before finally ending with deep, bold violets on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdZis woman, zhe ees, how you say?... a neat freak,\ufffd Roy said. \ufffdAi guess eet makes zense for her to have zought employment as la femme de m\ufffdnage... ai mean, how you say?... ze housekeeper ... oh, and zpeaking of which!\ufffd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy began wriggling out of the degrading maid's costume he had been forced to wear. He untied the apron and removed the frilly, little hat... then stripped off the satiny, black dress itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in Yvette's room wearing nothing but her undergarments, Roy couldn't resist taking a peek at himself in the mirror. Although he saw himself as physically male and completely unchanged, he knew other people perceived him as Yvette and that's what he'd see in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, enough, his reflection revealed an attractive young dark-haired woman, her hair a bit disheveled and her face showed signs of having been crying recently. She had modest sized, firm, round breasts constrained in an expensive-looking, lacy black bra. A matching pair of black, satin panties with fancy, lace trim were around her hips. About her waist was a garter belt attached to a pair of sheer, black, thigh high stockings. On her feet were the shiny, black pumps Roy had been teetering about all day in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdMon Dieu,\ufffd breathed Roy. \ufffdJe suis beau.\ufffd</span></div></div>",

Just as before, Roy felt thoroughly embarrassed and humiliating at wearing womens clothes (and knowing he still had Yvette's black satin panties and matching bra on underneath). But again, the mirror showed the perfect reflection of Yvette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the world, that was now Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he walked back out to the living room and sat down to face Amy, his new roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYvette, are you okay?\u201d asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Roy answered in a thick French accent. \u201cI've just had a horrible day and, and, and I'm very confused about a lot of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all right,\u201d said Amy, putting her arm around Roy. \u201cTell me what's on your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy found himself suddenly gushing, telling Amy all about the strange feelings he'd just had. He didn't try to explain who he really was (he felt certain anyone in their right mind would refuse to believe that story!) But Roy confessed how the Yvette part of him felt used and betrayed by men after what had just happened in 'her' most recent job. And Roy explained how lonesome and frightened he felt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to be alone,\u201d Roy said, again in the thick French accent of Yvette. \u201cBut I'm scared to be with a man now. After, y'know, how I got used and tossed aside. I'm not sure I want anything to do at all with men, now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Roy meant that statement one hundred percent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, there are alternatives,\u201d said Amy, smiling mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Roy asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you've tried men and didn't find any satisfaction,\u201d said Amy. \u201cThen there's always the Love that Dares Not Speak Its Name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stared blankly at her and blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was a very pretty girl, with bright emerald eyes and flaming red hair. When his identity was male, Roy would have loved a girlfriend like her. But attractive women like Amy had always been in a different league from loser geeks like Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Amy leaned forward and kissed Roy softly and gently on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what I mean,\u201d Amy said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Roy, finally beginning to understand.</span></div></div>",

He'd never been lucky in love before, and now this attractive woman with her sparkling emerald eyes and flaming red hair was practically throwing herself into his arms... while believing the whole time that he was actually a woman named Yvette Dupris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain what else to do, Roy hesitantly placed a hand on Amy's leg. The fabric of her sweatpants was softer and smoother than he'd expected. He gently rubbed his hand in a slow circle on her leg, the friction between his hand and the fabric of her sweatpants gradually generating heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy opened his mouth and started to speak, but realized he had nothing to say. Amy kept her restless gaze silently locked on him, and Roy started to feel something begin to change. His breath came a little more quickly, his heart started pumping a little harder, and the palm of his hand resting on Amy's leg grew hot and moist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something in Amy's gaze that made Roy's body crave movement. He couldn't just sit here silently anymore, with butterflies fluttering about in his stomach. He squirmed uncomfortably as he noticed the growing bulge in his pants begin to come to life. Amy just sat there with infuriating silence. This isn't right, thought Roy. She thinks I'm a chick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy bit his lip and slowly raised his hand from Amy's leg, then gently drew his fingertip to her cheek. It felt good! Warm and soft. There was nothing to be afraid of here. Amy pulled him in closer and locked her sweet, pink lips with his own. She wrapped her thin arms around his back, dragging his body right up next to hers. Roy could feel the heat of her skin and the strength of her feminine yet athletic hands. Amy's lips bit and chewed at Roy's own, devouring him. Roy found himself now alight with hunger, holding his breath for moment before releasing it in a gasp of desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful growl, Amy released Roy for a moment... then suddenly tackled him, knocking him backwards onto the couch. Her hands were instantly running up inside his shirt, expertly undoing his bra clasps and then hurriedly tugging off Roy's shirt and casting both it and bra aside. Much to Roy's surprise, he felt vulnerable and naked with his flat, masculine chest exposed. He had no time to wonder, for Amy had already bent her head down and begun to touch her tongue to his nipples, making tiny arcing circles on his chest. The surprising sensation made Roy shudder with pleasure, while simultaneously the swollen bulge in his pants grew increasingly more tight and uncomfortable, aching desperately for some relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to restrain himself further, Roy pulled off Amy's sweatpants and cast them onto the growing pile of clothes on the living room floor. Amy smiled for a moment, then leaned in closely and gently bit Roy on the throat. The sharp pain surprised him, but the strange personal intimacy of the action aroused him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy began to clumsily attempt to pull of his own jeans. Amy happily helped him undo the buttons and remove both the pants and the black, satin panties beneath. Then clad in just her t-shirt and the green, cotton bikini style panties she wore, Amy lowered her head to Roy's groin and began eagerly caressing his swollen male member with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Roy was having trouble thinking straight at this point, a thought briefly flashed through his mind that Amy believed he was a woman. In her mind, she was performing cunnilingus on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever her perception was, the sensation was ecstatic for Roy. His body quivered slightly, now slick with sweat and heat. Amy's questing tongue writhed, delved, caressed, and embraced Roy's swollen, purple manhood. He ached for release, looking down upon this gorgeous woman. His heart, pounding fiercely in his ears, Roy began to think only a hungry animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hands still slick with sweat, Roy abruptly pushed Amy back. Her head snapped up at him, a confused and almost hurt look on her face. Then Roy grabbed at her panties and violently ripped them down her smooth, creamy thighs exposing Amy's own secret regions. The look of confusion on her face evaporated into a flushed look of pleasurable embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing could prepare Amy for what was about to come next. Roy suddenly pushed Amy down onto her back and lunged after her. Wordlessly, he thrust his angry, aching cock into her. And though Amy couldn't see it, she quivered ever so slightly and released a soft, high-pitched moan at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy clutched his hands in a tight grip around the flesh of Amy's hips and steadied himself. As Roy pounded himself into her over and over again, Amy suddenly became more passive. Her fingers tightly clenched the nude flesh of Roy's back, and her legs entwined themselves about his waist and locked tightly, squeezing every so often with a quiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy and Amy locked eyes, and again pressed their lips against one another, each eagerly wrestling for dominance in a battle neither particularly cared about either winning or loser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy tightened his grip about Amy's waist, holding her in place as he continued to push his body into hers. His ears rushed with loud pumping of blood. Suddenly, Amy's entire body rigidly tightened up, her legs clamping fiercely around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Yvette!\u201d she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some inexplicable reason, being called that strange woman's name pushed Roy past the brink of arousal into a pleasurable place where there was no turning pain. He drank in the delicious pain of Amy's fingernails scratching into his back, the hot wet flesh of her skin pressed against his, and the tight clenching of her quivering body engulfing his cock, deep in her. It was all too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd \u201cYvette\u201d exploded, her head thrust back moaning in pleasure while her cock pumped load after load of seed into Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaisez-moi!\u201d groaned Yvette mid-orgasm, paradoxically forgetting for a moment that she was really a man named Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d cried Amy a moment later. \u201cThat was fucking fantabulous. Fuck me, Yvette, I mean... how... how did you... I'm breathless. I mean, I literally forgot my own name for a minute there. You... You're an incredible woman, full of surprises you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOui,\u201d said Yvette with a mysterious smile.</span></div></div>",

It's hard to believe this prim and proper French lady here is the same tiger who somehow managed to fuck my brains out last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi have some seecrets, no?\u201d laughed Yvette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered her life as Roy, but had come to accept a far happier existence as Yvette Dupris \u2013 lesbian partner of the lovely tomboy Amy. Indeed, the more time Roy had spent living the life of Yvette the more her feminine side had leeched into him. He now genuinely enjoyed prettying himself and dressing femininely. It was how the world (and the woman he loved) perceived him now. Who was Roy to argue with reality? For all practical purposes, he was simply a woman who could pee standing up if she chose to (though Roy never did; it struck him as too crude and unladylike). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lingering masculinity still proved quite satisfactory at pleasuring Amy, who seemed genuinely mystified at how Yvette grinding her pelvis against Amy's nether region could produce such sharply pleasurable sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the French were just good lovers, Amy told herself. Even (or especially) the women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'm hungry,\u201d said Amy finally. \u201cHurry up, Yvette. You look fine. We're not going to the Ritz or anything. I just feel like grabbing a burger for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about zhe Burger Bonanza?\u201d asked Yvette, with playfully mischievous intent sparkling and dancing behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... sure... yeah, that's fine with me,\u201d answered Amy. She loved Yvette passionately, but the girl could still be so strange sometimes. It was like she had a few private little jokes she never fully clued Amy in about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple drove to the local Burger Bonanza and went inside. Again, Yvette surprised Amy with some silly, uncharacteristic giggling about the guy who had waited on them. Some poor, kinda chubby, lonely-looking guy that Amy actually felt sorry for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't laugh at that poor guy,\u201d she admonished Yvette. \u201cRemember, a year ago you were unemployed until I found you that sweet job as a tutor for kids learning French. This fast food job is probably the best that guy can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you do not understand,\u201d said Yvette warmly. \u201cAi am not laughing at heem. He... oh... comment est-ce que je peux dire ceci?... he reminds me of a pet dog I once knew. I smile and laugh warmly, with him. Not to be cruel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Okay,\u201d said Amy. She'd never known Yvette to be malicious, so she accepted her girlfriend's explanation at face value, never suspecting Yvette had just met her old life-role as Roy... still inhabited (from Yvette's perspective) by a man-sized poodle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to see part of the newspaper?\u201d asked Amy. The couple usually shared the morning paper. Amy read the sports and business sections; Yvette read arts and leisure. They shared the comics page, reading it together last, usually giggling at the same jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEef ai could have zhe arts?\u201d asked Yvette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy happily passed over that section, and a moment later again heard the mysterious peals of Yvette's happy laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What is it now?\u201d asked Amy, peering over at the article Yvette was reading. \u201cWhat's so hillarious about... a dog show? I don't get it, Yvette. So some an ugly poodle owned by some rich old cow wins a prize. Who cares. You've never been interested in dog shows before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvette wiped the tears from her eyes, careful not to let her mascara run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi am zorry,\u201d she said. \u201cReally, ai zhould not laugh. Eet ees not funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy frowned more closely at the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't that the mean old battleaxe you used to work for?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvette nodded wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unbeknownst to Amy, the poodle who had just won first prize was the original Yvette Dupris \u2013 visible only to the current Yvette as a naked, young woman obediently crouched over on all fours and wearing a collar around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi zhould not laugh,\u201d said Yvette. \u201cEet just zurprises me, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAi am zorry about eet all,\u201d whispered Yvette. \u201cBut ai am happy now, and you have won zhe first prize. Perhaps you are happy now too, in your own way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYvette, you're the weirdest and craziest woman I've ever known,\u201d said Amy, setting aside the paper for a moment. \u201cBut I am happy. You make me happy. Very happy. Don't ever doubt that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMerci beaucoup,\u201d said Yvette as she blushed.</span></div></div>",

He turned to see a handsome man, roughly the same age as Mrs. Walton, walking over and taking a seat beside him. He guessed that this was Mr. Walton. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened Yvette\u201c he said. \u201cYou getting fired is all my fault\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no\u201d Roy said. \u201cZit vas bound to appen eventually\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It was my ridiculous requests of you that lead to this\u201d Mr. Walton said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t give you your job back but I did get this for you\u201d he added as he pulled the device out of his pocket. \u201cMy wife said she took it from you and assumed it was one of my projects. I can without a doubt say I\u2019ve never seen this before, so I can conclude that it\u2019s yours\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZank you very much, monsieur\u201c Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. Now, understand I can\u2019t give you your job back, but I will ensure all of your things are returned to you. And if you need any help getting a new job I will do whatever you need from me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZank you monsieur\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. You better get going before my wife gets any angrier and calls the police on you\u201d Mr. Walton said as he stood up and headed back inside. When he opened the door, Roy spotted the real Yvette walking around on all fours and quickly fired the device at her. Roy then came up with a plan. He\u2019d give Yvette his life for the time being, then he would return to his life once he had gotten her a new, far and away, better job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Roy set off down the long driveway to head to the Burger Bonanza he worked at. Once he reached the street, he quickly realized that the fast food restaurant was only about a half an hour walk from here. Seemingly rejuvenated by this, Roy set off and found he was now expertly walking in the high heeled shoes on his feet. Once he arrived at the Burger Bonanza, he immediately found the Waltons dog which was currently living his life. Roy let out a feminine giggle at the sight of the now very large dog walking on its hind legs and operating the cash register. As discreetly as he could manage, Roy aimed the remote at the dog and fired it. Within the blink of an eye, the dog was gone, now replaced by the woman who\u2019s life Roy now inhabited. Her hair was short like Roy always kept his, and the uniform she was wearing didn\u2019t do a good job of showing off the gorgeous body Roy knew she had from looking in the mirror. But that was true for all women who worked at Burger Bonanza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yvette now back in the life of a human, Roy took a seat at one of the outdoor tables. Realizing just how much his feet hurt now that he was off them, Roy took the high heels off and  massaged his feet for a few minutes while he contemplated what to do next. \u201cVell\u201d he said, still not 100% used to speaking English with the thick French accent. \u201cAh guess ah zhould vind vere ah live now. But how.\u201d As he looked around he saw a road sign pointing to the library. \u201cCe serait un bon endroit pour commencer\u201d Roy said in French. \u201cil devrait y avoir un annuaire t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour trouver mon adresse.\u201d That was another thing that still bothered him, that if he just spoke naturally he was speaking French.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Roy had a plan, he put the high heels back on and set off for the library.</span></div></div>",

Sure, he'd have to live Yvette's life for a few days... maybe a couple weeks at most. But everyone seemed to perceive him as actually being an attractive, young French woman. Roy alone seemed to still see himself as a man in drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it'd be weird and uncomfortable teetering around in these high-heeled shoes. And Roy felt intensely embarrassed thinking about how he was currently wearing Yvette's underwear... and would have to continue doing so day, after day, until he could reacquire the device. He supposed he'd be learning a lot more about cosmetics and hairstyling now, too. He'd probably have to get up at least an hour earlier than normal each day, just to put himself together as Yvette. And then go off and do her work all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the alternative was to risk the ire of the wealthy bitch that owned this place. If she sensed anything funny was going on, she'd fire Roy on the spot. And then what? Roy would be an unemployed young foreign woman with a thick French accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy resolved to use the device to change the rich snob into something unpleasant at the first opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the meantime, sighed Roy, he would just have to make the most out of an awkward situation. Roy was a likable person... just rather unlucky in life. Given ample time, maybe he could schmooze his wealthy employer and patch things up? After all, she could've fired him right there on the spot. She'd given him a second chance. There must be something he could to impress her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have to succumb to the inevitable: answering to the name Yvette, doing the rich woman's bidding, and doing plenty of housework. But on the bright side, it couldn't be much worse than flipping burgers for a living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Roy mused looking down at his frilly, scantily-clad attire, the uniforms at Burger Bonanza weren't a bit more comfortable to work in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, maybe he should start by changing out of this skimpy costume and into something more suitable for doing housework? Would that impress the old cow? Heck, it might even help put a damper on her husband's libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\ufffdAh wondeer where zee maid's room ees?\ufffd said Roy. </span></div></div>",

Roy thought she might be an interesting subject and quickly  pointed the device, pressed the buttons and was quickly blinded by a flash of light. The light only lasted a moment, but when Roy regained his vision again he found that he was no longer in the apartment. He was on the sidewalk, somehow having moved a great distance in the blink of an eye. Incredibly, that wasn\u2019t the most impressive feat of the device had managed. \u201cThis is insane!\u201d Roy marveled as he looked down at the clothes that now encased his body. He was not only wearing the same grey pantsuit the woman had been wearing, but he could taste lipstick on his lips and more incredibly, \u201care those boobs?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to fill the woman\u2019s role the device must have decided that Roy needed to become a woman. Roy was both impressed and scared by the device his alternate-self had handed him. He noticed a few people staring at him oddly as he tried to check what else had changed so he hurried to a nearby store and went straight for the bathroom in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy made sure no one else was in the bathroom and locked the door behind him. He stepped over to he mirror and stared in amazement at the person staring back. He could recognize his face to be sure, but his features were much softer, his lips were noticeably larger and there was a perfectly applied layer of makeup on it that he would have never had imagined he\u2019d see on it before. Looking further down he was awestruck by how the pantsuit followed the new curves of his body. A quick check between his legs cemented what he had already felt with every step he had taken, his old friend had been replaced by it\u2019s female counterpart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy wasn\u2019t sure what to do next, but the ringing phone in his inherited purse decided for him. He fished it out of, taking note that the device had also popped into the purse, and saw a reminder for a meeting in 30 minutes. Suddenly a memory of a job interview pops into Roy\u2019s mind and before he can really think about he was bolting out the door and on his way to the meeting. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a cute blonde girl, probably 16 years old from what Roy could tell.  She was sat outside on the bench playing a 3DS game, apparently waiting for someone to arrive.  Maybe she was getting a ride somewhere?  Regardless, the girl was oblivious of Roy watching her, as she was entirely engrossed in her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blonde hair kept blowing into her eyes, as it was uncontrolled and probably hadn't been cut in a while.  She was the type to go as long as she could without a haircut, to minimize the number of times she has to interact with other people.  Despite it being the end of summer, the girl wore light blue jeans and worn out tennis shoes.  Her T-shirt is nothing special, a few sizes too big for her skinny body, hiding any curves that she might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now let's see if this remote thing actually does anything... hope she doesn't mind,\"  Roy said to himself as he took aim at her and fired through his window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened, but he knew he needed to pick a second target to Role Swap her with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly his perspective changes, and Roy realized he was staring at a 3ds game in his hands... It looked like Pokemon.  A lock of messy blonde hair fell in front of his eyes, and he brushed it aside easily.  He noticed his hands felt softer, but more or less unchanged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really worked didn't it?\"  Roy said quietly, noting that something about his voice sounded.. off.  It was still his voice, but it sounded different than before.  Quieter, softer, and even a little higher pitched.  \"Testing... What the hell?\" He had trouble raising his voice, as though he wanted to avoid bringing any attention to himself.  It was like the way he imagined this shy girl normally talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked again to the 3ds in his hands, and decided to save the game before closing the console, and putting it in his pocket.  He quickly realized this was a mistake, considering he was now wearing this girl's skinny jeans, which had pockets that weren't even big enough to fit a credit card in.  The game was clearly not going to fit in his jeans pocket, so he stood up and looked around.  As he noticed the backpack sitting on the ground next to him, he couldn't help but be distracted by the sensation of being... shorter.  It wasn't much, but enough to throw his balance off.  When he looked down to get a better look at his height, he saw that his T-shirt was pressed out a bit, with what looked like a pair of small breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...  This thing gave me tits?\"  He practically whispered, briefly cupping his chest with one hand, feeling how soft and weighty they were.  They were only A cups, maybe Bs, but they still had a distinct weight that he was definitely not used to.  \"God that's fucking weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly anxious that someone might see him, he quickly removed his hand and picked up the backpack, safely tucking the 3ds inside, so it wouldn't get lost.  He began to rifle through the backpack, and soon realized that this was this girl's school supplies.  She was a 16 year old in high school, and there wasn't really much of anything in the backpack that shocked him.  In fact, what shocked him more was the lack of any girly things.  She was clearly a bit of a tomboy, and didn't carry makeup or anything that he expected a high school girl to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I shouldn't expect her to be so stereotypical... girls these days don't have to be into all those things.\"  He blurted out, and then wondered where that thought came from. \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did lead him to thinking however, why the remote had given him long hair and even breasts?  Was there more about him that had changed?  Of course, his hand went straight to his crotch where he realized there was no bulge to speak of.  He patted himself down and felt alien sensations and no indication of his old buddy.  The remote had made him into a full fledged girl... Maybe that was required in order to fill this role?  It would be hard to be a teenage girl without the parts for it.  But aside from all that, he felt otherwise unchanged.  If he had a mirror he might have even recognized his face, albiet with slightly softer features, as his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird... wait where's the remote?!\"  He panicked briefly, as he looked around to see if the remote had traveled with him.  \"I can't believe I forgot to check for that!\"</span></div></div>",

It looked safe and undamaged, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what he would do next, now that he was this other person.  He could see what this girl's life is like, or just use the remote again to become someone else.  So far, being a girl wasn't as jarring as he'd expected, and he was glad he didn't pick a total girly girl to start with.  This quiet, nerdy girl was much easier for him to adjust to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's thoughts were cut short, however, when a car pulled up directly in front of him, and he could see a teenage boy waving to him from inside.  Roy stared at the boy for several seconds, wondering what he was waving at until he realized this must be someone who knows this girl!  He had none of her memories of course, so he really hoped that was the case.  He suddenly felt quite vulnerable knowing he had the female equipment to go along with this identity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy in the car started to look annoyed and began honking his horn.  He rolled the passenger window down, and yelled, \"Are you coming, Katie?!  We're gonna be late if you sit there playing Pokemon all morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Katie... that must be this girl's name then.  I guess he's a friend, and I'm supposed to go with him.  To school most likely.  Hm...</i>  Roy wondered if he wanted to put up with high school, and as a nerdy girl no less.  It might be quite the experience, but it might end up being a horrible one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright.  I'm coming...\"  He meekly called out to the boy, slinging his backpack over his shoulder.</span></div></div>",

His hair had grown out, and Roy could feel it all piled high about his head in a fashionable, female style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt really worked,\u201d Roy said aloud to himself. \u201cI actually became... hey, I wonder who I am anyhow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked down and saw he was carrying a fashionable looking purse. Digging through it, he found a driver's license that identified him as someone named Robin Brown. The ID clearly showed a photograph of Roy (with a woman's hairstyle and plenty of makeup on), but identified him as a 300 pound, twenty-two year old African American woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'm keeping the first chapter the same, but rest assured everything after will be new. Do feel free to add chapters, but please try to keep your chapters WAY longer than one sentence, a paragraph at least. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginal description from SandySeeker:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roy Milford is a washed-up failure at age 23. But after a visit from an oddly familiar extradimensional stranger, Roy gains access to an incredible device capable of Role Swapping \u2013 putting one person into the life of another individual. Can Roy use this amazing machine to turn his own life around? Or will he just make things worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd whatever you'd like! Pretty much any sort of transformation is welcome. Feel free to create new characters, push existing ones in different directions, flesh-out the background of any characters you like... or even abandon the main character and give the device to somebody else! Anything goes, so long as you're being creative and having fun with the story. Interesting plot twists and unexpected happenings are always welcome! Thanks in advance to all the wonderfully interesting additions I know you'll be adding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe creative. Be imaginative. Be wild. Be daring. Be unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe fresh and original, and have fun with it!\"</td>",
