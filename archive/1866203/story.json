I got up to shut a window, that was open because yesterday was fairly sunny, I was a freak storm. I tryed as hard as a could. won't buge. I got on warm clothing, and brown boots. and got a hammer. I walked out of my house and made my was around 2-3 feet deep snow. I came around to the frozen window. *Bam* *BAM!* The ice shattered then I proceeded to shut the window. Then I herd a faint whine. \"hm?\" I walked towards it. Then a saw a gardevoir under a large tree shaking out of cold. \"arceus! are you ok?\" I said rushing over to her, her body felt like a block of ice! \"Come on. I can't leave you out here.\" I said getting her to her feet. Then I started to walk foward, but she walked very slow. I picked her up, her body had a few icicles on her! I rushed her inside. Taking my coat off and putting it on her and sitting her next to the fire. I then ran to the other room grabing two blankets. I ran and put them around her. \"you ok?\" I asked her. She nodded seeming to understand me, she was still shaking even in a heavy coat and two blankets plus a fire. I sat there for ten minutes untill she took off the coat and one of the blankets. I was happy to have found her! she would have died! \"are you hungry?\" I asked. She turned to me very fast. \"gard!\" She said. I hurried and made a sandwich, gave it to her, then make my own. By the time I was back she had finished it. \"woah you were really hungry.\" I said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(im gonna stop the story here. want it to go fast? or slow? .. love wise.)</span></div></div>",

I simply returned the hug seeing as though she was thanking me. Then, she broke away and gave me a kiss on my cheek. I didn't know how to react, but all I knew was that my face was probably red. What she was doing next shocked me... she was headed for the door to leave! I looked out the window and the blizzard still hadn't calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" I yelled as I bolted after her. Just before she reached the door handle, I slammed my hand on the door and blocked her way. She looked at me puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar!\" She looked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... the blizzard still hasn't settled down. I don't want you to freeze to death like you almost did when I found you.\" Her expression softened to understanding. She must have thought I was trying to trap her or something. She turned and took a few steps to peer out the same window that I did a moment ago and she saw a flurry of snow pelting the glass as if it was trying to get in. She looked down like she was lost deep in thought. \"Is something the matter?\" She jumped a tiny bit as I broke her out of her thoughts and she looked at me with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voir...\" She looked down again as her smile disappeared. \"Gar gar voir gardevoir.\" I always found it a little irritating that humans couldn't understand what a pokemon was saying besides the hints that come with their expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're welcome to stay here until the blizzard lets up if you want.\" There was a gleam in gardevoir's eyes that told me that she'd appreciate it. \"Come on, let's find you a place to sleep. I don't have a pokeball and I'm not just going to simply drop you off onto the couch.\" I took her hand and for a split second, I could have sworn I saw gardevoir's face turn a slight shade of pink.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since my house didnt have a guest room (not that I'd be expecting many guests around these parts), I felt it was the right thing to do to allow the Gardevoir to use my bedroom. If she was as blistering cold as I thought she was, my bed would be the warmest place for her. Wouldnt want her getting sick, now would we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Here we are!\" I opened the door and led my newest guest into my room, \"you'll be sleeping here for the night.\"<br>\r\n\"Gar....?\" Gardevoir stared wide-eyed all around my room almost in awe. I gave her space as she walked around my room, looking it up and down, possibly 'basking in its glory' or something silly. \"Gaaar... deee....\" She stared up at the ceiling fan, down at the soft carpet, peeked into my closet, tilted her head at my tv, she was seriously acting like a curious peasant that stumbled inside a nobleman's castle! It was too cute for words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I enjoyed the show, I had to show her to the bed.<br>\r\n\"Here, over here,\" I ushered her over to the bed, \"you can sleep here.\"<br>\r\nGardevoir merely blinked a few times at me like a curious child.<br>\r\n\"Sleep,\" I tried to explain it to her despite the language barrier, \"you sleep on it. You lie down on it and go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n\"Vo...ir?\" she still wasnt getting the concept. I had to remind myself that I was dealing with a pokemon who has probably never seen human civilization in her life, so I had to be slow with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best way I could describe the use of my bed was by example.<br>\r\n\"Watch, watch,\" I said to her as I hopped into my bed and lied in it, \"like this, see? You just lie down...\" I pointed to the pillow, \"head against the pillow,\" I rested my head and against the pillow, \"then you pull the blanket over,\" I pulled the blanket over myself, \"Like this!\" How else was I supposed to explain it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir continued to stare wide-eyed, possibly making a mental note that could possibly change her life as she knows it. \"Gar... gar de!\"<br>\r\n\"Hop in,\" I swayed my hand my way and patted the vacant spot on the bed.<br>\r\n\"GaAR?!\" Gardevoir was suddenly shocked at the notion. Dont ask me why.<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" I assured her, \"it's comfy and warm. C'mon. Hop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir seemed a bit hesitant judging by her worried expression as she poked at the bed, but she finally caved and hopped in next to me. The moment Gardevoir lied down with me, she began to get used to it fast!<br>\r\n\"Gar... gar de voir.... Gardevoir!\" an excited smile appeared on her face as she said with glee, \"Gardevoir! Garde voir! Gar! De!\" She practically rolled around in joy cuz of how incredibly comfortable my bed was. \"Ga ha har de voir! Ga ha ha!!\"<br>\r\nI kinda laughed myself at how overly excited she was over the bed. I can imagine this was probably the most comfortable thing she's ever slept on in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the bed?\"<br>\r\n\"Ga-ar!!\" I took that as a yes.<br>\r\n\"If you think that's great, here!\" I pulled the blanket over her. She gasped at first, but then let out a relaxed sighed and gripped the covers tightly. Gardevoir was clearly satisfied. With that out of the way, I was ready to hurry off to MY new sleeping spot of the night: the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when I was about to walk out, Gardevoir suddenly got up and looked over at me.<br>\r\n\"Gar? Gar de!\" Gardevoir was staring at me questionably. \"Gardevoir! Voir!\" Then she swayed her arms her way and patted the vacant spot on the bed! Once again I started to blush at that generous offer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... thanks,\" I said, \"but's it... um... kind of... improper that we both share a bed.\"<br>\r\n\"De?\" she seemed disappointed.<br>\r\n\"Dont worry about me. I'm gonna go sleep on the couch,\" I said to her with a smile, \"er... let me know if you have any trouble sleeping. Good night, Gardevoir!\"<br>\r\nThe graceful psychic pokemon smiled back at me \"Gardevoir!\" I noticed her glow a bright multiple shade of colors as she puckered her lips and made a quick smooching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" I jumped in surprise as I felt a ghost's lips press against my cheek! It wasnt a ghost, though. I could tell by the way Gardevoir's cheeks went pink again, she had something to do with it. A psychic kiss. Cool! If she can deliver a kiss telepathically, a pervy part of my brain began to wonder what other kind of nifty tricks she can do telepathically!<br>\r\nI immediately walked out of the room before Gardevoir could see any of those thoughts I was having!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about what to do with her tomorrow as I headed to the living room. Since I wasnt a pokemon trainer, I couldnt capture her. Besides, how do I know she doesnt have family of her own out there? She could possibly have a husband/boyfriend/mate out there probably looking all over for her... not to mention, she could have baby Ralts wondering where their mommy went. I'd feel guilty if I kept her locked up in my house. Yet, cuz of this snowstorm, I couldnt just risk having her freeze to death! There's just so many questions I wanna ask her in the morning, but I cant talk to a pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lied down on the couch, I just thought, 'You know what? I'll worry about all that crap after the blizzard stops.' And that's just what I intended to do! I pulled my extra blanket over me, curled up tight and went straight to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

At the same moment, I had wondered if Gardevoir was an early riser and decided to leave without saying goodbye. So, I got up and went to my room where she slept for the night. I knocked on the door, but there wasn't a sound to be heard after that. I carefully opened the door quietly and looked inside. I was glad to see that she was simply still sound asleep. It was only after I had opened the door that I could hear her breathing. I felt happy... happy that I found her. She looked so peaceful...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's two perfectly good explanations why I didnt wake her up right then and there. One was because she looked so peaceful, like she hadnt had a good sleep in a LONG time. And two... because she's a high-leveled psychic pokemon. It is very dangerous to wake a psychic pokemon up from a deep sleep mainly because if she gets startled, that brief moment of mental imbalance could cause unintended harm to my brain. Surprised the lot of you pokemon trainers didnt know that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I let sleeping pokemon lie and to the kitchen and made breakfast. I wasnt exactly a chef, so my choices to make were pretty limited. At the least I had plenty of waffles. So I microw-I mean, cooked a couple of waffles, put some butter and maple syrup on them, poured some juice in two glasses, and waited to see if my new Gardevoir friend would come down and join me. Heck if I know she'd like what waffles, but there's only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaa...rr?\" and right on cue, I heard the sound of her adorable curious voice call out. To me it sounded like she was calling my name. Not sure if she even knew my name to begin with.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Gardevoir!\" I said with a bright smile.<br>\r\n\"Ga haar-de!\" she said with an equally bright smile as she hovered toward me. <br>\r\nLike the gentlemen I was, I pulled a chair out for her. \"Have a seat.\" She merely tilted her head, so once again, I had to show her. \"Like this.\" I sat in my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De...\" she observed her own chair for a moment before finally sitting in it, \"...de.\"<br>\r\n\"I made breakfast.\" Then I set her plate of waffles down along her knife and fork and glass of juice. Once again, she acted like a curious peasant.<br>\r\n\"Voir?\" she leaned in toward her plate, eyeing the waffles on it, even sniffing it a bit.<br>\r\n\"It's waffles,\" I explained to her as if it even mattered. She just stared as I cut up my waffle slice with a knife, poked a piece with a fork, and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir then stared back at her own plate. At first she attempted to grasp her fork and knife, but to no avail. I'm guessing cuz it's hard to grasp utensils with only three fingers.<br>\r\n\"Gaaa....\" she made a voice that sound similar to a girly whine. Then she realized, 'You know what? I'm a freaking PSYCHIC!' and used her mental powers to levitate the knife to cut a slice off her waffle, then the fork to pick it and send it to her mouth.<br>\r\nIt wasnt long before she stopped using the fork and knife and just snatched the other waffles off the plate and scarf them down! Man, she musta been hungry. Either that or I was a really good microwaver-I mean cook!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaa... garde...\" after finishing her breakfast, Gardevoir sighed and lied back, rubbing her tummy in satisfaction. Sheesh, that was a smorgasbord to her?!<br>\r\n\"Enjoyed it?\"<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!\" she announced with glee. After washing it down with juice, the time had come. As much as I didnt want her to leave so soon, she probably had family out there waiting for her. I really hoped I didnt cause her any trouble keeping her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as we stepped outside, Gardevoir's eyes brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar!! Gar de voir!! GAR DE!!\" she shouted with joy. It was obvious she was overjoyed that the blizzard stopped. She sang and danced about, probably savoring in the nice refreshing warmth of this delightful spring day.<br>\r\n\"GAAAAA-ar?\" she suddenly stopped singing and stared over at me. Her blissful smile then changed to a frown. I knew what this meant and so did she. Goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar. Gar de gar de voir,\" she spoke to me and bowed her head, probably thanking me for providing her shelter.<br>\r\n\"It was no problem at all,\" I assured regardless of whether or not she could understand me, \"I was happy to help. Besides...\" my own face went red, \"it was nice to finally have a visitor at my place.\"<br>\r\nShe tilted her head, closed her eyes, and gave me a heartwarming smile that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside! \"Gaaaaardevoir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Gardevoir,\" I said my goodbye, \"if you ever need shelter, youre more than welcome to come back!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, she turned around and walked off toward the forest. Immediately, I began to miss her. She was the only decent company I had in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*smooch!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" once more, I felt a pair of familiar invisible lips pressed against my cheek! Somehow I was quick to recognize the sensation of those lips! Gardevoir turned her head back to me and gave me one last smile before blowing me another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*smooch!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered in glee at the sensation that last ghost kiss felt. So warm, so tingly, so soothing. Seriously, her psychic kisses were amazing! I had to constantly remind myself that she was a pokemon to fight those feelings off before I end up being entranced by them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I struggled with that brief moment of bliss Gardevoir finally turned around and continued her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smooch Smooch Smooch Smooch!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly I felt myself smothered in those irresistable ghost-kisses! I was easily overpowered by the bliss of those luscious tingly invisible lips! Any more and I'd have probably have fallen to the ground writhing in the pleasure of the psychic-smooches! Just when I couldnt get enough of it, Gardevoir finally left my field of vision, taking all her smooches with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... wow...\" I muttered, \"...what a woman.\" Suffice to say, it was one heck of a reward for my good deed!<br>\r\nImmediately after she left, I began to miss her.  And those magic kisses of hers. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s a pokemon, anyone would kill to get kisses like THAT! Perhaps there was some kind of a drug laced to them, because I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, I rarely have guests over at my house. It gets pretty lonely here. And all the other pokemon I\u2019ve seen around these parts would sooner tear me to shreds than politely accept my generosity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed hard as I headed back inside, but just as I was about to open my front door, I got to thinking.<br>\r\nI looked back toward the direction that Gardevoir headed. Well, to get to the point, I was bored, curious, and wanted to see her again. Maybe at least find out if her and her family (if she had one) lived nearby. Scratch a little itch, if you get what I\u2019m saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I shook my head, thinking about how dumb an idea that was. She\u2019s a pokemon and she might already has her own habitat to live in. Not to mention that if she does, the others of her kind might not treat me as well as she did. Heck, they would clearly treat me as an intruder, since I would be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, those kisses did kinda get to me. And I didn\u2019t wanna stay cooped up in my lonesome house the whole time. A little adventure never hurt nobody right? If the average pokemon trainer can handle it, surely I can, right?!</span></div></div>",

I tried taking a shower, watching television, even making my bed that she had slept in last night. However, I still couldn't stop thinking about her. I wondered if I really should have followed her. Soon, I heard a noise from outside. \"Gardevoir?\" I wondered as I walked to the door. However, as soon as I opened it, it wasn't her. In fact, I didn't see anyone at the door. At least, not at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LADE!\" A gallade burst in and shoved me aside sending me flying to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea!?\" I scream but he didn't seem to respond. Instead, he had disappeared up the stairs in a flash of white and green and I could hear things being tossed and thrown about up there. \"Who the heck do you think you are!? Get out!\" Gallade rushed back down as if searching for something and turned to me with an angry look and narrowed his eyes. He walked up to me, grabbed my shirt, lifted me up off the ground, and slammed me against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAL GALLADE!?\" He seemed to be demanding for something but I didn't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't seem to understand because I'm a human and YOU'RE A FREAKIN' GALLADE!\" He narrowed his eyes even more and tightened his grip on my shirt. What happened next kinda startled me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she was here!\" He was using telepathy! I shouldn't be surprised since he was part psychic type. \"I'll ask again... WHERE IS SHE!?\" He took me off the wall and slammed me on the ground knocking the breath out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... excuse me for asking... who is 'she' exactly?\" As if I didn't know. I just hoped he wasn't talking about Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell she was here. Don't try to hide it from me you filthy human! You kidnapped her during the storm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't answer my question Gallade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know who I'm talking about... Gardevoir! WHERE IS SHE!!!\"</span></div></div>",

And even if I lied, I'm sure that mohawked dickhead would see through with his telepathy. So since I was in shite creek without a paddle anyways, I figured I might as well tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know WHICH Gardevoir you might be referring to,\" I said, \"but I didnt kidnap anyone! I did however give warmth and shelter to a Gardevoir during the blizzard. I found her nearly freezing to death under a tree, so I carried her here and offered her food, shelter, and a place to sleep until the bad weather died down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, that was enough for the overzealous Gallade to finally release his grip on me, but then he started looking all around shouting, \"GALL! GALLADE!! GAL-LAAADE!!\" It looked as though he was calling out to her.<br>\r\n\"Where are you holding her, you despicable hairless mankey?!\" I heard his equally overzealous voice shout to me in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not holding her anywhere, cow-lick!\" I snapped back, nearly forgetting doing so was not good for my health, \"She left after the storm finally died down. She wanted to leave, I let her leave.\" I left out the parts about her kissing me (physically and psychically). Although I'm not sure whether or not he could probably read those memories in my head as well. But even if he did, I have no reason to feel guilty! SHE kissed ME, I didnt kiss HER! Oy, why am I still on this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Gallade squinted his eyes as he glared right into mine. I merely glared back. We glared at one another for almost a whole minute before the Gallade finally FINALLY lowered his guard a little. He was still hostile, but not AS hostile as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say where she was going?\" Gallade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" I honestly said, \"I dont speak Pokemon and she never spoke to me telepathically like you did.\" Maybe certain telepathic skills vary depending on the individual user. After all, not all Gardevoir have the set moveset!<br>\r\n\"So you just let her leave all by her lonesome without even finding out where or why?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what else was I supposed to do?! Keep her here against her will?!\" I couldnt believe I was explaining myself to a friggin pokemon, \"what wouldve happened if you busted in and saw her here with me?!\"<br>\r\n\"I would have gouged both your eyeballs out with my elbow-blades.\" Holy crap, he was brutally honest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaa...llllaaaaa...\" Gallade let out a loud groan of irritation. Perhaps he had finally come to realize that I'm not the bad guy?<br>\r\nThe Gallade turned his head toward outside and stared for a couple of seconds... then he turned his head to me and started saying \"Gallade! Gall gallade! GALL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, again. Cant understand you,\" I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm holding you equally responsible for her disappearance!\" jerk had the nerve to declare, \"it is your responsibility to help me find her!\" If he werent a wild psychic potential powerhouse, normally I'd tell him to get lost... but since I personally was interested in seeing Gardevoir again, I made no objection. I just hoped she's alright, wherever she is. \"I'm sure she couldnt have gotten far. Most of the paths are still blocked by snow. Urgh... god, this place is too cold! What were we thinking coming here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they didnt live locally, huh? That's understandable. The Ralts family isnt common around THIS part of the world. But I couldnt help but wonder what they were doing here instead of in a much warmer climate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Actually you know what I was REALLY wondering? What is this Gallade's relationship to that Gardevoir with those magical smooches?<br>\r\nEr, sure it didnt really matter what his relationship was, but I was still curious! After all, he seems so darn protective of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok I'll help you out. Relax,\" I said to him, \"but first, could you even tell me what youre doing here to begin with? And what was that Gardevoir to you? She a friend of yours or something?\" That was the best way I could ask what his relationship was to her without looking shady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thankfully, it was enough to get the answer I totally wasnt THAT desperate to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isnt it obvious?!\" Gallade said in your mind, \"she's my-\"</span></div></div>",

Still, I couldnt help but continue looking over my shoulder. Sure, I've never seen Darkrai around these parts before, but if a Gardevoir and a Gallade are here, who knows who else decided to tread on my territory recently!<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!\"<br>\r\n\"GALLADE!\" both me and the Gallade called out to her (him obviously in more of a panic than me)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga?!\" Gardevoir immediately turned around and faced us. I held back the urge to feel all warm and tingly seeing her again.<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!\" I felt her smiling my way as she ran toward me! I could not hold back the urge to feel all warm and tingly anymore! I extended my arms ready to give her a nice big warm hug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gallade!!\" unfortunately, Gallade dashed in front of me and gave Gardevoir that friggin hug that she was supposed to be getting from me! I didnt really know why I was feeling jealous all of a sudden. I shouldve felt relieved and prideful that I just reunited a brother and sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after the hug ended, Gallade began to converse with his sister!<br>\r\n\"Gallade! Ga gal gallde?! Gal al all gal?!\" I couldnt understand what he was saying, but judging by his panicked expressions, he was probably asking her if she was alright and why she wandered off on her own.<br>\r\n\"Ga-ard? Gard de voir!\" she apparently answered him, \"Voir de gar. Garr.\"<br>\r\n\"Gaaaall! Ade!!\"<br>\r\n\"Gar ar arde!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was currently feeling like the odd one out. Gallade didnt so much as give me a telepathic translation of their conversation. But I'm certain they were bringing up me in their chat a few times judging by the way Gallade and Gardevoir turned her heads to me a few times. Every time she turned her head to me, it seemed warmed and inviting while every time Gallade turned his head to me, it seemed cold and hostile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that I was way too interested for my own good, I returned my attention to the surroundings. There was still nothing out of the ordinary, but I had to keep my guard up. For all I knew, Darkrai was probably giving us a false sense of security before knocking us out when we least suspect it and devouring our dreams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, Gallade grabbed Gardevoir's arm and began dashing off! Geez, jerk didnt even bother to warn me that they were leaving! Nonetheless, I ran along with them trying to keep up.<br>\r\nFortunately for us, we made it out of that abandoned frosty wasteland without a single Darkrai in sight. Guess the whole 'Darkrai' schtick was just a silly children's horror story after all.<br>\r\nAll three of us stared at one another for almost a whole moment as a light cool breeze blown across us. I was getting awful sick of the silence myself. I was waiting for Gallade to say or think anything. After all, he hasnt properly thanked me for helping him find his sister (not to mention providing her warmth and shelter!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gal!\" he FINALLY broke the silence, but only to speak to his sister, \"Gallade. Gallade!\"<br>\r\n\"Gaarr...\" Gardevoir gave a slightly timid nod. And just like that, the two turned around and walked off. Not even a thank you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the two of them were out of view, I gave a harsh shrug and thought, 'YOURE WELCOME, JERK!' I sighed hard and shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Smooch!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd flinched a bit when I felt those ghostly lips press against my cheek again! My face went flush yet again from her psychic smooch. Well, at least SHE was grateful! And to be honest, that was pretty much all I cared about! And with that crisis averted, I headed back home with a smile on my face and partially lonesome... still missing my friend.<br>\r\nWell, it was a pretty lively day, but I felt pretty much out of it and should probably head back home for the rest of it. So, I retraced my steps, followed the path me and Gallade took, but reversing it, and before I knew it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I was still wandering the snow-covered forest. Odd. Judging by the directions and length of time we took, I shoulda been back home by now. Once again, I looked for a familiar path and continued retracing my steps.<br>\r\nIt was no good. I still found myself in the middle of the snow-covered forest. Curious, I went as far as following Gallade's footprints in the snow. After a while of pointless walking leading to nowhere, I had come to the realization that I was walking in circles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, this is weird,\" I admitted out loud, \"it shouldnt be this difficult retracing steps! I mean it's not like the paths magically change on their own!\" ...Do they?<br>\r\nNo soon after did I notice that the sky was a dusky red. I wasnt wandering around that long! I've only been out for about a hour during the afternoon! How could it be dusk so soon?!<br>\r\nEven after a few minutes of walking around hopelessly, the dusky sky blackened to a starlit night!<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon!\" I actually blurted out loud as I stared at my watch, \"it's only 2pm! What's going on-!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt a cool breeze chill the back of my neck. Not like the wind. More like somebody literally blowing on my neck! I turned around and lo and behold, nobody was there! As if I wasnt paranoid enough, I could feel another presence around me. Something or someone was watching me. Maybe it was an animal instinct telling me this, but I did not like the presence. Something was telling me to stay away; to keep as far away from it as possible. Too bad that was a lot easier said than done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO?\" I shouted out, \"IS SOMEBODY THERE?!\" No response. But I knew somebody was there! \"I KNOW YOURE OUT THERE! SHOW YOURSELF!\" Still nothing. Somebody was playing a joke on me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to feel the cooling chill blow around me. I shivered a bit as I kept pacing around under the starlit sky. Little did I know that cooling chill had another side-effect. The longer I paced around in the chilling wind, the weaker I gotten. My walking slowed, my breathing got heavier, and I was having trouble keeping my eyelids open. I was feeling very tired all of a sudden. My body felt like it hadnt slept in days! Whoever was out there, it had just sapped up all my energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of me that wasnt feeling tired was starting to worry. That part of me was telling the rest of my body to wake up and start panicking, but the rest of my body wasnt hearing any of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont strain yourself...\" I heard a pleasant voice whisper in my ear, \"lie down... take a rest...\"<br>\r\n\"Lie down...\" my own mouth repeated in agreement, \"...take a rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough my barely opened eyes, I made out a big luxurious bed in the middle of nowhere. It looked brand new and very neatly made. My brain was too out of it to question what a bed was doing in the middle of nowhere. All it was thinking was 'PERFECT TIMING'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie down here...\" the voice whispered, \"it's so nice... and warm here....\"<br>\r\nIt felt like my feet were moving on my own, heading toward that bed to take a nice little nap... that for all I know, I probably wouldnt wake from!<br>\r\nAs I got closer, I could make out another figure lying on that bed, waiting. I couldnt see it very clearly, but I was able to make out the figure of a white haired woman in a black tattered gothica dress with what looked like a red scarf around her neck. Despite being unable to see her face, her bright blue eyes shined very clearly even through my spaced out vision. Her eyes probably helped draw me closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep...\" the voice whispered as I headed closer to that bed, \"sleep...\"</span></div></div>",

He also seemed incredibly quick to jump to conclusions. I figured that if I told him the truth, he'd automatically assume I was trying to take advantage of that Gardevoir friend/sister/girlfriend/wife/mother/daughter/whatever of his and probably tear me to pieces with his elbow-blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure he was part psychic, but he was also part fighting, so hopefully the PSYCHIC part of him isnt able to read minds! Especially the one about how I'm really really REALLY that Gardevoir's tele-smooches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know what youre talking about,\" I lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you dont know?!\" His cold glare of disbelief matched the voice I heard in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know of any Gardevoir,\" I answered, \"I have never seen a single Garevoir since I first started living here. I know this place aint exactly a safe breeding ground for Ralts. I'm still dumbstruck that I'm standing here talking to a Gallade of all things!\" The angry Gallade squinted his angry eyes at me. \"Er, no offense.\"<br>\r\nI waited patiently for his response, but I was not liking the stare his giving me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the kind of stare. That silent but artic cold chilling staredown kind of stare that you see in those detective movies during an interrogation when the detective guy sees through the suspect's bullshit and just silently waits until the suspect suddenly cracks and confesses the whole thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT kind of stare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gall...\" he silently grunted. Danged if I knew what that meant. After almost a whole minute and a half of staring silently with the front door left wide open causing me to freeze my ass off, I finally heard a telepathic response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've NEVER seen a Gardevoir here?\" he questioned, \"Ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"No never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued staring me in the eye. \"Not even once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not even once.\" I answered. Sweat dripped down my forehead. Was he buying it? Am I finally clear to go... I mean is HE finally clear to go?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. I breathed a sigh of relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...right before being sent flying and smacking straight into the kitchen table, shattering it on impact! Pain enveloped me. I think I mighta bruised a few ribs, but I was still in a daze from the sudden psychic G-force that sent me flying to concern myself with pain! If I had to make an educated guess, I'd say he didnt buy it. Nope not a bit. Shoulda known Gallades werent stupid. Now I learned the hard way that they were smart AND strong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dizziness died so, I focused more attention to how much I was hurting at the moment! I'm pretty sure I pulled something from the impact, but I'd rather not get into detail what! How I wished Gardevoir was here to psychic-kiss all these booboos and make them all better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, I saw Gallade charging at me at mach speed! You bet your ass he wasnt done with me yet!<br>\r\nNext thing I remember was that he was standing over me with his razor sharp elbow-blade pointed at my throat. Man if looks could kill, he wouldnt need that elbow-blade to tear my throat open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gall Gal ade. Gaaaa,\" his voice was intimidatingly cold and I had to lie there and wait for the telepathic translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will ask you just one last time, human.\" the voice spoke calmly just before Gallade leaned down close to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd roared, \"GAAAAAALLADE??!!!!\" <br>\r\n\"WHERE IS SHE?!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As peaceful as she looked while asleep, it was probably for the best that I woke her up. It was an extreme, but what if she did have family looking for her? I imagined how awkward it would be if they found her sleeping in my bed. If she had a boyfriend/husband... well, use YOUR imagination. Besides, I'm not a pokemon trainer and I'd rather not be fined if word got out I was illegally housing a wild pokemon without a license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made me feel bad waking Gardevoir, seeing her curling up in my blanket basking in it's warmth, no doubt having a good dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gently shook her a little, being extra careful not to spook her. You NEVER wanna spook a high-leveled pokemon that specializes in psychic powers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G....gar....\" fortunately for me, she slowly woke up with no hassle. She stretched a little, let out a yawn, and rubbed her eyes. It mustve been the best sleep she had in a long while, huh?<br>\r\nAfter her red eyes focused, she drew her attention to me and gave me the world's brightest smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir!\" she immediately hugged me! Gosh, I nearly zoned out from the hug she was giving me! It felt so warm and snuggly! The red protrusion in her chest wasnt bothering me one bit. No wonder Gardevoirs are 'embracing' pokemon!<br>\r\nI smiled nervously and hugged her back, \"Good morning, Gardevoir. Guess you slept well?\" I really didnt want her to let go of me, but she unfortunately did. I missed it almost as much as her psychic-kiss!<br>\r\n\"Garde!\" she announced with utter excitement, \"gar gar de! Gar!\" Wow was she pretty up and at'em this morning. That's good. She shouldnt have much trouble heading home. Not that I was in any hurry to let her leave, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry, huh?\" I asked her. She just tilted her head, still smiling a cute smile, \"I'll make us some breakfast in a little bit.  First, I'm gonna go take a quick shower.\"<br>\r\n\"Gar gardevoir!\" she beamed again. Shame I couldnt understand what she was saying.<br>\r\n\"I wont be long, I promise!\" I assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaar de! Gardevoir!\" *smooch!* I jumped again from the ghostly kiss on my cheek! Part of me deep down was screaming 'YES! YES! SHE KISSED ME AGAIN!' while I tried my best to keep a cool face, despite my blushing.<br>\r\n\"Heheheh,\" I laughed nervously, \"Uh...\" I returned the favor and blew her a kiss, even though she wont feel it!<br>\r\n\"Ga ha har!\" she giggled. I certainly hope she didnt take that the wrong way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I headed to my bathroom, took off my clothes, and ran the hot water, basking in the ambiance under the shower head. The warm water felt really good against my freezing cold skin. After a blistering cold night, it was refreshing to be in a nice hot shower. I took my time savoring before I finally rubbed some shampoo in my hair until it lathered up nice and reached for the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" stupid soap slipped out of my fingers. Dont you just hate it when that happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the soap's fall stopped short just before hitting the shower floor! It was actually hovering in mid-air! I could see a glowing aura brighten around it as it somehow floated right back up to me! I raised my eyebrow and dropped my jaw in absolute dumbstruck at the magic trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garde?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Gardevoir... GARDEVOIR?!\" I jumped and lost my footing and almost slipped after seeing Gardevoir standing right in front of me in the shower! It was nerve wrecking and embarrassing to say the least! Ya know, being naked in a shower with the lady and all... even if said lady was a pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar de gard!\" she continued smiling at me like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-G-Gardevoir!\" my face went red and used my hands to cover my special spot, \"y-youre not supposed to be in here! This is... kinda private!\"<br>\r\n\"Gar ar de?\" Gardevoir tilted her head.<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm naked?\"<br>\r\n\"Gar?\"<br>\r\n...Oh right. Why would it matter to her? She's technically naked too, despite the 'dress'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaarr...\" she turned her attention from me to the shower head. She actually hovered under it and twirled around in the warm 'rain'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GA HAAAA!!!\" she shouted with utter excitement, spinning about, probably savoring the warm as I was! I snickered a little and shook my head, and resumed washing myself while she was uh, 'busy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga ardevoir?\" she then stopped spinning and turned her attention to me again, \"Ga arde! Gar de! Voir!\"<br>\r\nSadly, I had absolutely no clue what she was going on about. But whatever it was mustve been important to her.<br>\r\n\"Um... uh...\" didnt know what to say. I really REALLY wished I was a pokemon trainer. Or at least I really REALLY wished she could just speak to me telepathically!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I noticed she grabbed an extra bar of soap. \"Gaa ar!\" She constantly pointed to me. \"Gaa ar!\"<br>\r\nI just shrugged my arms and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" then she began rubbing the bar of soap against my back! Somehow, I didnt flinch out of surprise or anything. I just stood there remaining all cool while she got my back all nice and sudsy. How thoughtful of her. Heck of a way to bond with a total stranger.<br>\r\n\u201cGa hahahar!!\u201d she laughed happily like an super excited new wife that\u2019s showering with her husband for the very first time. Oh dear. That probably wasn\u2019t a good comparison.<br>\r\nDespite her eagerness, I closed my eyes and tried to relax as I humored her, letting her constantly rub soap against my back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uh\u2026 \u2018hands\u2019 were soft, but they were incredibly rough on my skin what with her practically slapping soap on me instead of rubbing. But at least she was enjoying it. That was enough for me, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGar de voir!\u201d her washing finally ended. I guess that was her way of saying \u2019All done!\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cEr, thanks,\u201d I properly thanked her, hoping her mate never ever EVER finds this out\u2026 if she has one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and turned around. \u201cGar de! Gar de!\u201d Then she pointed to her own back.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d I tilted my head, unable to comprehend what she was saying to me.<br>\r\n\u201cGar! De!\u201d she pointed to my bar of soap then to her back. \u2026OH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants ME to wash HER back? I uh\u2026 didnt know if I should find it cute or awkward. Assuming the worst, my face went red, finding it awkward. Sure, she gleefully washed MY back with no hassle or care, but I\u2019m not nearly as carefree as she is! Pokemon or not, part of me still felt rather shy being naked in a shower with a female stranger! Especially a female EMBRACING stranger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGar de?\u201d She looked over her shoulder at me with a questioned frown, \u201cGar de voir?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was overthinking this. WAY overthinking this. Overthinking times infinity plus one no take backs! She's just a pokemon. A POKEMON! An animal that can be zapped into a tiny ball that fits in your pocket! It's probably not uncommon that other trainers have showered with their pokemon! Theyre practically pets! ...Nevermind I wasnt a trainer and Gardevoir wasnt a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I forced THAT train of thought through my head and kicked out the whole taboo vibes, I sighed partially relieved and told her, \"Hold still.\" Possibly sensing I'm finally cooled down (despite being warmed in a hot shower), Gardevoir smiled and turned her head back forward.<br>\r\nI lathered up my hands with as much as the soap as I could, not sure how much would be too much for a Gardevoir's skin, and gently rubbed her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga ha hah,\" Gardevoir giggled as I ran my soapy hands up and down her back. She got a bit squeamish when I was cleaning her sides. She mustve been ticklish. She relaxed though after I started rubbing her shoulders. Bear in mind, it wasnt necessary, but I somehow felt obligated to give her a light shoulder rub perhaps to ease the tension she had when she was out in the blistering cold all by her lonesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deee....\" she sighed, pleased by my rubbing. Dont ask me why, but I couldnt stop there. I stopped focusing on scrubbing and just concentrated on giving her a nice massage. I thoroughly rubbed her shoulderblades with my thumbs in a rhythmic pattern, hoping to de-stiffen those aching spots that somehow I knew she had.<br>\r\nGardevoir was twitching, but she gave me no hint to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the next part... well, I'm still unsure how I knew, because I dont really know much about the body of a Gardevoir, but I sensed the most tension coming from the back of that big red protrusion sticking out of her dorsal region. I'm still not sure what the protrusion is nor what it does if it even has a use, but some dumb part of me was telling me to massage it.<br>\r\n\"G-G-GARRR?!!!\" she immediately jumped and flinched as soon as I pressed my fingers deep into that protrusion piece! I quickly thought 'Uh oh! Was that a bad touch?!' I was pretty nervous, because I had no idea what that meant. It just didnt seem like a good reaction. Worst case scenario, it was sexual harassment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of reaction any further (let alone psychically beating my ass for touching her where I shouldnt), she simply got a little flustered, but didnt seem resistant. Against my better judgement, I assumed she didnt want me to stop. So again, I was pressing my finger into the red protrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-G-Garrrrr.... d-deeeee....\" she was shivering, even gritting her teeth, but she still wasnt resisting. She could easily push me away, maybe send me flying across the room with a single thought, but she did none of that. Interesting. The protrusion itself felt incredibly firm, but not hard. I could pinch my fingers deep into it's 'flesh' and it would always regain it's shape rather quickly. Like the memory foam in my mattress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt until I noticed she was panting awful heavily before I finally decided to stop. I er, think I overdid it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-ok!\" I finally stopped, trying to hide the blush on my face, \"there! N-nice and clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vore? De?\" she quickly turned around facing me... I couldnt un-notice the rather intrigued look in her eyes as she stared at me. Whatever I did, something told me I passed the point of no return.<br>\r\n\"Uh, shower's over!\" I quickly dashed to the shower knob and turned off the shower, trying to ignore the intrigued stare she was giving me. I also tried to ignore her stare as I put on my clothes... I ESPECIALLY tried to ignore her stare as I was bending over to pick up my clothes!<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" I put on a nervous smile, \"let's go get breakfast!\" I dashed out of the bathroom and she dashed along with me. I still felt her intrigued stare as I made my way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I searched through the fridge for a few bites to eat while Gardevoir was keeping her eyes on me for some odd reason. I thought about whipping up some pancakes or bacon and eggs. Unfortunately I was out of eggs. And bacon. And butter. And milk. And pancake mix. Good lord, I forgot to buy groceries before the stupid storm! Urggh. Perfect timing, yes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGar de?\u201d my intrigued companion tilted her head, sensing my uneasiness (THIS uneasiness, anyway!). I knew the damn storm was coming! I told myself to prepare for it. I told myself repeatedly \u201cGO TO THE SUPERMARKET! GET GROCERIES BEFORE IT STARTS! OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!\u201d<br>\r\nWell I didnt. And I do regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, I had an unopened box of Pop Tarts hidden in the corner of a food cabinet. Sigh, that is not breakfast! That's vitamin candy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head to Gardevoir actually considering it. I mean, she's just a pokemon. It's not like she's got an expensive palate or anything.<br>\r\nBut the moral side of me told myself not to be stingy. It was actually telling me to head outside in the storm and get more groceries! IN THE STORM, can you believe it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat side of me did nag pretty hard. It made me hesitant to open the box of Pop Tarts and call it breakfast. I looked out the window. It wasnt snowing as bad as last night, but still...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as I wished I could whip up a classy breakfast for the Gardevoir, I didn't want to trudge through all the leftover snow from yesterday's blizzard just to do some shopping, especially not on an empty stomach, and it'd be a while past breakfast time even if I did. So I figured I should just work with what I have for now, and that entailed Pop Tarts for breakfast. I popped open the box and pulled out the foil-wrapped snack food. Gardevoir seemed to be intrigued by what I was doing, leaning in close over my shoulder to see what I was doing, so I filled her in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just preparing some breakfast. It's going to take a few minutes, though,\" I informed her, as I opened the foil and put the snacks in the toaster. I was prepared to discard the foil, but Gardevoir looked interested in the shiny item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gard?\" She was looked at me with a cocked head. I offered the foil to her, since she seemed to want it. She gently took it out of my hand and started playing with it, waving it around and marveling at how the light reflected off of its surface. Now it was my turn to be the observer, as I stood leaning against the countertop looking at her amusement towards the simple snack wrapper. After a couple minutes, the relatively loud springing sound of the toaster broke the tranquil quiet of the room. Gardevoir in particular seemed to be the more shocked of us two, as she dropped the foil and looked towards me as if she was worried about the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, that's just the toaster,\" I conveyed, even though she likely wasn't sure what that meant either. I grabbed a napkin and took the two Pop Tarts out of the toaster, letting them cool a bit on the same napkin for a moment before walking into the living room and handing them both to Gardevoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Gardevoir,\" I said to her, before sitting down on my couch. She seemed a bit confused by the objects I'd just handed her, so I informed her, \"it's food.\" At this she brightened a little, which reaffirmed my thoughts that she had a decent understanding of simple English, at least in reference to concepts she'd come across in her own life. She wolfed down the first Pop Tart, and I couldn't really blame her. After all, the only thing she'd had yesterday was a quick sandwich I whipped up in the moment, and I had no clue how much she had eaten before then. With this in mind, I got up to go and see about getting something a little more filling (for her and myself), drawing Gardevoir's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voir? Gar gar de voir?\" I didn't need to know her language to know she wanted to know where I was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for something else we can eat,\" I responded, as I entered the kitchen once more and inspected the contents of the fridge. In my search I found a couple of assorted berries, something I knew many Pokemon would eat on a daily basis, so I grabbed a handful of those and set them on a platter. I followed this up with another pack of Pop Tarts for myself, before leaving the room. The second I walked back into the living room, Gardevoir's eyes lit up. I knew she'd be excited for this. I walked over to the couch and set down the platter on the table right in front of the couch, and then sat down again, beckoning her over to do the same. Gardevoir confusedly came over to me and did as I was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garrrrrr...\" The moment she sat down, Gardevoir seemed to calm down significantly, not talking, looking around, or anything. I took this moment to chow down on my own pair of Pop Tarts, before sitting up to reach for one of the berries. At this, Gardevoir put her arm over me, keeping me down. At first I was more than a bit confused, but then I saw a cyan aura appear around one of the berries, followed by it gently floating off of the plate and directly towards my right hand. Looks like she didn't to get up from the comfort of the couch, and she didn't want me to have to either. I gently nibbled into the berry, at the amusement of Gardevoir, who had dug into her own. This continued for some time, and before long the only thing left on the platter were berry stems, leaves, and cores, plus the two Pop Tart wrappers. Gardevoir and I, full on berries and Pop Tarts, were simply reclined on the couch, relaxing the morning away. I knew we couldn't spend all day here, though, and began to wonder what else we could do today.</span></div></div>",

I didnt have much for lunch to share with my new guest and dinner was literally gonna be toaster leavings. I shouldnt have neglected grocery shopping for so long. I only had myself to blame for being forced to brave the storm to achieve the bare necessities. At the very least it wasnt as bad as earlier. It's now mostly rain instead of snow. Hopefully I can rush over and back without drowning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir immediately eyed me the split second I got up out of my seat.<br>\r\n\"Gar?!\" she questioned me like a frightened housewife.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go get groceries,\" I answered her regardless of whether she understood me, \"I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garde!\" she hopped up off the couch, still expressing concern.<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I wont be long,\" I tell her even though the words werent filtering in, \"I'm just gonna head over to the supermarket and pick up some things and come right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga ar de!\" Gardevoir followed me as I headed to the door, \"Gar de! Vore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and turned back to her, \"I'll be back soon. I promise.\" Didnt look like my statements were clicking with this psychic pokemon. So I had to stop treating her like an adult human and start treating her like a pokemon.<br>\r\n\"Here,\" I went over to the remote and turned on the tv.  She immediately jerked her head to the tv screen as soon as it came on.<br>\r\n\"TV. Television,\" I explained and put the remote in her... hand/paw/thing, \"you can play with this while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaarrr...\" she stated with a bit of added interest (of course, not nearly as much interest as when I squeezed her red-thingy in the shower!) I waved her back down to the couch and despite looking reluctant to, she finally sat back down and focused on the tv screen... though looking back at me one last time just before I stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didnt end up getting TOO soaked in the rain, praise Arceus. My clothes were a little wet, but nothing I couldnt handle. Sure my hair got pretty drenched, but that's only because I didnt bring an umbrella.  But it was ok. I didnt spend an awful lot of time shopping anyways, I mainly just bought a few microwave dinners, some frozen meats, a couple of drinks, a small bag of pokemon food, and a couple of snacks. That was all. A short line at the checkout and a quick pay with the debit card later, I grabbed my bagged groceries and I was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Simon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil I heard HER voice which to those too informed for their own good signaled absolute DOOM.<br>\r\nI paled worse than the rain made me and mouthed 'OH FUCKING HELL' before turning my head to her and smiling, \"H-hi Matori! Fancy running into you today!\" I almost sounded sarcastic, but it mostly came out kinda off pitch!<br>\r\nThe purple haired woman in spectacles smiled sweetly at me despite the familiar looking R logo on her parka filled me with dread.<br>\r\n\"Shopping for groceries in this weather?\" Matori stopped whatever she was doing to continue chatting, \"I hope you bought plenty of cold medicine.\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, I was just getting a few last minute things,\" I had no choice but to respond, \"it aint bad. I dont live that far, anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Right, you live just up that hill over there, dont you?\" I took a heavy breath, hoping to Arceus she doesnt know my address.<br>\r\n\"A-a-a little further!\"<br>\r\n\"And how's your father been doing? Did he ever manage to expand his burger restaurant chain in Aloha?\" I feared not only for myself but for dad as well.<br>\r\n\"N-Not yet,\" I answered, \"h-he's still finishing up the last few payments of his first restaurant.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you remind him that if he's ever in need of a good loan, you have my card,\" she reminds me. Like hell I'm gonna put pops in that kind of jeopardy.<br>\r\n\"I did,\" I lied, \"but he's really stubborn. He'd rather pay everything off out of his own pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Anyways, I'm currently running a few errands for work with a couple of associates of mine,\" Matori explained what she was doing even though I didnt ask her, \"on the way, I've been in a bit of a spending mood. Now that the President pass a new tax cut plan, our boss gave us all very generous bonuses.\" I never thought that HER line of work would even have a tax status to begin with!<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's great,\" I pretended to be excited for her.<br>\r\n\"With all that extra money I've made, I bought some gifts. Here, I even bought you something!\" she reached into her bag and pulled out an umbrella... An umbrella that bared the logo of Celadon Game Corner... one of her business's fronts! Not only that, she even got me a nice thick warm parka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heh, wow! Thank you!\" I eyed the parka, trying to keep my face straight and not looking too suspiciously at the R-insignia engrave on it!<br>\r\n\"I had it custom made and tried my best to match your measurements and ensure it fit you right,\" I pretended not to be a little creeped out by her words, \"go ahead try it on!\" I swallowed hard and put the parka on, hoping no cops were witnessing me in it (and at the same time hoping cops WERE witnessing it!). It fit perfectly.<br>\r\n\"It suits you perfectly,\" Matori smiled passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, thank you again for the gifts!\" I expressed my gratitude and hoped she didnt take it as flattery. With that, I turned around and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way!\" until Matori zipped in front of me and blocked my path! \"Do you happen to have free time tonight? There's going to be a special parade and firework show happening in Jubilife City later.\" If I was completely oblivious to her occupation and the people she's affiliated with, I probably wouldnt hesitate to go with her! I aint incredibly particular when it comes to a girl asking me out!<br>\r\nBut I knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, Matori,\" I tried my best to shoot her down easy, \"I'm gonna be really busy later.\"<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\" she had the decency to question me.<br>\r\n\"I've currently got a guest at my place,\" I answer.<br>\r\n\"A guest? An old friend? A relative?\" Matori got awfully noisy.<br>\r\nI swallowed and shook my head, \"Nah, she's a new neighbor. And I want to make her feel at home. Show her around.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah! Would you like a hand?\" she offered, \"me and a few associates of mine would be happy to show her around and make her feel at home!\" LIKE. FUCKING. HELL.<br>\r\n\"TH-THAT'S... ahem! That's right,\" I almost lost my cool for a second! \"I think I got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then will you be available tomorrow?\" she wasnt about to take no for an answer, \"Hearthome City's putting on a concert. I have front row tickets.\"<br>\r\n\"M-Maybe next time,\" I told her and I walked around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about next week?\" and she zipped in front of me AGAIN! \"we can watch this year's Pokemon League Tournament.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I really need to get going-\"<br>\r\nThen she grabbed my arm. And that look in her spectacle-covered red eyes was chilling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont understand,\" she seemed a tad bit cross at me, \"you seem to always be busy whenever I ask you to go somewhere with me. Is there some kind of a problem?\"<br>\r\n\"M-Matori, I honestly didnt mean to offend you if I-\"<br>\r\n\"Then why do you always keep telling me youre busy? Are you trying to avoid me or something?\" crap! Why today of all days?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless. I had to say something. She wasnt gonna let me leave.<br>\r\n\"L-l-listen,\" I explained, \"it's not like I'm not interested. I am. I'm very flattered, really.\" I took a deep breath, \"However, I... dont think it's gonna work.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" she continued.<br>\r\n\"Well... uh... it's not you. It's just... well, I'm not really interested in a relationship. And I know your line of work can be tough on relationships and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" AW CRAP! She gazed at me very suspiciously! I just said the wrong words! \"Why do you think my line of work is tough on relationships?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... w-well...\"<br>\r\n\"Just what are you implying?\" Matori squinted her eyes at me, \"what do you think I do for a living?\"<br>\r\n\"Matori, I'm sorry, it was a bad slip of the tongue-\"<br>\r\n\"No, answer me,\" she demanded, \"what exactly do you think my line of work is?\" I saw through the corner of my eye that she was reaching into her pocket as she asked me. What was in her pocket? A gun? A taser? A syringe? A special prototype pokeball that captures humans?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MATORI!!\" just then, one of her big bald surly associates called to her from a big black van, \"HURRY UP! WE GOTTA GET MOVING!\"<br>\r\nPraise Arceus, that was the end of it.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Simon. I have to go,\" she humbly bowed, \"see you around.\" And headed to the van and it drove off. I facepalmed. I dodged a heck of a bullet, but that wasnt the last of her. I'm so thankful I didnt bring Gardevoir grocery shopping with me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the rain calmed down, the walk home was incredibly nerve-wrecking. I suddenly remembered why I skipped out on grocery shopping for so long. God, I hope one of Gardevoir's ghost-kisses could perk me back up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, I headed back to my house and hoped my new guest is fine and didnt cause a ruckus while I was gone. To find out, I opened the door and saw her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared blankly with no other expression than I was already giving earlier as my tv set lay on the floor cracked and sparking as my new Gardevoir friend stood over it in an obvious panicked look on her face. It was a no-brainer what happened. Gardevoir broke my tv. I dont know how she did it nor did I care. It was now an oversized fizzling brick of shattered glass on the floor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner did I realize this awful situtation did Gardevoir turn her head and notice I came back. Clearly sorry for what she did, she rushed over to me and constantly bowed over and over, begging and pleading with me in her Pokemonish language.<br>\r\nAny other time, I'd be pretty miffed. That was pretty danged expensive 50 inch flat screen Ultra HDTV with 4K compatibility even though I had no idea what 4K even is! But now, after my intimidating encounter with my old shifty friend Matori that almost went sour, I was in no mood to get mad. I was just as feared for my life as Gardevoir was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" I spoke in an unusually deadpan voice. Gardevoir still continued to apologize and I just replied, \"It's fine, I got another in my room.\"<br>\r\nShe continued bowing, begging, and pleading while I cleaned up the mess with a souless look on my face with the memories of Matori leaving me too shellshocked to display any other emotion or feeling.<br>\r\n\"Accidents happen,\" I pretty much tuned out the pokeapologies while I took as much of the broken tv as I could to the recycle bin, still keeping an eye out in case Matori was watching me from the shadows. I kept telling myself she didnt know where I live, but I knew she was still trying to find out. If a brand new Ultra HDTV flatscreen with 5K compatibility suddenly shows up at my door, I'll know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I dumped the last bit of the broken tv, I thought to myself of the special smart chips they put in them. Rumor has it, certain corporations use them to spy on people... if a certain company manufactured said chip... and a certain high-ranked member of said company was tracking those chips.... well, long story short, I yanked out the chip from the tv's corpse and chucked in the fireplace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCant pussyfoot around this. I was a mess. A total mess. All it took was one bad moment, ONE BRIEF BAD MOMENT OF DISCOMFORT THAT'S IT, to turn a good day into the worst day of my life and question everything up to it. And the brief disagreement that occurred just before Matori left filled my head and left me wondering. How close for comfort was that? Did she figure out I know she works for Team Rocket? Will she still remember that bit the next time we meet? What was in her pocket she was about to reach for?! How fast can I get into witness protection and change my name?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those questions and more arose as I got the smaller, not Ultra HD, not 4K compatible, tracking chipless tv from my room and brought it to the living room for me and Gardevoir to enjoy. At least she was infinitely quick to get over her worries the moment I turned on the tv. It gave me ample time to microwave some tv dinners. The few minutes I spent waiting for the microwave to finish cooking felt like hours. Several hours later, the cooking was done and I brought our dinners over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Gardevoir friend gleefully scarfed hers down like it was the closest thing to real meal she's had in a long time (and considering how well she liked her pop tart, it probably was). Me, I just took small unnoticeable bites as I stared at the screen in deep thought. I wasnt paying much attention to the cartoon. I dont even remember what we were watching. Some harem cartoon involving taking place in the country involving some guy who can change into a girl. <br>\r\nIf I was in the right state of mind, I'd be kinda dumbfounded watching how slapsticky awkward it is, and maybe be a tad offended by a certain character with a thick accent speaking broken english, but that state of mind took a nice long vacation and left the rest of me behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir was practically glued to the screen, fully entertained and even laughing at the comedic moments even though she probably didnt understand what they were saying! I just stared into space tuning out everything in the universe but the memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt long before my friend turned her head and noticed my uneasiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Gar?\u201d she spoke over to me questionably, \u201cGar de?\u201d I didnt respond. \u201cGar de? Gar de gar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?!\u201d I snapped out of it and turned back to my pokemon friend who looked toward me with concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaar?\u201d she asked like I knew what she said. Although I had a good guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It's nothing, I'm fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaar?\u201d she reapeated herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it's nothing. Dont worry about it.\u201d<br>\r\nShe stared silently at me. Like she knew something was up. Like she was waiting patiently for me to crack regardless of whether or not she could understand me. In a way, it awful thoughtful of her to be concerned for my well being. But on the other hand, I'd hate to get her involved in things she shouldnt be involved in (especially when it's involving particular poachers that would no doubt wanna consider catching her!). Still, I wasnt making things easier for myself keeping this all bottled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short patient while, I couldnt take her silent stare any longer. I finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time I recognized what she was, she had already woken up. Her big red eyes gazed into me with determination as if not bothered at all by the pain of whoever harmed her. Immediately afterwards, I felt some hostile vibes emitting from her... giving me the suspicion that I probably shouldnt have gotten so close to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gardevoir suddenly grabbed my arm and squeezed it! Just as I wondered what she was up to, my arm began to tingle and shake! Every finger and thumb on that hand was twitching on reflex of their nerves reacting somehow! I wasnt even moving them on my own!<br>\r\nIn mere seconds the strange tingles and twitches spread throughout the rest of my body, making me totally lose control of everything below my neck! For a moment, I felt like a marionette with Gardevoir tugging on my strings, making me a do a little dance! Worst moment in the world to remember she's a high-level psychic pokemon! A WILD high-level psychic pokemon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar de.... voir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she let go of my arm, I still couldnt move! I felt some sort of surge of power keeping me frozen stiff! No matter how much I tried, how much my brain tried to tell the rest of my body to move, it wouldnt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" the pokemon merely dusted herself off and circled around me, still gazing into me with intrigue! <br>\r\nJudging by the way she twirled around me effortlessly, she didnt seem wounded! She wasnt hurt at all! I noticed a grin across Gardevoir's mouth as I heard the word 'IDIOT' echo in my head! Damn it, I've been set up! <br>\r\nI couldnt believe I let myself fall victim to such an obvious trap! A professional trainer like myself had just made a Grade A rookie mistake: underestimating an unfamiliar wild pokemon without my partner on standby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arr....let me go!\" I demanded, which looking back wasnt a good idea! A high-leveled psychic pokemon could leave quite some nasty mental harm to it's victim. Worst case scenario, they could cause some serious brain damage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaar.... gar de,\" I heard her mock me in her own language while I kept hearing 'IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT' repeat over and over in my mind. \"Gard! Gar gar garde! Voir de!\" With no other options, I was forced to just stand there in silence and accept her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ga?!\" just then, her eyes lowered down to my waist. Sweat dropped down my forehead as that intrigued gaze of hers locked on my belt! She snatched my pokeball holster right off and glared back up at me... like I just made a non-verbal offense. For a wild pokemon, it was a GREAT offense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gardevoir? ....Gardevoir?! GAR-DE-VOIR?!!\" she raised her voice angrily at me in her little outrage. Although I couldnt understand her pokemonish language, I knew exactly what she saying.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" I answered,\"I'm a pokemon trainer. I capture pokemon.\"<br>\r\n\"Gar-de?!! Gar-de-VOIR!!\" she smacked me hard in the chest with my own holster! Thankfully, her psychic spell she put on my body numbed the pain, but it probably left behind a bad rash! She still didnt cool down yet.<br>\r\nGardevoir chanted something, causing my pokeball holster to glow a darkish aura. Whatever she was about to do wasnt gonna end well form my pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaaaaarrr...\" my eyes widened when she tossed the glowing holster up in the air...<br>\r\n\"What do you think youre-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...VOIR!!\"<br>\r\nMy holster suddenly exploded! All my pokeballs were sent flying all across the forest! The little poke-bitch! I spent a ton of money on those balls and she just scatters them all across the land! Arceus help her if one of those had my Latios in it! I wanted to vent and shout, but I knew better. I didnt want her to leave any mental scars... let alone physical ones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gar?\" Gardevoir looked down and noticed one of them was left behind! It mustve fell out when she holster-whipped me! I paled as she bent over and picked it up, still eyeing it with intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I noticed the little blue 'L' I painted on that pokeball! My Latios pokeball!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa hey stop! Put that down!\" I pleaded, \"please, put it down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir looked as though she raised an eyebrow at me. Great, now I made her curious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please give it back,\" I begged her, \"I dont care about the others! Just give that one back! That's all I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarr...\" once again, the damn clever psychic pokemon smirked. She knew I wanted it bad. Did she know WHY I wanted it bad?! I could never live it down if I lost my Latios! Latios was my own and only partner! I... wouldnt say he was a 'friend' or anything like that, more like a devoted teammate! He was loyal, strong, and goshdarn it he'd ALWAYS get the job done! He'd show this psychic bitch a thing or two for messing with me! But he's helpless while he's still in his boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Just give me back the pokeball and I'll walk away,\" I tried to reason with the pokemon, \"you'll never see me again! I swear! HEY! STOP THAT!!\" The smug little green monster actually had the gall to start juggling it in front of me! She continued to try my patience, tossing it in the air and catching it with one hand! I'd clench my fists... if I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah,\" Gardevoir finally stopped juggling my pokeball. And then she turned around and walked off... with my damn Latios!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME BACK!!!\" I shouted, but to no avail! The little thief disappeared into the forest with my pokeball! I couldnt believe it. All because I was worried she mightve been hurt! The only voice I heard in my head calling me an idiot was my own! How could I let myself get suckered in by such a poke-conartist?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after she was gone, the psychic hold she had on my body disappeared as well! I could move again, but it was still long before I could celebrate. Without my Latios, I wouldnt be celebrating ever again!<br>\r\nIt was my duty to go after that little manipulative theif and get my pokemon back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before I was about to charge in with guns blazing like the reckless idiot that I am, I thought about the situation. What if she WANTED me to follow her?! She could just be leading me into another trap! Maybe I'd get ambushed by her friends or something! Maybe she'd be leading me toward a pack of hungry Ursarings or something equally scary!<br>\r\nStill, I couldnt leave Latios behind. After all those poke-battles he won me, I owed it to him to rescue him!<br>\r\nBut just chasing after a high-level intelligent pokemon could just end up getting me more hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do?</span></div></div>",

Realizing what she wanted you opened your mouth and allowed her to feed you. She continued with this treatment untold there was only one piece left. Smiling and blushing Zangoose placed the last piece in her lips and leaned in towards you. You blushed heavily and bit the piece, trying to avoid contact with her lips. Just when you were about to pull the piece of fruit away. Zangoose leaned forward forcing you into a kiss. You tried to pull away but only succeeded in falling backwards with her on top of you. Laying on top of you zangoose began to rub your chest through your shirt. You had begun to feel better due to the effects of the pecha berry but this was making you freak out a little. You pushed her off and tried to move away. However you still weren't fully healthy and fell over again. \"Za zangoose\" she said dissapointedly. You looked back only to see the terrible sadness plastered all over her face. \"Dammit\" you mumble, unable to leave her in such a shape. You turn around and pull her into a hug shocking her speechless. After a moment she returned the hug more powerfully than you expected, nearly crushing the breath out of you. \"Zangoose Za\" she mumbled happily. Slowly you extract yourself from her grip \"I have to go home now Zangoose, it was nice to meet you.\"  \"Zaan\" she grabbed your arm with tears in her eyes desperately wanting you to stay, \"I can't stay here zangoose I have a family to get back to!\" she looked at you with pleading eyes gripping your arm to her body like a vice. \"I told you I can't stay!\" you exclaim frustratedly \"but\" you muse as you get an idea \"Would you like to come with me?\"</span></div></div>",

Despite the blowjob she just given you, your desire quickly resurface stronger than ever as your eyes fall on the soft withe fur barely hiding the wild Pok\u00e9mon sex, a new wave of arousal flow through your system, bringing new life at the semi-limp organ the Zangoose just sucked clean<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild Pok\u00e9mon give you a toothy smile as she follow your eyes to her crotch, her fang glisten in the light as she push her hips forward and clearly expose her aroused sex to your sight. You do not even wait for her to say or do anything as you grab her legs and drag her hips to the limit of the couch with her pussy pointing slightly up, placing the underside of your quickly hardening cock on her wetting nether lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems surprised by your forwardness but do otherwise nothing to stop you, she just place her paws on the couch a wait for your next move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel her body heat rising and her breath quickening as her body prepare itself for being mated, the smell of her arousal can now clearly be felt in the air and the very idea of fucking with a wild creature that hold no allegiance to anyone and strong enough to shred a normal human to pieces in mere moments push your libido far beyond anything you have ever felt before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continue to watch you, or more precisely your cock resting on her lips, her expression is one of longing and lust, not need however, merely wants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she has waited long enough, you release one of her legs, while she keep it hanging in the air, and use your freed hand to push the head of your cock in the lower part of her sex, where her wet labia easily part and allow just the tip inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zaann\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grip her leg still hanging and strongly pull her towards you while pushing your hips forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooooooose\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvoluntarily a moan escape your lips as her walls greedily part and immediately begin to squeeze every part of your rod demanding it deeper, until a soft but unyielding wall of flesh and a gasp from the wild Zangoose tell you that your tip just reached the end of her tunnel, looking down you see a good inch still outside her welcoming body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to ignore the problem for now and instead focus your efforts in enjoying her body as you see fit. Slowly, you remove you pleasured rod from her tight insides as her body fight for every inch you pull out, begging and inviting to give back the delicious feeling of being spread and filled so fully. Only after nearly pulling completely out and quickly slamming yourself in, you realize that a human cock is far bigger than the one of any Zangoose and most small-medium Pok\u00e9mon out there, the pleasure of her walls squeezing you so greedily nearly wash out the thoughts of a bigger Pok\u00e9mon fucking your slut<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a chance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea push you to begin to really make use of her offered body, starting to increase the strength behind every push and noticing her increased vocalization of pleasure and the lewd sounds coming from her wet spread lips as she surrender her body to you, only watching you giving her the time of her life. You don't know why, but once again seeing such a strong Pok\u00e9mon offering herself so openly to you boost your arousal sky-high and make you thrust harder and faster inside her welcoming body, ignoring all signals your body give you to slow down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe withe stuffed Pok\u00e9mon vocalizations of approval increase in both volume and frequency driving you to overcoming the burning feeling some of your lower muscle is forcing you to experience due to lack of use in the lasts months. In fact you have never been particularly dominant in your past relation, and it did passed some time among the lack of serious physical exercise, the other reason is laziness but it's unimportant now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefocusing once again on the task at hand you found yourself giving your all with this Pok\u00e9mon, an effort clearly appreciated as she suddenly begin to mercilessly clamp down on your cock like a vice, sucking like a newborn to it's mother tits, demanding your seed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooooooose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came hard, completely uncaring on who or what might hear her screaming her orgasm to the four winds, fortunately you too care little about noises as her wild contraction imprison your rod inside her steaming body and practically force you to release your pent up lust on the not so small Pok\u00e9mon under you. Every spurt from your tip easily find it's place inside her hungry womb as your cock rest pressed against her cervix, bringing forth a small high pitched \"Zang\" from her at every new pulse from your depleting reserves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, an unclear time later your flow finally stop, a last spurt elicit another small moan of approval from your now claimed Pok\u00e9mon, before she collapse down on the couch with you barely hanging from collapsing on top of her. Her painting and big smile tell you anything you may wanted to ask about your performance, or at least you like to think so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with your duty you slowly try extracting yourself from her well used snatch, the deed is proving to be a lot more complicated than expected, in fact every time you try to pull out, her sex clamp down on your oversensitive flesh and force you to stop, least provoking another orgasm so soon after the last one, knowing that right now it may mean collapsing down from fatigue. She doesn't seems to mind however, apparently while she too as similar problem she slightly push her hips towards yours at every attempt, a gesture you interpret as \"fuck me or leave it in, I like where it is\" or something along those lines<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to prove her who is in charge, you grit your teeth and remove all your cock from her dripping love box but the head, then thrust back in with all the strength you can muster, the indecent squelch and the heavy \"ZA!\" coming from her make you smile at your victory, one that is short lived however as her body respond by clamping down fiercely once more, by reaction you pull out completely as quick as possible and uncomfortably land on your naked ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your new position the act you just consumed with this Zangoose is evident, her lower red lips are clearly visible thanks to both the lower density of fur in the area and to their puffiness, all accentuated by a small rivulet of mixed cum flowing out from her well filled sex. The image bring another smile on your face as you successfully try to get up and seat next to her well sated body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole ordeal undoubtedly changed you, before you had more then a few doubts about doing something physical with a Pok\u00e9mon, and lacking a license those ideas were mostly limited to your ever favorite Absol and they were mostly tame, never a wild ride just like the one you just got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that acquiring a license outside the normal school career it's not cheap, a law put in place to discourage the many far too lazy would-be-trainer that would probably neglect their Pok\u00e9mon at the first occasion, but there are ways, being a volunteer for the pokecenter is one of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head towards the Zangoose, your eyes fall on her still dripping sex and thoughts you never had before start forming and taking shape in your head. Maybe being a trainer will be more fun than you thought it would be</span></div></div>",

Why did I take a detour? Arceus, Man im so stupid! I ruined everything. this is my fault, I had all these plans I thought I could hurry to blackrock....\" I sadly said head down. \"You had plans? what plans?\" she said with curiosity. \"Well, guess its no use now. Well, we became friends exactly a year ago. I know its stupid but we were going to blackrock, I figured we could stop by, eat dinner, go to the festival thats tonight, a day of fun.

Did you see something?\" He asked confused \"Uh, yea I just need some fresh air...thats all\" I lied. \"ooook then...\" He said, I could tell he was confused. (Ohh, that was wierd, that was wierd) I thought, (I-its just because we are friends, yea haha, friends loving FRIENDS.) I just stood there for awhile. Just thought about that. (Oh who am I kidding... I felt a feeling of love. NO NO no no no its not it was not.) I shook the thought from my head. I then realized my feet were freezing cold in the snow. I slowly walked back in the cave. That was the strangest thing ive even felt, I mean ive felt love before but, hes, hes human. Its just a crush, just for a second. I looked at the amulet around my neck that I put on in the haste of leaving the cave. The words echoed in my head (\"Your not a pokemon in my eyes, your a friend\")That ment a lot to me, not sure why. I got butterflies and just stared at the amulet with soft eyes. \"You ok?\" His words shattered the quiet of the cave. \"Yes, I just needed air...\" I said. \"Just making sure your ok.I know you said you are, but it looked like something was wrong... If there ever is, please, tell me ok?\" \"ok.\" The silence flooded in. \"Did a hug make you feel uncomfortable? I guess ive never really hugged you, Its ok to say it was...\"</span></div></div>",

You are a novice Pokemon photographer, but you have no Pokemon of your own. Normally, your friend goes with you for protection, but they are busy and nothing has ever really happened before so you decide to go it alone today. As you walk between the lake shore and the tree line, you spot something moving up ahead. You sneak up carefully to investigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a group of Pokemon consisting of a Buizel, a Dewott, and a Vaporeon. They appear to be ganging up on a Pikachu who is keeping them at bay with jolts of electricity. You pull out your camera to capture the oncoming battle. While you focus the lens, you listen in on what they are saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Sparky, give us back our Sitrus berries or we'll have to take them back,\" the Buizel ordered, pounding his fist into his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Blitz, I'm hungry!\" the Pikachu replied. \"And besides, you guys left them outside. How was I supposed to know they were yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the fact that they were on our log, you thieving rat!\" the Vaporeon barked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Vance,\" the Buizel, Blitz, told the water eeveelution, \"we'll get them back. Otto,\" he commanded the Dewott, \"Go easy on him. We want him to learn never to steal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dewott nodded and pulled his razor shell off to attack. With lightning speed, Otto launched forward on an aqua jet and slashed Sparky with his shell. The Pikachu fell backwards in pain, but clung to the berries nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved up to get a better view, but, when you were no more than ten yards away, you tripped on a root and crashed into a pile of sticks and leaves. The sound alerted the Pokemon to your presence and while he left the other two in charge of the Pikachu, the Buizel rushed over to you. You tried to get up and get away, but before you could move, the Buizel had his foot on your neck. He wasn't choking you, yet, but he was letting you know he could. He glared at you in a way that meant: \"Go ahead, try something.\" All you could do was lay there and watch as the other two brought the Pikachu over, knocked out, berries in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, boys, looks like we have to teach two lessons today. Let's get them back to the cave so class can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were inside the cave they had dragged you into, the Dewott rolled a rock in front of the entrance to prevent your escape. The cave was still lit by holes in the ceiling letting it sunshine, but you were in the darkest corner. You saw the three water Pokemon coat the Pikachu in mud to damper his electric attacks. When they finished with him, they stripped you of all of your clothes and equipment. You did not fight it because the Dewott held his razor shell to your throat. The Vaporeon woke the Pikachu up and moved him next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boys,\" the Buizel began, \"we've got a theif and a spy. Justice will be served, but I'm a fair Pokemon. Let's give these two a chance to explain themselves. Rat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu refused to answer, instead spitting on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Sparky chooses his right to remain silent. Human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mr. Buizel\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Blitz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Blitz\u2014I'm just a photographer. I was just trying to capture your battle on film. I wasn't spying on you or anything like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A photographer, huh? Tell me, where would you send those pictures?\" Blitz asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, probably to PokeWeek for the Wild Encounters section. Trainers like to know how wild Pokemon battle so they can prepare their own Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking pictures to expose a rival's secret's to their enemies...sounds like the definition of 'spying' to me. What do you guys think?\" The Dewott and Vaporeon agreed with Blitz. He then assumed a judicial air, \"This jury of your peers finds Sparky guilty of grand theft and the Human guilty of malicious espionage. Your punishment will be decided on in an executive session of the Buizel Gang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three water types moved over to the door to talk in hushed voices, leaving you with the bitter Pikachu. You don't know what to do, so you try to talk to him. \"What kind of punishment do you think they'll give us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Sparky answered. \"All three of them are crazy. But Blitz is the craziest. He's got it in his head that he's a dispenser of justice, but all he does is bully everybody equally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did steal from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Hardly. They purposely leave berries lying out for people to take. Sometimes they let them have them, other times they act like they stole them. I was just unlucky. They're crazy,\" he repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finished, Blitz and the others returned. \"The Buizel Gang has decided that, as punishment, the two of you will be forced to serve us for a week,\" he informed them. \"Be glad that community service is all you got, as your crimes warranted much more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Service?\" you ask. \"What kind of service?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do whatever we tell you to or Otto here slits your throat,\" Blitz stated calmly. \"Now, for my first order, I want the two of you to entertain us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Sparky asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, do something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can juggle,\" you offer. Blitz shoots you another death glare. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a battle?\" The Vaporeon suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vance, that wouldn't be fair to the Human. You know how weak they are. However, that does give me an idea.\" Blitz grinned mischieviously. \"They will fight for dominance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you and Sparky say together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first one of you to fuck the other gets their time reduced by two days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" you refuse. \"One, we're separate species; two, we're both guys; and three, you can't watch people do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Blitz chuckled, \"Because it doesn't seem like Sparky has the same feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see the Pikachu preparing to lunge. You roll out of the way as he dives past you and gets a face full of dirt. He gets up and looks at you. \"Sorry, but I have two little brothers to take care of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, the mud prevents him from doing anything but tackling. You can't let this happen, but you know it is going to. It's fuck or get fucked. At a loss for any way out, you decide to pick the lesser of two evils: you have to fuck Sparky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time he jumps at you, you grab him with both hands and hold him tight. He struggles to slip free, but you don't let go. Despite your rational knowledge that this is wrong, you can't help but get excited as his squirming only brings him closer to your crotch. He panics when he feels the tip of your eight inches touch his rear, but you hang on and push him down harder. He tris to shock you as you prod at his hole, but the mud prevents him from using his attacks. As you finally slide in and he gasps in pain and surprise, he gives up the fight. He knows he has lost and will not get to leave early, so he quits struggling and lets you have your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlitz and the other two were standing aside while you battled Sparky, watching the outcome while slowly stroking themselves. When they see you have Sparky safely impaled on your cock, they move over to join you. You look up from your position hunched over Sparky to see Blitz's cock only a few inches from your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have a winner,\" Blitz said softly, caressing his member with one hand while he stroked your cheek with the other. \"We'll let you leave two days early like we promised, so long as you continue to obey us until then. But first,\" he lifted your chin so that you looked into his eyes, \"I want to see how good you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slides his meat from your cheek down to your lips, making it very clear what he wants you to do. You know you have no choice but to take his member into your mouth and give him a blowjob. As his pink organ passes your lips and you begin licking it with your tongue, Blitz gives out such a lewd moan that you become very self-conscious of your situation. You were becoming a total slut for this Pokemon, but what choice did you have. Any one of the three could overpower you. Your only hope of escape would be Sparky, but they had made sure to neutralize that threat. You were going to have to play the sex slave as long as they wanted if you wanted to survive. The faster you went along with it, the faster they might release you, you decide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Blitz shakes you from your thoughts. \"I don't want to cum yet.\" He pulls out of your mouth, panting in ecstasy. \"I just needed you to lube me up, and you did a damn good job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe directs you to sit up against the wall, Sparky sitting in your lap with your cock balls deep in his hole. He is panting as well, moaning softly with every movement. You are trying to keep him as still as possible so you don't blow your load inside of him. It doesn't really matter now, but it makes you feel like you are at least somewhat resisting. This doesn't last long, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, Sparky,\" Blitz cooed. \"How're you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls the Pikachu up by the armpits until he is almost off of you, then slams him back down on your pole. Sparky cries out in a mixture of pain and pleasure as pre dribbles furiously from his cock, running down from his member to coat your own cock in his juices. Blitz and his partners laugh at the electric mouse as the Buizel rubs his cock on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that, huh? He is pretty big; I'm surprised you could take him so easily. Looks like somebody practices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up, B-blitz,\" he pleads softly, only eliciting more laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. That's enough talk; actions speak louder than words, anyway. I want to see how much you can take, rat. I think it's time the Human shares his prize.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You place buizel on the stretcher and she is wheeled away quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir could you tell me what happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh \"We got into a battle and she just stated at me the whole time, didn't move an inch.

You smile and sit next to her on the bed. She wraps her short arms around your stomach and nuzzles you affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir\" nurse joy whispered worriedly in your ear. \"I believe she may attempt to mate with you if you continue to show her this sort of attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've known her for a long time and she has never tried that before.

Relenting you pick her up and tickle the edge of her floatation sack. She giggled, madly squirming to escape your reach. You persisted tickling her until she was red in the face. Once she regained her breath you realized that the redness hadn't gone away, in fact it had darkened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buizel are you okay? You're awfully red.\" you place a hand on her forehead to feel her temperature. However she grabs your arm and pulls you on top of her onto the bed. Now laying on the bed your face extremely close to hers you could hear her heated breathing, and feel it on your cheeks. You try to get up but buizel has her arms wrapped around your neck preventing escape. She pulls you closer until your noses touch, and she still brings you closer until your lips touch hers and you realize where this is all leading.

You heave a couple more times, removing the remaining water from your body. \"feeling better?\" a light and female voice speaks softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, you seem to be in some sort of cave, and alone. \"Hello?\" You call \"Hello human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"h-human? You say it like you aren't one.\" You respond as you stand up. The cave has a spacious ceiling adorned with stalactites(trust me those are the ones that point down). The slightly uneven ground kept several puddles of water trapped and there was a small hole in the ceiling allowing light in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not\" \"you're not a human?\" You say incredulously as you turn around, still looking for the source of the voice. \"No, I'm a Pok\u00e9mon\" \"that's not possible, Pokemon don't speak English\" \"I do\" you grunt and rub your head. \"Alright show me you're a Pok\u00e9mon, where are you?\" The voice was silent for a moment. \"Hmm alright I guess I can show you\" you were about to question her when a slight shimmer in the air moved past your face. The shimmer suddenly changed into a small pale grey and blue creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly fall backwards as the small being appears in front of you. It giggles and spins I the air. \"I am Azelf, Arceus created me to be the embodiment of willpower\" You take a closer look at Azelf as she floats in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was almost triangular in shape with a crest extending a short ways downward on each side. The top half of her head was blue while the rest of her body was a uniform grey. She had a small red gem on her forehead, with matching gems placed in the ends of her two tails that curved up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your will awoke me from my slumber\" \"My will?\" Azelf nods happily \"Yes, your will to survive. When you were in the water. I awoke and helped you fight off the Golduck, then when you passed out I brought you to my cave. I was only supposed to wake up if some one with enough willpower arrived\" her smile widened \"and you finally have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down, taking in all the information. \"So I'm like some sort of chosen one?\" \"No you were not chosen, you just fit the requirements\" \"okay so what now?\" </span></div></div>",

Which doesn't take long to come.<br>\r\n\"I think we should talk to Arceus.\" she finally says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back. Arceus? The pokemon who created the world? The literal god... or goddess of all pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Azelf about it. She nods her head, before hovering closer, extending her tiny paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you close it in your bigger hand.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Azelf warns. Then, in a flash of light, the cavern disappears from your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, you materialize and fall flat on the ground. Shortly after, you feel something pulling your shirt. You figure that it must be Azelf, trying to help you up. With little success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you get back on your feet.<br>\r\n\"Eh, sorry.\" Azelf apologizes. You shake your head.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" you dizzily reply as you take your first look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you're standing on a plain, white surface. And, in front of you, an immense, white ladder of marble that leads upwards, to an unknown destination.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" you hear Azelf from beside you. She grabs your hand with both her paws and floats in front of you, encouraging you to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you start climbing up the ladder. You are somewhat afraid of what - or who - you'll find once you got to wherever Azelf is leading you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes an incalculable amount of time to get past this ladder. But, finally, you take your first step on a white, plain surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your eyes shut open as you notice a tall, equine figure. It has pure, white fur, golden hooves, and a weird, golden wheel around its waist. It also has green and red eyes, which are currently staring both at you and your small companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god of all pokemon itself is literally standing there before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring you for a moment, it turns its attention on Azelf first.<br>\r\n\"Azelf,\" its voice sounds deep. Powerful. Divine.<br>\r\n\"Weren't you supposed to be asleep at the bottom of Lake Valor?\" it asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf bows respectfully.<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" she starts, confirming you that Arceus is actually a male.<br>\r\n\"I was asleep. But this human I brought here with me - he had it. The willpower necessary to wake me from my slumber.\" she explains, answering to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Arceus gazes at you.<br>\r\n\"And that's, I believe, the reason of your being here?\" he asks. Thinking that he's talking to you, you bow as well.<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, my lord.\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus seems to stare at you more intently as those words escape your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot you, Azelf or Arceus himself break the silence for a while. You occasionally glance at the blue pokemon beside you, who looks back at you with indecipherable looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, finally, Arceus speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Azelf,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I'd recommend that you stick with this human.\" Azelf rises her head.<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks, seemingly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus nods his head.<br>\r\n\"If this human had proved himself equipped with enough willpower to wake you up, you should stick with him. I feel no negative intentions in him - and I trust that he hasn't any,\" at this point, he looks at you somewhat sternly.<br>\r\n\"N-No, sir.\" you quickly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white pokemon gives a slight nod, before turning to Azelf again.<br>\r\n\"Of course, the choice is up to you, Azelf,\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small, blue pokemon looks at Arceus. Then, her golden eyes move on you. She gives a big smile.<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd like to. If the human is fine with it...\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no problem... I guess,\" you reply, showing a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf giggles, and floats in circle around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she abruptly stops as Arceus talks again.<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" he speaks.<br>\r\n\"Azelf will be staying with you, human. But - of course - there will be no hurting her in any possible way...\" you sweat drop.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't even dream about it, my lord,\" you say, earning another nod.<br>\r\n\"I'll believe that. Now, you both can go,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently look at Azelf, who grabs your hand in response.<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thanks, Arceus,\" Azelf says, bowing again. You imitate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you brace yourself as you once again experience teleporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you manage to stand tall as Lake Valor appears around you and Azelf. You notice that you're not in her cave, you're actually on the same cliff you fell from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ehm... guess we're staying together now?\" Azelf asks you.<br>\r\n\"Uh... I guess...\" you reply. The small pokemon smiles, and floats over your shoulder, lazily sitting down on it, tails resting on your other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even know it, she had wrapped her tiny arms around your neck. You blush a bit.<br>\r\n\"Er... now what?\" you awkwardly ask.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" is Azelf's simple reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm, you know, I was actually camping with a... friend,\" you suddenly remember how you met Azelf earlier.<br>\r\n\"... Maybe we should go back to the campsite,\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf's golden eyes open up as an idea springs up in her mind.<br>\r\n\"Or, maybe, we can stay around my Lake. I could show you around a bit as we... you know, we get to know each other better...\" she suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... sounds good?\" you say, uncertain. Azelf gives a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a sigh as you decide what to do next...</span></div></div>",

You grin sinisterly.<br>\r\n\"I have some unfinished business.\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small pokemon sitting on your shoulder nods her head.<br>\r\n\"Alright. As you wish.\" she simply replies, unaware of your intentions of imminent payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you turn your back to Lake Valor and start walking away, soon disappearing into the thick vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop behind some bushes and peek through the leaves. As expected, you finally reached the campsite. And, standing there, Derrick. With a worried expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou distinctly hear him talk.<br>\r\n\"It's been awhile now. He should have been here by now,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're worried about what you did, aren't you?\" you rhetorically ask, thinking about all the nice ways to pay him back for his prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf seems to notice your sudden change of mood.<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright...?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch, having totally forgotten about her presence.<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"But that guy over there - I fell into the lake because of him. I almost drowned, and it was his fault. If it wasn't for you...\" you mutter gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf smiles.<br>\r\n\"I think I get it. You want to payback him, am I right?\" she asks. You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile shifts into a smirk.<br>\r\n\"Then, let me help you. I do know a few tricks.\" she states. <br>\r\n\"Like?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Azelf closes her eyes. Slowly, a translucent figure very similar to her floats out of her body and hovers in front of you. You place your hands over your mouth to keep yourself from screaming.<br>\r\n\"Like this.\" you hear your new companion's voice coming from the shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Azelf?\" you whisper.<br>\r\n\"Precisely. My spirit can leave my body. I think this will be useful for our purpose,\" she says. You quickly remember the reason of this.<br>\r\n\"I have an idea...\" you say, delicately grabbing her unmoving body and placing it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek out of the bush again. Derrick is now walking around the clearing where you both set up camp. <br>\r\n\"Now.\" you whisper to Azelf... Azelf's spirit, who, obeying to your command, floats out of the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of Derrick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your friend leaping back, startled.<br>\r\n\"What the-\" he doesn't even finish his phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking back a laugh, you start talking with a deep voice, following your plan.<br>\r\n\"Derrick,\" you speak so that your voice can be heard from him.<br>\r\n\"I am the soul of your friend. The same friend you left into the lake. The same friend that got attacked by a Golduck. And the same friend that drowned in the waters of Lake Valor because of your actions!\" you say, noticing him starting to tremble as he takes a few steps back. However, Azelf just hovers closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he stumbles and falls on his butt. You stifle a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-You... Y-You're...\" he tries to say, but no other sound comes out of his mouth.<br>\r\n\"I am here... to punish you...!\" you shout, again emulating a deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Azelf rises her paws. Derrick starts to float off the ground as well, lifted by what could be mistaken for ghostly activity, but is in reality a simple psychic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend starts to scream at top of his lungs... and he falls straight back to the ground, hitting it with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, your laughter fills the whole clearing. You notice Azelf's spirit floating back in her body, and she soon starts laughing as well.<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" you say, shedding a tear and picking her up, grabbing her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the clearing, where your still startled friend is.<br>\r\n\"Hey Derrick.\" you call with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to face you.<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-You...!\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n\"Yup. Me.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And meet my friend, Azelf,\" the legendary in your arms waves her paws.<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" she chimes playfully, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you explained everything to Derrick, and once he made you swear you wouldn't repeat this kind of jokes (you and Azelf exchanged eloquent looks in that particular point) he finally calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he says.<br>\r\n\"This pokemon-\" <br>\r\n\"Azelf.\" you correct.<br>\r\n\"... Azelf... she's going to stay with us... with you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" the blue legendary, who is currently sitting on your lap, chimes happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend nods, before casually looking at the sky.<br>\r\n\"Hey, will you look at that? Sun is setting already,\" he notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's right, you notice. It was around 4 PM when you met Azelf; now, the sun is disappearing over the horizon.<br>\r\n\"We need to start a fire,\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner said than done, and with Azelf's psychic help, you gather a decent amount of wood and start a fire. The sun completely sets in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bowl of soup is the dinner for both you and Derrick; Azelf hovers upwards, soon returning, holding a berry. She sits down on a stump next to you. Before she can grab the first bite, though, you stop her.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try some of this?\" you say, pointing to the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon looks at it, then at you, looking unsure. Then, she reluctantly lowers her head into the bowl, taking a sip. Immediately, she springs back up, her cheeks red and her eyes sparkling.<br>\r\n\"Tasty!\" she cries, starting to flutter around you gleefully. You laugh. You guess pokemon don't often eat something different from berries. That would explain Azelf's excited behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Derrick, who is sitting in front of you, with a hand over his mouth, trying to keep himself from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner settled, you and Derrick walk to the tent, you carrying Azelf along.<br>\r\n\"That is where we'll sleep,\" you explain her. She nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl inside your sleeping bag with a satisfied smile.<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning Derrick. And no more water-related pranks.\" you warn. He laughs from his own sleeping bag beside you.<br>\r\n\"See you in the morning.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Azelf hovering over your sleeping bag.<br>\r\n\"Well... goodnight, Azelf. Uh, sleep tight...\" you awkwardly say as she descends near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then close your eyes. This day was full of surprises, you think. What was meant to be a simple camping trip turned into something more... special. Meeting Azelf and Arceus... that was something you'd never see coming. And you already bonded with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as you feel something crawling in your sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut your eyes open and notice the small blue pokemon crawling her way beside you.<br>\r\n\"Azelf?\" you whisper upon noticing Derrick snoring, suggesting he's asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue pokemon stops once she's fully inside your bag.<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Er... what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes a bit, though you can't see it.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I thought... I could... is it a problem?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Uh... n-no, if you want, you can sleep with me... you just surprised me.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe willpower pokemon smiles, and wraps her arms around your chest.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight then...\" she says closing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Sleep tight.\" you reply, closing yours as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually find that it is pretty comfortable to have the pokemon sleeping beside you. Her body carries a comforting warmth. Plus, she looks adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a last, tired smile, you relax, and your mind slowly drifts off, tugged to dreamland.</span></div></div>",

In fact I was saving you a special Pokemon. I had her with me at home so she didn't get stolen.\" reaching into his pocket, this time he pulled out a small red and white capsule. \"Come out Abra!\" he shouted as he tossed the ball into the air. At the peak of its arc the ball exploded open in a flash of light revealing a small yellow and brown figure. \"Hi Abra, I'm (_____). You reached your hand out to pet her.

The pokemon had a cream colored body with a blue tail and red streamers coming from its head. Moving at a tremendous speed it swims toward the shore. You fall backwards as the Pokemon rushes towards you skimming through the water like a torpedo. You stagger backwards and grab your bag as you try to escape. Sprinting towards the road you hear an loud cry. \"Milotic!\" soon after a large jet of water tears through the ground next to you. The shot had a great amount of force behind it, enough to knock you off you feet even though it missed you. As you hit the ground you landed uncomfortably on your pokeball belt.

You realized that the pain had faded from a sharp ache to a slight twinge. \"You want sleep in the bed? Okay sure, you've earned it. I'll take the couch.\" you pull the couch out into its bed form.

I don't think she'll leave it as it stands.\" \"Master...don't...worry...I protect\" she said. \"Thanks but it's not quite that simple\" you lay your head on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, may I take your order?\" you look up to see a waitress looking down at you. \"um yeah just a second, Nysa, come out please\" you grab her pokeball off your belt and open it wearily. \"Milooo!\" Sylvia immediately began to translate \"Maassteerrr\" Nysa curled herself around you in the booth. \"Not here Nysa we'll discuss this later, but for now would you like some food?\"  Nysa nods her head without looking away from your eyes. \"Okay we'll have your best pokefood and a double cheese burger.\" \"Alright your food will be with you shortly\" you thank her as she walks away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nysa could you stop squeezing me?\" you ask somewhat strained. Reluctantly she uncoils herself from you, making sure to rub your crotch with her tail. Gritting your teeth you ignore it and contemplate the two thieveries that you know of. \"Hmm starters and a rejuvenator, what the hell are they up to? Well I'm clueless how about you two?\" you look first at Sylvia who shrugs, then at Nysa who is staring at you wantingly. \"Uhhh\" it continued like this until the food came, providing you with a temporary respite from Nysas' gaze. You all finished your food and exited the diner, after paying of course. Outside you recalled Nysa to her ball and placed Sylvia on your shoulders. During the walk back to the Pokemon center it began to rain. \"Dammit you begin to run until you notice that none of the drops are hitting you. \"What the?\" you reach out and see the drops just curve around your arm and continue down. \"Sylvia? Are you doing this?\" \"Yes master\" you pulled her off your shoulders and gave her a hug. \"Thanks\" she returned the hug, smiling contentedly. You carried her In your arms the rest of the way there. You pass through the door to see joy still working with the rejuvenator. You sigh and walk upstairs to your room, still carrying your Pokemon. Once inside, you place Sylvia on the bed and release Nysa from her ball. \"Okay let's get this over with\"</span></div></div>",

Seriously you have heard of trainers and pokemon...sharing intimate moment, or just fucking silly but, you have always thought that those pokemon where simply following orders, after all a trainer can be easily seen as the ^alpha of the pack^, and for them, there is nothing strange for a sentient in such position to demand sexual satisfaction from his subordinate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now...now you know that sometimes happen the opposite, that a pokemon can be Very clear in expressing it's own emotion and desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your left hand to your hairs, caressing them lightly, trying to understand why Nysa has suddenly become so direct towards you, to the point of blatantly offer herself; maybe the commanding voice, the dominating position that you exerted on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a mess, not even a week as a trainer and the new captured member of my team want to bed me already, splendid, it show how much control i have over this whole situation\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the peaceful sleeping Sylvia, and hope with all vehemence i can master, that she will evolve in Kadabra soon, i can't have a partner that systematically sleep away most of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing my thoughts aside, i grip the ball containing the reason of this very introspection, and steeling myself i throw the ball in the air: \"Come out Nysa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA withe flash is released as soon as the container open and not a moment after, the shape of a resting Milotec appear before you. As soon as Nysa materialize fully, she look around and noticing the absence of any other being beside Abra, she slither towards you, and before you can even breathe a word, she coil herself around you, keeping her head towards you the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now you notice how...short Nysa is, while a normal Milotic should be easily more than 6 meters long, you estimate that she barely reach 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweet voice, remind you of your not exactly comfortable position, and decide to clarify the misunderstanding, you start to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nysa we must talk about..mhmhmhm!\" Your mouth is suddenly invaded by a tongue far bugger than yours. Desperately trying to regaining control of the situation, you feel Nysa lower coil moving up and down, pushing against your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization come like a lighting on a clear day, she is trying to remove them! Damn to hell her past trainer, he must have taught her this...trick, sick bastard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push your hands on the muzzle of the far too amorous Milotic, and finally succeeding in detangle your tongue from hers, you nearly scream: \"Stop Nysa! What in Darkrai abyss are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at you with a confused expression, then smile and continue in her endeavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue: \"Stop dammit, i swear that.ah! What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and sure enough she has succeeded in breaking the waistband, belt and all, leaving you only with a soft tissue protecting your organ from her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a decisive tone \"Miloti<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">iiiic</font>\" Not even the time to finish the word, that she start to lick away with her strong flexible tongue, what remain of your resistance.<br>\r\nThe heat and wetness on your cock, provoke the obvious reaction that she is hoping for, and as soon as the tent in your underwear bend the material sufficiently, she delicately grip the crinkle with her lips and pull, painfully breaking the tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to protest but your tongue freeze in your mouth when she envelop you cock in her muzzle and start sucking in strong, slow gulps <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth is incredible, tight soft, hot you can't describe the pleasure it bring you, the sensation is so strong that your lungs can barely keep up with the now increased request of air that your body is desperately begging for<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the feeling stop, and barely fully conscious, you notice how Nysa deliberately place her more than ready slit under the tip of your erect spire, her opening kissing the tip<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force your exalted but physically drained body, to look up at the genuine smile on her muzzle, waiting for your approval<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to say no, to tell her to stop this...this nonsense but your dry lips don't respond to the command given them, and Nysa unwilling to wait, place her opening vertically over the tip of your cock and slowly start to push down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as the head of your cock spread open her dripping lips, and as soon as the tip start his to slide in, a powerful blast forcefully remove you cock from his rightful place, lifting you up and slamming Nysa on the room side wall; luck seems to favor you, as the your water type firm scales cushion your body, harmlessly absorbing the kinetic energy applied to your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later the not so light unconscious head of your Milotic fall on your shoulder, pushing you down; After a few more seconds, a delicate nearly reverent force, lift the sea serpent head from you and slowly levitate and later lay you down towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your barely opened eyelids you can see the blurred shape of a very worried Sylvia coming towards your immobile body, then an unintelligible tiredness wash over your overstimulated nervous system, causing your conscience to temporarily leave the waking world.</span></div></div>",

Why did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought, really i have...always believed that only perverted trainer and occasionally a few breeders participated in this..thing, and now reality slap me in the face i...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both stay here, i need..\" I run out the room, slamming the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know what i am doing, beside running away from a place...a situation i don't...i can't face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found myself at the pokecenter cafeteria, now empty with barely enough light on to see where you are going. Myself seated at a small rounded table with my emotionally confused head on my hands, elbows pressing down with a weight i can't recognize if real or not. Then a noise bring me back to the present, a voice, a male not much older then me i think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift my head, looking to a boy that seems to be around twenty years old or something, kicking an automatic snack vendor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoice: \"Oh come on you stupid piece of shit! Gimme my blasted snacks you useless piece of..\" I interrupt him by laughing, i try to contain myself but i can't, it's too hilarious seeing him so pissed at the stubborn machine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy: \"What? Who's there?\" He turn and notice me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy: \"Huh?\" His face transpire surprise, then acceptance: \"Hello there, sorry for the show, it's just that this useless piece of, never mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pause for a moment, then switch to a friendly tone: \"So what are you doing here all alone, your girlfriend dumped you?\" I can clearly recognize the playfulness in his voice, too bad i am not in the mood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i mean i don''t think..so, i may have..i don't know anymore\" I return sulking in my previous position<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear he coming closer, with a concerned tone he ask: \"Hey kid, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer: \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't see him, but i bet that he rolled his eyes: \"You don't say.\" I can easily perceive his movement as he take out a chair and seat in front of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone return serious: \"So what bother you kid?\" Should i tell him? Why i should anyway?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply harshly keeping my position: \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear him snorting: \"Listen kid, you look more troubled than anyone at your age should be\" His tone become playful: \"So as an elder i command you to respect my volition and tell me what the hell is wrong with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh at his silliness, but he succeed in drawing me out of depression, looking at him i hesitantly reply: \"It's...my pokemon they...they..\" I move my hands in a circular motion, not even knowing what i want to tell him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckle: \"They wanted to have sex with you, am i right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI choke on my saliva, and look at him like he was a ghost, he continue: \"Don't worry kid, happen all the time. I still remember when Sena, my Raichu, entered the bathroom and nonchalantly started to give me a blowjob while i was showering\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue to smile: \"I tried to make her stop, only to find myself seated, stunned by a light discharge, and a few second later in bliss as my cock penetrated her tight snatch. I stayed still, shocked and unbelieving as she ridden me until i repainted her womb withe, not even the time to recover that she presented her leaking twat and asked for a second. Hahahahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him, bewildered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued: \"She is my partner btw, the first pokemon i ever had, also the most loyal. We had, and we still have, a very close relationship she and i, ending with me inside her at least 2-3 times a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face is still frozen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue again: \"She was my first, but definitely not last pokemon i had sex with. As i have said before, it's pretty common, not excessively so but...i think that at least 5-6 trainer out of 10, had regular sexual intercourse with at least one of his poke\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unfroze, and unbelieving ask: \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckle again: \"You wouldn't believe with what other member of my team i had sex with, wanna guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stagger: \"Well, ha..i mean..ehm\" i feel ashamed for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe playfully: \"Tell me yours, i tell you mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't want to believe him, but what i saw....what Nysa nearly done, Sylvia kiss....she...she<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue: \"So? What poke scared you so kid? You will never guess mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle as well, maybe he is right, i am too hard with myself: \"Milotic, she...kinda blowed me and..we nearly..eh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod: \"Milotic? Wow kid, they are quite big i give that to you, catching the attention of one, my, extremely difficult. I heard of only another trainer that manged it, and he is a Gym Leader so...why nearly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply, more emotionally stable now: \"Well, my partner is an Abra and she didn't like to be the second i guess, so she..ehm, kinetically bashed her to the wall, one hit ko\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face astonished: \"An Abra, 1 hit ko on a Milotic? Ho ho, kid, you hit the jackpot!\" He pause for a few seconds, pensive: \"I have a friend, his partner, an Espeon. Man she Never leave him alone, literally stalking him Everywhere, and i mean Everywhere, bathroom too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile slowly vanish, replaced by a serious expression: \"Kid, psychyc type are Very, Very, and i Do Mean Very, loyal. But also Very,Very, annoying. Once you are their mate don't even try to leave them at the center or in storage because they will come after you, find you, fuck you silly as a reminder, and then.....ha, forget it, it's nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer: \"What? What happen then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignore my question: \"Best lay? Fire type, i mean not really the best but they are quite..free in their affection. Seriously, you can have a Ninetails, fuck her day and night for weeks and then leave her in storage for a month, as soon as you get her back, she lick your face and then present. Give a damn. Well unless she start to have feeling for you, because if she does....let's just say that fire type can be as bad as psychic in that regard, ask my Monferno about it; playful pokemon, sure, between Sena and her i can barely get a day without getting off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay silent for a while, i am still not sure about having sex with my pokemon but. I will consider it, in the future. Now if only i could understand why i snapped at Nysa yesterday...: \"So what pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe perplexed: \"Hmm? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue: \"What pokemon did you have sex with? It's big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remain confused for a moment, then: \"Ha, of course! Yes i have said that haven't i? Well, don't laugh ok?\" I nod, he continue: \"Good, a Rhydon, i am serious. She was only a Rhyhorn when i ehm, wanted to know how would have been doing it with a Ground type sooooo, i have innocently masturbated her while i was washing her, and when ready, i fucked her silly, hahaha. As soon as we had done she remained still for at least 10 minutes if not more, immobile with her twat leaking my seed. Then i discovered that, That was her first time, she didn't even know what mating was, i was soooooo embarrassed; i wanted to apologize but by morning not only she recovered fully, she asked for sex every day since then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, then: \"Now she is even bigger than me, and she still refuse to get a mate of her own, asking for my ^attention^ more often then not. It was awkward after her evolution at start, but we managed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe get up: \"Sorry kid, i must go. Remember that not all pokemon are slutty as my Raichu, or Monferno, or Rhydon. or your Milotic, or..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, i got it. Just most of them...shit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed young one, but only with their trainer, and not always. Build a serious relationship with your pokemon kid, respect them, love them and they will do the same. And maybe, if all goes right you'll get a romp from time to time, ahahahah. Bye kid, and good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye..hey! What's your name?! Shit! He left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rethink to what happened just a few minutes ago, and i still can't believe that...no, his tone was sincere. It's all true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up and walk towards the stairs, i must confront both Sylvia and Nysa. I will not accept to have sex with them, not yet at least, i must still sort a few things out before, yeah that. Also Nysa must understand that this kind of thing will not be tolerated in the future, also i must speak with Sylvia about our...relationship. I think that she has started to have strong feeling in my regards, i can only hope that everything will sort out as it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso i must prepare a list for my future team member, and tomorrow i want to start the hunt against the rejuvenator thief as well, so is better if i catch some shut eye.</span></div></div>",

Usually if a pokemon feel abused tend to leash out, so she was unconscious or restrained somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod: \"It's possible that he was telling the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recover her serious expression: \"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her, a single-mindedness that leave no margin of doubts: \"While it's true that sometimes a wild pokemon take advantage of certain situations, and that i have treated a few rape attempt, both from male and female, they are not this sadistic. Reached satisfaction the offender leave the victim mostly intact and certainly won't leave such crude sign of ownership on it. It's just not their way.

Well i can still stalk him anyway. With luck on my side, i find a bench not far from the grocery store, now i just have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how much times has passed, 3-5 hours? Nothing, my prey haven't come out the store since this early afternoon, it's evening now and..wait what's that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small group of 4 people, walk with a quick pace towards the grocery store, they seems to be in the middle of an animated discussion, and while i can't heard what they are discussing about, i can definitely hear one of them nearly screaming<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy: \"What do you mean broken?! How can you break a brand new reju..\"<br>\r\nBoy2: \"Shhh! The hell are you screaming about!

But what they are doing there, or more importantly, how many and what are their combat abilities....mmmh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must gather more information before deciding to do anything, also if i have discovered this connection so easily while the police still fumble in the dark, can only mean 2 things:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) They are complete Moron, likely. Their superior officer is a complete idiot, most likely. After ll promotion given on favors and not talent or skill can only give such result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) They are corrupted, paid to feign ignorance, combined with the highly likely theory of the superior officer, everything make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't trust the authority, it's seems that i must go in alone, but first i should return to the center and try to pry more information from that crazy nurse, hopefully she will be more collaborative when i present her some decent theory, along with the phrase i just overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile i get up and begin my walk towards the center, Sylvia uncharacteristic silence finally break<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>Jaden...we...ambush?</i>\" Ambush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean ambush them when..where?

And assuming that they get up early we must go tonight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be dangers, especially at night but it could give us an edge, and we may need every advantage we could get.

In the forest there was a road that appeared to be in relatively good condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a few Pokemon in the forest but nothing really spectacular. \"I thought there would be more Pokemon here.\" \"Jaden...there...something...powerfull...deeper...in...forest.\" \"Powerfull? What do you mean?\" \"Angry...strong...scary\" you realize it must be really powerfull if it was scaring Sylvia. \"Don't worry I won't let you get hurt.\" you hug her close for a moment and she returns the gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked on through the forest following Sylvia's directions towards the powerful presence. Once you began to get really close you saw some people unconscious on the ground and even one in a tree. A quick examination revealed them all to have the good pim identifying them all as Team Shadow. After you identify the people Sylvia points you towards the powerful entity. A large bolt of lightning sprung up from the ground where Sylvia pinpointed the powerful presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint to the site of the lightning in time to see a team shadow member slammed into the ground by a huge black Pokemon. The Pokemon was pitch black, it had two wings, a large conical generator on its tail. The crest jutting from its head glowed blue at the tip. It's red eyes stared maliciously at the terrified grunt on the ground. Moments later it released the man and kicked him, sending him into the tree line with a yelp. The huge Pokemon turned towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice echoes in your head, not unlike when Sylvia speaks to you. \"you are not a member of their team. What are you doing here?\" the voice was serene, feminine, and seemed sad. \"Umm I was trying to find an item they stole.\" the Pokemon tilts to the side. \"I am Zekrom, maybe we can be of use to each other.\" \"I'm Jaden, what did you have in mind\" smiling Zekrom said \"You have already helped me Jaden. Now I will help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait how did I?\" you weren't allowed to finish as Zekrom lunged forward and grabbed the both of you before launching into the sky. \"Holy shit!\" you scream as you fly to the grocery store that you found earlier. \"Wha? But how did?\" \" I took the information from your mind.\" you shivered slightly not liking the thought of her searching your mind. \"Now I want you to go inside and try to find a way for me to get in.\" \"alright but how will I let you know when I find one?\" \"Telepathic link, and if you don't find one I'll just blast my way in!\"</span></div></div>",

We have to get inside this building.\" she slowly uncoiled herself rubbing her tail across your crotch. \"Don't do that! I need your help, will you listen and follow my orders while we are in there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and agrees quickly, but with a twinkle in her eye that suggested mischief.

Not seeing anyone you drop your legs into the building and hang for a moment before falling to the floor. \"Nysa c'mon\" you whisper crouching low to the ground. Nysa drops to the ground without a sound coiling around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of her coils and look out into the hallway. Here you spot one guard and couple cameras. \"Alright Nysa use mist to create a smokescreen.\" with a soft \"Milooo\" she opened her mouth emitting a white fog that spread through the area quickly, obscuring vision and distorting sound. You grab a wooden chair found in the room and sprint towards where the guard was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide out of the fog and smash the chair into his head. The chair shatters and the grunt falls to the ground knocked out. You smile hoping that the rest of the security was that lax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProceeding down the hallway you look into each and every door avoiding the grunts when you could and taking out the rest. You look in a doorway and immediately pull your head back, the room had several grunts in it. Focusing you manage to hear some of thee conversation \"Man I'm beat\" \"Yeah me too, Bernie is running us ragged to find rare pokemon\" that must be where all the grunts are. And Bernie must be their leader or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue searching for any sign of Reshiram and Kyurem. Zekrom's relatives as she put it.

Unfortunately there were two guards standing next to the door. \"this ones gonna be tougher than the others.\"  you think for a moment leaning against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nysa can you take them both out with a Hydro pump?\" she nodded sliding up close to you. \"alright then on my signal we both charge and you blast them.\" she nodded again and licked your cheek. \"R-ready set now!\" you both turn the corner Nysa slightly in the lead already firing a powerfull blast of water from her maw. The attack took the guards completely by surprise, before they could even reach for their pokeballs they were nicked into the wall and knocked cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Nysa\" she cooed happily and curled around you wrapping you in a serpentine hug. \"Not now\" you pry her off \"Let's see what's in this room.\" you cautiously open the door and look inside. You are greeted by the sight of a small red dragon restrained in a cage. The dragon was red with white highlights on its neck and stomach. It had no back legs but instead it had a wingspan equal to its body length. Thee was a red triangle on its head and a blue one on its chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck is wrong with these people?\" you seethe quietly. Sneaking forward, you get about halfway to the cage before the ground in front of you explodes. The blast sends you sliding across the slick linoleum floors. \"What the? You're just ssome punk ass kid! How did you get in here? Who are you? Nevermind it doesn't matter. I am Bernie and you won't be leaving here alive.\" a voice yells at you for the ceiling. Looking upwards you notice a balcony you hadn't seen earlier. On the balcony stood a man. The man had red hair with eyes to match, right now they burned with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You aren't even worth the trouble of battling, I'll just let my Pokemon take care of you.\" he grabbed a ball and hurled it into the air. It split open revealing a black and red dog like Pokemon with two large horns protruding from its head. \"Houndoom kill them\" the dog opens its mouth wide and wastes no time in blasting a large flamethrower. You cover your face and expect the worst, but Nysa intervenes. Blasting a hydro cannon she extinguishes the flames and blasts the dog in one fell swoop. \"Damn\" you whisper as the Houndoom attempts to get up and fails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time Bernie decides to become scarce. \"Oh no you don't! Nysa blast him!\"  \"Milotic!\" she quickly launches a burst of water that knocks Bernie off the balcony and onto the floor. You walk over and grab the front of his shirt. \"Who is that Pokemon in the cage and where is the rejuvenator?\" he coughed \"As if I'd tell you\" a punch to the face makes him infinitely more cooperative. \"The rejuvenator is in a room down the hall, that Pokemon is Latias, she's amazingly rare.\" releasing him you walk over tithe cage and have Nysa bust the locks. After all the locks are undone you gently wake the unconcious poke. You glare at Bernie \"this had better not be permanent damage\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latia?\" a soft voice reached your ears and you crouched in front of the red Pokemon. \"Are you alright?\" Latias stares at you for a moment before leaping onto you and clutching you to her tightly. \"~Thank you~\" a voice echoed through your head. \"Would you allow me to capture you for a little while? Just until we get you healed up?\" she nods softly. You grab a pokeball and tap her on the head with it pulling her inside. \"Let's go Nysa we still need to get the rejuvenator.\"</span></div></div>",

Also this remind you to check for her relatives as she as put it, Reshiram the seeker of truth, and this Kyurem you never heard about<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of running grunts can be felt above the siren alarm sound, positioning themselves just outside the lab door, the only exit. Then looking up the you notice that the balcony is not that hight, unfortunately Abra is out so no levitation, but....i know i will regret this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nysa, can you push me up to that balcony over there?\" I bet she is strong enough, but is not her physical prowess that worry me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with a glint that would have scared off a lesser person, and nearly make me change idea as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miloooo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grab you by the hip using her flexible tail, then with a smirk that promise woe and despair, to me at least, she delicately launch my body towards the balcony edge. As the air with the acre smell of chemicals hit my face and the feeling of emptiness reach my guts i think: this is how a doll must feel when discarded somewhere. Before i can rectify my erroneous statement about inanimate object feeling, the handrail come in my reach and grabbing it with all my strength, i am able to push myself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering from my quick free flying experience, a thing that if i have any say in it will probably Not repeat anytime soon, i grab Nysa ball and recall her in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Nysa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilotic nod as the red beam of light impact her body, enclosing her form in the safety of the ball, just as the grunt outside start to launch attack at random inside the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only look while these idiots careless attempt, destroy machinery and scatter unknown chemical everywhere, some even hitting the experimental tube contained within as box with an enormous sticky saying ^Instable reactant, frail^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is my cue to leave. I hear the grunt outside screaming obscenities at me while the container with the scary looking sticky start to melt from the side, releasing fumes that i have absolutely no intention to breathe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunt: \"Surrender and we will spare your meaningless life!\" Right, perhaps verifying your threat assessment would have been a wiser choice, especially because<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 The lab ventilation system is evidently down....<br>\r\n2 A crashing sound of epic proportion could be heard from behind the little group of grunt, followed by a terrifying roar coming from the same spot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom with a mocking/friendly tone: \"<i>Need some help?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to ^think^ back at her, should work but i am no psychic: \"<u>Can't hear you over the grunts screaming voices</u>\" the i try to think privately: \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><u>not that they didn't deserve this</u></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom now serious: \"<i>Indeed they do</i>\" More screams coming from the corridor, as i hear a grunt literally flying to the labs door, begging for his life until the impact knock him out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom thoughts become darker as her roar easily cover the alarm siren, i can feel it, but i don't know if she is ^talking^ with them as well: \"<i>No mercy you monsters</i>\"<br>\r\nThen i feel her thoughts clear a little, this time she is surely ^talking^ to me: \"<i>Have you found my relatives?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little sad i reply: \"<u>No, only a Latias experimented upon, don't know what or if they did anything to her</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reply is clear, and despite my negative answer quite happy: \"<i>Saved a Latias? They are quite rare you know. Treat her well and she will become one of the best in your team</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no intention to keep her....well i am tempted but i prose to release her..or not?: \"<u>I have not, bah, look i still need to search the rest of this base, just keep them occupied while i seek your relatives and the rejuvenator ok?</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, removing the light dizziness that talking to Zekrom left me, realizing my foolishness in remaining in this now useless lab, and leaving Bernie to his fate, i run towards the balcony back door and let myself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balcony door lead to an empty corridor well illuminated by battery powered lights, big enough for a well fit human, but definitely not for Milotic, so i keep her in ball while i search for my objectives possible location. Nearly at the end of this corridor i notice a door with a plate, on it ^Director^ is written in a clear elegant manner, under it a far less elegant ^piss off^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that probably various useful documents could be inside, i kick the probably locked door...well i try at least, damn TV series it look so easy there..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a light chuckle in my head, bet that Zekrom know, and pissed off at both the door and the mocking legendary i focus all my strength and anger on the poor door, that to my surprise give in hinges and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom chuckle vanish, but her tone is still mocking: \"<i>Such power young trainer, did the anger empower your kick?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply back, still a little angry: \"<u>No but the idea of what TS could do to innocent people and pokemon disgust me, and perhaps here i can find some answer at last</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom mockery vanish, replaced by what i can recognize as respect: \"<i>An idealistic then..interesting</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore her comment while i start to search for any valuable information they may have about other experiments or the rejuvenator exact location.

The first couple drawers only hold letters without a return address, containing instructions on the rejuvenator. In the final drawer however you found a single file. You examine the file, and finding nothing unusual you open it. To your surprise it's relatively straight forward. \"let's see. Oh shit, they're trying to control of Arceus!\" reading further into the file you find the outcome, and what you see enrages you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the paper you were looking at when Arceus had appeared it went ballistic, unleashing its power over the world in a berserk rage, reshaping the continents themselves. \"T-these bastards! They killed my Dad!\" you slump to your knees stunned this past year you had thought it was a natural disaster, everyone had but now you realize that it was these criminals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to think for a moment finnaly coming to the conclusion that they must be stopped. The police weren't gonna get it done and the government probably wouldn't believe you, that left you, a lone inexperienced trainer with two Pokemon and no clue how to proceed.\"~Whats going on did you find my family?~\" Zekrom's voice snaps you back to the present. \"Wha? No I didn't but I did find out that they caused the cataclysm a year ago and they might try it again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou charge out of the office and swing over the balcony railing. You manage to avoid injury by rolling as you hit the ground. \"I don't know about you but I'm gonna try to stop 'em!\" you dash through the lab now in flames and turn for the store room where the rejuvenator supposedly was. Surprisingly it actually was there, searching the machine you find a button labeled compress. Crossing your fingers you press the button hoping that it does what you think it will. Fortunately it does and the device shrinks to the size of a rubix cube. \"That was a lot easier than expected\" you say holding the now miniature healing machine. You turn to the exit only to see that it was blocked by debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" you run through the compound in search of a door or something to escape through. \"There's no way out!\" you cry out in frustration. \"~Hold on a moment~\" Zekrom thinks towards you. Shortly after the roof crumbles near you and Zekroms arm reaches in and grabs you. \"Shit!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are launched into the air for a third time that day. Zekrom clutching you in both hands as she sped through the sky to the forest where you had met. \"~goodbye Jaden perhaps next time we may get to know each other better.~\" her farewell sounded odd and it was a moment before you realized what she meant. Blushing furiously you stutter \"H-hey if you think I'm just gonna have sex with any pok\u00e9 that wants it your crazy!\" giggling madly she leapt into the sky and shot off like a bolt of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I've gotta walk back, great\" </span></div></div>",

When i started the trainer carrier i have always imagined of incredible adventures, challenging battles, the discharge of adrenaline that only being less than half meter from a creature who's power can easily level a mountain can give you, a creature that respond to your every order! Isn't every child dreams? Meeting such power of nature and unleash them on your foes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that's being a megalomaniac?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway syntax and adjective details aside, i think that my dream of becoming a trainer included all the above, and maybe some tiny little mention about fame and glory, don't differ much from others who has similar dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside the occasional perverts of course, i can't still remove from my head what Nysa ^told^ me when i asked if her past trainer asked her to..expose herself, and i bet that he will not be the last idiot with only a giant pussy fixed on his forehead. But finding myself with an overeager Milotic, who's thoughts revolve only in having my reproductive organ inside her genitals, well, that's wasn't in the list, nor meeting a playful-double meaning-frustrated? legendary. Her tone didn't seems entirely serious about our possible next meeting, but i still can't believe that she mean what she said. Right? Nah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts keep me company while i conclude this crazy trip by crossing the automatic doors of the pokecenter now deserted, and meet a disheveled Nurse Joy near the old rejuvenator wielding what i can only describe as a giant hammer, in the obvious intent of crushing the nonfunctional machine in it's compacted version, without using the appropriate function of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Joy half crazed, but strangely calm voice: \"And now you little piece of shit, your time hath finally came...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI call her name just before the consecrated hammer of vengeance start it's deadly march: \"Joy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe startled: \"Aaaahh!\" and turn towards me, dropping her hammer on the old rejuvenator, easily denting the plastic exterior<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Don't sneak up like that! I could have damaged something!\" Wasn't that the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI with an amused tone: \"And you usually stroll around the center with\" i point at the hammer: \"that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMockingly i add: \"Is that perchance the new shock therapy i sooo much heard about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy slightly angry: \"I don't know what are you talking about, sir\" Then mockingly add: \"Does your pokemon need Healing perhaps? I am sorry young trainer but a certain colleague of yours promised to recover..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI interrupt her, keeping a professional tone: \"And i always deliver, miss Joy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere i place the compacted brand new rejuvenator on the counter, and not even thanking me, squeal in happiness and grab the device running in the examination rooms behind the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the hero thanks, why always a pleasure Joy, really is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear her muffled voice beyond the door, probably still excited by my astounding success, maybe it's better if i don't mention Zekrom involvement in this, for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored i start to walk towards my room, i will ask about my reward tomorrow when Joy will be more calm, sane hopefully, but them i remember Latias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sight, it seems that i must wait regardless, i am not sure if the experiment she was forced to participate was completed or even started at all, but i will take no chance in her wellbeing, and of course i must what she want to do afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember Zekrom words about Latias, but i can't force her to stay, an unwilling pokemon is an useless pokemon after all. While the pokeball prevent all but the strongest or more willed pokemon to break free, it doesn't really force them to obey your orders, compel them yes, but it's possible to refuse the compulsion and disobey the trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory on how the gym medals are nothing more than pretty energy amplifier, bring a smile on my face. Some trainers still believe that a piece of pretty iron make them more worthy in the eyes of pokemons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha\" I laugh in the empty center at the absurdity of such concept. Why Pokemon should even remotely care about Human recognition, they mean nothing to them.<br>\r\nRespect is important, friendship is important, a bound that in rare cases can transcend logic, like what happen with some psychic or rarely between a legendary and it's trainer is important. A few other things too, but a common piece of metal easily duplicable everywhere? Definitely not. That's why the league don't persecute imitators, their products just won't work, if your team follow you with it it's only because they believe in you, and your confidence boost help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy dash out the back room door, and reaching the counter look at me happily: \"It work! I can finally resume my duties! Come i want to discuss about your reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcluded her brief speak she hastily return in the back room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow Joy, a little apprehensive about her mood swings, hopefully i am on her good side and will remain so from now on.</span></div></div>",

I didn't do anything last night, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Nysa\" I then stretch my arms and get up, trying to not trample over her coil, i don't think that it will harm her but still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa don't impede me but don't uncoil herself either, i admit that i feel quite refreshed, it's nearly an year since i slept this well, maybe i should propose a Milotic-like bed as a commercial idea..nope<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in my head that i recognize as Sylvia greet me: \"<i>Morning Jaden</i>\" a slightly bitter tone follow: \"<i>Slept..well?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy such question? Can't i even sleep with my Milotic that another member of my team become jealous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's come out wrong..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine Sylvia thank you, no need to be angry either, just slept, right Nysa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Milotic, she wear a naughty smile, and in a suggestive tone: \"Miloooooooooo\" Can Milotic have a sultry tone? Because i believe to have just heard one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI facepalm and looking at Sylvia: \"Ignore her, now i see that's our guest finally returned to the land of the living, how do you feel Latias?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is facing Quilava, and as soon as she hear me calling her, she turn towards me with an embarrassed expression and a shy smile on her muzzle, she try to avoid to look at me directly: \"<i>Mo..morning..ahhh, how..eh..how did you...slept well?</i>\" she now is looking at me, i could have swear that Latias head was white and red yesterday not just red?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the smirking Quilava, then at Latias.....i think that i now know what they was talking about, and if Quilava behavior of last night is of any indication....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply with a calm but resolute tone: \"Latias, ignore what Quilava may have told you, usually trainers don't..use their pokemon in That way, and she is the most recent addition by the by the way, got in just last night\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias nod, part of her muzzle return withe: \"<i>Yes she told me that she joined the team just yesterday, and....</i>\" she then ^speak^ so fast i can barely understand her  \"<i>whatshewasdoingwiththeothertrainer</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI confused: \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias: \"<i>Nothing...</i>\" an awkward smile on her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to watch her strange smile, deciding that i should definitely talk to Joy right Now, i walk towards the bathroom for dispatching my morning routine: \"I'll return shortly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Quilava: \"Behave and don't speak like all trainer are that way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qui?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore her answer and opening the door i go inside the bathroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seat on the toilet with my pants down, not because i need to evacuate, but because even if i have finished my business here i need some time to think, alone, and i am too lazy to bring my pants back up.<br>\r\nMy alone time is however interrupted by the door opening with Quilava on her ^toes^ releasing the handle, smart. Then she enter and close the door behind her<br>\r\nShe then walk towards me still surprised to see her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start to talk to her, but she ignore me and place her front paw on my uncovered cock and start stroking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately stop her: \"Quilava! What are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me perplexed, like this is normal routine for her, and remembering her past, probably it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look i am not your old trainer i don't..\" She remove her paw from my hand and put herself in a typical mating posture, presenting herself to me, i want to continue my lecture but a needy \"Quiiii\" stop me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pained expression on her feature, i think that she believe i am refusing her as a member of the team, that i am punishing her in some twisted and perverted way by not mating with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously i place my hand on her rump, caressing her hard fur, slowly descending. I recover my wits only when a soft moaning escape Quilava muzzle and i feel something hot and damp on my finger. I look down only to see my fingers stroking her now wet lips. I want to withdraw but Quilava push back and my fingers penetrate her sex. A strong moan escape her as the hot, damp insides clench rhythmically, trying to drove the welcomed intruders deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately remove my hand from her sex, a transparent strong scenting liquid on it: \"Quilava that's not...out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe confused: \"Qui?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a few deep breaths, calming myself down: \"Quilava it's not your fault, i need time to think, alone, out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile, probably thinking that i merely wish to postpone our intercourse, in truth i just don't want it at all, i think. She walk towards the exit, and like before open the door and let herself out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hand on my face, trying to understand what has happened to me since the beginning of this ^adventure^, then an arousing scent reach my nostrils and i realize that this is the same hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick cold shower, i recall Nysa and Quilava, that has accepted to be called Pyrie from now on, while Sylvia and Latias has asked to walk, or float, with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reach the mess hall only to find it empty, i release Nysa and Pyrie, then try to call for Joy: \"Nurse Joy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy enter from the corridor with her characteristic smile: \"Good morning, want breakfast?\" I nod and walk towards her while she prepare food for my team and me,<br>\r\ni then curiously ask: \"Joy why..\" indicating the empty hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Yesterday i had to turn down some healing due to the inoperative rejuvenator and the rumor has spread quickly, but i have placed a sign just outside, i expect new patient by this afternoon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point i need to ask: \"Joy can we talk for a moment?\" i indicate the door leading out, she nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reach the corridor and as soon as the door is closed i ask: \"Joy Quilava attempted to..mate with me, more than once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy assume a pensive expression: \"I expected such thing, but you refused right?\" I nod, she continue: \"As i have said before she has been abused, probably trained specifically to be a slut for her trainer and the rest of the team. As for a solution there are none, love her and treat her with the affection she has missed, a family. But if she persist it would be better to..accept her advance, not doing so may have serious repercussion on her psyche<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?!</span></div></div>",

Fuck it, i am not gonna be a freaking pokemon slut, i am a Trainer not a whore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up and with a pissed tone: \"I seriously start to have enough of you, all of you\" i point at them all generically \"When i wanted to be a trainer i have never imagined that it would have been so mentally taxing for my sanity, i can't even go to the bathroom without being molested for Arceus sake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look down, all but Pyrie who is just staring at me with an unnerving smile, i try to ignore her for my own sake, actively trying to forget the smell of her arousal on my hand, the needy whine she used, the clenching wall of..shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated by my own duality i bring my sight to the colorless ceiling and scream to the heavens \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to force my thoughts to refocus on something else, and i partially succeed, but i don't even have the time to gloat at my triumph over the deep abyss that can be desire, that a memory of my childhood forcefully reemerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne class packed to it's limit, a teacher wearing a yellow suit with the pokeball insignia on it's left chest pocket and a smile that is still haven't fully understood, the rest of his face blurred by the insignificance of such trait, just as his name. I can't remember it, nor i ever cared to, but his voice...his teachings, that i will never forget<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Man in yellow speak with a fatherly tone, i can clearly feel his happiness and proudness at being here: \"Good morning class, i thereby declare our session started\"<br>\r\nWith only a few seconds of pause he continue: \"The first and more important lesson that a Trainer should always be aware of, is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence, then Man in yellow: \"Well what is it? Come on it's easy, what a pokemon Need from it's trainer, what is that element, the one which permit champion to win against impossible odds, the very same that distinguish a real trainer from losers like Team Rocket, Plasma, Magma...and all the other idiotic insensate name they give themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the words that make me chose this career, the same that i missed since father death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Man in yellow said: \"Love, pure unadulterated love, with everything that such powerful emotion may bring...for you\" pointing to me, me! \"or anyone else\" showing his opened hands to the whole class<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory return in the depths of my subconscious, i realize that a tear is slowly descending my left cheek, father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the voice of a scared Joy as she enter the still messed up room. Joy: \"What's happened? Why did you scream?! Is Team Shadow here?..Oh my! I must save the center! Chansey! Battle formation now! We must be ready for Waaaar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and my team look at the preposterous image of a Chansey with a military helmet far too small for her, getting out from the examination room, saluting Joy in a typical military manner ad exclaiming with decisive short tone: \"Chansey chaaaaaaan!\"<br>\r\nThen she start to march towards the back rooms synchronizing her walk with a continuous \"chan! sey! chan! sey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have absolutely no idea.....about everything, my mind empty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to say something but Joy interrupt me: \"Well?! Why are you not preparing yourself?! I want ot see the entrance barred, the battle station manned and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped listening her, i Knew she was crazy, but this crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that my psychics have enough of Joy ranting, so i notice has they both nods to each other and then i see as Joy collapse to the ground unconscious...good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the crazed nurse asleep i can finally speak with my team seriously, or at least as serious as i can be discussing about intercourse with them <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy i am thinking in double sense?..i am going crazy, i just know it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow i understand that what they are asking me is not to be their whore, but to be their lover. Even if it imply exactly the same thing, semantics<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a the most calm and sympathetic tone i can muster: \"Team, here please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole team look at me, then assemble randomly in front of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue looking them all with a serious expression: \"I am sorry for my outburst, and i finally remembered why i have chosen to be a trainer, why i have started to...how many of you want to have sex with me? Please raise your hand, or paw\" i look at Nysa: \"tail for the lacking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all raise their sign, i nod: \"In line please, now how many of you...love me as a person, not as a trainer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly Sylvia raise her hand, while Nysa and Latias blush. I nod again but before i can continue Latias speak to me: \"<i>Jaden? I..i want to tell you that ..i haven't raised my hand because...i..still don't know and..i didn't wanted to lie..but i want to know you Jaden, to know you better,..please let me love you..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answer to Latias in a confused tone: \"Why? You barely know me and who know what our Pyrie told you and...why are you smiling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answer joyfully: \"<i>I knew it! I knew it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias quckly that i can follow come close our distance and kiss me deeply, i don't resist my pokemon kiss this time and i can hear Sylvia growling, but she continue as soon as she stop: \"<i>You said Our Pyrie! Like it should be! Not my Quilava or my slut like her trainer called her before, you are not like him or the human that caught me, i knew it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue on a humorous tone: \"And maybe you wish to try some thing that Our Pyrie suggested then?\" I am not talking seriously but she, unexpectedly reply: \"<i>Yes, some are...interesting, like when her old trainer penetrated her womb and filled it with essence, she said it feel funny but very good after a while. Or when..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok i got it! I think that me and Pyrie will have a nice and long discussion about what is opportune to say and what's is definitely not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qui quilava qui?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias: \"<i>She asked if the discussion will include sex</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiii lavaaa quilava qui?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias: \"<i>I am not sure, she asked about your previous session and when do you wish to finish it, what she is speaking about Jaden?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore Pyrie for now, and ask: \"Latias, why do you wish to love? Because i saved you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias reply as she is telling me the most obvious thing in the world: \"<i>Us pokemon need a partner, a lover if you want to reach happiness and our full potential, and i have chosen you Jaden. Not only why you saved me but also also because i believe in you, in what you wish to become and i want to be part of that dream, of your family</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she can know..Sylvia, she must have peeked in my dreams, i must have a nice long talk to her as well it seems..that come out wrong...again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exhale: \"Fine, Latias mind if a call you Lyrica from now on? I know it sounds lame, bur your voice remind me of theater somehow so..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatias coo happily: \"<i>I love it, thank you!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubts on old trainer come to mind, how they could bring their pokemon to their maximum potential if...well, maybe the voice on the champions of past are true then? That they ^mingled^ with their team, physically?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discard this line of thoughts and quickly ask: \"Did you hear our conversation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>Heard..all Jaden, what..do..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my right hand, calming any possible barrage of question from them: \"Do you all feel the same?\" All nod, even Pyrie although i think that he just nodded because the others did when we spoken about sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Owwww, what's happened?

What they are hiding? What scare them to the point of.....they are afraid of? What it would happen if they recognize pokemon as something more than animals?

No wait, i don't want to know<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica seems pretty excited and her tone reflect that: \"<i>Massage? I have heard of such things, and i have only heard good things about it, ok a massage or the winner then, but what about you?</i>\" Her mischievous smile return: \"<i> What do you get for winning? A massage from us?</i>\" Both Pyrie and Nysa seems quite happy with the idea, i wonder why<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, if i win...i don't want to hear anything about mating, nor even the slightest allusion about it for the whole day, agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole team pout, but i stand resolute and my small family agree to the terms, now i just have to win this thing, but first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now team da rulez\", i use a finger for every rule i speak about: \"First Lyrica you can levitate only at ground level, never higher then my head and i hear that Latias can become invisible, no got it? Second None of you may use any moves to increase their respective speed or agility, only the base physical ability are allowed, and last but not last\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lower my hand and speak with the most serious tone i can: \"Everyone for himself, to team play, because among the other things, only the victor will get the prize, the other will have to find something else to do, like training, are the rules clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seems a little dissatisfied with the rules but accept nonetheless, i must solidify my position as their alpha if i want them to be ready to compete for the gym, and not for who get the turn in getting breed first: \"Good team, let's start\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope that Sylvia is alright, but something tell me that she is.</span></div></div>",

Make no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to drop it for now, and instead think on how i can help my partner evolve, the little push she need to achieve her next stage, a teenage years of sorts. Battling seems the most obvious choice, and the fastest too, but i want to maximize Sylvia capacity before evolving and that mean a very specific training, one that can enhance her psychic skill and possibly add some defense on her stat too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile my thoughts are occupied by possible strategy and evolution theory (yes they practically force you to study it at school) my body reach the intended destination, the room where my Abra peacefully sleep, i hope<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly open the door, trying to make as less noise as possible and looking towards the bed, i spot my sleeping partner. While i observe her, the thoughts of her sickness forcefully return with vengeance, i try to quiet my mind in fear of awakening Sylvia, i am not sure if she can detect ideas and emotion even when asleep, but i don't want to take any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with my quick check, i withdraw in the corridor silently closing the door behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my back still on the door, i start to think to every possible cause of her sickness, but finding no plausible answer, i walk towards Joy once more set in getting some answer about Sylvia and about Pyrie, i want to know what she thinks about their condition, so to speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding nurse Joy i relatively easy in a pokemon center, and is even easier when 2 pokemon are harassing her, although i think that some trainer would call that playing, probably<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door on the main atrium, i find Nysa loosely wrapped around Joy, with her semi-screaming obscenities at her while Pyrie and Lyrica laugh their ass off, apparently Joy is scared of Big snakes like pokemon, or at least she is when they are coiling themselves around her, witch is perfectly understandable, if your job wasn't healing them of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch the scene for a few more seconds, still undecided if i should just wait and laugh, or help the poor human out of the evil pokemon coils, in the end even if i am the first to not be happy about it, i decide to help her, if nothing else because i don't think that she will be particularly talkative in her condition, unless  the talking is about an increasingly sophisticated way to insult what is practically a very big snake, sort of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to put on my most serious face, thankfully succeeding, and speak with a tone worthy of an alpha: \"Enough Nysa, release her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa look at me and nod, uncoiling herself from joy and reaching my two other unruly member of my team, she set herself in a waiting pose, fixing her gaze on me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy quickly recover, still a little angry but noting serious: \"Damn that oversized earthworm! I should..oh, hi Jaden, done already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI question part of her sanity more and more, or maybe she is just good at being oblivious? To everyone their talent i guess: \"She is asleep, i didn't want to disturb her. Joy can we talk for a second, it's about the...treatment you suggested\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"I am sorry Jaden, but there are not much more to tell, your Quilava has been trained since hatched to become a slut, i think that she has her first orgasm a few minutes after her first real breath, and probably given head a few second later, there is no cure, it's too deep rooted in her psyche, that's for her having sex with her trainer is a sign of affection and love, she is addicted to it. I am sorry, for you but more importantly for her, there is nothing i nor anyone else can do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not the only argument i want to speak about, but it's definitely one of them: \"Nothing? I mean, really nothing but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reply firmly: \"Yes, nothing but having sex with her, i am confident that with time she will be a little less demanding, but expect her to ask and in some cases even demand that kind of attention. Forcefully if denied too often\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forcefully? Like trying to rape me or something?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shake her head: \"No, she has been trained to be passive, a submitting creature to her old trainer desire, but she can and will try to arouse you, even in public if she is not..fixed, also she may try to present or even beg for your attention, do not underestimate her seduction capabilities Jaden, i bet that she has more experience in arousing a male that most woman in this city have, yes it's a little depressing i know, but it's probably so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am a little taken back from her spontaneous confession: \"So you basically given me a needy whore that know only to fuck everything that has a cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy look at me with a stern expression: \"No Jaden, i give you a beautiful pokemon that has quite the combat record if the database tag are exact, and usually are, a pokemon that will require the love of a family and most importantly, the affection of her trainer, both physical and emotional. In simpler terms, love her as family, but forgive me the term, use her as your personal cum dumpster, because if you do not\" Joy lift her right index to give more strength to her reasoning  \"she may go crazy with lust and do something both stupid and harmful to herself, believing that the most important being in her life, you from now on, do not love nor need her. It's what we call depression Jaden, and i think that you know what it can do to a person, or a pokemon in this case\" She lower her hand, having told me everything she has to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover from my stupor: \"So i basically have free reign over her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy expression change to the same that a mother have when she tell her children something it should already knew about, something obvious: \"Jaden, i do not think you have realized yet, but i have given you an abused pokemon, something that is usually done only to the most trusted and clean recorded trainer, usually, i have already registered your name and id in the database as one, you can basically do whatever you want with your pokemon and getting out clean. Normally if a trainer bring in a pokemon covered in semen we Joy do what i have done to your Quilava old trainer, keep her for more in depth exam and then if positive, remove her from it's care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy continue: \"Now Jaden, if You bring your Quilava, or even your Abra dripping semen from their ass, the Joy there know that there is a reason and just clean up the mess keeping her mouth shut about it, maybe even asking what you wish for launch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the hell...what..no..can't be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"From now on Jaden, you are an elite trainer, get yourself used to it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo..you can't do this..\"Why Joy, what in the deepest pit of tartarus\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"I am old Jaden, i look young but i am not, in my long career i have gained the full trust of many professors and league champion with my more..active work, outside this center, i knew about Team Shadow Jaden, the rejuvenator was a test, i also knew about Zekrom presence in the Smiling Forest, we are watching the legendary closely for good reasons, i have read the report on how quickly She befriended you, helping you in your short quest, how she...exposed herself to you, perhaps it was merely a joke, but i never saw a legendary do that Jaden, ever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy continue over my complete silence: \"Legendary don't trust easily, but she trusted you for some reason, and i believe i know why, there is no special power in you Jaden no universe breaking energy that you can manipulate or anything, it's just, you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another short pause: \"So yes Jaden, you. Consider yourself recruited, with the good and bad that will come from it, for some reason i trust you Jaden, there is something in you that make me..believe that you will succeed where other have miserably failed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with a singing tone: \"Don't delude us Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck. It. All. Period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pass my hands through my hair, frustrated with these events, now they may give me mission to accomplish, i will never truly be free...but perhaps i was never so, merely an illusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Don't worry Jaden, your mission is the very same reason you started this career even if you didn't knew about it then, stopping Team Shadow at all cost, i am sure that by now you are aware of their involvement in the catastrophe that changed the world forever, a disaster of immense proportion, that has reshaped what so little time ago we called Sinnoh and a few other isles of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resigned tone i reply: \"Of course. So, cum dumpster eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with an happier tone: \"Well, not exactly, but you got the meaning did you not? Fuck her silly Jaden, there are no other way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy a question, well beside all of this mess about being elite and all, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">it's all so..crazy</font>, why Sylvia has gotten sick over her evolution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy look pensive, then: \"I have theory, but you aren't ready for it yet, don't worry, everything is alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA SpyJoy tell me that everything is alright, of course, how can not be?</span></div></div>",

Not even the time to think about possible solutions, that the now familiar feeling of a swarm of ants crawling in my head warn me that the Latias in question is about to make her move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Jaden can....can we talk about..us?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least she is has manners, glad to see that my next would be mate try to make me feel comfortable at least, i must clarify this situation now before it escalate into something unpleasant, i don't want to deal with my team being heartbroken, nor i wish to transform it into a slut caravan of sorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look straight into her eyes, the amber colored iris soft glow is easily recognizable even on full daylight: \"Lyrica i know that you wish for a chance at being my partner, but we can't discuss this now, not without Sylvia anyway, also i think that maybe you idea of me is a little...discordant with reality so to speak\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica look confused: \"<i>Dis-cordant? You mean incorrect? But i have saw your memories and...ahhhhhhh...ops?</i>\" What?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to repress my anger, why every psychic in my team first and foremost idea of communicating is by snooping in my memories?! Why they can't just...damn it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica appear scared and nervous now, her inexperience in dealing with strong emotion drive her to overreacting, screaming in my head: \"<i>SORRY! JADEN PLEASE DON'T HATE ME! PLEASE!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head! My fricking head! I feel like on the verge of exploding! \"Lyrica! Stop it i can't, argh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain, that's the only thing i can think about, every nerves in my brain is on fire! I can feel my hands pressing on the scalp in a vain attempt to protect my mind from something that can't even be touched. The pain slowly lessen, and the feeling of my body return to me; i find myself kneeling on the ground, with hands on both sides of my head, eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute, i think, of what i can only describe as a vibration of sorts, cease, leaving me able to think clearly once more. What was that? Did Sylvia overloaded my senses with her psychic energy? Damn i feel sorry for whatever bugger will face her wrath in the future. Maybe i should remove her from the team...nah that's a stupid idea, is not that a Flamethrower from Pyrie or an HydroPump from Nysa will be any less painful, probably. Why i can't feel my body weight anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a distant male voice calling me, more like a whisper..i know this voice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden....Jaden...Jaden<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice gradually become more clear, and finally i recognize it's possessor, father<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes, why everything is so black? As soon as i remembered his face, he appear a few meters from me, i see him! It's dad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! H.....how..you are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is dressed with the lab coat i usually saw him wear at work, he is just as i remember him. Then he softly speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden i am here, it's everything alright, the pain will pass soon, don't stop trying just because you failed once, perseverance is one of the key to success\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat phrase, he said exactly the same thing the first time i fallen from my bicycle, he encouraged me to continue, despite my reluctance to continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather then come closer and putting an hand on my shoulder: \"Jaden i believe in you, i will always believe in you, never give up your dreams\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel his hand leaving, i look as his form become smaller and smaller<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! Wait! Please come back! Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant female voice is calling for me, Joy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Jaden</font>..<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Jaden, come on</font> <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Jaden wake up!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ethereal blackness vanish replaced by the feeling of my body lying on something soft, the noise of machinery and....cold? Why it's sol cold here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the weight of my body again, my eyelids open revealing a blinding light just over my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Joy, shut that thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Jaden! Finally i was worried that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" My eyes finally focus, i recognize the emergency room of the pokecenter, Joy look afraid for a moment but she change expression before i can ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"About what? How are you feeling Jaden? You seems spaced out a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at joy with an unamused expressio, i may be confused, but i am not a fool, what she was worried about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened Joy? I mean what really happened, i was...in a limbo of sorts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy expression become serious, and after sighing she reluctantly reply: \"Well Jaden, you see..just before starting to train your team, Latias has inadvertently overstimulated your cortex, short circuiting your higher brain functions, i think that the limbo you are referring to was your subconscious, but i cannot say it for sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWat? You mean..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in a coma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy shake her head: \"Not really, your brain must have pushed you down in the deepest part of your mind for safeguarding your consciousness, to prevent any possible damage. I have double verified all your nervous function with the scanner and your brain seems intact, merely a little shaken from the experience, just like you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo i have..dreamed about father? Seems....plausible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with a worried tone: \"Jaden are you alright?\" She must have noticed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes joy, thanks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"It's not uncommon to experience various kind of hallucination during such a state, some patients even told me to have saw his own infancy play before him. Don't hesitate if you need anything, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe know uh? \"Alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Your team is just outside, they refused to leave obviously, Latias seems particularly depressed and Abra nearly smashed a whole row of the waiting chairs on her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was that pissed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Well, the chairs Were kinda bolted on the floor, i underline were. Don't worry, i will justify the damage as the usual excuse of ^rampaging pokemon got free^ or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk..wait, usual? How many times..ha, forget it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice i recognize as Sylvia enter my head, strangely it doesn't bother me this time: \"<i>Jaden, you awake! How do you feel?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia tone is strange, more mature, doesn't stutter anymore, unconsciously i reply mentally: \"<i>I am ok Sylvia, say so to the others as well please, i don't want to repeat myself other 3 times</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>Jaden? Since you speak by mind?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI confused, reply mentally again: \"<i>What are you..wait, what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>J..Jaden? Is that you? I didn't know you were telepathic</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither did i, oh shit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy..help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"What is it Jaden, you whitened all the sudden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u>A modified explanation of the events transpired with Latias later</u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"I see, i don't think that you had become a psychic Jaden, however the shock that Latias accidentally unleashed on your brain may created a limited connection between you and her, Abra also. I think that the residual energy still on your brain must have given you some limited psychic skills, It has happened before, they will probably vanish in a few hours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i will return normal soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Yes, just so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Joy, see you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and the team leave the center, we have lost nearly 3 hors of training, and i have intention of recovering for the lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, we reach a clearing not far from the center that just border the Smiling Forest: \"Alright, for this match all of you will be in the rooster, hopefully none will go berserk about having Latias in the team. It's a grass gym so expect strategy specifically developed to counter Fire and Ice type moves, Psychic is also quite effective against grass, but i don't think that they will have an effective counter for that so, Sylvia and Lyrica, you both are our primary offensive, followed by Nysa and Pyrie of course, the gym leader may ask for a double battle especially after he/she will see you Lyrica, if that happen the team will be as just said, all clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole team nod: \"Good, let's start with scanning your move-set, you know the drill, in position girls the analyzer can't read your moves otherwise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scan take a few minutes with the following result: \"Alright team, as you know the pokegear can't read your specific power level, no device can yet do so, but it seems that you all have combat experience, and that Pyrie is close to evolving. Sylvia your evolution is literally there, just a small push, i expect you evolving during our match, let's use this as our advantage, and Sylvia, please forgive her, you must work with Lyrica for this gym and in the future, holding grudges help none, least of all us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia seems to think about this, and reluctantly nod.</span></div></div>",

Such cheap tactics...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa materialize in front of me, releasing her species signature cry and falling in her personal combat stance, more pronounced and aggressive as per her personality<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven from here i can see Nysa glare at Mirabelle taunting her like a Liepard ready to pounce on a Rattata, and curiously Mirabelle seems disturbed by her behavior<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle: \"Why your Milotic is so hostile towards me? I didn't offend her or anything..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly the gym leader statement make me reevaluate her skill level, she may just be feigning ignorance of course, but a veteran trainer should has lost counts on how many glares he/she has received from pokemon/trainer by now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, when fighting she is always very..driven, no matter what she face\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle relieved: \"Ah, ok\" Her recover is immediate returning to look confident and ready for anything. Smiling she say: \"I have never faced a pokemon so openly aggressive before, she seems quite strong\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle grip a ball on her belt, i then notice that she too has only 4 ball with her: \"My Turn! Come out Meg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she throw her ball on the field, the pokemon contained within get released. The ^materialization^ process take longer then it should, curious, want to ask her why is so later<br>\r\nThe process completed a few seconds after reveal a perfectly healthy Bayleef ready to battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bay!\" The pokemon look at Nysa before turning her eyes towards me, the smile on it's face deepen before turning to Milotic once again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle: \"Ready girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayleef nod: \"Bay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle: \"Let's do this! Meg start with Flash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn aggressive tactics from a Grass gym leader? As expected she want to compensate Grass type lack of offensive capabilities with their extensive debuffing arsenal, but flash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bayyy!\" I close my eyes as the intense bluish light start to cover the battlefield, unexpectedly Mirabelle order another attack while the first is still incomplete: \"Meg, Body Slam now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if still blinded by the light i can hear Bayleef charging towards us: \"Nysa aim at the light and use Scald!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the light still in effect i can barely open my eyelids without hurting my eyes, but Nysa seems mostly unaffected and focusing towards the light she release a superheated stream of water towards the Bayleef<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream of pain resonates in the stadium as the boiling jet of water force the grass type to halt her charge and stop her move \"Bayyyyy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can finally open my eyes, and i can see that Nysa is still attacking her opponent mercilessly, i look at the poor victim as she roll on the ground unable to stop herself while the water temperature is slowly cooking her insides<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scream: \"Nysa Stop! She is down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa acknowledge my order and immediately stop, the Bayleef is literally steaming and is red all over, multiple burns are visible on her skin. The first match is ours it seems, but i never thought that Nysa could attack another pokemon with such ferocity, she is still glaring at her opponent ready to strike the final blow if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she just wish to impress me with her combat skills? I hope so, the alternative are not particularly appealing otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle doesn't seems affected too much by the events, while she is evidently worried, her face look more displeased than anything, if with herself or her pokemon is for anyone to guess:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, return\" The return beam hit the downed pokemon, recovering it from her disastrous assault<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirabelle: \"Well played, i misjudged you Jaden, i knew that our match would have been brief, but not with Me on the losing side, still i have a few aces up my sleeve so be ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Mirabelle, me and my team are ready for anything,\" Then mockingly i add, hopeful to destabilize her morale: \"Can you say the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miloooooooo!\"</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s celebrate!\u201d you immediately find yourself flat on your back and covered by your Pok\u00e9mon, some of whom seem to be feeling rather frisky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that\u2019s enough!\u201d you squirm your way out of the group and get to your feet only to have <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrie jump into your arms. \u201cQuiiill!\u201d she moans seductively rubbing your chest. You look over towards Lyrica for a translation. \u201cShe wants her massage, and so do I\u201d  \u201cOnce we get back to the center I\u2019ll give you both your massage okay?\u201d receiving affirmation from Pyrie and Lyrica, and pointed stares from Sylvia and Nysa, you relent \u201cYou two can have massages as well\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers all around, followed by hugs. You stroll around the shops for a couple hours, before heading back to the Pok\u00e9mon center for lunch. Standing in front of the center is a man about twenty years old. \u201cAre you the trainer who almost destroyed the gym?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah I guess that\u2019s me\u201d \u201cBattle me, now\u201d \u201cNo\u201d you walk around him into the building only to have Joy almost fall on top of you. \u201cYikes Joy chill out.\u201d \u201cOh Jaden it\u2019s you, I heard about the gym. Are you alright?\u201d \u201cYeah we\u2019re all fine, the girls did fantastic\u201d you start to leave when an after-thought hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey Joy if anyone comes looking for a battle could you throw them off my trail?\u201d Smiling knowingly she assured you she would. Thanking her you return to your room with your Pok\u00e9mon in tow. Closing and locking the door, you turn to your girls. \u201cAlright who\u2019s first?\u201d surprisingly there was no arguing when Sylvia stepped up first. \u201cOkay then let\u2019s get started. Girls would you mind waiting in the other room?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia lays face down on the bed as you begin to rub her shoulders. You alternate pressing with your knuckles and palms making sure to get her entire back. \u201dJaden, could you get my legs?\u201d At her request you start on her legs, and slowly work your way up, eventually reaching her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to allow your embarrassment to get the best of you, you continue with the massage. Sighing contentedly Sylvia takes you by surprise and pulls you down next to her on the bed. Lying face to face, Sylvia leans forward and kisses you slowly. You return the kiss despite your misgivings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something fumbling with your belt \u201cH-hey what\u2019re you\u201d you are silenced by another kiss. \u201dI love you Jaden, this is what I want\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I stare at her sex for a few more seconds before pushing Sylvia down on my legs; my partner seems to understand my intention as she left me push down and free my legs from under her, still keeping that exposed pose. I find my body moving in autopilot as i get on my knee and, using the right hand, place the tip of my organ on the lips of her tight looking sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my head i can hear Sylvia pleading to continue, to claim her as my mate, but i don't listen, my instinct now awaken are like a beast from the deep, starved for something to unleash the lust and frustration accumulated in me from their presence, the teasing and sometimes infuriating presence of my team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a link that bind me with the pokemon under me, prostrated and submissive to my lust for her. I stop thinking as i decisively push forward, feeling my tip finding it's way in, spreading the tight walls of her slick sex with ease. I continue to press my hip to hers, until a barrier prevent me from going further, only now i realize that Sylvia is moaning both with her voice and in my head, encouraging me to do with her as i please. I slowly remove a good half of my tool from her tight insides before ramming in all the way to the barrier, hearing her encouragement to take her fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fleeting thought about pokemon toughness despite their appearance, quickly come to me before losing it in the pit of question that at the moment i am unwilling to process, instead i start pumping my hips into hers with the single minded purpose of claiming my partner as mine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer contraction are becoming closer between each pulse, tightening at every push and driving me to thrust with more strength until i literally push my lover on the bed with each entry. I lose the concept of time as i continue in this primitive dance, until i feel Sylvia walls tightening to the point of pain, her mouth open and screaming her approval to anyone who can hear it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue my motion getting desperate for release, finally with a last thrust i go as deep as i can, my vision blank as i let it everything go, my frustration, my limited view on love, all my vigor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy return to me after the longer moment of bliss i ever experienced, just before collapsing on Sylvia, after what i think an eternity has passed, i can cleary hear my lover talking to me: \"<i>Thank you, my love</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere i black out, too tired to resist the lure of temporary oblivion.</span></div></div>",

Sylvia: \"<i>Knowing father he didn't tell her anything until the deed was done, and believe me Jaden if mother knew that he didn't wanted to tell you anything....</i>\" her laugh again: \"<i>Let's just say that she would have ^persuaded^ him otherwise</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersuaded eh? Not sure i like the idea, after all if the said ^like mother, like daughter^ is true, then she will try to ^persuade^ me from time to time.

No time for merriment now, first breakfast then i will play painbringer with an old friend, training with team, a brief talk with Joy and.....meh I'll cross that bridge when i come to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue to ignore Sylvia mind prodding while we finally cross the door that bring us in the mess hall, my team completely ignoring my arrival, occupied as they are devouring the food before them. Joy greet me with a big smirk on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with a flirting tone: \"Morning Casanova, why i would have never, making your pokemon scream like That....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to ignore her comment as best i can, but the unnerving smile of my team tell me that i will probably lose more than one night of sleep in the future. My hunger leave me when i see my team inviting me at their table, instead i walk toward the videophones hoping that berating Jeremy for his deceit will make me feel better, maybe i will finally get some answer too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seat in front the closest phone that happen to be the second on the right, inserting the coin i notice Sylvia seating on my left watching me intently, i start to digit the number to call and as soon as i have done, Sylvia jump on my lap surprising me for her bold move just as the call is starting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover from my surprise just in time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of an Alakazam appear on the video, i recognize her as Sina as she start to write on the keyboard but she stop as soon as she recognize me and her daughter, her smile threaten to break her muzzle as she run to the right, probably to get Jeremy to the phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia start to wiggle her rear on my crotch, while she put her head just under mine seeking affection for her not so innocent act, i keep my lower body still but i gladly embrace her upped body removing any doubt she may have about my feelings for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ^sense^ that she know my love for her despite my indecision, no matter what i do i can't completely remove the feeling of wrongness i feel when i think of loving my partner, it must be some remote part of me that doesn't want to accept my love for a sentient being that is not human<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a running noise come from the phone as Jeremy appear on the screen with Sina at his side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia now look at the screen but continue to wiggle her rear now intentionally stimulating me by placing her sex just above my sword. I place my hand on her lower body keeping her still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily only the upper part of our body is visible on screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Jaden finally! I was just thinking about you!\" Me too Jeremy, me too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jeremy, Sina...i just wanted to keep you both up to date with the most recent events, that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Don't worry Jaden, you can call us whenever you want really, don't hesitate for anything you may need\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes whenever i want, sure. Without any malice in my voice, but with thoughts whispering of blood at his betrayal, i continue with our little family reunion, dropping the bomb with complete nonchalance \"Why thank you dad, i can call you dad now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile slowly vanish, slowly getting replaced by worry, Sina is beaming instead nearly jumping with happiness. My serious face and Jeremy silence however make Sina understand that something isn't right, and as expected she turn her head towards Jeremy probably telepathically asking him The question<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice as Jeremy face darken all the sudden, yep just as Sylvia said, Sina won't appreciate his silence on the matter, it seems that she really believed that i knew about Sylvia being Jeremy daughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy with a apologetic tone: \"Well congratulation?\" his forced smile don't convince his partner Sina, and from her expression i can easily predict the misery she will bring upon him in the near future<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy return to a somewhat serious tone: \"Jaden..sorry, i should have told you, i know! but i thought th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI interrupt his ranting: \"That i would not have accepted Sylvia if i knew the truth? But at the same time you thought that i would have been a good candidate for her? Seriously Jaremy, i trusted you! and instead -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia keep her serious expression, but in my mind nearly beg: \"<i>Please Jaden, i know that father took advantage of your trust but, just, can you forgive him?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot now Sylvia, not yet. I recover a more calm but still my emotions find a way to influence my tone: \"I just wanted to inform you that my team and i have just obtained our first badge, Sylvia has showed an enormous amount of power during the final part of the match, enough to literally lift the whole gym from the ground by...i don't know, few centimeter at least along with everything inside, referee and my opponent included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression on both their faces are priceless right now, but i continue imperturbable: \"Don't worry, no pokemon nor human took any real damage from the event, although the gym need their walls reinforced and probably a good repaint here an there, along with new windows and spectator chair, unless the mentioned chairs are still intact when they finally find a way to bring them down, from the ceiling and trees\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy jaw nearly fall down from stupor and Sina face express similar emotion from my tale, i don't care however, not now: \"Afterwards me and Sylvia has a..clarification on both our feelings and...yeah, you know how it work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy: \"Th..the..whole gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? My gear is unable to measure the exact level of energy a pokemon can exert, nor any gear that i know of, but i presume that the amount used by Sylvia is enormous compared to a normal Kadabra, i suspect that her human heritage has something to do with it, but i have no proof to support this theory. Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shake their head in a universal sign of no<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, i will contact you both..when the mood strike me, Jeremy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that i close the call and embrace Sylvia as tight as i could, needing all the comfort i could get. I acted tough, and i am, but i too need to know that my loved ones are there for me when i need them. I normally don't feel this way but after Jeremy betrayal i, feel a little empty, it will pass soon i am sure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia hug me back as best she can given her position, understanding and probably feeling my distress right now, we don't speak only keeping ourselves closer as possible, it's enough for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur moment is interrupted by Joy: \"Jaden you coming? It's getting cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy bring a smile on my lips again, my dark emotion leave me, returning in the abyss they come out to, at least for now. I will return happy and easygoing pretty soon i just know it, but first, an healthy and as such probably tasteless breakfast await me, with the rest of my team waiting for an answer soon as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassage, right. Maybe later, another day if i have anything to say on the matter anyway. Also if i spot Joy smirking once again i unleash Sylvia on her, promise.</span></div></div>",

Remembering what Joy said, you begin to rub her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Somewhat hesitantly, you rub your way down her belly until you reach her vent. Unsure exactly how to proceed, you slowly trace your way around her slightly puffy lips, eliciting a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour subconscious still whispering to you that this was wrong. You shove it down to the back of your mind, and focus on Pyrie. You move closer and closer until you are rubbing her lips with your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming more forward you slowly insert a finger, and smile slightly as she gasps and bucks her hips, trying to get you in further. You oblige slowly sliding your finger in up to the second knuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch a whiff of an enticing scent as Pyrie becomes more aroused. Much like pepper but with a hint of berries, you realize the scent is coming from the Quilava in front of you. Slowly removing your finger, you raise it to your nose and inhale taking in the wonderful aroma. You get a taste of her fluids as you clean off your finger. The flavor was rich, with a heavy taste of spices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you had been ignoring Pyrie for a moment, you lean forward and lightly lick her now soaked vent. Receiving an enormous moan you continue. As you continue Pyrie begins to breathe harder and her internal muscles clench spastically. Knowing that she is close, you find the sensitive nub at the top of her lips.

When i mated with Sylvia there has been no time, nor the need to stimulate each other orally, but Pyrie seems quite pleased to start our session from here, however i don't have time to mull over the idea, that Pyrie open her mouth as much as she can and engulf the head of my member and start sucking, hard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moan heavily at this sudden peak of pleasure, i never expected such moves from a her, but then again she has been trained as a slut for her old trainer and team since birth, so i should have known. I try to tell Pyrie to stop or i may come in her mouth, but she only smile at my attempt and begin to lick and suck faster, trying to fit in her mouth and throat as much as she can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene before me is ridiculous as much as is arousing, with my quilava sucking my dick like her life depend on it while keeping her rump as hight as she can probably for permitting another male to mount her while busy giving head, her position remind me of the abuse she must have suffered with her old trainer, and while he disgusted me i must admit that having at least a female in your team specifically trained for giving...relief to the rest of the team is not a bad idea as it is especially during long and arduous training session isolated from any form of civilization, the method he used are unredeemable at best and he deserve anything that will happen to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel myself already reaching my limit due to both my very limited experience with sex, and her stellar performance she is giving me. I try to hold it as much as i can but in the end after another few handful of seconds i came, straight in her throat with her paw massaging every part of the member she couldn't fit inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrie continue to lick and massage my organ even after my release is over, and with her continuous stimulation, i never get soft and instead feel getting hard again in record time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover fully from my orgasm only to find my slutty pokemon finish cleaning the remnants of cum on her muzzle, smile mischievously, and turn around exposing her more then ready sex ready to be taken. My first instinct is to give her just what she wants, but calming myself for a moment i realize that this is exactly what she has done for her old master all her life<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push those impairing thoughts aside and decide to mate her on her back, maybe a little tricky but in this way she can see that i don't have her in my team only for sexual relief, but because i want her to be part of our team, part of my soon to be circle of lovers and not just a hole to fill every time i have the urge, not that she would mind apparently, but such ideas does not feel right to me, she is not a toy, She Is my beautiful, quite skilled and perpetually horny Quilava<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully it's not the same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my right hand i roll Pyrie on her back, despite her surprised expression she complain without question, then i keep her down with a slight pressure on her chest while i align myself with her sex; as soon as i feel the hot and damp lips of her sex i push myself in. Her lips easily part, her whole body welcoming me with a tight, burning embrace<br>\r\nthe incredible heat of her sex is amplifying the feeling of her tight walls inviting me in, eager for her dose of maleness she has become so addicted to. Pyrie close her eyes and moan freely as i part her insides and quickly reach her cervix, i feel my tip parting the normally tight closed entrance of her womb with worrying ease, making my head partially slip through<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to worry for her ^condition^ but her pulsing walls and needy whine blank most of my thoughts, promising to check her condition later and reminding myself that evolution solve many minor problems, i commence to pull my hips back and when halfway out, hastily re-thrust myself in, this time the whole head enter her sanctum only to have Pyrie moan of pleasure saturate the whole room, encouraged by her reaction i start to mate her hard and fast, trying to keep her face always in my sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy soon to be mate open her eyes, for a moment a surprised expression appear on her feature, immediately replaced by one of pleasure at my next thrust, she look at me intently as i mate with all the energy i can muster, maybe curious about her position; i slow down as i bring my head over hers and kiss her deeply, the position is uncomfortable given her height but i manage, and after a few seconds of bliss i resume my frenzied motion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to focus on her still incredulous expression as she suddenly orgasm mid-thrust, the walls of her sex while not as tight as Sylvia are still quite strong and more then capable of bringing the second orgasm of our session out of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to bring my hips to hers and nearly succeed as my tip press against her uterine wall as i release all my pent up emotion with every jet of semen until my balls too remain as empty as my regret, which is now completely gone, so are most of my strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come down from my hight and kiss the open mouther Pyrie as much as my remaining lust let me, feeling her paw gripping my head and try to pull me closer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we separate our lips i can descry that she has understood, i consider her much more then a pokemon to use for my pleasure in battle or in bed, but a something more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extract myself from her, a small trail of semen still connect my tip with her leaking sex, i don't pay much attention to it as i lay down on her side, with her hugging my forearm in sign of affection; maybe i have succeed where even Joy thought i would fail, releasing Pyrie from the prison of lust, abuse and need she was forced to live until now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pyrie start to hump my arm and moan softly, licking every part of my flesh withing her muzzle reach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not, well at least the abuse part is still as good as it gets<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrie, enough for now, alright? I am tired and so are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrye look at me quizzically, as saying ^Don't want another round?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, not sure enough energy left, also while clear that i will never rectify her lusty behavior, i will be at least capable of somewhat reducing it by not having sex with her everyday, and hopefully it will not just make it even more needy that she already is, later i will try to talk with Joy about this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would also like to discuss her my next move against TS, i must know more about the cataclysm and their role in it and maybe Joy will know more about their possible next moves, or something else about the oceanic platform father was working on, information on the whole ^Reaforming^ project was scarce at best, heck military where involved in it! So the most brilliant mind of the known world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's really happened that day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh, Joy she is quickly becoming my very personal advisor, perhaps it's not as bad as it sounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?</span></div></div>",

Well physically i mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy expression shift for a moment, i think that she understood what kind of question i am asking her, but she feign ignorance and simply reply: \"Yes she was perfectly healthy when i visited her, or at least as healthy as a pokemon that has been abused since birth could be, why there something wrong in her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her that's right, not exactly wrong, i think but still<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, Joy as you have guessed i am still a little reluctant in talking about...that\" i a few relaxing breath: \"Anyway, during our..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smile mischievously: \"Fuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue annoyed: \"<b>Bonding</b>, Pyrie cervix opened far too easily, i think. Pokemon should share some basic anatomy function with human and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy interrupt my rumbling, serious now: \"Yes, the entrance to her womb should be, difficult to penetrate, just like in human woman yes, however as you already know Quilava was abused repeatedly from her ex-trainer and team, so your revelation doesn't surprise me at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy seems quite pissed about our discussion, however remain perfectly professional: \"All considered i would have found strange if her past partners haven't done such damage to her, after all for a Quilava even a normal human penis is quite long and pretty thick in comparison to her body structure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have guessed that, thanks Joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Normally pokemon females are quite, how to say it? Stretchy? Yes stretchy, they have to be, some possible partner Are in some cases quite bigger and sometimes even quite heavier, so they body adapt to a point. Repeated..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her anger slip in her voice now: \"Session may and in some cases, permanently damage the female body and make her sterile or unable to conceive correctly with smaller sized pokemon anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if one exagerate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy evidently angry now: \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy close her eyes and seems to meditate or something, then nearly a minute later return calm and mostly relaxed: \"Sorry Jaden, it's not with you that i...sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Now don't worry about her, when she evolve in Typhlosion her body should be able to repair itself just enough to solve her problem, so don't brood more than necessary over it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too must take care then and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy laugh, a pure unadulterated laugh, at my expense, yeah i knew she was crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy now more relaxed, her expression completely softened, not a trace of the anger she possessed a few seconds ago: \"Jaden, Quilava cervix is already damaged and her evolution will fix that problem no matter what you do from now on, of course it still won't be as it should have been, but similar thing happen in nature too, so she will be perfectly fine. It's commendable that you think so much to the wellbeing of your pokemon Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression and tone become mischievous again: \"Or you just wanted to know if she could become even tighter when..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suddenly can't understand you anymore! There must be something wrong with the Pervert/Nurse translator Joy, Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy still smiling: \"Sure, whenever you say. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to the matter at hand: \"Does any of your contact know anything more specific about TS plans or goals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy return somewhat serious: \"Not as much as we would like, only what i already told you, and a few things i can't tell you Jaden, at least not now, sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she is, more secret, splendid: \"What could they do with all the three Lake legendary? Theoretically speaking of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy look pensive, unsure, but then she exhale softly: \"Alright, you haven't heard from me\" I nod \"Good, The three legendary Are capable of influencing creatures, human included, emotions and to a point, their will. Truth to be told their power, while still quite strong, diminished tremendously since creation or at least so we speculate. Anyway probably Arceus or another similarly powerful pokemon, have sealed part of their power just in case and they are unable to manipulate sentient creatures directly anymore, although it still possible for them to influence their behavior quite a bit, again human included\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Now if TS find a way to unlock their full power they could become strong enough to take over entire region by barely lifting a finger, however such large scale of operation would be noticed by operatives and also we have device capable of reducing dangerous pokemon powers, at least to a point. I short we would notice them, so we believe that TS want to find a way to influence humanity past, changing some important historical moment in their favor and eliminate any possible difficulties along the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horrry Shit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Yes with multiple r, now for them to even a remote chance of succeeding they need not only the lake trio but also a powerful and perfectly stable energy source, also a way to influence time and space directly, so..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palkia and Dialga\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Not necessarily, they have already attempted to capture them without success so i am not sure what kind of backup plan they have if any\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want to use Reshiram and Kyurem as energy source?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Probably, do try to save them ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me? Can't i have some help from your superspy organization?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Jaden, try to understand, i should not have told you anything, also yes expect some help from us, from time to time at least, but nothing big unless absolutely necessary, try to pass as a normal trainer in his journey, also have fun with Zekrom if you eventually found her, she seems quite attached to you before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blush: \"She was just joking, that's all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with a sing-song voice, smiling: \"If you say so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so Pyrie problem will solve itself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Changing argument are we, alright. Yes it should solve itself, if something goes wrong, but i don't count on it, just bring her to any center, my college have access to the trainer database so they will recognize you, i have already told you that no? Also a Typhlosion should be big enough to take you without problem, or you are so gifted that..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Joy the disturb from your translator again, you should fix that, is getting quite annoying you know, bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking toward the room with my team in it only a phrase echo in my mind: Why didn't i chose to be breeder instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, bad idea.</span></div></div>",

Shouldn't you ask the trainer for that kind of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile: \"Compelling a pokemon to fight it's like trying to make a river flow on reverse, even if you succeed in the end you just messed up things, so why not ask her first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica seems a little confused at my reasoning but find nothing to counter with so she just nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove my hand from the affection seeking Sally: \"Sorry girl, but i have a few preparation to make\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally look unhappy and try to make a pout face, with hilarious result, that i keep to myself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"Sorry Jaden but we just stopped for a quick check up, we a just leaving, maybe next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still smiling: \"Sure, on next then, farewell Rubica, and farewell to you too Sally\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grin as she follow her trainer towards the door, and just as she pass through the automatic doors, she lover her front paw and lift her big tail, giving me an unobstructed view of her glistening sex, she keep her pose for at least 10 seconds i think looking at me over over her wings, then recover her normal stance and walk out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWTF?!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with a teasing tone: \"My my Jaden, another victim of your charm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn towards joy, pissed: \"What da facq?!

Somewhat unsteadily she walks over to you, and in a shocking display of affection, forced her tongue into your mouth. It lasted only for a second before she pulled away and pushed you towards Rubica, who was still lying prone on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently roll her onto her back and check for injuries. Deciding that she was merely sleeping at this point. You stand and explain it to Sally before setting up your tent, which conveniently, was made for a trainer and several Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the help of your Pok\u00e9mon it was up in a matter of minutes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna put Rubica in here, I\u2019ll just sleep outside.\u201d You lay Rubica on the sleeping mat, and exit the tent to see a large fire already lit. You sit down and are immediately surrounded, which you expected, but to your surprise Sally joins the group, sidling up to you and laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you\u2019re really friendly aren\u2019t you?\u201d you pet her head \u201cSala, sal, mence Salamence\u201d she mumbles towards your Pok\u00e9mon. You kept track of their various responses, as they continued the conversation in a way you couldn\u2019t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking in their various tongues, the conversation was short but appeared to intrigue your team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cJaden we would like to sleep in our pokeballs tonight\u201d Sylvia said in your head. You were surprised to say the least. \u201cUm okay, if you want to\u201d you remove the pokeballs from your belt and recall the girls back into their respective Pokeballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Sally wraps herself around you and plants a kiss on your lips. Stunned you fall backwards, and let her continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see the reason for your teams\u2019 odd behavior. They had decided to allow Sally a shot at you. You decided to talk with them later, but for now you had more pressing concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you had been thinking you had been subconsciously kissing Sally back. You realized you couldn\u2019t back out of this now, so you decided to make the best of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly rub her neck and move lower and lower until you are at her wings. She quivers at your touch as you delicately rub along her shoulders. You begin to feel drops near your crotch and realize she is very much ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trail your fingers down until you reach her needy sex. Tracing the outer lips with your finger, you feel the volume of viscous liquids increase dramatically. You slowly insert a finger and pump in and out slowly, gaining a heavy groan from Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she bucks her hips it occurs to you that you are getting a good deal of experience in this area. Adding another finger you speed up your movements until she stands up, turns around, and presents you with her badly leaking vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Removing your pants, you stand behind her and align yourself with her entrance. You lean forward until you feel your tip pressing into her heated vent. Pressing forward you slowly penetrate and push until you are fully inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold that position for a moment, until Sally grinds against you. At her behest you pull almost all of the way out and push back in slowly, eliciting a pleasured groan.  You continue, slowly increasing your speed, until you are moving at full speed and Sally is rocking back with each thrust. You feel yourself getting close, and the random spastic clenching of her walls suggests that Sally is close as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more pumps before you slam into her as hard as you can and release your seed deep inside her. The feel of your essence inside her sent Sally over the edge as well, her juices spilling out around your softening member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted you pull out of her and fall on your ass. Sally curls herself around you and falls asleep. Too tired to move, you use her wing as a blanket and fall deep into the oblivion of sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to ask about the lieutenants but suddenly the temple door are busted inward as the goddess of corruption herself came in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLariyra is a beautiful creature, humanoid but not, with a smooth coverage made of what seems to be withe and red skin, her ember eyes glowing with power<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe start to speak sensually: \"Hello grandmaster, how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face become sad all the sudden: \"You never write, never come to visit, i feel so alone in my empty dark halls\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandmaster face remain calm: \"I don't hate you Lariyra, i understand your loneliness, i too live in seclusion, but you must seek companionship within your own species, not among our order\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLariyra advance a few steps towards us until a blue seal stop her from coming closer, her tone become more normal but still a little sad: \"Why don't you accept me, i can give power, richness...love\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandmaster sigh, then continue as before: \"I cannot love you Lariyra, i want to but i can't, our difference are too great. Our purpose too different\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLariyra now angry: \"Liar! You are just being stubborn, Aracatuanga never prohibited our union! It's only your false guilt that prevent us from being together, mark my words ^grandmaster^, i will do Anything in my power to make you see the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Lariyra vanish in a strange, transparent cloud that distort her image for a second. I think to remember that distorted form, but from where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all retire in our lodging for the night, the strange form i saw make difficult for me to focus. Suddenly something long and wet lick my face, a creature with blue skin and red wings embrace me tightly. In her eyes i can descry something, an emotion i am not familiar with<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something pinch me on my cheek, i try to look at my side but see nothing. I turn toward the creature and again the pinch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI touch my cheek and feel something my hand touching something, even if i don't see anything! What's happening?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pinch and this time the creature make me look at her and then kiss me deeply, her tongue entering my mouth and i instinctively kiss her back, until another stronger pinch make everything go withe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open my eyes and find myself aggressively kissing Sally, a soft purr coming from her throat. Sally stop kissing me while another pinch make me turn towards the offended, only to see Lyrica smiling form levitating over my side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Ma-Jaden, so early in the morning and already doing naughty things?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the...i dreamed everything? Lariyra...the grandmaster...that was....wow. So Aracatuanga is...Arceus? And Lariyra was Lyrica?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind must have projected some of my doubts in the form of that dream, crazy shit that was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally give me another lick before giving me a mischievous smile and turning around she roll herself on her back, exposing her already wet sex and tight anus to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Oh yes, me too me too!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look as Lyrica place her lover body over Sally muzzle and my eyes widen as Sally start to lick Lyrica vent with her tongue provoking a moan from the horny Latias. I remember my crazy dream trying to relate what i remember from it with what i am seeing now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the reality and the dream far too related for my liking i decide to focus on what important,closing my eyes and removing the noise of both dragon pokemon are making, but despite my effort the only thing i can think of is my dream, and my team are feeling for me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to solve the puzzle that my life has become, i open my eyelids and find myself looking straight at Sally exposed undertail, her wings twitch every few seconds as her lower lips drip the evidence of her arousal, i still can't understand how such big pokemon can have such a small sex, perhaps it's a matter of efficiency so that even relatively small poke can successfully mate with bigger species. After all isn't Pyrie ^elastic^ as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless the reason i cannot deny that the scene before me is dramatically increasing my arousal<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Master..what are you waiting for, she is ready and in need of her mate..touch</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am i not Your mate anymore Lyrica?\" Here we go with master again, she will ever consider me her equal? I start to think that mateship in pokemon mean one under and one humping all the others, with not necessarily the female under<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Master please, stop  ah..worrying and start mating your needy mates</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the time to continue our talk as i hear a distinctive voice of Rubica screaming: \"<b>What the hell are you doing to my Sally?!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe? Ask her dammit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask your Sally? She is a lovely pokemon, a little explicit but lovely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"You haven't forced her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica check her belt and find Sally ball still firmly attached to the latch, she start to look worried and softly say: \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Sorry</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didi you ever...you know with sally?\" I hear a grunt as Sally reach my side and envelop me in her left wing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica blush: \"...sometimes, i never thought that she..would have mated with a human of all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica recover her verve: \"Of all the possible mates i presented her to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's seems that Sally only wanted some attention, did you ever asked her what she wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica look at me surprised as Sally wind tighten around me: \"Yes..i mean..well..i am her trainer and i kn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what's best for her? She can choose her own path Rubica, she merely share it with you. Did you wish to understand her, ask her opinion sometimes, believe me pokemon have their own opinion on many things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think of Sylvia and Nysa not so subtle advance: \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Sometimes even too many</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, why don't we talk over breakfast, maybe we can discuss about pokemon and human relationship further?\"</span></div></div>",

But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they merely wish for something more exotic? Or maybe just a good session without worrying about consequences, after all human and poke can't reproduce\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, most of the time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"I suppose, what you really want to do there anyway? You didn't tell me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd i won't tell you now either: \"Something that i cannot avoid, nor i want to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part of my phrase come out a little more menacing that i wanted to, Rubica look pensive, then: \"Did you have the time to attend my match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, if i have the time i will gladly do so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------------------------------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day hold no surprise to us, beside a few battles against a few wild pokemon we met on the way. Based on the map in the pokegear we should be able to reach the Aeterna Caves tomorrow, which may be a good thing or not given that not much is know about the pokemon living in the least traveled path, a mix between what remained the old Mt.Coronet (now what remain is permanently enveloped in a tick mist) caves and the new excavation done in a attempt to restore the old path after the ^Event^. During the excavation many new natural passage was uncovered, some even reach what is now the southeastern side of the continent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat southeastern region was originally known as Kanto and Johto, not sure how much remain tough, they has been hit pretty hard i hear, anyway maybe i will go even further north after the lake problems has been solved,  what was once called Unova, something tell me that there i will find some answer about father work<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh knowing that probably Joy and her mysterious superpy team, will found something else for me to do before i get the chance to explore those region, perhaps i won't need to<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of what i will do depend on what or if, i uncover something when i reach our destination.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve only taken a couple steps when you hear something to your right.  Turning quickly you shine your flashlight in the direction of the sound. Through the shifting fog you can see a figure approaching. As it gets closer you can make out white claws, black fur and red feather-like protrusions on its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Sneasel\u201d you mumble to yourself. \u201cIce and dark type...Weak to fire\u2026Male from the length of the feathers.\u201d You reach for Pyrie\u2019s pokeball, but the Sneasel notices the motion and charges towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSneasel!\u201d you push Rubica out of the way and jump backward barely avoiding the slicing claws. Still in the air you pop open the pokeball containing Pyrie. With a flash of light and flame she appears on the cave floor, ready for a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPyrie, flamethrower!\u201d \u201cQuiiill!\u201d the flares on her back intensify. As she rears up on her back legs and blasts a stream of intense fire. The stream surrounds Sneasel in an instant, and as quickly as it happened it disappeared, leaving a badly burnt Sneasel kneeling on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, the Sneasel jerked to its feet, staggering unsteadily. \u201dSneasel snea\u201d it lurched towards Pyrie, who merely sidestepped, and fell on its face. \u201cI can\u2019t just leave it in this condition\u201d you knelt next to the injured Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cSneasel!!\u201d a loud cry echoed around. You turn and behind you, you see a group of several Sneasel. \u201cSnea Sneasel\u201d one of them, apparently the leader, walked right up to you and began to wave its arms furiously. \u201cSneasel snea Sneasel!\u201d it dropped its arms and glared at you seeming very irked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you reached for Sylvia\u2019s pokeball; the Sneasel tensed but didn\u2019t attack.

Attacking two trainer this way, out of the blue, if anything happen to Rubica Sally will make a fine side dish with her</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her blatant way to expose the fact, i agree with Lyrica, this group of Sneasels must haven't thought about the consequences of their action, what if the trainer has a group of powerful pokemon with him/her? How did they hope to defeat an experienced team? By taking the trainer by surprise? And then what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that while pokemon aren't stupid creatures, some of them aren't exactly smart either: \"Human have ways to make things run in their favor, but if you expect me to fight unharmed, the fight will be fought exclusively without powers or moves beside your claws of course, is that what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sneasel seems a little shocked, it seems that as i have expected they didn't plan this ^attack^ as well as they should have<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps with a small push i can use their own nature against them, and get out of this sort of negotiation ahead: \"What, isn't it obvious? Human don't directly involve themselves in pokemon fight, usually\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this is not the time to remember Nysa aggressive advances, focus: \"If you wish to fight me, you must either renounce to your moves for the fight, or risk to fight me with a device you may or may not know, with all risk a jump in the unknown may bring, and before you threatening me with harming my companion know this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make the more menacing voice and expression i can: \"If something, anything happen to her, i will not consider myself responsible of what her Salamelance or my Lyrica here will do to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group of our attacker start whispering between each other, they know that a pissed of dragon type can be pretty much uncontrollable in it's rage, is not by chance that a move is called Dragon Rage, i admit that i don't know if Sally is capable of using that particular move or even if she can learn Outrage, but they don't need to know that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not that Sally don't know other impressive moves anyway, probably at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Sneasel that challenged me scream something and the rest of the group shut up immediately, her scream reverberate in the tunnel ahead of us, hopefully nothing big and angry will came out of the darkness thinking about dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah right, with my luck a Sableye or worse a Tyranitar, is already on it way, and of course they will be female AND in heat. Ok enough pessimism<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneaseal snea se sneasel sne, sel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>She say that she is not afraid of you or your weapon, but out of honor she will allow a pokemon to fight in your place</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get closer to Lyrica: \"Honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica smile, barely containing a laugh: \"<i>So she said, not that Sneasel has any, they are good, nimble fighter, but honor is just not their way</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk appear on my lips: \"A very honorable term, but what i get if I win then? An honorable fight must have a prize for those who prove the to be the strongest, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sneasel nod, it's common among pokemon fighting for a prize, it's common even between human after all, of course if a trainer lose a fight usually the prize is just a small sum of Pokeron (sometimes more elegantly called credits) or something else of limited value like a TM, but in the wild things are different and fight can happen for pretty much anything as a prize<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be persuaded to part with some ration of food, or maybe a TM in case you may want to learn a move otherwise unobtainable without training, think about it, a move no other Sneasel can ever learn on it's own would give you quite the advantage in battle. In exchange i merely ask....mmmmh, let's say the precious things you have and free passage in these caves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female look at me suspiciously and i can understand her, but nutritious food is a rare commodity in the wild, for free at least, and is known that most wild pokemon know what a TM is, perhaps some released pokemon in the past have spread word<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the most precious things? Well it was the first ting it came on my mind at the moment and simply asking to go free may have left the group suspicious about my intentions, freedom is always the prize of the strongest after all, but i would like to avoid fighting the whole group over a failed blackmail attempt, the noise will probably attract something far more dangerous than a group of Sneasel and frankly i have enough of these caves already, hopefully i won't need to use these caves for awhile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long while<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female watch me intently, then turn her eyes towards Lyrica and notice her claw-like hands on my right shoulder and whisper something to herself. After nearly a minute she answer: \"Sneasel...sne-sel, sel-sel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone seems quite final and Lyrica eyes widen before turning her eyes toward me and wholeheartedly laugh barely a cm from my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica has trouble speaking telepathically without laughing: \"<i>She...she..accept...mmfmfmfmf</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what there is so funny about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica still with a smirk: \"<i>The most precious thing they have Jaden, is......trust</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica smirk deepen: \"<i>Between mates Jaden, she accept your term, if you win you will earn her trust and by that, herself</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWat? <b>WAT?!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! Bu..but..that.  that's ridiculous! I mean...i\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica return somewhat serious but her smile can be hardily hide her amusement: \"<i>The deal are made, no take back now</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI..I...I just thought a gem or something! Of fuck me sideway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy this Constantly happen to ME!? WHYYYYY!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigh, alright calm down, one day i Will get the legendary responsible for all of this and, personally, STRANGLE IT WITH MY BARE HANDS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hate legendary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica with a sensual tone: \"<i>Sooo Master..</i>\" Here we go again: \"<i>How do you intend to claim your newer mate when all this fight thing is done, hmmmm? Granted she is barely a meter tall, but i am sure that she will be able to take most of you in. Maybe you should claim her here, in front of all the other Sneasel so than none may deny your claim on her, Rubica curiosity will surely be satisfied then</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You single-minded crazy..., you know what? Return in your ball\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica with mocking fear: \"<i>Nooooo, please Mas-Jaden, let me assist on your so much difficult fight, i don't want to lose the spectacle...pleaseeee</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should add extremely rare pokemon to the hating list, yes, yes i should, now i can't fight with Lyrica being a dragon type herself would spoil my earlier claim about dragon types, also i don't want to give her the satisfaction of winning this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo either Nysa or Sylvia, i can use Pyrie but they would probably claim it a cheating being her heavily advantaged over them, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release Rubica and chose the ground then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sneasel nod and Rubica is promptly released from having a claw at her neck, then the female choose a small circular field devoid of rock a few meter ahead of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"What this is all about, what the long face? They accepted let's get on with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her curiously, then remind myself that Lyrica speak telepathically so she hasn't heard any of her side of the conversation, nor she knew about ^the prize^, i decide to inform her later and, after giving a glare at a smirking Lyrica, i walk towards the chosen ground for our fight and release..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes she will do.</span></div></div>",

Shakily she got back to her feet. Surrounded by the others she refused any offers of help. Huffing and puffing, she slowly made her way over to you. When she reached you crouched down so you could look her in the eyes. \u201cSneasel snea\u201d she mumbled and grinned slightly before collapsing into your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently you pick her up. \u201cRubica could you grab a hyper potion from my bag?\u201d she nodded and quickly procured the pink spray bottle. \u201cHere\u201d you lay down a blanket for your new Pok\u00e9mon.

No matter, what i am talking about is...well why don't you make an educated guess, Jaden</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to focus my will, a small headache start to crawl up in my brain, but i still decide to persist: \"<i>Can we have a conversation that does not include sex for once? It's really, really start to get annoying Lyrica. Why don't we discuss battle tactics or...our future for example</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache intensity increase, i don't think that i will be ready to use this skill more than a few minutes anytime soon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica amused: \"<i>Well mating is in our future, hopefully a lot of it!

Was Lyrica talking to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache is slowly diminishing, and i already feel my mood improving a little: \"Yes, lewd as always\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica smirk at the now blushing Latias: \"Maybe Vulcan will be able to soothe your desire for a while..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a spike of anger in Lyrica emotions, then a fter a few seconds she speak to me, clearly angry at Rubica: \"<i>Jaden can you recall me please, i am..not feeling too well</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excuse is obvious but i decide to not pry, from her at least: \"Sure thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI change the position of the sleeping Sneasel so that i can keep her up with one hand, then use my freed arm to grip Lyrica ball and recall her in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout turning i ask Rubica: \"I get she didn't appreciate your offer?

I patiently wait a good minute for her to recover<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia in a teasing tone: \"<i>She is asking why you haven't claimed her yet, my Jaden, can't i leave you alone for a few hours that you immediately add another mate to your circle?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy headache is gone but still i fell slightly irritated : \"Sylvia can you please explain to her that this is not the moment? And that she need to be captured in a ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>Oh she already know that, in fact she is technically wild, a Sneasel so close to you and still un-captured, my my Jaden, are you already getting old?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sbuff in her direction: \"Whenever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI delicately try to pry the wild Sneasel from my neck and surprisingly succeed now, then looking in her eyes i say: \"Look we will discuss this later, but you don't have to feel obliged to....you know, anyway i must capture you okay? It's necessary, unless you wish to go free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sneasel shake her head as a no, jump on the ground in front of me and wait;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell easy capture then, i try to remove my back pack but found the action useless as an empty ball float a few centimeter to my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>What are you waiting for, go on! Capture her!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting my teeth i grip the ball in front of me and launch it toward the unresisting Sneasel, that of course get captured in record time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering the ball from the ground i place it on the far left grip on my belt, it will probably remind me to give priority on this one as soon as i reach the center, then i resume walking with a silent Rubica and an overly affectionate Nysa in tow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's not forget a very amused Sylvia at my side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia: \"<i>So when i get some? We mated just once!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica 2 the return, sound bad even in my head. At least i can say that i haven't asked for it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that i believe any of it.</span></div></div>",

The doors slide open as you approach, revealing Joy sitting behind the desk, apparently asleep. \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder if she will be as crazy as the last one\u201d Rubica whispered. You shrug and attempt to wake her \u201cJoy, hey Joy\u201d not receiving a response at all you step up your game \u201cJoy! JOY!\u201d she awakes with a start almost falling out her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear god, what\u2019s going on? Why did you wake me like that? Hmm? Wait, are you Jaden?\u201d taken aback by the rapid-fire questions you only manage to respond to the last. \u201cUh yeah I\u2019m Jaden\u201d suddenly cheerful she leaps from the ground and pulled you into a hug. \u201cOhhh it\u2019s so good to meet you I\u2019ve heard so much from my cousin!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat all have you heard?\u201d \u201cNothing too embarrassing, just that you\u2019re a nice boy with a talent for attracting females.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately that seems to be me.\u201d You sigh \u201cCould we have a pair of rooms? We just got out of the caves and we\u2019re exhausted\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing tiger\u201d Joy giggles as she grabs a pair of keys.

You lay there for a moment before releasing all your Pok\u00e9mon, which you had recalled partway down the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were immediately buried under your team, and wound up trapped on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay, get off me!\u201d slowly they all get off of you but stay on the bed.

It's just.., my cousin told me about your recruitment and how you can be trusted, so i..sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecruitment?

Ever\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy laugh: \"Alright, so are you willing to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually no, but do i really have a choice: \"Can i say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Not sure, perhaps, willing to try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed: \"Next time, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the team relax at my word, Sylvia however seems a little upset about something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy now serious, close the door behind her and lock it: \"We have intel about the lake trio and TS operation, it seems that your little stunt about freeing Latias didn't go unnoticed, don't worry our contacts say that they was unable to identify you or your pokemon, they are however actively seeking to recapture her by any means necessary\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information does not come as a surprise really, i had hoped to conceal her long enough for them to refocus on something else i admit, still<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a Latias anyway?

Well Latias and practically all legendary appertain to the so called Undiscovered group, in theory they are unable to reproduce..BUT\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Latias and Latios clearly reproduce, i get it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Exaclty, so if they are capable of breeding why the other legendary cannot? They firmly believe that they can, and that it's just a matter of finding the right method\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sense, but it simply possible that Latias and Latios are in a whole different group and placing them on Undiscovered was merely a lazy attempt to ^standardize and classify^, after all doesn't people prefer to deal with things that can be schematized and cataloged instead of confronting themselves with the unknown that surround us? Or your- sorry, our supersecret group has anything to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy grin return with vengeance: \"You got the point exactly, yes we have something to do with it, only us and a few others know the truth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let a light chuckle leave my lips: \"What? They can reproduce with human perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy face become deadly serious: \"Some yes\" she point her finger at Latias: \"In the right occasion and with a little push most legendary can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......What-...i don't even...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredulous: \"Sorry, i haven't heard you, what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"You heard me perfectly young man, normally such things don't happen, but in truth, genetically speaking, legendary are super-mutated pokemon and their DNA has some similitude with human one, so with the right cocktail of enzyme it's possible, not certain, that some human, not many really, become compatible with them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am afraid to ask: \"And...perchance..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smiling like a fool: \"I haven't the slightest idea! Maybe, truth is we are not sure what are the genetic marker that identify a compatible human by on that is not, as you may have guessed we a re short on subject so, meh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh? Now that's a scientifically sound answer: \"Fuck it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smirking: \"Didn't you have her already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPissed: \"Out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Sorry, anyway we think that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted what? Fuck Lyrica till she got pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy uncomfortable: \"Probably, by both human and pokemon, look like you saved her just in time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI like TS more and more, on a pike of course: \"But if legendary reproduce-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Shouldn't be many around? Or at least more then one? Well yes, and there are, sort of. We think that when a legendary reproduce a new type of pokemon came out, or a new type of legendary, for example we know for sure that Victini is Mew child, and that Hydreigon are as a species anciently descend from Rayquaza, there are a few more, but we are uncertain of those\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnzyme?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..see, why an Enzyme would be needed tough? It's natural right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Curious? Well yes, i admit to not know much about it, but yes it's supposed to be natural, extracted for a combination of plant or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doubt surge in my head: \"Lyrica, can you give us any enlightenment on the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica suddenly appear nervous and very interested in the floor, then unconvincingly: \"<i>No?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will talk about this, another day, now let me guess Joy, a TS member is here and i must flush him out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"No, not this time anyway, we heard rumor about a strange pokemon not far from here who's description strikingly resemble Mesprit, it could be a Mismagius hunt but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply confused:\"Mismagius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy with an obvious tone: \"You know, they are tricky little bastard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTricky little bastard?: \"I sense a story behind it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy annoyed: \"Next time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, where exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"South of here, on the White Mesa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy notice my expression and answer: \"After the ^Event^ the city of Oreburgh was mostly destroyed, the ground where the ruins of the old city remained proved stable enough so most of the old citizen decided to reconstruct their home here, they also kept the old name. We are in what we can call New Oreburgh but officially the name is just Oreburgh City, just like before. The Withe Mesa just appeared during the Event, at the beginning we thought that a mountain of rock would have buried us all, but in the end the the creation of the Mesa it's all that happened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? Was you here before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"Yes i decided to remain here, it was my original post after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust have been quite the scare: \"Thanks Joy, ill check soon as possible, after a little rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smile and unlock the door, after letting herself out she simply say: \"Alright, let me know when you are ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a day of peace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team doesn't look tired, more bored actually<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright team, i go get a shower then we decide what to do, we need more training if we wish to defeat the next gym, also i must be careful with you Lyrica, no more public or official fight until i know it's safe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica is not happy with my decision, but it must be so.</span></div></div>",

She can get free sex whenever she want with such excuse, pfffff, slut</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop the towel on the ground, not even caring about it's dirty fate, then proceed inside the bathtub and promptly turn the wall shower on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegulating the right temperature take more than a few attempts, it's seems that i have already nearly exhaust this room boiler reserve, after the temperature is set i seat and try to relax<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the time to close my eyes a moment that Pyrie jump on me and immediately start rubbing her sex over my partially aroused member, no rest for the wicked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the lack of any rest Pyrie surely know how to arouse a male, with her small needy whine and her pleasuring movement she definitely has a lot of practice on the matter, a thing that not necessarily make you happy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy organ raise fully from it's partial slumber in no time thanks to Pyrie ministrations and, deciding that at this point your excitement won't let you back down easily anyway, i surprise Pyrie by impaling her when she least expect it and causing her to nearly jump from the sudden pleasure coursing through her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sex is exactly as i remember it, hot, not too tight and her cervix let my head reach her inner sanctuary with incredible ease, despite the pleasure i can't not worry for her no matter what crazy Joy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift my sexually addicted partner until my tip barely touch her lower lips, then without warning slam her down all the way. This time i can clearly feel my tip touching her womb with still length to spare, Pyrie however seems lost in bliss as i start to mate her hard and rough, i like the feeling of her pulsing walls on my member, but i am doing this mostly for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy previous encounter left me with more sexual endurance to spare, an advantage that this time i have no intention to exploit, on the contrary i need to finish this quick or i will have to wait tomorrow for doing nearly anything else and i don't what to that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot mentioning getting my team in the mood, definitely something i rather avoid at the moment. Maybe ever<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hips rhythm quickly increase and become frenzied trying to push myself to the limit as quickly as possible, and my effort give it's fruit.....i think 5 minutes later, my still limited experience and my decision to solve this faster then normally possible has surely influenced the final result<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrie has stopped moaning when my frenzy started and instead simply breath with her mouth open and her eyes unfocused, then finally her insides actually become a vice as she recover her voice and scream her name hard enough to be heard outside the room, then as my release came soon after hers she just freeze as my seed fill her womb and slowly flow outside her clenching tunnel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a minute to recover fully from my exertion before removing Pyrie from my lap, her lower lips still dripping my essence and her look while now focused, clearly tired<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't really feel satisfied with this second session but i don't want to lose too much time right now, hopefully our next time will be more....dignifying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the still temperate water i wash us both, and with clean towels dry our body quickly and efficiently. My team rejoice when we both get out of the bathroom and the first ting to caught my attention are the awkward position every one of my pokemon is, their sudden interest with the ceiling is also worthy of note i presume<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's add voyeurs to the list of my team skill then, hopefully i will find use for such skill in the future<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, not even i believe that.</span></div></div>",

Jaden you need to go there and see about Mesprit, if she is there I believe she will reveal herself to you. And if TS has her, destroy them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Flashback<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the cliff you can see no path or any such way to get to the top. After several attempts to climb and several bruises and a skinned knee, Sylvia pops out of her ball and levitates the pair of you to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I never thought of that\u201d you hug Sylvia \u201cThank you\u201d Smiling contentedly she kisses you on the cheek and prepares for the search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the Mesa has a bunch of trees and a large pond, making a good imitation of a plains area.  Let\u2019s start near the pond, Mesprit used to live near a lake, maybe she still does.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m psychic remember?\u201d she says in your head \u201cI can search this whole area in a millisecond\u201d silently you berate yourself for not remembering that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia closes her eyes and glows for a second, before speaking telepathically: \u201cThere is a large group of Team Shadow about a mile to the north, they are in pursuit of something that is blocked from my powers, I can\u2019t tell what it is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably Mesprit, let\u2019s go! Sylvia Teleport!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of light you vanished and reappeared behind a group of trees from where you could clearly see TS. They were all grouped around one grunt, which had what appeared to be a thermal camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunt: \u201cOkay I\u2019ve got a fix!\u201d he points off to the left \u201cIt\u2019s over there!\u201d \u201cSylvia\u201d you whisper \u201ccan you confuse them? Like really badly?\u201d giggling maliciously her eyes glow for a second and you can see that suddenly all the grunts are staring at one point above their heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see this and grin with her \u201cThis is gonna be too easy\u201d releasing Pyrie and Nysa you come out from behind the tree and shout \u201cFire Blast, Hydro Pump!\u201d your pokemon ,side by side release a huge combined attack. Spreading over a large area, the water and flames cleared a swath of the grunts leaving them with burns and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the grunts slowly were able to draw themselves out of whatever dream Sylvia put them in. \u201cNysa, remember the battle with Sneasel?\u201d she grins remembering the combination you had thought up. \u201cMist, Go!\u201d spewing forth a large volume of dense fog she soon hides all the grunts from view. In the fog you can hear the grunts murmuring, and you laugh a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have no idea what\u2019s coming. Ice beam!\u201d Nysa fires the blast of freezing energy into the center of the fog, freezing the water in the air coating everything in range with ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fog no longer clouding your vision you could see that most of the grunts were frozen in such a way that they couldn\u2019t move. You smile watching them struggle. \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting out until you thaw!\u201d you shout jovially \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201d \u201cDammit kid when I get out of here!\u201d \u201cSylvia, confusion\u201d she smiled and her eyes glowed green, moments later the grunts were all sprawled about unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d you hear a whisper in your mind \u201cthey have been after me for days, I didn\u2019t want to reveal myself to them, but thanks to you I won\u2019t have to!\u201d you look around wildly \u201cWhere are you, who are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m right here, and my name is Mesprit\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am becoming like sister Uxie.....nahhahahaha. She is rubbing off me, must...eh...resist</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe assume what i can only describe as an intense expression of deep concentration, or at least as a 10 year old would do in such cases anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later she return normal, her tone is normal now, adult even: \"<i>Much better, i should seriously stop mulling so much, now human, as i have said i can't really explain emotion to you, i am sure that in your young life, you have surely felt many emotions since your birth and they varies as much as the person that feel them do</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake sense i guess, a very logical explanation i must say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit tone become deadly serious now, no more trace of the childish personality she exhibited before \"<i>No matter what your life will force upon you emotion and not all of them i had pleasure in making, but i had to, i never wanted human or pokemon to suffer and grieve, but those emotion too are necessary.

Aren't we know as the lake trio?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know as pokemon yes, your gender however is-was a matter of debate\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit look curiously at me: \"<i>Does human has nothing better to do that speculate on famous pokemon gender?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! absolutely\" suddenly i remember the various pokemon professor around the world:\"....ok, some may do that, sometimes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appear amused: \"<i>Hhmhmhm, why brother will be sooooo happy to hear that, hmhmhm. Anyway</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit look intensively at Lyrica for a few seconds, then suddenly she blush and start to use her paw as a fan: \"<i>Fiuw, that was something, even for me</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me: \"<i>Your mate has quite the feelings for you, many are about love....many more are about passion, there are some strange feelings too, can't understand them fully, perhaps she is unsure about something</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two part didn't surprise me, but the last, not sure what could it be. Maybe that discussion about herbs with Joy? Hopefully not, my life is complicated enough as it is, and if the rumor are true i don't want to sire a new species of pokemon in case Zekrom is serious about...that: \"Oh, i am sure it will solve itself in time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit doesn't look convinced but: \"<i>Alright it's your family, your call. So, i have answered some of your question at the best of my ability, for now at least, how about reverse our role for a while?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredicable, well ok let's see: \"What do you wish to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did you like breeding your pokemon?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly fall to the ground while Lyrica and Sylvia laugh like mad: \"Pff, wha...EH!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's a pretty simple answer to give, yes or no</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...but...YOU SHOULDN'T ASK SUCH THINGS! It's..it's you just shouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I feel embarrassment from you, why? It's natural wanting to express your love in a physical manner, i just asked if you like what you feel when you mate with them, if you like it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT answering That!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit pout: \"<i>Oh well fine, don't then. Let's see, hmmmm, is common?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have an idea of what she is talking about, i am still uncomfortable answering such kind of question but, she did answer mine, in a sense: \"Somewhat, it's a sort of gray area really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to understand what i mean: \"<i>Have you ever met another legendary before?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i have, beside the pseudo-legendary Lyrica here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica: \"<i>Hey!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have met Zekrom in...curious circumstances, we helped each other in a sense.

Meet a legendary too? Impressive</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed: \"They aren't mine, they are my mates and lovers, not objects that i use and then put away in their balls. I thought that the pokemon of emotion would have more tact when discussing about her own species\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit smile: \"<i>Not exactly my species, but yes you have right.</i>\" Her smile increase dramatically: \"<i>You know, Mewtwo would been Very happy to meet one such as you, despite the power already in your command, you keep a level head and respect your trainees or family in your case, yes you definitely would be a good candidate..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't like how she told me that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe even better my dear friend Ray or the young Kleedy, why it would be perfect</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh i am just ranting, ignore me</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnore me my boots, time to leave, oh right, one last thing: \"I Really, Really need to go now, but can i talk to your brother and sister? Another day of course, i want to know what TS are planning and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But of course, we owe you a favor now, sister will probably know about TS plan but she tend to be a little, how to say it, absent sometimes, like me she will not be able to tell you much, but you are welcome to try. Brother can probably give your resolve a little boost so to speak</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit smile childishly again: \"<i>Just continue north, we will meet you at Crystal Lake after defeating the gym, don't be loooooong!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she vanish in a flash of purplish light<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.......................\"Will i ever find a sane legendary?

Did i lost it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing my hand on the back of my neck i try to stimulate the muscle there in a vain attempt to remember where could i have lost that damn key, not that doing so is actually helping but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy team already rest in their balls and i decide to let them be, beside i don't think that any of them knew where the key could be anyway: \"Ok, let's recap, i had it when i returned here to the center so...maybe it's slipped off when i was eating, hopefully it's still there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around i return to the stairs and slowly walk down, Joy already got enough amusement from me today, no need to add absent-minded to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy slow pace give me an unexpected advantage, i am nearly completely silent, an unintentional advantage turned out i needed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly at the end of the stairs i hear Joy voice speaking with a faint voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Yes he is here......no i don't know what he found he seems diffident, expected really after what he found in his last raid</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to remain as quite as possible as i finish to descend the last steps, making my presence as thin as possible with my back on the wall<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy: \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">I already told you, i don't know! He don't want to tell, he just mentioned Chrystal Lake....yes i believe so.......not sure but our plan...no, no i can't my cover is already stretched thin as it is, if i do that....well maybe.....are you serious?! His team, especially that Latias watch him like an hawk! Let's not even speak about that Kadabra, her power value are off the chart......I'll try but i don't think....hello? Hello? Damn him!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear Joy throwing something on the ground, then the noise of a chair being occupied: \"Bastard, i would like to see him trying that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear her exhale, she is obviously stressed. I wait another minute and hearing nothing else, i carefully return upstairs and as quietly as possible reach the end of the corridor. There i grip Lyrica ball and release her keeping the ball in hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica appear before me happy as ever, especially when she notice no pokemon nor human beside us: \"<i>Hello Jaden, i was just thinking about you...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt, with the most serious tone i can master : \"Lyrica listen, Joy was speaking with someone about us, i am not sure what it was all about. I don't trust her Lyrica and i am not sure if we a re even safe here so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jaden calm down, what is it all about? What Joy said?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI calm down: \"Lyrica, can you really turn invisible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica look at me confused: \"<i>For a time, sure, what do you wish me to do?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to go down in the hall and seek the key to our room, and if possible try to understand what Joy has in mind\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica nod: \"<i>I'll try</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica close her eyes, her red coat slowly become transparent and completely vanish before me. I have heard about the Lati ability to become invisible but, seeing it first hand-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tongue enter my unclosed mouth, the unexpected sensation make me pull back and stumble as Lyrica head try to press forward at my quick reaction. Falling on my ass i hear a giggle in the air and as a small breeze pass at my side<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain seated like a fool for a few moments<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have know\"</span></div></div>",

As it processed your smell it began to smile in a way that put you on edge. \"well I'm going to try to sleep\" sitting down you lean against the wall and shut your eyes. Almost immediately you felt a pressure on your shoulder. Opening one eye you see that Marowak was leaning against you. Being as tired as you were, you decided against asking it to move, so you closed your eyes and shuffled a little lower. Soon with the surprisingly soothing heartbeat of the Pokemon laying on you you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat feels like a few hour later you feel something fumbling with your belt. You sit up surprising the Marowak who had been pulling on your pants. \"Wak?\" it questioned. \"What are you doing?\" you mumbled wiping sleep from your eyes. Murring quietly the Marowak stood up facing away from you and bent over forward. Immediately you drop your head and sigh \"What the fuck is with the female Pokemon?\"  you shake your head and say \"no\" not dissuaded she (as she obviously was) crawled onto your lap and began massaging your crotch. Gently, you move her off shaking your head. Even more determined now, she sits in your lap facing you and grinds her hips against yours. She grins as she feels you harden through your pants. Once again you try to move her but she wil have none of it. As your hands get close she slaps them away. Her face moves closer and closer to yours untill your foreheads touch and she stands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she grabs your belt and yanks insistantly. \"Dammit\" you grumble as you pull of the belt. \"I'm not going to get any sleep am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n with a girlish giggle, Marowak manages to remove your pants, leaving you with only boxers. \"Wak\" she mumbled as she grabbed the waist of your boxers and pulled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your manhood now revealed, Marowak decides to...</span></div></div>",

I wanted to tell her to \"stop you don't really want this!\", but i soon realize that not only she Want this, but also i am not so sure anymore that I don't want to mate with her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak having placed herself on my cock, spread her dark-brown lips wide and impale herself slowly all the way down. Despite her small size, her vent is not as tight as i have expected, and definitively quite colder then any other..experience i had<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy partner vocally express her approval of our union and while the experience is quite pleasant, it doesn't even compare with Pyrie or Sylvia. Deciding that i had enough i forcefully grab the now distracted, and quite willing pokemon flanks with both hand, force her down on her back,  start to fucking her as it should by pushing myself as deep as i can go trying to force away her last barrier, pull back until just the tip is in and then reenter her without pause<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild pokemon under me now try to scream in pleasure and i found myself force to use an hand to shut her up, as a side effect the Marowak start to lick my fingers as i fuck her silly. Rubica seem unaware of my twilight activity and i rather keep it that way, and now things are getting worse as she use her small paw to secure my hand where they grabbed her, not permitting me to remove them and totally abandon herself to our mating<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tepid insides are incapable of stimulating me much but i appreciate the evident effort, also i quicken my thrust as i want to conclude this diversion fast, eliciting even more frequent moan of pleasure from her. Probably due to my unwillingness to lengthen this quickie, mostly, i feel myself coming and not even try to hold back, i release inside the wild Marowak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her and my orgasm, she still doesn't let me remove my hands from her, instead she get up and place herself on all four and lift her small tail, inviting me to take her once more by exposing her not yet completely closed sex still dripping my seed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly tempted by her offer i feel myself becoming again aroused, and now more then willing to finish her off, my member return to an acceptable condition and i waste no time in returning in her tepid embrace. Differently from before i am now only driven by lust and the will to subjugate the female under me, so my thrust are hard and deep uncaring about speed right now, with the only objective in mind to push myself in her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her limited size reaching and ramming her cervix is an easy thing, her strong body is resisting my assault for now, so i decide to redouble my effort by using all my weight to achieve my goal and nearly two minute later i finally succeed. Expecting a grunt of pain from my dominated partner, instead i found myself silencing her strongest moan of pleasure since the beginning of our union as my the head of my cock fully enter her womb and the tip release some more precum on her sensitive uterine walls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarowak came under me as i relentlessly continue my attack on her body and will, her walls are unable to bring me to my peak until her second orgasm belly down. There i release what i have left for the day directly inside her supersensitive womb, painting her inner sanctum flesh withe and filling the space left empty from my previous release with this one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i fully recover my senses from my double effort, i notice that the pokemon under me has fallen in a tired sleep with me still inside her. Removing my cock delicately from her womb, i feel her cervix seal closed again as i slowly retire my member, forcing most of my donation to remain inside her small chamber even as i left her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing her weight i decide to drag as gently as possible, her body near the wall where i Should have slept and quickly clean what i can from her rapidly closing lips. After having finished my work and apparently having paid for our stay, i seat next to my most recent sexual partner and try to catch a few hours of sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my lack of faith on the matter, i unexpectedly succeed</span></div></div>",

She was here before we were\" you finish your berry and stand up. \"C'mon we should go\" you grab your bag and re-pack your equipment. As you hefted I onto your back you noticed Marowak had awoken and was getting up. \"Wak?\" she looked curiously at you. Running forward she grabbed your waist and hugged you tightly. \"Wak!\" she mumbled looking at you pleadingly. \"Wow you can't even go a single night in the wild without getting fucked can you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody asked you Rubica!\" you growl. crouching down to her eye level, you run her heeck with your thumb eliciting a small giggle. \"If you want you could come with us, I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this her eyes light up and she buries her head in your chest. \"Marowak maro!\" she jumps forward knocking you on your ass and kisses you her tongue going straight into your mouth.

The end result was her waiting for you at some points. \"Slow down!\" you gasp as she jumps further ahead. \"Snea!\" she taunted, standing on a large boulder above you.  You scrabble the final few feet to her and pull yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments rest, Rubica appeared over the edge. \"Nice of you to join us Ruby\" she merely grunted as she heaved herself onto the ledge. You both catch your breath, with some difficulty on your part, as it can be rather difficult to breathe with a Sneasel attempting to makeout with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relent and allow her a short kiss, which she takes full advantage of, sliding her cold tongue along your lips, seeking entrance. With some amount of dissapointment you pull her off you and set her in your lap. \"So why did you lead us up here?\" she points further up the mountain to where you can partially see a cave. \"Up there? In the cave?\" she nods, confirming your fears. \"I hate caves\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later you were standing at the entrance to the cave. From the mouth you couldn't see anything but after Mistra darted in you followed, not wanting her to cause any trouble. \"Mistra! Where are you?\" you turn a corner and nearly have a heart attack. Right there around the corner was none other than Zekrom! Sitting immediately around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden! It's nice to see you\" she looks down and sees Mistra. \"A new 'Mate'?\" you sigh \"If you must know then yes, yes she is\" \"Zekrom who is he?\" a new voice echoes. \"This, dear sister, is Jaden. He is the one who helped destroy a Team Shadow base while I was searching for you.\" \"oh so that is the illustrious Jaden. My sister speaks very highly of you\" from the shadows, a large figure emerges. Mostly grey, and partially covered in ice she made for a very powerful looking dragon. \"I am Kyurem, dragon of the ice\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden! Jaden! Where are you?\" Rubica shouts as she turns the corner. When she saw the two legendary dragons together, right in front of her, she paused for a moment before she fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she alright?\" Zekrom asked \"Umm, yeah, I think\"</span></div></div>",

There is a reason behind it or Arceus was just in the mood for pranking..me..naaah: \"How did you find her btw, did i have helped you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hahahaha, yes Jaden, i didn't know if i could really trust you at the time so i may have..forgot to mention something i have found before leaving</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI understand, i don't like having important information concealed from me but, i understand: \"Was something important? For me i mean, something i could use against Team Shadow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyurem reach her sister side and join our conversation respectfully: \"<i>Why do you wish for this group defeat? What are your stake in this?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice/dragon let her suspicion transpire from beneath her words, again i don't blame them, and just as i am about to explain Zekrom intervene: \"<i>Sister, Jaden here is a trusted friend, do not worry about his action or his reasons, they are pure and honest as they could be</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....That..was unexpected, how did she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sister you can't be serious, i can understand giving him some measure of trust, but this much? Wasn't you to always reminding me to never trust humans? That they are greedy creature interested only in their own gain?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that hurt, i admit that people like TS are quite aplenty, but not all human are evil or greedy monster ready to kill their own mother for profit, i meet a few but..common? No, not that much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom take my defense once more: \"<i>I haven't changed my mind sister.

Some human has Attempted to capture me, to enslave me to their will, but ultimately failed. However in my brief travels i have also found humans openly helping me in my quest, offering me their healing bottles or simply giving me information about your probable location. Many humans disapprove of Team Shadow method sister, and many trainers do not want to enslave us, they merely wish to challenge our strength, something that we pokemon understand very well</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I...sorry sister, i just..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I understand, do not let those painful events to condition your future, despair is their greatest power, do not let them use it against you, against us, sister</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyurem seems to accept Zekrom advice and lower herself to the ground, the conflict in her emotion can be felt from here, what those bastard did to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I do not know Jaden, but if they wish to live it's better for them that i never discover it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have been surprised by the electric dragon ability to read my thoughts, but frankly after our last encounter and Lyrica teasing, i have learned to ignore it and consider the whole thing as normal, sort of: \"Can i help her somehow? Maybe..no, sorry, of course i can't, it's my very form that unnerve her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my eyes fixed on the sad ice dragon, but i still can feel a spark of happiness coming from Zekrom: \"<i>Do not trouble yourself with fault that are not yours dear Jaden, i can feel the anger in you, and i discovered their full involvement in what you human call ^The Catastrophe^. It was a sad day for us all</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Damn sure it was</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah yes Jaden, there is a thing i would like to speak you about</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind snap in action as soon as i hear her words, her curious tone remeber me that i too have question for her: \"Of course, can you answer a few of mine in exchange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gladly, do you wish to begin?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes if you don't mind\" I take a good breath, asking her what i am gonna ask take guts, and hopefully such part of me will remain where they are: \"Why female pokemon are so...drawn by me? Just last night a Marowak practically throw herself at me! Molesting me until i finally gave up and mate her. It's a legendary that has done this to me or..or..i don't know!

Jaden you have what you human call the mark, a rare gift that permit you to mate with a legendary and successfully reproduce, it's something that Team Shadow has uselessly try to obtain for years and utterly failed</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...what the..eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know what give them such ideas Jaden, but Arceus did Not created the human species, it only created us, in it's original plan we should have, in time, become a single species with many difference, fusing together our strength and your cunning, our resilience and yours intelligence. We should have become one, conquered the stars together until time would have reach it's end</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell fuck, not sure i like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I do not know what happened, only that something changed, i think that your species evolved too quickly, ignoring the law of nature that we pokemon has learned to respect, and carved your own path among the sea of destiny. I admit that i have always admired such ability, evolving by will instead that by the law that others have placed upon us. But i digress, as i was saying the original plan failed so, Arceus devised a clever trick to permit us pokemon to quicken our growth, live in close contact with human as we could, all of us in our own way</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take that plan too gone to shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling Zekrom continue: \"<i>Mphf, not exactly, in truth Arceus merely forgot that not all of us have the drive that has pushed it forward, to fuel it desire of one glorious species. Most of us just want to live our own life without it or who for it, meddle in our affair. So in a sense, yes, that plan too didn't fully succeed. But Arceus may be a little..how do you call it..out of the loop sometimes, but certainly not stupid, and definitely not willing to repeat the same mistake twice</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am gonna get a great revelation aren't i? At this point the idea of being a random result of a series of lucky event would have done it for me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo probably not, but i had to think of something less serious for Arc-, fuck it i am not saying it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So he as a contingency, Arceus with the help of a few others like Mew, created a few ^artifact^ capable of storing a minor quantity of it powers and release a very specific mutation in it's possessor blood, something that would have insured it's children future when the time arrive</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood? It means our DNA? What the fuck give him the right-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>None Jaden, none give him the right to do such a thing, and it's that why he asked for us legendary, it most precious children's, to find volunteers willing to make such changes. As you may now have guessed Jaden, one of your ancestor volunteered, and now that the time is right the ^changes^ in your...DNA you called it? Manifest in all their..hmm, glory, i know it may not seems like it Jaden, but as i have already said, you are gifted</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....adding another thing to my hate-list....ancestor:\"So my gift is what? Fucking pokemon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused: \"<i>Not pokemon in general Jaden, your gift is being a perfect, within reason, mate for a certain number of us legendaries, the attraction that more common pokemon has for for you is merely accidental, a side effect if you want</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They..don't really like me? I am just..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No nonono Jaden, no, don't even think about it, that changes it's what made you what you are. Jaden you are human not an hybrid or something in between, you are a human with a...an edge if you want, nothing more</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight a fucking mutant, when i get my hands on IT i..why it anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Arceus has no gender, it want it want to be, just like Mew, although Mew seems to like being female for some reason, just like Rayquaza chosen to being male instead, just so</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You..chosen to be female?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, only a few of us could chose, not sure why, maybe it's a matter of blood- ah, DNA, maybe we are compatible only with a specific...traits? That are typically male, my guess at least</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have a lot to think about<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom suddenly become nervous: \"<i>Take your time, and i know it may seems rushed but....will you consider me or/and us as..potential mate?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean i can have more then one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You will have to chose Jaden, eventually. Us or another compatible legendary on your travels, i can't and don't want to force your decision, we can't but we may still..tempt you</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.............Here we go, well at least i have now chosen My goal as a trainer. Killing Arceus in the most painfully way possible. Also don't we need that enzyme to become compatible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes we do, and i don't think It can't be killed</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPissed i reply: \"We will see about that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside torture has it's merit no?

The clouds open as in kneeling at the display of power<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs That her signature move? Shit that Fusion Bolt could easily level a not so small village! Definitely as big as home at least.

Her saliva has a strange, nearly addicting flavor that drag me in, making me unable to focus anymore. Zekrom remove her muzzle from mine and walk back a few meters.

I get so close to her that i can feel her body heat, but still unsatisfied i reach for her sex with my hands and part her lips, revealing her healthy bluish insides to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of her pheromones strike me straight on my nose exciting me even further: \"<i>Yes my mate, explore me, know me.....use me</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of my mind, i know that she is using me, i know that while her intentions are genuine, she must be desperate for a mate. How old she really is? Hundreds? How many i wonder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands move on their on as find myself playing with her lips, trying to figure it out where or if, she even has a clitoris. After a good minute of exploration i find none, curious i slip my right fingers inside, finding her lips eagerly parting away at my intrusion, and using my left to touch the small hole under her tail with she purring softly all the while<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>N-naughty masterrr, t-hat  ah! too?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering my left hand i push my fingers inside her quite hot and moist sex, lubricating my fingers, then i return to stimulate her undertail, this time pushing a finger inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah! N--not there! Mast- Ah!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy exploration is suddenly interrupted by a loud screech outside and a thunder landing at the mouth of our cave<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jump back, the loud noise break the spell i am under, losing my balance i fall on my ass. Zekrom get up, lowering her tail and letting out a menacing growl toward the mouth of the cave, the shimmering light of before return, in less then half minute she return to her original height<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screech return with vengeance as another thunder, stronger then the last, land exactly where the last one did, scorching the ground black. Rubica run towards me and grip Sally ball ready to launch it if needed. Mistra place herself in front of me ready to fight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud boom echo inside the cave, and only now i notice Kyurem has reached our side and got in what i recognize to be a combat stance. The figure that forcefully landed a second ago, enter the cave without even pausing to see who is inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the creature it's a few meters from me and i see it clearly, i recognize it's unique yellow, spiky plumage as one of the legendary bird, Zapdos<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's form is a lot more unified and a lot less spiky then i remember having seen in the books, much more pleasing to the eye, attracting even....oh fuck not again! Bad thoughts bad thoughts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapdos look in our direction, using it's keen eyes to discover any meaningful detail this empty cave could give. When it sight reach my form, stop. It's unnerving being looked down by such creature, i have the feeling that the legendary is literally giving me a full x-ray scan, no part of me is safe under it's gaze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bird of lighting surprise me by speaking in my head, all of us i think: \"<i>Greetings oh gifted one, i have come to extend my regards</i> The voice is..guess it..female, damn. She look at Zekrom like she would do to a worm: <i>And assure your wellbeing in the presence of this, unworthy tealight that dares define herself Lightning</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that i recovered from my drunken state, i can easily pick up a certain tension it the air, literally considering what my hairs are doing. My near-was-be-mate growl and get closer to the legendary bird: \"<i>He will and is, safer with me that it would ever be with you, useless sparky plug</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch, they must not be exactly in good terms i wager<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud boom signal that another visitor come to keep us company. The creature slowly enter the cave, it's blue plumage make it easy to recognize<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno the bird of Ice, majestic and beautiful. Her sweet, calm voice forcefully enter the conversation : \"<i>Calm down Zapy, no reason to get angry, we have reached the candidate just in time</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapdos do not even turn or acknowledge the other legendary in the slightest, keeping the death-glare focused on Zekrom: \"<i>I have all the reason to angry, Arty, this..unworthy slut nearly seduced him to mate with her, BEFORE He knew all he must. I knew she didn't, it was never her method to play by the rules</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno slowly get closer to me, Kyurem seems nervous but do not stop her advance.

Lightning arcs across her body as she prepared her attack. <i>\"I'd take your own advice you slut\"</i> Zapdos snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! Stop\" you yell. With a roar, Zekrom launches herself at the lightning bird. Colliding with Zapdos, Zekrom forced her out of the cave and into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the mouth of the cave and see the two floating in the sky. <i> \"I will make you pay!\"<i> Zekrom roared. Several bolts of lightning converged in her palms, before shooting toward Zapdos. Flicking them away with one of her wings, Zapdos fired off several bolts of her own all of which we'd redirected into the sky. As the battle continued, you felt helpless rage over the fact that they were fighting over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit I have to stop this!\" <i>\"I'm afraid there's not much you could do.\"</i> Articuno said as she stood watching the two electric types fight. <i>\"they have always been this way.

Rummaging through your bag, you come up with two pokeballs. Gripping one in each hand, you curse Arceus once again for doing all this, before you throw the balls with all your might. One conected with Zekrom, and the other with Zapdos. Both the legendaries were contained for a second before the balls shattered releasing them once. They hadn't been captured, but that had never been your intention. You had hoped that by trying to catch them you would draw all their attention to yourself. Huffing and puffing the two legends descended to the ledge whee you stood with Articuno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Jaden I'm sorry, I won't lose my temper like that again\"</i> Zekrom said. She got down on her knees and looked you I. The eyes.<i>\"please don't hate me\"</i> she almost whimpered. Zapdos landed beside her. <i>\"I would also like to apologize for my behavior\"<i> she bowed low<i>\"I beg your forgiveness.\"</i>with both them nearly begging, you couldn't take it any more. \"I forgive both of you, just- shit!\" Before you could finish your statement<br>\r\n Zekrom grabbed you and held you to her chest. <i>\"Thank you\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can put me dow-MPH!\" You were cut off once again by the electric dragon, this time by her tongue invading your mouth. Unable to resist, and not sure you want, to you struggle weakly for a moment. Before giving in and kissing back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you can see Zapdos seething quietly, and decide to even things out a little. Twisting your shoulders you slip out of Zekrom's grip and stride over to Zapdos. \"I don't believe we've been properly introduced. I'm Jaden, Pokemon trainer, and gifted human\" somewhat taken aback Zapdos thinks for a moment before coming up with a response. <i>\"I am Zapdos, one of the three legendary birds, and I am a candidate for mateship.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, lets go inside, it looks like it might rain.\"</i></i></i></i></span></div></div>",

Giratina was banished and the boy...Arceus rules was clear, not even it could force a human to chose a mate if he didn't wanted to, nor to do anything for us. He disown Arceus and all it represented for banishing his true love. He declared his hate for all of us, especially for Groudon that at the time, did everything only for vexation. He left us, despite his affinity with other legendary, he knew that Groudon provoked Giratina, Arceus too admitted it's mistake, but he....didn't wanted to hear anything more from it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom: \"<i>Groudon was isolated for her mistake, Giratina become a shadow of the noble creature she once was. Anger and darkness consumed her, and while Arceus could banish her in the distortion realm, that world was still her domain. She was trapped in, but she could still cut us all off from her realm if she wished, remove herself from the circle and abandon her duty to the world. And she did.

We lost 3 lives that day</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno: \"<i>For avoiding any other incident of similar nature, Arceus decided to divide us based on a logic we still don't fully understand, i believe that it did it using our blood as a distinction marker, by type or something like that, it never told us</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapdos: \"<i>We was divided by groups, different group had different objectives to achieve, but all of us had a common goal, if we wanted to</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting mated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno chuckle: \"<i>Something like that, we later discovered that candidates was often compatible with different group that shared similar blood, similar affinities</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it put you all in a kind of competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapdos: \"<i>Something like that, our objective was sometime directly opposite one another, we think that it wanted us to prove ourselves to our potential mate, what he or she liked more between similar but different elements</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno: \"<i>It passed so long that we forgot what it mean coexisting peacefully, and soon it become a competition with a mate as a prize</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't work together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom: \"<i>We can, but after century of working one against one another we become resentful with members of opposite groups and, some of us still don't want to even hear the term collaboration or peace.

It bother me how Arceus has forced it's children to become something more akin to whore then, the maybe not-so-noble-but-still better than this for sure, legendary, noble creature, whatever<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am feeling like when mother brought me with for the first time at the market, browsing what merchandise she found more appealing. Maybe Arceus is right, there are many legendaries with similar power and sometimes even roles, what better then a competition for choosing who appeal you the most. It's just...not really cruel after all similar things happen everyday in the wild but....it still somehow disturb me. Also did Really Lyrica or even Sylvia loves me? Or it's just the ^side effect^ Zekrom told me about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in my thinking i didn't even notice Kyurem coming closer until she speak to me: \"<i>Jaden?

Damn i am gonna find myself with some very powerful mates, ready to do anything for me, And at the same time i will be forced to turn down someone else, probably just as powerful.

I find curious the existence of such path, but after the meeting with Zapdos and the others, the details of our voyage become uninteresting to me.

We could use some rest, and a shower.\" You run your hand through your hair with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I DO need a shower\" you chuckle \"And a bed would be great.\" Sylvia's voice rings in your head <i>\"lets get a bed Jaden! We can have some personal time\"</i> \"well Sylvia has voted, to the Pokemon center!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open into the lobby, revealing a few people sitting around, browsing the shelves, or playing with their Pokemon. Joy sat at her desk reading a book. As you walked in she looked up and called out to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you Jaden and Rubica?\" Rubica:\"Yeah that's us\" \"Let me guess\" you interject \"you've heard about us from the other Joys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes and no, my cousin did call and tell me that you might me here in a few weeks. Buuuuut I heard on the news that a trainer named Jaden's Abra evolved and nearly destroyed a Pokemon gym.\" \"Oh wow, that hit the news? I'm not sure if that's awesome or horrible. Anyways could we get a couple rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a smile she handed you a pair of keys. You toss one to Rubica and head for the stairs. As you reach the landing you get the feeling someone is watching you. You look back over your shoulder to see that several people were staring intently at you. \"Um can I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man of about thirty stands up\"Was that true? Did your Pokemon nearly destroy a gym?\" \"Yeah it's true, but the circumstances were a little, unusual\" apparently not satisfied he continues \"unusual how?\" \"Life threateningly unusual, now I'm going to my room. Please don't bother me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your room opens with a click. Dragging your feet, you walk inside, close the door and collapse onto the bed. \"Arceus I'm so tired\" you moan. Sluggishly you open all your pokeballs, allowing your Pokemon to pile on you for a while, and just relax. All too soon however someone knocks on your door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?!\" You untangle yourself from the dog pile and throw open the door. Rubica:\"Hello Jaden, angry much?\" \"Sorry, I thought you were one of those people from the lobby.\" \"It's alright you have been under a lot of stress. Anyways I came over because Sally wanted to see you.\" She placed a pokeball in your hand and left, closing the door behind you. \"Wait, why would she keep her in the ball? Why not just let her out?\" You mull it over for a second 'would she do something like that? What is in this pokeball? Is it Sally or is it something else?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you were over thinking it, you press the button and drop the ball hoping for the best. Fortunately your paranoia is misplaced as Sally is the only thing to emerge from the ball. \"Mence! Salemence!\" She exclaims as she leaps onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you now on the floor she begins her aggressive exploration of the inside of your mouth. Despite your surprise you welcome the affection and return the kiss. You were beginning to get into it when Sylvia interrupts. <i>\"Jaden? Nysa says that she has waited long enough and she won't wait any longer. I don't think she's going to let anything get in her way.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa coils herself around you and slides you out from under Sally. Wrapping you in a big hug she gives you a look that says 'I'm yours'. \"Sorry Sally, I don't think I have a choice\" huffing grumpily she walks into the other room and curls up by the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapped firmly, but not uncomfortably, in Nysa's coils you can do nothing as she lifts you onto the bed and presses her lips to yours. The rest of your team takes the hint and leave the room. The last one out, Lyrica closes the door behind her, after she smirks at you.<i>\"Have fun!\"</i> fortunately you can't dwell on it as Nysa presses her tongue against your lips. 'Well it's Nysa's turn I wonder what she wants to do.'</span></div></div>",

II admit, after my romp with the rest of my team i don't find myself denying the pleasure and the bonding such act it gave me, but right now after the explanation the lighting duo dropped upon me, i just...don't feel able to perform as i should. Despite Nysa being smaller then a normal Milotic, her tongue is still larger then mine and easily win our little match as her muzzle delicately come close and slowly give me a deep loving kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo forcefulness this time, and when she remove her tongue from my mouth, she lower her head under my chin as asking for permission, and the affection she now desperately crave. I am not sure to be in the condition to give her the treatment now long overdue, but i can definitely give her the latter, make her feel wanted and loved despite our uneasy beginning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keep her head under my chin as i embrace the upper part of her long neck, softly i speak: \"We didn't exactly start our relationship in the most...conventional way, but Nysa, i haven't mated with you not because i don't find your body attractive, but because your reason of wanting me are wrong. Pyrie too committed this mistake but i can't do anything for her, well nothing lasting anyway, but i can still help you my sweet Nysa, please, let me help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa remain in the same position, her coiling grip tighten painlessly around me, as afraid of me vanishing in the like a ghost, leaving her alone against the specter of her past. But i won't i will never leave her or any of my team behind, i will never abandon or discard them like some people i knew, and still know quite well, TS for one<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me\" she remain still: \"Please Nysa, look at me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly bring her head next to mine, then recovering a normal position, normal as possible in our position at least, she look me straight in the eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what he did to you, i can't even image the suffering you have been through, i won't even pretend to understand. But please Nysa, remember that your memory of him are only a shadow of your past, of a person that will never harm you again. I won't let it, you are all mine after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that my little speech is not exactly the most inspiring talk ever, but hopefully it will be enough. Nysa nuzzle me gently, a smile slowly return on her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa nod, then shift her body around me, her coil delicately tighten once more, i can still easily move and breathe, but there is now way to remove myself from her now, not that i am trying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel her coils shift coming to a close, and looking at my crotch i can easily notice her open slit just above my member. She look in my eyes, asking for permission, i nod and she immediately try to remove my pants like she did before. With my help, the process is get done a lot quicker, soon finding myself naked from the waist down in no time, with my pants and under safe on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to speak to her, reassure her that this time no Psychic attack is coming to interrupt our bonding time, but i don't have the time to say anything, nor i need to as she decide to get what she has waited so long for by pressing her sex above my raising member. I decide to play a little with her and use my finger to spread open her lower lips, revealing to me her moist and more then ready tunnel already drooling in preparation of our act. I suppose that being a water type has it's perks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy member is now erect and ready for action, and how it can not be? Not only the idea of mating with her is arousing me more than i am willing to admit, but her pheromones are affecting me far more then they have the right to, on a human at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle at my own clarification, human? Zekrom assured me that i am still human but....i am overthinking again, drop it damn it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nysa place the parted lips of her sex on my rigid flash, a small distraction caught my attention, what could it be?</span></div></div>",

She slips her tongue back into your mouth and surrounds yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your tongues wrestle, Nysa presses her vent harder onto your member sliding you further into her depths. With a small moan she pushes one final time fitting your few final inches into her. Deep inside her you feel your member just brush her cervix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out of the kiss to take deep breath before pulling most of the way out and driving yourself back in. As you thrust, Nysa gasps and nuzzles under your chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip an arm out of her coils and rub the back of her neck, tracing her tassels and feelers. Apparently you hit a sensitive spot at the base of her hair-like tassels making her gasp and clench her muscles. You groan as her already tight entrance seizes-up on your member. She relaxes and licks your chin, urging you to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her cheek and continue, pulling out and pushing back in. Slowly you feel her movement become more and more spastic, and unpredictable. Your breathing begins to harden, you feel the pressure in your groin signaling your imminent release. \"I-I'm getting close\" you groan as you push in once again. \"Milotic milo\" she whispered, tightening her coils slightly, rubbing against your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pump in and out harder and harder groaning softly as Nysa moans and clenches her internal muscles. With one final gigantic thrust, you drive your manhood deep into Nysa's hole pushing against her cervix and poking through. Your tip now in her womb you release your seed painting her inside white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fill her to the brim, Nysa shudders, her climax ripping through her body. Her copious fluids pour out around your member soaking your hips and the blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahhh hahhh\" you gasp \"I do love you Nysa, never forget that\" her ruby eyes tear up and she tenderly presses her mouth to yours and coils her tongue around yours. \"Milotic\" she murmurs before falling asleep. You kiss her once more on the top of her head before you close your eyes and sleep as well.</span></div></div>",

Most of us are asleep when they do so, others however are not. We have a name for such problem, can't remember it right now, it doesn't matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene before me, i can't believe it, i don't want to. It's all so real, i..it's monstrous, i can't describe it in any other way<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself the invisible spectator of an event i only recently came aware about, one of the reason of my ^adventure^ is so..spiced, to say the least. The withe hall i can only recognize as the Legendary Hall, is nothing short of amazing, and terrifying. I don't know how i recognize such place, i never been here before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human, not a trainer judging from his nonexistent gear, just a boy, crying on his knees. His sobbing are hearth shattering, real, so very real. A few legendary surround his sad form from a distance, i can't recognize most of the shape, they are too blurred, only a single form is daring to touch the boy, Cresselia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice, sweet and sad, echo in the withe hall: \"<i>Don't cry /\u00e8\u00e0\u00f2\u00e0, it's not your fault</i>\" The boy name is gurgled and twisted, despite my effort i can't understand it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly stop sobbing, he sniff a few times before attempting to speak: \"H-how i ^sniff^ it's not my fault? I ^sniff^ i just...i love her, why he c-can't see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCresselia eyes become enveloped in a ligt pink aura just like Latias do when she use her powers, the boy is delicately forced to look directly at her \"<i>My dead /\u00f2\u00e0\u00f9\u00e8, how can it be your fault, we all knew the love between you two, but what was she trying to do was-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy now angry suddenly get up, freeing himself from Cresselia weak hold, his eyes red from the crying but still fierce even in this state: \"She?! Giratina did nothing but trying to help me! ME! T-than that...thing! wanted to stole me from her, that damn Whore! And like that..she..she was taken from me! WHY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCresselia distance herself from the righteous fury the boy is evidently feeling, i can hear a chorus of whispering voices agreeing with him: \"She didn't deserve this. Always loyal despite the shit of a work you all gave her, and then...when i finally found her, she is taken from me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dear i am sorry-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No you are not! You and all of the others don't give a damn about her!</b> Nor about me, you just want my cock, does it? Why don't you all go a pray your precious savior for a fucking dildo?! Huh?! <b>Well fuck you!</b> Go open a whorehouse, i am sure that a few fools willing to rut yours slutty holes won't be too hard to find, just don't mention the whole breeding thing and all the others bullshit and maybe, they will stay for a second run, maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy start leaving, his tone still angry, a fury that do not befit his age: \"I am done with you. Find someone else for your...plans, whatever they are, i am out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sweetie please</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turn around to look at her: \"<b>Don't you sweetie me! I know you, and all of you bitch don't give a damn about me!</b> My love is lost, even if...even if i manage to find a way to bring her back...I swear, here and now, i Will make you pay for what you all done, i don't care how much time it will take, i don't care if the anger or the void will consume my soul, till a drop of blood flow in my veins, my only goal will be your suffering. And when finally nothing of this place will remain but dust,  i will gladly let the darkness of my mate, send me anywhere she will found fit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream suddenly end, the feeling of pleasure surge from within and force me to wake up. I moan as i find myself emptying myself inside Nysa spasming sex, her insides clenching fiercely, attempting to draw every drip of liquid i can give. The Milotic aggressively try to continue humping me despite the pleasure cursing her body, demanding her to stop<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally cease get motion, i fell down on her spire more tired and empty the i ever felt, until now. Looking down i notice a small pool of her secretion under us, her body glistening in the artificial light of the room, her eyes glazed and her mouth open with her tongue out on the side. From the pain i feel id say that she woken up before me and decided to have a bis of yesterday night, then she must have decided to continue due to the lacking of any negative input on my side. I know it sounds stupid, but sleeping during sex doesn't acknowledge the partner to ignore your condition. Usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moan, of pain this time, leave me as i feel her walls trying to stimulate my member for another round, the lack of any withe substance on sight is a clear indication where all my stolen fluids are gone: \"Nysa..ah, damn it..<b>Nysa Stop!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa walls stop convulsing around my hard flesh, her eyes gradually recover shine and lose the emptiness that that characterized them: \"Milo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breath tiredly due to my body recent extension, Nysa too seems tired but uncaring of it: \"Release me, now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa look sadden a little but nod, her sex slowly let my member sliding out, her walls clenching every few moments increasing the discomfort  the pain of overexertion bring me. When finally i am out of her, she delicately uncoil herself from me and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need a good minute before i can finally move my hips without feeling pain, not much anyway, i think i can stand and walk normally now, but the stinging feeling from my member will remain for a while, and no chance in hell i am asking Joy about a cure for my..situation, no way i am explaining why my penis is red and aching. I prefer to suffer like a man. Okay probably it's stupid but, just no<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to find the right words for explaining my Milotic why you should not mate with your mate while he is asleep, it's quite rude at best, true i agreed to fuck her silly last night, but...oh shit. I facepalm as i remember that water type pokemon are know to prolong their coitus for a long time, the female is usually requesting repeated performance from their desired mate until satisfied, sometimes mating in group and even exchanging partners on the way. Also when a female found the mate she want to reproduce with, she simply demand to continue until she is sure to be pregnant from her chosen partner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually such method make sense for water pokemon, it's perfect and effective in it's contorted way. But with others...well i remember a Buizel mating with an Houndoom at the park when i was younger, and if the cum steadily flowing out the dark type pussy was any indication.... Pretty sure she was with egg after that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would berate myself if i had the strength to do so, but frankly it's useless crying over the spilled milk...damn pun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nysa....never again, ok? ASK next time or forget to mate with me for the rest of your compulsive life. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa nod, her dripping vent still exposed, maybe she is trying to tempt me or perhaps she is telling me that if i change my mind...no way right now: \"Milo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, not a drip of my fluids are anywhere in sight, at lest they are efficient. I quickly suit up and Nysa recover a more dignifying posture, just before the door where the rest of my team slept open. Unexpectedly is the Marowak to greet me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mar!\" She run to me far more quickly then i gave her credit with her short legs and stop just before touching me, then drop the bone and open her small arm asking for a hug. I smile and try to bring her up on my chest...bad mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as i try to lift her up, her weight force me to reconsider my options. I think that i would have been able to lift her if i wanted, but i rather not tire myself more then i already am, beside i can embrace my lovely ground type even as i am now, thank you very much<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems happy and after the embrace, she exaggeratedly ask for a kiss, i chuckle at her antics and gladly oblige her, deciding to give her something that unequivocally say: yes, i like you too. When our kiss end i find myself looking at a very embarrassed ground type, that despite her element give her a sort of chubbiness shape, i could easily felt that under her hard skin, she is nearly all muscle and very little fat, if any. A strange things for me to say no? Or maybe she is a pokemon and it's normal...oh fuck not again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI release Marowak from my embrace and remind myself to name her later, or as soon as a decent name came to mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia approach me: \"<i>So, had a satisfying night?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me, mhf\" Thinking about the last time i felt similar pain, i remember Sylvia mother using a restoration ability on me, an happy grin appear on my lips: \"Remember anything about dad experiments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia look at me curiously: \"<i>Something, not much i am afraid, why?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after Nysa and me....can you heal me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mother practiced on father something like that, yes. I can try i think</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia eyes glint in curiosity, probably she want to know if her skill can match her mother, and without even asking if i am ready, i find myself enveloped in a withe blinding light. The soothing feeling i felt that day return, although it's weaken then i remember. After a few more seconds the light vanish, and while my pain is still there, most of the stinging feeling are gone. Not a bad start id say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, still there but definitely better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can try again, maybe this time it will work?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door distract us from our conversation, my team but Sylvia and Nysa doesn't even need to be told as everyone grab their respective balls (how they recognize it anyway?) and return inside. That leave me with Sylvia at my left side, Nysa just a step behind me and Sally close to the door, ready for anything. Did Sylvia and Sally talked about our last visit with the TS spy Joy last night?</span></div></div>",

Zekrom tempted me with her powers last night, telling me that all her strength would have been mine if..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where are the others then, hiding from Team Shadow? Is the dream i had somehow connected to how TS has come to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Jaden!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ah!</b> What the- Rubica why are you screaming in my hear?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small punch land on my left shoulder, ow: \"Come on worry boy, less thinking more fighting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica quickly escape from my rightful retribution by entering the gym glass double doors, \"Hey! Ah, i knew it. Mom always told me how woman enjoy messing with us males\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at my belt i can't ignore the feeling of being laughed at. Did pokemon hear us from within the ball? No, focus, one problem at a time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI follow Rubica inside, the automatic doors open and soon, i realize that the doors are perfectly sealed, in fact not only the temperature inside the lobby is significantly higher, but also now i can clearly hear the unmistakable sounds of battle coming from the bowels of the gym<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that a subtle way to tell challengers that no matter how loud, nobody will hear your screaming?......I think that i am becoming a little more paranoiac then it's healthy to be, perhaps the last Joy working with TS has something to do with it, maybe, probably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young man, are you here for a match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up i find myself before a middle-aged woman fiddling with an iPad, probably the secretary, and from her attire, occasional marshal between gym leader and challengers. Did i really walk up here without noticing? Rubica is right, i am too stressed: \"Ehm yes, let's go with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me suspiciously, not that i blame her: \"Well then, mister..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving my surname for an official match may not be..prudent: \"Just Jaden, here my ID\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully Team Shadow will have the same troubles that all trainers has to go through when asking for information about a license, even when it's yours. Bureaucracy at it's best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged woman grab my card and efficiently slide it in the iPad bottom. A melodic ping came from the electronic device, it's bearer seems confused for a moment, then her eyes widen as her face pale. She swallow nervously then: \"I am so sorry Mr...Jaden i didn't recognize you, please this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, sure no problem at all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica: \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">What was that? What did you say to her?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Nothing! I just gave her my...card</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI facepalm for the second time this morning, that crazy nurse Joy wasn't joking about giving me the elite status, this will happen every time i enter a gym from now on? Hopefully not, i have enough trouble as it is<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI signal Rubica to follow as the secretary lead us towards the battlefield where the gym leader is fighting with another challenger, judging by the noise. A load noise similar to an explosion resonates in the whole structure just as our guide open the door to our intended destination, and to my great surprise, two different fields are placed at the right and left side respectively, of the enormous room we are now in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the field on my left a barely bearable heat is rising from what seems to be resembling a small dormant volcano, while the one on my left is full of various electric machinery, electric sparks safely falling down from isolated plates under them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary give me my ID back: \"A critical information regarding your mission is waiting for you in my office, ready for your examination at your discretion Mr. Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jaden?  I feel so old all the sudden: \"Thank you miss..\" The woman close the door, not even giving me the time to thank her properly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica whisper conspiratorially: \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">So, are you a spy? I thought they were taller</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaller uh? Well i expected someone smarter as a traveling companion but, you are all i got<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male voice echo in the room: \"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Welcome Mr. Jaden, we was under the impression that your journey would have taken longer to bring you here, but it's fine, we are always available for the league and all it's agents. I am Henry</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice, female this time, follow the first: \"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Indeed we are, let us officially welcome you in our humble gym, and i am Jane</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man and a woman elegantly suited enter our field of vision from doors at the opposite side of the room, the man from the left and the woman from the right. Reaching the center of their respective field they both say: \"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Lighting Strike!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n........\"Doesn't the gym just get the town name, you know tradition\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth look at me sheepishly, then Henri: \"Well yeah, officially it just so but, we like to call our gym this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, i am not in the mood for talking and i have quite the frustration to work out, also i don't want a double match and if there are two or more gym leader for a single medal, defeating at least half of them is enough unless specified before the match. So I'll take one and Rubica can take the other, who of this two leader will be my opponent then? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's see....</span></div></div>",

The challenging stare we exchange between us make me feel alive, finally some action...that doesn't involve sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence between us, is interrupted by the noise of someone running, and looking towards the source of the noise i recognize the secretary that greeted me in the hall, she is evidently try to reach the platform at the side of the arena as fast as she can, panting heavily in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a few secods later she reach her position, she kneel down as she try to catch her second wind: \"S-*pant* S-sorry *pant* got del-delayed by, paperwork *pant*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was something amiss, no need to spit out her lungs reaching here however, could have just asked to stop for a moment, or could have just remained when she escorted us here..no matter, let's do this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary slowly recover a normal breathing pattern, the getting up she straighten her vest and start to speak in an official tone: \"Hmhm, Welcome to the Lighting Strike gym challenger! I will be your referee for this match, and as tradition i will explain the rules of this gym. Both of the contenders may chose up to five pokemon in this fight, only one vs one battle, the first trainer to win 4 match is declared the winner and only the challenger may switch pokemon between fights. As any official battle the restriction of 10 moves per match is lifted, only four moves per pokemon are allowed. Any kind of move, included combo techniques are allowed 1 time per challenge, so chose wisely. No item nor device can be used to enhance or otherwise improve any pokemon move or statistic, natural pokemon abilities are of course, allowed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keep her serious expression, and just before i shout an order she interrupt us, again: \"A last thing, all trainer must declare the move it's pokemon are going to execute, no telepathic commands are permitted on any match, the inhibitor field surrounding this field will disrupt any attempt to use such methods\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA psychic disruption fields? Are they even legal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shout immediately wake me up from my stupor: \"Flame Charge!\" Pyrie flames envelop her body completely as she charge with increased speed toward her opponent, despite Jane order to doge, Pyrie already faster attack speed become far too quick for Ampharos to dodge<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact force the electric pokemon on all four, Jane immediately order a counter: \"Discharge Amphy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ampharos touch it's bulbous tail with it's forehead and yellowish ball of energy rapidly appear and grow on it's tail, then slamming the bulbous tail down a wave of electricity attempt to invest any creature withing the battlefield, namely Pyrie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging is impossible on solid steel: \"Substitute!\"<br>\r\nPyrie form shift for an instant, i can't really see whats happening, then a copy of her appear in front of her absorbing the attack, vanishing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was close, the paralyzing effect would have mean the end of the fight given the strength of that poke, Pyrie has only her speed as a clear advantage, unless..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane: \"Smart choice avoiding being paralyzed, but Amphy is far stronger then her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk: \"Pyrie, Attract\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Quilava start dancing on the field, entrancing the far too attentive Ampharos in her snare, i admit that even i found her skill effective. After a few other not adapt to minor moves, she complete her dance by exposing her sex to the now evident horny pokemon, drooling at the sight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan she is good at that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amphy! Snap out of it! Amphy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't believe it, this move it's practically cheating: \"Let's finish it, Brick Break on his head, go!\"<br>\r\nPyrie charge against the yellow pokemon now reduced to a twitching mass of flesh, and smash her hand right below his jaw. Ouch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ampharos fall down, his erection still showing even after the heavy hit, his lips curved into a smile. At least he fall from this battle with hight...spirit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well played, i should have expected this strategy, initial distraction with a move, finish it with a trick....you have skill. But why she exposed herself that way, normally the move finish after the dance is completed and is not that effective, did you trained her for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no but i wasn't able to discourage her either: \"Not really, she is just...talented for it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a way to put it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ampharos is unable to continue, challenger chose your next pokemon, or continue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy next choice, id say ground or psychic, i bet that at least one of her pokemon is super-effective against ground so, now or next match, later it will be too late</span></div></div>",

I can't breathe\" a little dissapointedly she got up and pulled you into a hug. You return the hug along with a small kiss before pulling away and grabbing another pokeball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a solid stance, you launch the ball into the field. At the same time Jane threw her own pokeball, the pokeballs burst open revealing your choices, Marowak and Magnezone. \"Tierra! Are you ready?\" Only last night had you thought of that name. \"Grinning over her shoulder she gave you a thumbs-up. \"Wak! Maro!\" You could easily hear the enthusiasm in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnezone! Use supersonic!\" \"Tierra dodge left and then Bone Club!\" With a roll to the left, Tierra avoids the attack and dashes forward, holding her bone aloft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnet bomb!\" Tierra was too close at that point to dodge the attack, getting hit by all the chunks of metal gravitating towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going you've got this! Create some cover with Sandstorm!\" Tierra takes her bone in one paw and slams it on the metal floor. Sand begins to spin and spiral through the air obscuring vision and scouring the metal floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnezone, use lock on!\" \"Now! Bone club once again!\" Dashing into the spiraling sand, Tierra calls out a battle cry and a loud clang is heard. \"Magnet bomb!\" \"Get out of the sand!\" Tierra leaps backwards out of the sand and lands in a defensive pose, her bone in front of her, ready to block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed and the attack still didn't come. \"Did it faint?\" You ask \"I don't know\" Jane replied \"ref?\" The ref/secretary shrugs unable to see. \"MAGNEZONE, MAGNEZONE!\" The metallic voice screams. \"Magnezone! Hyper Beam!\" Jane cried \"protect! Now!\" She held up her bone creating a bubble of energy around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnezone fired the blast directly at Tierra due to lock on, but it glanced of the shield she created, dissipating in the air. \"Tierra! Earthquake, no holding back!\" Raising her bone above her head, she plunged it into the ground setting off shock waves that knocked you off your feet.  When the tremors stopped, the sand had settled and you could see Magnezone lying on the metal floor motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnezone is unable to battle! Tierra is the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, very well done\" Jane applauded \"but what will you do against my next Pokemon? Go! Lanturn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Im definitely going to have to switch, Tierra won't stand a chance, but who should I send out?' You think for a moment before you make a decision.</span></div></div>",

Knowing Lanturn specialization and Jane good sense, i believe to have an enormous advantage on this fight. Just after the referee declare the start of the fight and Jane order her first attack, i find myself grateful for her father training before giving her to me: \"Role Play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia doesn't seems bothered by the disruption field, and nodding, flash green with Lanturn for a second. That just take the cake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane freeze for a moment as her face show a sudden flash of anger before she can hide it behind her professionalism: \"..a tactician then, cleaver, i should have guessed that after our first match, originally i expected a strong opponent, not a cunning one. Very well, Casia, Rain Dance and follow with Surf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around inside the battlefield suddenly become humid, and i watch amazed as real black cloud are forming above our head, i am glad to have exchanged Sylvia ability with Volt Absorb because if i hadn't...lighting-based moves always strike true while raining and even if Lanturn are unable to generate much power in combat, they are quite deadly if directed correctly: \"Sylvia Teleport behind him and use Psychic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally using Teleport in battle is very tiring for the user due to the necessity of gathering energy quickly, making the correct calculation in the very little time available isn't exactly a joke either. In short, she can't do it for long; i need a more decisive move or Sylvia reserve will get drained before we get the chance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous wall of water gather behind the Lanturn quicker than i expected, it's an impressive move seeing a pokemon actually doing it, then she push herself forward and the enormous wall of water come down on Sylvia. Luckily she teleport just in time....i pity anyone stricken by such move.<br>\r\nSylvia appear just behind the Lanturn and lift her up with Psychic before slamming her into the wall, then she use the move again to slam the water type just under Jane and reappear before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasia slowly float up in midair as all her kind of pokemon do, i have to ask a professor how they do that, and ready herself for another command. Jane knowing i can't continue order Sylvia teleporting around for long, order another surf. Surf too hoverer isn't a easy move to pull out, especially to non pure water type: \"Again Sylvia\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more just before the wall of water can crush down on her, Sylvia teleport behind Casia, but to a different position this time, and slam the exposed Lanturn down a few times before releasing it as the move energy gathered for the move exhaust, then once more, she reappear before me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am down to one move, while Jane can still ask for two, now what-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blizzard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! The water is still on the field, even if it doesn't it the ground will become slippery, Casia can float if she remain still or move only slightly but..why not me- hem Sylvia too? She is a psychic after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvia combine Double Team with Teleport then bash her around, don't let her charge up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kadabraaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia form shift then gathering all her strength, she teleport around the field in short burst, making her copy appear and disappear at the same time as she do, confusing both Casia and Jane..me too actually, without our connection i can't determine who is the real one anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasia stop mid charge, a few snowflake drop above her, she is trying to understand witch Sylvia is the real one, unsuccessfully apparently, Then as the ^teleporting storm^ end, Jane order an attack on the Sylvia behind Casia: \"Behind, Giga Impact!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasia turn and impressively quick gather all her strength, creating an enormous ball of semitransparent energy around her, beofre crashing herself and the sphere on Sylvia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylvia!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust clear, a small still not fully visible hole is now present under Casia..... Just before Jane start to moker me, Sylvia appear before me glowing brightly green<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Kadabraaaaa!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of purplish energy materialize between Casia and Sylvia, Jane face is horrified at the magnitude of the psychic attack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can clearly see that Sylvia reserve are exhausted, she is sweating and panting heavily. However Jane pokemon is faring much worse, she is on the ground outside the field, out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee seems surprised by the force of Sylvia Psychic, in fact despite the small difference in execution, the attack is evidently the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jane pokemon is unable to continue, the challenger win this round\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane recover her composure and recall her Lanturn: \"I have underestimated you again, quite the trick Mr Jaden, a Teleport Field with multiple Double Team, impressive. The energy required for combining such moves<br>\r\n\"An elite trainer indeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia teleport a last time in front of me, then she collapse on my arms: \"Sylvia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is awake, but too tired to even stand now, she has really given everything for me: \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Thanks Sylvia, i will find a way to repay you</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia nod weakly, and i recall her in her ball. Three match on three, not bad. But now i have only another psychic and a Water type available, if Lanturn was her special pokemon for dealing with ground type and all, she has only another electric type at her disposal, witch mean no Nysa...how she will react to a Latias i wonder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane stare at me for a few seconds: \"My compliments Mr Jaden, you are worthy of your title....but knowing of your arrival here, i was able to convince a very special guest to be present in our humble gym. It wasn't easy, and he accepted only after i mentioned you name Mr. Jaden, i am not sure why but right now, frankly i don't care. Let's give all our attention to our special guest of honor, a pokemon considered Legendary in the region once know as Unova and surely a worthy opponent even for you Mr. Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane threw a ball on the field: \"Let's give a warm welcome to one of the group know as Kami trio, Thundurus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Thundurus!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she won't react as badly as i originally thought. Maybe. Should i tell her that Zekrom is a possible candidate for mateship with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNah, i am not in the mood for hysteric right now</span></div></div>",

Come on out!\" You toss the pokeball you retrieved from your belt, into the air. With a flash of light and a loud \"Latias!\" Lyrica enters the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Latias lati\" seeming slightly befuddled when you don't respond you explain the situation. \"Telepathic nullification devices of some sort. I can't understand you right now.\" A look of understanding crosses her face closely followed by one of irritation. \"I know it's a little frustrating but stay calm, our opponent isn't just any Pokemon,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sideline, the referee noticed your signal and announced \"Ready? Begin!\" \"Thundurus agility! Then crunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThundurus cries out and begins to move extremely fast, too fast for you to keep track. Lyrica on the other hand followed his movements perfectly. \"Lyrica! Reflect type!\" With a cry she glows green for a moment, before Thundurus dashes straight towards her, fangs beared. \"Charm!\" Lyrica flashes Thundurus with an endearing smile followed by a blown kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Thundurus's crunch still hits, however due to the effects of reflect type and charm, it does practically no damage. \"Strike back! Ice beam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica opens her maw and forms a small, light blue sphere. \"Latias!\" Her cry rings out, followed by a blast of sub-zero energy. Thundurus roars in pain as the super-effective attack forces him to the ground. \"Glad I bought that TM\" you grin to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psychic! Don't let him back into the air!\" Lyrica follows your command. seizing Thundurus with her telekinetic power she slams him into the steel floor multiple times. \"Thundurus\" weakly the bruised legendary floats back into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's end this! Ice beam.\" No such luck before the move hits, he is up and moving with a purpose. \"Try to find a movement pattern, if you can, he's finished!\" \"Thunder punch!\" Wasting no time Jane gives the command, thundurus roars and rushes towards Lyrica at a blistering speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\" Your warning came too late as Lyrica was sent plummeting to the ground, sparking with electricity. \"Now we end this! Lyrica! Mist ball!\"  Shaking off the blow Lyrica's eyes flash and a ball of white mist formed between her claws. \"Wait for it. We can't afford to miss\" you mumble as Thundurus flits through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now!\" With a battle cry, Lyrica launched the ball in her grip in a seemingly random direction. \"Where were you aiming\" Jane laughs only to be drowned out by a large bang and roar of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile dashing about Thundurus had ran straight into the mist ball, knocking himself out. \"Yes! You did it.\" Lyrica rushes towards you and sweeps you into an airborne hug. <i>\"did you plan all that out?\"</i> \"yeah, it was defiantly some of my best work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did good Thundurus, return. Well Jaden I'm impressed. I've never seen a style quite like that.\" Motioning for the ref to come over she continues \"you have proven you and your Pokemon to be strong in both body and mind, therefore I present you with this!\" She took a box from the referee and pulled off the cover dramatically. \"The strike badge!\" Under the cloth sat a small badge. In the shape of a bolt of lightning falling from a cloud it shone with a lusterous glow. \"Jaden, you are a magnificent trainer. I hope to see you again someday.\" Leaving you with those words of encouragement Jane leaves you with your Pokemon and the referee. \"Jaden! Jaden! That was fantastic!\" Rubica called out from her place on the floor. \"Hey Rubica, how was your battle?\" \"Not too good, we lost. But that's okay you win some you lose some\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem Mr. Jaden there are some case sensitive files in my office for you. Would you like me to get them?\" \"Oh? Yes please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod of her head she turns and quickly runs off to gather the documents. \"I've got to get Sylvia to Joy she's exhausted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently done sitting back Pyrie wraps her arms around your shoulders, giving you a lick on the cheek. Reaching behind your head, you rub her head, earning some affectionate growls. \"Mr. Jaden, here are the files you requested. Have a nice day!\"</span></div></div>",

Deciding to eat something before having a much needed shower, i am stopped by Henri, the other gym leader<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill suited in the exact same way he was before battling Rubuca, i can descry a small frown on his face: \"Congratulation for your victory Mr Jaden, i have heard that despite his best effort, even Thundurus couldn't prevent your success, well done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh..thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes indeed, however i have also heard that your Latias, impressive having one so early in your journey by the way, have been ordered to execute 5 distinctive moves during the match, while in any official battle the rules allow only 4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp nervously, replaying the last battle with Lyrica in my head, and sure enough, Mist Ball was the fifth move i called, the forth being Psychic. Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry MR. Jaden, in fact Jane too violated the rules by calling an unsanctioned pokemon on the field\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Really?: \"Unsanctioned? You mean Thundurus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri nod, a sad expression on his face: \"Yes, him. As you Should know Mr. Jaden, only captured or otherwise authorized pokemon are allowed on the field. Simply bringing a pokemon on the field with a ball registered on your name is not enough to qualify such pokemon as yours, it must also be ^tagged^ by the ball using the unique code every trainer or breeder posses, it's automatically given when the pokeball connect to the pokegear after the capture has been successful, or when the pokemon is examined in a sanctioned center for the first time. Of course calling it tag is mostly incorrect, such id is valid only while the pokemon is inside it's respective ball and do not carry over when he or she are released from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrgh, too much technical stuff, it's not that it's complicated or that i do not understand it, it's mandatory in school anyway. Nah, i am just not in the mood: \"Yes i remember..something from school, the code change every time the pokemon is stored within, sort of randomized every time right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mph Mr. Jaden, not random, it's based on a very specific code generated with a combination of numbers obtained from your personal ID and others values, most of them are known only to Database Central, such codes are too valuable for public knowledge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, yeah, i know, not that it helped any against Team Rocket, Team Magma, Team Plasma....or Team Shadow: \"It should prevent pokemon from being stolen and used in any official competition right? It never stopped the various teams to abuse the pokeballs anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri exhale, clearly both upset and tired from the argument: \"True...they simply remove the tag and replace it with a generic one of their own invention, they can't still participate in any official tourney..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish his phrase: \"But they just don't care anyway\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod:  \"Thundurus is not one of my partner pokemon, and he was not sanctioned for use in that or any other official battle either, he just accepted to combat at her side when your presence here would have required it Mr. Jaden, but only in an friendly or any kind unofficial match between you two, not in a match with a badge as a reward\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know where this conversation is going: \"..a draw then? My mistake for hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accepted, she risk more then me if i remember the regulation correctly, beside i liked how she tried to balance out the issue of my..status\"<br>\r\nI hate that word, i feel like a shiny pokemon at the breeding center<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Mr. Jaden would need to simply fight another match in replacement of the one where the rules has been broken, at worst...Jane risk her license as a gym leader if the league where to be informed of what transpired in that last match...Mr. Jaden. I doubt they would do much more then suspend her but..i would like not to risk it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It isn't the first time, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri doesn't even try to deny it: \"It's not, she never used such methods against novice or unprepared trainer however, despite what it may seems she has eye for talent, and trouble\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle: \"I have both, id say more of the latter given recent event tough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admitting your problems it's the first step in solving them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look toward Henri, giving him an unamused look<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I leave you to your affair then Mr.Jaden, i bid you good day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood riddance i say. Rubica literally appear from nowhere: \"Su Jaden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ah!</b> Where the..*pfff* where did....*pant*...i <b>hate you</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she reply: \"Awwww Love you too, sooo, what he wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business woman, shoo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmp whatever, i don't care anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure you don't: \" In that case you know where the door is, oh and while you are out could you please check the ranger station? I want to know if there are been any sighting of..<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">you know who</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will you do in the meantime, oh mighty Jaden? Helping your team ^Relax^ after the hardship of winning a badge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy you little, sigh, nope, much much worse: \"I need to call mom.....never talked to her since i left, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">she is gonna be pissed i just know it</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never called her? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I'll get the info, see you later..right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the pokemon center i greet Joy in a somewhat depressed manner, i try to be cheerful but i know that the odds are against me, and to make matter worse my only consolations and mates right now are feeling quite frisky to say the least. I did remind them that talking to a parent...no, talking to your Mom after having completely forgot to contact her for...how long? Forget it, anyway, for a quite some time...especially if above mentioned mother tend to be a tiny little bit over protective is....dangerous, for the eardrums anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Jaden, you look beaten, did you lost at the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gym are the last of my worries right now, and no, i won\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someting happened? Did your team got hurt or..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGot hurt? They fought of course they got hurt, what question is that?: \"Not really, just.\"<br>\r\nI pause for a second: \"Didi you ever forgot to talk to your parents after they specifically recommended to contact them every now and then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy seems thoughtful for a moment: \"Mom or Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy retract slightly: \"Since?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginning\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy remain still for a few moments, then she begin to make some strange signs with her hands: \".....May Arceus have mercy upon your soul\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Thanks joy, i needed that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't feel ashamed to say that my legs tremble a little as i press the call button on my gear, i asked Joy for the better soundproofed room she had, as a response i got the ^special case breeding room^, that translated means: Pokemon that do it noisily, are desperate and need it NOW. Didn't even know such room existed, and Joy told me neither she did before a trainer came here last heat season with a bunch of Eevee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, most of them mysteriously became Espeon or Umbreon by the time he left. Having Pyrie and Lyrica in my team, practically granted me the room by default, not that i have any intention of releasing them here, still..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing completely disinterested in the how, i have left all my team with Joy for a quick checkup and revitalization, also i want to avoid the obvious, perhaps mom will help me forget the thought of Articuno gathering all the interested legendary...brrr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident that such feat will still take some time before reaching it's conclusion, i put up the best smile i can as mom answer the phone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy greet me back as i return to the hall, she politely ignore my new hairstyle as i ask the form for a speaker replacement. With bureaucracy done, i find myself unsurprised to discover that ^loud noise^ is not an uncommon cause of decay for the integrated speaker of the pokegear, i have always thought it was because incautious trainer use their gear for playing pranks using Zubat or something. How wrong i was<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before i get to retire in my room for a quick shower and nap, Joy call me back: \"den, <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Jaden</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y foot yu em\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy roll her eyes: \"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Forgot your Tom</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot Tom? Who's Tom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll kep tm fnow, obvsly ned rest.

You have to be careful with her. Records show that she is prone to overreacting, and she is as bull headed as they come. Once she has a goal in mind she will almost never give up.\" Zoroark stood up off the bed. \"We also think thought you should know that there's already quite a few legendary Pokemon in the area.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" you reply \"I met them a few nights ago\" \"which ones?\" Lucario asked. You think for a moment \"um Zekrom, Zapdos, Kyurem, Articuno, and I met Mesprit about a week ago. Actually I was supposed to meet her and her siblings after I beat the gym here.\" \"Well that sort of makes our visit superfluous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, I appreciate the information about Lugia.\" \"Your welcome. we need you, so don't make too many enemies.\" With a grin Lucario sticks out a paw to shake. \"We wish you luck in all your endeavors. By the way I'm Luka, and this is Elisa\" \"we hope to see you again soon\" the pair turns to the balcony door and kiss quickly before jumping out into the streets. You rush to the balcony, but they are nowhere to be seen. \"Must've turned invisible\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide the door shut and fall onto the bed. \"Damn, Lugia sound like she could be trouble, I hope they were exaggerating at least a little.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand drops to your waist where your pokeballs usually are. When you don't find them you bolt up. \"My team! Where? Where are they?\" You stop as you remember. \"Right they're with Joy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit your room making sure to lock it behind you, and walking back to the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Jaden! Trench coats? Really?\" You falter for a moment before flinging your arms into the air \"I don't even fucking care how you know that. Could I have the girls back?\" \"Sure, here you go! All in perfect health!\" Holding out a tray with your pokeballs on it she smiles warmly. \"Have a nice day!\" You collect your team and clip them to your belt. \"Thanks Joy. I'll see you later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass through the sliding doorway and walk out into the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still got a lot of daylight left, maybe I should go see Mesprit.\" You walk down the road contemplating your options when you hear Rubica calling your name. \"Jaden! Jaden! Wait up!\" You turn around and see her sprinting up the street breathing heavily. \"Jaden! I just saw Articuno!\" Instantly you freeze up. \"What did you just say?\" Rubica catches up with you and pants heavily. \"Articuno *gasp* was in the sky *gasp* to the north of the city *gasp* near the lake\" \"damn, I guess I should head over there. I don't really want to go it'll be pure chaos\" Rubica stood up having regained her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going too!\" \"Sorry Rubica, I can't let you go, the legends might take it the wrong way\" \"but..\" \"Ahh ahh ah! No buts! You're staying here!\" Sticking out her lower lip she grinds her heel into the ground \"I'm going with you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* you're too stubborn. Sylvia come out!\" You open the pokeball containing your Pokemon, releasing her into the world. <i>\"Jaden!\"</i> she jumps into a hug. \"Hey Sylvia, could you teleport the two of us to the north gate?\" <i>\"sure\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of light and a small popping sound later you find yourself standing just outside of the city. \"Thanks, Sylvia. Articuno is supposed to be near the lake, so we should try to get there quickly. I want to get this over with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry Sylvia most of the way to the lake as part your thanks for the gym battle. When you arrive all appears calm, but you know from experience that they are probably nearby. <i>\"you made it!\"</i> Mesprit shoots out of the lake followed by two other, similar Pokemon. <i>\"These are my siblings, Azelf, and Uxie\" she gestured first to the blue highlighted one,and then to the gold. You take  a look at your two new acquaintances. Azelf had a body practically identical to Mesprit's with the exception of his head. Instead of the pink bangles, he had three crests pointing to the rear of his head, of a bold blue color. Uxie also had a similar body. Her head was gold and had the appearance of a segmented helmet. You noted that her eyes were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf began to speak telepathically <i>\"Jaden, Mesprit told us how you rescued her from team shadow. We are in your debt\"</i> \"it was nothing really, I was going to beat them up anyways.\" Uxie floated forward. <i>\"irrelevant, you aided our sister, now, we will aid you.\"</i> she turned and floated to the left a ways. <i>\"team shadow has bases all over the continent. Some are hidden in the wilds, others are in plain sight. I can see most everything that goes on. I know of nearly everything.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew everything, then wouldn't you essentially be unbeatable in battle?\" <i>\"in theory\"</i> she turned and smiled, her eyes still closed. <i>\"back to the topic at hand. . . Umm what was I saying?\"</i> Mesprit covered her face with a small paw while Azelf just shook his head. <i>\"team shadow bases, sister\"</i> <i>\"ah yes! But I'm afraid that will have to wait.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head, you were having trouble following this conversation. \"Why?\" <i>\"it's simple, Articuno is almost here, and she isn't alone.\"</i></i></span></div></div>",

What if...if i can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit float towards me: \"<i>I am the one responsible for many of the emotions you are now feeling Jaden, i would like to tell you to not worry, to help you deal with the feeling of anger or...despair somehow, but i can't. As a legendary i can only tell you to be strong and resolute. because all the creature that will present themselves before thee, have only one objective one purpose. Ending the loneliness that clutched their heart since their first day as adult, a torment that i too, knew all to well</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure how to reply at her words, but i too have the right to decide what i want..and what i do not want, what i like..and what to hate with all my being, and right now, if i had a weapon strong enough to bring pain to Arceus....i would have used it, god it may even be, but still mortal to my eyes, to my hate: \"And my decision? What of them, hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Mesprit straight into her amber eyes: \"What.of.them? Do you realize how...useless i fell right now? How angry at being seen as nothing more than a giant.fucking.cock? Do- does i even- bah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMespirit look down, ashamed of her behavior, i don't think she is wrong, but i too, am not. Azelf the only male legendary i have ever meet, place one of his small paw on my shoulder: \"<i>You have right, Jaden. But as probably you have already guessed, my sister too, is suffering, and she too is tempted to enter the competition for your mateship, but despite her feelings, she do not. Do not ask more from her, she can't help you on this regard. But maybe...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe she can help you choose, my friend.....can i...call you friend?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitate for a moment, but i see no reason to deny him this request: \"I would be grateful for the company of a male after...everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel his emotion now that he is touching me, and i can feel his happiness at my acceptance of him as my friend: \"<i>It's not that bad is it? Lot's of females, powerful one too, and all of them coming from every part of the world only to beg your love</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all the responsibilities it bring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, yes.

I want more then....fuck anything that breathe Azelf, i want more, much more...and i fell so empty..<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">cold</font>\"<br>\r\nI am not sure if it's because he too is a male but, i can relate with him, sort of, far better then with anyone else since the beginning of all this...whorehouse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>.....Tell you what, me and my sisters will help you skimming the results, and who know, maybe you will realize that..most legendary wish for a lover, not just a cock. It's just, well, how can i explain it to you...if your father would have came to you one day and said: Son, one day part of the essence of this very world will bow to every whim or desire. But, if i find you abuse it for any reason the punishment will be swift and absolute, oh and also you are forbidden to love and have any kind of sexual relationship with any living, and/or nonliving(don't ask), creature or otherwise being present in this world and beyond, clear?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pretty much, soooo, let's say that you discover that entropy is not an issue for you, you grow but don't get older, not a day, a thousand years nothing more then a breeze for you. Won't you get horny after a century or two?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot sooner i think\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hehehehe, yeah, me too. Anyway, can you now understand what kind of torment they, us all, we have to endure? Day after day, decade after decade, of being horny, lonely, empty just like you are now?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not horny at the moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes well you got the point no?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remove his paw and float in front of me: \"If anything i feel pity for them, that's doesn't make me feel any better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nor it should, i am merely explaining our position in the world. So, still feel ready to give up?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted some comfort, and i get a symposium on why all female legendary want to fuck me silly, was that your idea of emotional support?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am good at it ah? Sister alway tell me that i am obnoxious and too rational at times, i am not sure to understand what she means</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right, can we talk about something else? Please?\"<br>\r\nI swear my condition is worsening just by looking at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sure, what about?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said something about skimming results, of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A gauntlet, what else? A series of tiring but mostly painless endeavors to prove their respective skills in various fields, both metal and physical....of course sexual one as to be included as well, sorry, it's part of the game</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame? What the: \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Unless you have a better idea, or want to breed them all....yeah? If you don't give them something to focus on, all their attention will be focused on you, Jaden, or fighting each other, and i believe we all agree that a group of legendary fighting each other to exhaustion or worse may not be..practical</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it mildly: \"And the winner will have me as a prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No, you Jaden will be the judge, the absolute ruler of this competitions, You will decide between the two or more contenders, the one you are more interested in. I admit i do expect trouble, but mostly, everything should be fine...at least until you will keep you word, they will also probably want to attend in the claiming, probably</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?! \"Attend?! b-but, i must fuck them in <b>public now</b>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It will be a good methods to both confirm your claiming and placate any legendary that may want to accuse you of stalling. Also With everyone present, none will dare to interfere with the ritual</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He call it ritual, he-hehe, screw you Azelf\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud booming sound attract my attention, looking up i notice Articuno and Zekrom quickly coming towards me, Articuno then speak with an official tone: \"<i>Greetings Jaden, as promised i brought all the interested legendary for you to chose from, some will arrive quicker then others so, i ask you to be patient and wait for all of us to arrive before making your decision</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am hesitant to ask, but i know i must: \"How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom reply to my question in a way that remind me of a judge or something, this is serious: \"All the legendary the have openly showed interest and that will reach us today are: Zapdos, Articuno, Rakoyiou, Victini, Mewtwo, Dialga, Reshiram, Zekrom, Kyurem, and while she didn't reply directly, i believe that Lugia too will be present soon enough. Others possible match are declared their neutrality in the matter Jaden, expect friendship and attachment from them, but they will not be your mates, their names are: Jirachi, Deoxys, Giratina, Palkia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many, and She has also mentioned herself in third person? This is it then, they are serious about all of this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom continue: \"<i>A few of us has not yet declared their intention and may or may not be present today, their names are: Mesprit, Uxie, Heatran. That will be all.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look towards the lake trio, Mesprit is fidgeting with her paws while Uxie is unreadable as ever, of course Azelf is smiling like a fool: \"<i>Do not worry Jaden, my sister will not let their feeling interfere with the judgment or the gauntlet, if you still wish to have one of them later however well, we will find something....hihihihi</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastard, my only relied is that most legendary are in competition with each other and taking one may exclude another, for now i know for sure about Zapdos and Articuno problems with Reshiram, that Victini and Mewtwo can't stand each other, and that Rakoyiou may or may not have some incomprehension with..someone maybe Zapdos or Reshiram, what else hmmmmm ah yeah i bet that Kyurem will not accept to be my mate shy as she is unless all her sister are with her, good, now about Lugia..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArticuno voice disrupt my train of toughs: \"<i>Jaden if i may...Lugia has remained alone for a very long time, and probably she is..desperate, and she will do nearly everything in her power to win you over, even kidnapping you if necessary. Also it may be awkward having to share you with her Jaden, both me and Zapdos agree, if you chose her...it may be difficult for us to being your mates</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kidnapping legendary now?

Come out!\" <i>\"hmm very well. You did catch on.\"</i> the trees to your left shake slightly and from them fall a humanoid figure. It lands on its feet and walks towards you. <i>\"greetings, Jaden I am Mewtwo. I do hope you chose me\"</i> she was mostly a light purple color with a deeper shaded tail. There were two crests on her head resembling ears. Her head and shoulders were connected behind her neck by a small section of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n her voice flowed through your mind like honey making it somewhat difficult to think. <i>\" we could have such fun together\"</i> she got closer and closer reaching out to you. But when she was almost upon you another voice rang out inside your head instantly clearing the fog. <i>\"bitch! Get away from him!\" \"You!\"</i> Mewtwo snarled behind you you see a small Pokemon floating in the air. Mostly covered in cream fur with red highlights, it had two small wings on its lower back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" if you think you can just waltz in here and take him before anyone notices, you're dead wrong.\" \"And let me guess, you think you can stop me?\"</i> Mewtwo laughed, <i>\"you're a hundred years too early to fight me!\" </i> they converged upon you both clutching one of your arms. \"ENOUGH!\" You thunder. \"IF THE TWO OF YOU ARE SO IMMATURE THAT YOU CAN'T AVOID PETTY ARGUMENTS SUCH AS THESE THEN I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ELIMINATE YOU FROM THE POSSIBLE CHOICES!\" You yank your arms out of their grip and straighten your shirt as they stare dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo is the first to regain her composure, she drops to her ones and bows <i>\" please forgive me Jaden! I-i don't want to new lone anymore!\" \"I would like to apologize too. I am Victini. It's a pleasure to meet you.\"</i> \"it's nice to meet you too\" you kneel before Mewtwowho still has her head lowered. You place a finger under her chin and raise her face until she is looking at you. She has tears welling up \"I'm sorry I yelled, but I refuse to be treated like a prize\" you grab an arm and gently pull her to her feet. <i>\"I'm ashamed of myself\"</i> she murmured. \"It's alright just remember I have emotions too.\" She nodded wiping the tears away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump slightly as a small pair of arms wrap around your head. <i>\"Where is everyone else?\"</i> Victini clamped onto the back of your head. \"They were just up here\" you can feel the heat from Victini's crotch against the back of your neck. <i>\"Jaden you've calmed down, I hope? Oh? You found those two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean'those two'?\"</i> Victini growled her eyes narrowing. <i>\"nothing really, you two just fight all the time. It's a miracle that you haven't torn Jaden to shreds!\"</i> \"I kinda had to throw down the law.\" Azelf raised his eyebrow \"yeah if they continue to fight they will be removed from the gauntlet.\" <i>\"Well! I'm impressed Jaden. You do have the strength of will needed to handle some of the legendaries.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jaden, more will be here soon\"</i> Uxie warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a minute later a deafening roar echoes through the air and a large quadrupedal form breaks through the clouds. Sporting steel plates and a large metal crest on its back the Pokemon landed heavily, shaking the earth. <i>\"Greetings Jaden. Dialga at your service.\" </i> \"It is a honor Dialga\" <i>\"no the honor is mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?!\"</i> the psychic voice blasted through your head bringing you to your knees. \"F-fuck!\" You groan as you clutch your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Rubica moan in pain. \"Stop!\" You shove yourself to your feet. <i>\"so you are the inestimable Jaden, Articuno wasn't exaggerating, you are cute\"</i> the mental pressure recedes only to be replaced by a powerful  burst of wind. At the epicenter of the wind a figure appears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like a dragon in appearance, it is mostly white with a blue underbelly and blue spines in two rows along its back. Two large dexterous wings extend from its sides, their motions creating a near-hurricane force wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am Lugia, I am here to claim my mate.\"</i> \"you assume too much Lugia, I have not chosen as of yet. You would do well to remember that.\" <i>\"You have a great deal of spirit, I like that\"</i> she said huskily. Alighting softly on the ground she takes several steps towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lugia! Stop!\"</i> two figures burst from the clouds landing between you and Lugia. \"Kyurem! And Reshiram I presume?\" The newcomer flashes you a quick smile before focusing her blue glare solidly on Lugia. <i>\"We all heard him say that he has not chosen, are you truly so conceited to think he would only choose you?\"  \"I am not conceited!\" </i> Lugia hissed <i>\"Then remember that HE has final say in this matter! Not you\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia assumes a resting position and smiles sweetly at you. <i>\"she didn't do anything did she?\"</i> kyurem asks. you look to Rubica who gives you a thumbs up, still looking somewhat unsteady. \"Nothing lasting at least\" you grimace \"she's powerful, but really pushy and presumptive, kinda gets on my nerves\" Kyurem nods and Reshiram leans down to your eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"you really are cute, you know that right?\" </i> \"umm no I didn't but thank you\" <i>\"my pleasure,</i> she wraps you in her white wings and almost immediately the heat makes you drowsy. \"No-no, sorry I can't allow this sort of thing\" you twist out of her grip and take a seat next to a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems slightly disappointed but accepts what you say.  <i>\"Alright, if you say so\"</i> \"thank you\" you sigh and lean back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud roar pierces your ears and you bolt upright jolted from your accidental nap. \"What- who is that?\" <i>\"Raikou\"</i> Uxie replied <i>\"she is close\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that Mesprit and Uxie had curled up with you as you slept. \"We'll talk about this later\" you rose to your feet in time to greet the lightning legendary. She came rushing out if the trees at a breakneck pace, sliding to a stop in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"greetings! Jaden I am Raikou! I would love to be your mate!\"</i> \"it's a pleasure to meet you\" <i>\"Zapdos  was right behind me, I don't know where- oh there she is!\" </i> sure enough in the sky you see Zapdos flying towards the now-large group. <br>\r\n<i>\"Jaden! It's good to see you! Unfortunately I could not find Cresselia, so we must assume she is not coming.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then I suppose we begin\" immediately the various legendaries arranged themselves in a circle around you. \"Azelf what should the first test be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"well I think the first test should be one of pure strength.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright strength it is then! Lets start with physical strength. The one who lifts the most weight shall be the victor! One at a time, starting with...Zekrom!\" </span></div></div>",

That's enough\" you pry her off and set her back into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's not the only one who has been waiting\"</i> a low sensual voice flowed through your mind. You feel a pair of small hands rub your shoulders, moving in small circles. \"Victini?\" <i>\"yes?\"</i> you feel an envigorating energy flow into you from the points of contact. 'So the legends are true, somewhat at least, she really can pass energy into others. Definatley would be a valuable member of the team.' Pushing these thoughts aside you reach over your shoulders and grab the small legendary Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lifting her over your shoulders she spreads her legs apart revealing an enticing aroma. \"Smells like enigma berries\" you mumble, absently stroking Victini's head. <i>\"Arceus I'm horny\"</i> that stray thought snaps you out of your daze. <i>\"shit I didn't mean to project that\"</i> she berated herself before flashing you with an adorable smile. \"Nope!\" You drop her and look up to see Zapdos still maintaining the orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh don't you think she's been doing that for long enough?\" <i> hmm? Oh yes, Zapdos! You may stop now!\"</i> Zapdos allows the sphere to dissolve before returning to the earth. \"Thank you Zapdos, take a rest\" she nodded her head and sat down next to a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright next up, is</span></div></div>",

Man that's...i don't know what it is but it's definitively not normal! Right?: \"Did she taught you anything else, like something to slay Arceus perchance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini look pensive, then: \"<i>No sorry. Why?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just..you know..overthinking about something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie decide to share one of her pearl of wisdom with me: \"<i>Jaden, all this thinking about harming Arceus will bring you nothing but misery, i agree that it's probably deserve a lesson of humility, but obsessing your mind will do you no good, nor us</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight or no, i have already decided that my right boots has just got an unavoidable rendezvous with it's eminence withe ass, it's only a matter of time really: \"How Lugia is proceeding? I trust no city has incurred in any calamity just to impress me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf look towards Lugia, Uxie instead don't even bother and just answer my question: \"<i>Do not worry Jaden, everything is under control</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your sister attempt to make me give her oral? Or is everything planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie seems embarrassed now, it's the first time i manage to leave her without words: \"How long? The barrier i mean, for how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzelf reply whit his eyes still on Lugia: \"<i>Not long, we need to test two or more candidate at one time or we never make it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Lugia, a rumble over our heads make us all look up, black clouds swirl in a maddening circle above our heads, a storm so big i that i never seen is appearing before our eyes, Zapdos scream: \"<i>Stop this madness! You can't hope to control-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Enought! Do not question my authority or my control over my powers Zapdos. Now seat and look your mistress at work</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hate for Arceus resurface once more, it's common knowledge that Lugia is a mostly kind pokemon with the interest of the worlds at hearth, a pokemon that voluntarily isolate itself due to the nature of it's powers, a strength capable of creating massive destruction even by accident just by releasing a small part of it's energy. After centuries of isolation however, even the strongest of will may broke, and desperate for attention she is twisting her gift with anger and lust with the only intent of proving herself worthy of the only mate available to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure if admire of her resolve, or run away from her crazy determination. The storm become worse by the seconds, then Lugia scream and suddenly release a swirl of energy from her mouth, the attack reach the clouds is mere moments and literally shatter the storm in two, leaving behind a perfectly calm and clear sky. The last of the quarrelsome clouds leave our sight, and Lugia promptly land in front of me, her muzzle not a inch from my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive Lugia, reckless but impressive. You respected my request to the letter, but before expressing my judgment on your actions, i need to know. Will you have stopped if i would have asked, no matter the cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia reply mentally, a slight vibration like purring emanated from her throat \"<i>Yes</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if the price would have been the death of another, guardian of the sea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lower her head and close her eyes, she remain still and continue to ^purr^ for nearly a minute before answering: \"<i>If that would have been your command, if not i would have avoided it. I am the guardian, my responsibility, my power, my fault, other will not pay for my mistakes</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod: \"Please rest, the gauntlet is not over and you will need your strength\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Am i...with you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your answer to my last question would have been simply yes....no.\" I place my hand on her head: \"As it is now, I'll consider it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please, don't..leave me...i-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, not matter what i will never be able to understand your pain, the torment of remaining alone for so long, but you are not the only one and i can't...i have no illusion to be able to satisfy you all, let's not forget the rivalry. Madness\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I...understand</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia leave, crestfallen. Hopefully i will find a way to fix this mess, because if i don't..i don't even want to think what the loneliness may push the rejected legendary to do, no matter what the lake trio say, a desperate creature may find acceptable any solution if stop the pain, centuries.....thousand of years? It require more then willpower and determination surviving the ages, i believe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking to the all the legendaries present: \"Sadly we do not have the time to test everyone singularly, so we will begin to test your abilities in group of two or three depending on element affinities. Let's continue with speed and reflexes, Mewtwo and Victini, will be the first group, Mespirit will be your handler. Azelf you will be testing Raikou and Articuno. Uxie you will test Reshiram, Dialga and Kyurem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\"</span></div></div>",

I don't know what to think, heck I didn't even know it's possible to think so clearly while asleep, but my curiosity and self-preservation instinct bring me to focus north towards my position, where my body should be...I think<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it's weird feeling the light breeze and the humidity typical of this altitude, but not being able to feel myself breathing or my body heat or my weight for what matters. I try to push my body forward and soon realize that while my legs are useless here, my will permit me to move my conscience toward my goal, but before I can even get close to my approximate location a creature gently float towards me, it's shape is oval? Or something with some sort of pink rings surrounding part of her body. I stand still as I await for the creature to come closer from below, and when it's close enough I can finally recognize the creature shape<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh inwardly if that is even possible as I am: \"Hello Cresselia, what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCresselia seems saddened by my greetings: \"<i>Do not worry Jaden, I am not here to participate in your gauntlet, I am here only to offer my help with the impostor</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she is talking about? \"You mean a legendary is not what is seems?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh light and soft as a mountain breeze quickly change my mood from stressed to happy: \"<i>Quite the imagination, it would certainly ease your decision isn't it? But no, all the legendary asking for your companionship are genuine, maybe not all their intention are as pure, but real nonetheless</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have seen very little purity since the beginning of my career, of course I too had dreamt of fighting against or with some of the most famous legendaries a time or two, but finding myself licking Mesprit pussy wasn't in those dreams nor was having a horny Victini displaying herself so blatantly and...i need to think about something else<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I believe that the name used by the humans is Team Shadow</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ok.

It was very realistic</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine, ah yes, did any of you three know anything about a certain impostor or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three psychic look at me quizzically: \"Forget it, has Dialga finished her test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the emotion legendary that came barely a cm from my face to answer: \"<i>Not yet, their whole group hasn't performed yet, nor Uxie group, want to attend?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why they have not started yet? Also there is no reason for You to come This close\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They refused to perform without you looking while my group knew that could trust me and did it anyway!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you convinced them to place a good words for you no matter whom i chose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmmmm, third option?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take me to Uxie group; I need to ask Dialga a few questions after her performance is done\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Thanks to: Spelling and Grammar check by The Ever Burning Pheonix</div></span></div></div>",

You feel your face burn as she leans down and begins to lick around her entrance slowly. She grins seductivley and slowly pushes her tongue into her vent allowing some of her fluids to escape. Her tongue reaches deep inside with every lick. You try to adjust your now tight pants without being noticed, But you fail miserably. Nearly all the legendaries notice your actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReshiram moans heavily as she feels her orgasm rush through her body. <i>\"well? Did you like it?\"</i> she pants. \"Y-yeah\" you admit slowly, still blushing heavily. <i>\"alright next up!\"</i> Uxie calls. \"Arceus I'm gonna fucking kill you, driving them to these lengths\" you whisper, as both Dialga and Kyurem rise to their feet. Kyurem rolls onto her side, exposing her vent. Dialga stepped over her aligning them into a crude approximation of a sixty-nine position. Dialga lowered her muzzle to Kyurems crotch taking a tentative lick. Kyurem gasped sharply and returned the favor sliding her tongue against Dialga's now-wet entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two grew more comfortable with what they were doing the gradually delved deeper into each others depths.

But why wasn't she immunized or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga sigh sadly: \"<i>It was an experiment, mostly harmless for the pokemon i assure you. He, the professor, was studying the effect that different kind of antigen has on different type of pokemon. That particular pokemon was poisonous and she was treated accordingly, but when no other collateral effect appeared, she was released with a, how do you human hmm, ah yes, clean bill of health</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't know where to look i guess, and no exam revealed the infection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, we can barely read pokemons aura correctly, figure a sort of super disease: \"He discovered it then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDialga nod: \"<i>The professor that took over his research, his son apparently, was able to identify the disease after the hospital doctors suspected of something pokemon related.

It take nearly a minute but i feel my thoughts clearly again, untainted by anger: \"This will mean dragging someone else in my same condition, not sure i would like it if the position where reversed, but if he really should have awakened anyway i suppose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He should have yes, understand Jaden, Arceus do not want neither us nor human to suffer, it just...it is a traditionalist as you would have called it, after it chosen to turn us legendaries into craving bitch, i admit i too would have wanted to giving some of my claw up it's...but i can't.

No again..it's too blurry, it may not even happen at all after the procedure, before it was certain but afterwards, i cannot be certain anymore</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated: \"What do you mean you don't know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The future is ever changing Jaden, few things are set in stone and even those, the details may change but with a breeze.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, hopefully i will never meet this..fire type.

The probability to find such combination are quite slim</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chances has not been on my sides lately. So instead of having many slightly horny pokemon with a thing for human, i will have only a few but strongly attracted to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not sure how strongly, they may variate from blatantly interested to hellbent on mating with you but yes, that sum it nicely</i>\"<br>\r\n\"A way to not strengthen the affinity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me quizzically: \"<i>Not doing the procedure will leave things as they are. Reducing the number drastically to just Me, Zekrom, Reshiram, Kyurem, Mewtwo, Victini and Lugia. Also if Zapdos get another gifted expect Raikou and Articuno to follow. Rai and Zekrom had quite the..disagreement a century ago, i don't think it will take less then another to calm them both down</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to assume that Reshiram too prefer Dragon to fire then?

Relieve me of my fire affinity!\" <i>\"very well\"</i> Dialga reared back and slammed onto the ground releasing a tremendous roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of energy seems to dissolve everything around you and replace it with a seemingly transparent reality. Your eyes widen as you see yourself going through your life as if you hadn't had a fire affinity. You can see yourself recieving Sylvia, meeting Zekrom, rescuing Lyrica, everything you had done in your journey so far. You see everything go by recognizing all of it until you reach the cave. As Dialga had explained to you, without Zapdos noted feeing you did indeed mate with Zekrom. You try to remain calm as these new events races past your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually things return to the present, and you feel your body become solid once again, returning you to the world. \"Woah, that was a trip\" you gasp as you stagger under your regained weight. <i>\"I agree, altering the time stream can be most interesting. As probably noticed you've been allowed to retain your original memories.</i>\" \"y-yeah it's actually kinda confusing\" <i>\"sorry, but don't worry, it will pass.\"</i> \"yeah, anyways what now?\" <i>\"well you should probably go see your mates.\"</i> \"oh right, yeah\" you tentatively take a step, followed by another and another until you are walking normally to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Jaden! What happened? You seem slightly different.\"</i> \"just wanted to talk to Dialga, nothing big.\" You survey the remaining legendaries. You see that the legendaries that Dialga had mentioned were indeed still there. Surprisingly you see that Uxie was here. \"Uxie why are you here?\" <i>\"I had wanted to see which path your life would take. Beside you are quite attractive.\"</i> \"umm thanks\" <i>\"Jaden, are you sure everything is alright?</i> Mewtwo clasped onto your side <i>\"your memories are in disarray\"</i> \"please stay out of my mind, except for telepathic purposes\" <i>\" alright Jaden. I'll honor your request. By the way, when will we get to mate?\"</i> you flinch slightly. \"Wow you really don't give up, I don't know honestly. I was actually hoping to have a night with Sylvia, with all that's been going on we haven't had any time together.\" <i>\"oh I see, you would prefer her.\"</i> \"that's not what I mean and you know it! Sylvia is my first mate and I love her! She deserves my attention just as much as you.\" <i>\"I-I know but, I really wanted to have some time with you.\" \"Hey! I want some time too!\"</i> Victini cried hugging your other arm. Soon you were surrounded by the legendaries, all of whom wanted a piece of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently having had enough, Sylvia herself burst from her pokeball. She surrounded herself in a bright aura and snapped her arms out to both sides, pulling all the legends off you and to the sides. <i>\"Jaden, it's about time we renewed our bonds. Wouldn't you agree?\"</i> \"actually yes, I do agree. So what about all the others? Where will they go?\" <i>\" we will accompany you, of course.\"</i> Reshiram stated \"umm no i don't think that will work.\" <i>\"why?\"</i> do you have any idea what would happen if you came into the city?\" <i>\"yes, and we don't care, we will never leave your side, no one will separate us!\"</i> she orated vehemently. \"Fuck, well could you disguise yourselves?\" <i>\"I'm sure we could do that.\"</i> \"alright I guess I don't have much choice\"</span></div></div>",

Are you one of Jadens' mates?\"</i> Rubica spluttered and laughed uproariously, until she wasn't able to breathe. \"No-no I'm not Jadens' mate, just a friend. But one of my Pokemon is his mate. Sally my Salemence, managed to get into his pants after he rescued us from an Aggron.\" <i>\"Really?\"</i> \"yeah it's true. We might've died if not for Jaden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, well, well you're quite a hero Jaden. Saving damsels in distress left and right.\"</i> she wrapped her arms around your neck, rubbing her muzzle against your cheek. She purrs quietly, holding tightly to you. <i>\"tonight will be ours.\"</i> she murmured happily. <i>\"you may mate with him but not before me!\"</i> Sylvia insists heatedly, her eyes glowing. Mewtwo hesitates for a second, before relenting. <i>\"a-alright\"</i> she stuttered, apparently shaken up by Sylvia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mewtwo? You okay?\" <i>\"yeah she-she's very intimidating. She has so much power for one of her level. I've never felt anything like it.\"</i> \"oh yeah? Well it might be because she's not full blooded Pokemon.\" <i>\"what?\"</i> \"yeah she's half human. Her father is actually a professor in my hometown.\" <i>\"interesting\"</i> she falls silent for awhile as you walk. Sylvia, feeling left out, grabs your hand. You give it a reassuring squeeze to show you haven't forgotten her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get close to the city the number of people nearby began to increase, along with Mewtwos' concentration. You can see that she has to actively focus on her task as you enter the city. \"Don't worry we'll be at the Pokemon center soon\" you whisper. She nods gratefully, leaning on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the Pokemon center, Joy motions for you to follow her to the back room. You do as requested and enter the room, still accompanied by your Pokemon. \"Well? What goes on?\" \"Mewtwo, you can drop the shield now. She knows.\" Mewtwo ended her influence, allowing Joy to see her. \"Mewtwo, and who else?\" \"Well, Reshiram, Kyurem, Zekrom, Victini, Dialga, and Lugia.\" Upon hearing the list of your new mates, joy burst out laughing. \"I'm sorry, but you're in for a rough time buddy\" \"shut up joy, is there anything you wanted other than some gossip?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah sorry, our organization wants you to meet two of our representatives and team up to assault a team shadow base in the area.\" \"Okay thanks, if you'll excuse me i think I have a busy night ahead of me.\" \"Of course Jaden\" she snickered as you left the room. \"Mewtwo, please hide yourself for a moment, we'll be at my room in a minute. She did as you asked, hiding herself from the others. You reach your room without attracting any attention, the moment you are in and the door is closed, Sylvia forces you into a kiss. <i>\"I'll wait in the other room. See you later Jaden.\"</i> \"mmphh\" you respond receiving a giggle. Sylvia steals your attention back by licking against your lips, seeking entrance. You allow her and the night proceeds from there.</span></div></div>",

However despite my feelings for her are mutual, I feel empty inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is not right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gently push away Sylvia: \"Sylvia wait. We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia evidently annoyed: \"<i>Can't it wait? I am kind of excited here</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone is a little bitter, but I don't blame her, if anything I should have started this conversation earlier: \"I know but, we cannot continue like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia eyes widen: \"No! Not in that sense, Sylvia look at me, you were and still are my first Pok\u00e9mon, my starter and the one I love the most. Now please answer truthfully, did we ever do anything beside a few battles and fucking, not just with you the whole group, the team\" Man I am nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I am trying to tell is...I want to do something else, like I don't know a walk in the park or, just sightseeing, that kind of things. I feel trapped Sylvia, I practically haven't done anything since the beginning of my career as a trainer, and now with them, I am not feeling too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure what to say anymore, and as I want to continue my speech, I quickly found myself embraced by my mate soft fur, I can feel her sadness just like before I could feel her arousal, it's still there even now but contained for now. Knowing how strong a Pok\u00e9mon urge to mate can be firsthand, I wonder how many of my self-proclaimed mates would be willing to do that, she nearly sob even in her mind: \"<i>Jaden, I am sorry, I- was inconsiderate and-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, it's all right my love, it's all right. I just need some alone time or, at least just enjoy living, I am not denying you, later ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rapidly recovers, her emotional state is still a little off, but I'll pass soon I am sure: \"<i>Ok. What about Lyrica?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight the slutty Lyrica, well not really that slutty, it's just that if she called the shots, I bet that most of my personal time will be spent IN her till an egg pop out then repeat: \"I suppose I can make up for her, or...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">I am going to regret this</font>. I can..take you both?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view of her sharp teeth tell me everything I need to know, her tone become seductive: \"<i>I would prefer some time just the two of us, but agreed. You do know that Lyrica will pretend more than just a few humps do you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would have anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>True enough</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur walk in this small city is mostly quiet with only the toughts of my next destination keeping me focused, in fact this place is the last step before reaching Durian city, what was once just called Snow point; now certainly bigger now due to being the last urban area before crossing to the northern lands, Unova. Not even called that way anymore, 'Together we will rebuild!\u2019 nice slogan sure, now if only the politicians would deliver...wasted breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy call it Durian City anyway? It's the name an anticipation of the welcome I can expect, like the Durion Berry completely thorn covered? I know that such ice holes may strengthen character but, oh well. Hopefully the info about the strange more northern mild climate are correct and I won't freeze my ass just by breathing, although the idea of wasting TS bases will probably keep me warn for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat or vengeance whichever comes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the small city size, the market sure is crowded, let's see, sales on poke balls....antidotes...hmmm nothing interesting here. Sylvia keeps stalking me like a shadow, I walk a meter forward she does the same: \"I am not running Sylvia; relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll relax after you fucked me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what a tongue, did you want me to kiss you with such filth on your lips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I will not use my mouth later so feel free to avoid them</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see she took the delay splendidly, graciously even: \"No need to get angry over-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh but I am not angry lover, just remember that I Will gets what is Mine by right, Jaden</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my eyebrows at that: \"Yours by right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am your mate and lover. Master, as such I get dibs on your essence and it's your duty to satisfy my urges, when the need arise</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound more like a slaver then a lover, what is this thing about essence anyway? I keep hearing it but it make no sense to me, I know it's a metaphor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems angry now: \"<i>No metaphor, mates do consolidate their bond this way, our way</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't a common thing during heat season? Or well, always?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's not the same thing, mating and loving are two different thing, on heat season it's just sex, afterward it's fun, between mates it' the very proof the bond we share</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur walk brings us to the park, where hopefully I can finally relax, yeah sure: \"So when Pyrie ask to mate with me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, no. She is just an addicted slut that's all. She is loyal, just...</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High maintenance I get it, till now not that high tough, thought worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find a bench and sit, Sylvia immediately teleported at my side: \"<i>Not really, she is merely building up. After her evolution she should calm a little, but both her endurance and desire are probably increased, expect her to 'double team' you with anyone available very soon. She and Victini probably, then there is a good chance she will present at every turn until satisfied, will probably take a while to calm down</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you aren't jealous, not even a little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You can run but you cannot hide from me Jaden, no I am not, she is part of the team, she just needs some special attention that's all</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a lot of liquids I wager: \"I am not going to survive like this, one of these days mother will come to return me home from excessive sex, or a broken hips or...pffff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>None of us will ever harm you love, not on purpose at least</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow reassuring. I try to relax on the bench, forgetting all my troubles and releasing my stress as I close my eyes and breathe deeply the scent of grass and dirt, I smell them every day sure but doing it at the park when nothing is trying to fuck you or jump on you from who knows where is totally another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a voice calling me in the distance: \"Hey Jaden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeace? Now sir what kind of word might that be? Not in my dictionary for sure, It's an insult isn't it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Grammar and spelling checked by The Ever Burning Pheonix</div></span></div></div>",

The blast knocks the leaves away and sends Bayleef crashing into Mirabelle. \"I can't believe you're actually stupid enough to attack me again, especially after last time.\" You say as she struggled out from under Bayleef. \"Fuck you!\" \"Yeah yeah\" you grumble as you resume exiting the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave Mirabelles' line of sight you pull Sylvia into a deep hug. \"Thanks\" <i>\"your welcome\"</i> she nuzzles affectionately. <i>\"I've got an idea, hold on for a second.\"</i> you close your eyes and suddenly you get the weird sensation of weightlessness.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk back to the center is mostly uneventful, with the only exception of finding a mumbling Mirabelle, why she was here anyway? Right, beside finding her mumbling something about dreams and Chrystal Lake. Personally i know for certain that the only things i got from that lake are trouble and more 'duties', nice uh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before entering the glass double door of the center, a noise and a strong feeling of lust i think, attract both mine and Sylvia attention. Searching for the source of the disturbance we try to sneak as quietly as possible toward the back alley behind the center, honestly i am not particularly surprised of what we find<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Houndoom is all over a Dewott keeping her pinned face down and fucking her silly, not sure how but the Dewott is enjoying her treatment very much, or at least the moan say so. For a moment i thought to find a trainer with his pokemon fucking in the back alley but evidently i was wrong. As both me and Sylvia we turn back to give the couple a some privacy i remember of Vulcan, Rubica Houndoom, and remind myself to speak to her in the morning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course tease her that her pokemon are getting more action then she does, a lot more if the howling say anything at all. Returning to my room is no trouble at all, i ask her if it's common to find pokemon mating in the streets and she simply say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pokemon do not have the same sense of modesty that we have, still you'll never find two pokemon mating in the middle of the street no. Well unless a Bayleef is involved, Grass type are quite weak willed you see, and while they are loyal and mentally capable as any other pokemon, their idea of sex is quite..free, especially with the entity they perceive as their alpha male or female as it is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy look at me with a serious expression: \"They actively try to mate with their trainer Jaden, well many pokemon do true, but Bayleef and Meganium are literally the sluts of the pokemon world, not between themselves mind you, oh no they specifically like being involved in their respective trainers sexual life, Bulbasaur evolution tree too are behaving in a similar way, although on a lesser degree\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, caught myself a few of them flashing their sex to their respective trainers in battle, even the male one behave so, with the opposite sex at least, it's universally accepted that Grass type are actively interested in safeguarding nature and the circle of life, as such we believe they see sex as a perfectly natural thing, and mating with the strongest possible companion they can find is simply another natural instinct. Combined with their ^free^ nature..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, a trainer can command creature of all kind and types with barely any effort at all, or at least it seems that way, so..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a creature capable of controlling Fiercesome dragons and powerful Arcanine, well the Arcanine are pretty strong pokemon but for them it's even deadly, with virtually no effort at all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be incredibly powerful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, they see human or at least trainer as such, powerful beings that have the power to keep them and nature, safe, what better choice for a mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A correct assumption mostly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smile and nod: \"Enjoyed your walk? I am afraid this city does not have much to offer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has what i needed, say Joy any news from Durion City? I need to cross the mountain pass to Unova, or whatever they are called now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression become deadly serious all the sudden: \"The pass is closed, TS activity in the are forced the authority to take preventive measure just in case\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoying bastards: \"Can't the authority just gather a bunch of elite trainers and kick their ass out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and that's exactly what their are doing, but an official from the league must supervise the battle, safety measure\" A glint in her eye make her words quite suspicious: \"Actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew it would end this way: \"Let me guess, the base you spoke of before..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widen: \"You have been granted permission to lead this kind of operation from League Central Jaden, from now on you are authorized to manage this kind of situation in any way you see fit, within reason of course. Both local authority and minor officials are at your disposal, gym leader and qualified trainers included of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qualified? Aren't all trainer qualified?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a term we use for trainer that directly work fro the league, they get a few extra bonus in exchange for their service and any interesting information they may come across\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake sense i guess, what better way to get info then rumors? Just send a trainer to verify and done, you have your very own net of spy at your disposal: \"They are already waiting for me aren't they? But i don't have any experience in managing a battle of that scale or-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a melodic voice: \"Well you have to start somewhere no? Good hunting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI practically run to my room in annoyance with Joy light chuckle to jeep me company. Only after i reach the door to my room i realize that Sylvia is missing, trying to feel her presence i sense her already inside our room. I relax knowing that my lover is safe and try to get the key to enter myself, only to find it missing along with Lyrica ball<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of dread loom over my head as i gently push the door open, as i imagine the text 'Abandon hope all of sleeping ye who enter here' written over the jamb of the door. Didn't the commander always get a good night of rest before the battle? Not me, no sir<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentally check to have the balsam needed to remove Lyrica scent on my backpack, then gulp and let myself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is exactly as i left it, a messy bed, my backpack near the small window with a view on the street and an alluring Latias on her back with a Kadabra giving her oral. Yes ex- wait..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn towards the bed, Sylvia raise her hips and give me an unobstructed view of her sex, all with a moaning Lyrica as background music of sort. Resigning to my fate, i discard any lingering thoughts of sleeping and remove my clothing, then laying on the admittedly quite spacious bed, did Joy give me this room because i am an elite? Damn, Focus Jaden!<br>\r\nShaking my head of others strange ideas, i proceed to extend my tongue and begin to lick my lover sex. I feel her surprise through the link we share, she merely expected me to fuck her right away, nope, it's time to get my revenge for all her teasing, plus it's nice to finally be the one to give her a shock per say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flavor of my mate is quite peculiar, i never expected cinnamon, still i continue my ministration using my hands to pry open her treasure and tease her inner flash with the tip of my tongue, hoping to provoke a stronger reaction from my mate, i sense her pleasure but i don't feel it so having her orgasming so quickly definitely caught me ill prepared and nearly push me out the bed as a result<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering my wits i try to excuse my bad bed behavior about nearly jumping away in the middle of her orgasm, well i would have Lyrica would have not grabbed me with telekinesis, put me supine and proceed to impale herself on my rod. I externalize all my feeling in a single long moan at the tightness of her walls as she immediately begin to quickly float up und down on her own, barely giving me time to catch my breath. After, i don't know, maybe a minute maybe more, i am finally able to move properly as Lyrica telekinesis become too weak to keep me still, and grab her with all the strength i can muster at the moment, turn her with me on top and continue to fuck her at my peace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is soft and the suction applied to my cock is too damn good, i can't think properly at the moment but i am sure that fragment of thoughts about human woman being totally unable to do such thing pass in my mind here and there, only to washed away by the pleasure her flesh is giving me. I thrust harder and faster in a desperate attempt to satisfy my awakened lust but i find my effort always just a little under my needs, so i sacrifice speed in exchange for more strength uncaring of anything else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i try to kiss my my clenching mate i find my mouth invaded by Sylvia tongue, apparently in my distraction she has 'convinced' Slyrica to return the previous favor, i frankly don't care and kiss passionately my lover with ravenous hunger. As my peak get close, Lyrica walls begin to convulse in rapid contraction as her suction increase tenfold, unable to contain myself anymore, i release all my pent up lust inside the milking vent of my Latias, giving her everything i can and maybe a little more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy orgasm leave my senses stunted and when i recover, i find myself laying on my back with Lyrica at my side asleep. Only now i realize that Sylvia is still unsatisfied and more then a little pissed at my lack of attention for her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loom over my hips with her muzzle a barely cm from my face: \"<i>Well?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp down for the second time tonight: \"Round two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bet your cock on it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh man, i already see myself falling asleep on the road tomorrow</span></div></div>",

You groan as she sinks all the way down, your shaft rubbing against her soft insides. Your hand find their way to Sylvia's hips and she slowly begins to rise back up.

Feign I said anything, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is obviously unconvinced, but understanding that talking about it will lead to nothing, she just let it go: \"<i>Very well, if there is any topic you wish to discuss do not hesitate to ask, your call was very hazy and unclear, but I understand that being your first time trying to use your ability you still lack the focus necessary to speak to me clearly</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy confusion must be quite obvious given her response: \"<i>Oh dear, Jaden focus please, did you remember calling me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to seek for an answer in the tumultuous sea that are my thoughts right now, when I am awake all the frustration and resent ^my condition^ is giving me are easy to suppress, but here, here it's difficult and I can barely keep myself from screaming my anger to azure sky above me, an old music speaking of vengeance and betrayal that I know far too well is playing from every inch of this strange world, I remember to have that song on repeat in my stereo for a whole afternoon after I heard of father unjust demise <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to force out a semblance of coherent thoughts, an effort that required most of my available strength: \"I....I...don't know, me....no...I\u2026believe so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The world around us is rapidly changing, the azure sky is becoming blood red while the clouds begin to turn pitch black: \"<i>Jaden please focus, keep your emotion in check</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try, I am really trying but: \"I can't! I...want it pay...I want them Pay FOR THEIR MISTAKES!

Why I... We must suffer for Their Incompetence, Their Stupidity...I...just want it back, the time stolen from me, from all of us. From my dad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy emotions are slowly calming down, the clouds begin to happily return withe, and the land under me recover its healthy green. With my anger ebbing away, the feeling of my 'body' are returning to me, I feel hugged and looking down I see Cresselia gently hugging my form as a mother would do to a child<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's all right, it's alright Jaden, I am here.

I just find myself with my right hand a mere centimeter from Rubica face, when i reacquire the ^control^ over my body the first thing i notice is the silence, i can't hear even a bird or one of those incredibly annoying bugs cricketing in the distance, even the air seems to stand still for a moment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more surprising is Reshiram voice that break the silence \"<i>As you wish, Master</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she pronounced the word master send a shiver down my spine, it was with a mix of lust and excitement, something i didn't expected from the Bigger Sister of the Tao Trio, or any such kind of pokemon for the matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part that bothered me more than anything however, was that despite the surprise, i sort of liked it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head to see the now silent Rubica keeping an hand on the offended cheek, she seems shocked more then anything but say nothing in regard of my action, another voice, one i recognize as Uxie, suddenly begin to speak from seemingly nowhere and everywhere at once<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I do not condone unnecessary violence, but i am afraid that this time, it was necessary</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uxie?\" I try to look all around us but see no trace of the evasive legendary \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bright flash appear before my eyes, forcing me to recoil in surprise and uncomfortably land on my ass \"Ha! Fuck..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe being of knowledge continue \"<i>Sometimes Jaden you'll find yourself forced to remind others who is in charge, other times you'll have to let others speak their minds, no matter how painful it may be. Those are some of the most important traits a leader must have, regardless of it's companions nature</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly get up, thanking her 'majesty' Uxie for sharing one of her limitless pearls of wisdom \"Cheap advise, from an all knowing pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile always keeping her eyes closed \"<i>You are welcome</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmartass. \"Uxie, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile didn't fade as she gently levitate near Rubuca and seat on her shoulder, then touching the hand holding the offended cheek a gentle withe glow surround Rubica hand. Uxie then levitate in front of me, completely ignoring Rubica awed expression, i can't see clearly with the Ever Ass pokemon in the way, but i think she healed her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie still keep her amused smile \"<i>My next revelation are for your mind only Jaden</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said revelation remind me of an old joke, she is evidently playing on her role, trying to evade my question by preventing me to even voice them. Of all the legendary, she definitely earned the title of The More Annoying Pokemon Ever...After Victini of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to reply telepathically \"<i>Please, tell me that you know a way to infiltrate the base undetected</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily answer \"<i>Nope, i am here to get in your pants</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Spoilsport, i indeed know a way...but i am afraid you'll need Victini and either Mistra or Pyrie to get it done</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, both for having to bring Victini with me and due to the headache quickly resurfacing, i need to find a focus for my ability or a teacher, otherwise...meh \"<i>And why exactly should i bring that hyperactive furball with me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUxie Smile lessen slightly \"<i>Victini really, really like you Jaden, maybe even love you, in a way, do have some respect for your mate. After all, didn't she saved you from Lugia lust just a few hours ago?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd That, why i consider Uxie the Second most annoying pokemon ever, i knew she was spying, i knew it! \"<i>The day she stop slapping her pussy in my face, will be the day i begin to respect her as something more then a slut</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I fail to see the difference Jaden, didn't Mewtwo acted the same?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache is increasing and it's making me more angry by the second, still i keep myself in check, for now \"<i>Not...well, not really. It's not that i hate her, it's just...you know</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smug smile return in full force, she use her hand to touch her head \"<i>Of course i know Jaden, remember?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiseass. I stop using telepathy, the headache is killing me \"Can you at least teach me to use this damn skill 'oh great and wise one?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I would like to, but i am prohibited to tell you too much, ask Mewwto or Victini, they are more then capable to teach you i believe</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood enough i suppose. I look toward the rest of the group \"Alright, Me and Victini plus one will sneak inside the base and try to take TS by surprise, after the defense systems are disabled feel free to charge in and lay waste of anything it even remotely resemble a grunt, any question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReshiram is evidently annoyed with my decision but still nod, Rubica seems returned to her old self although quieter and nod as well, only now i realize that both Sally and Vulcan could have stopped or at least attacked me in retribution of me slapping Rubica, strangely they did not, on the contrary while Vulcan seem bored, Sally is smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose pokemon too have limits, and as Uxie said, she started to behave like a bitch and deserve it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Victini? Are you there, somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that sounded stupid, she can't hear me right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud pop at my side and there you go, a snuggling pokemon on my head it comes \"<i>Yes Jaden?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA doubt suddenly form in my head \"What about...Lugia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reply with a cheerful tone \"<i>Don't worry, she is fine. I was able to calm her down, sorta</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tone that express all my incredulity \"Do i want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Uxie and Victini \"<i>No</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..good.

Seems big enough just for a five numbers to be displayed at the same time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they was getting in when you took them down, maybe it's better this way, who know what lies behind these doors..unless\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital pad i can't hack but i don't need to, also even if Victini and probably any kind of indirect kind of psychic powers are actively blocked direct one like a psychic blast are still working judging by the pokemon of victory still floating, and if i remember something my old teacher blathering about chemistry i shouldn't have any problem both opening the reinforced door and surprise anyone inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breath slowly, trying to focus on my plan. The idea is simple, i want to use Mistra freezing power with Victini psychic to create a compressed ball of heat and air, i miss a strong ignition necessary for a real thermobaric blast, but it should be enough if Victini can compress the ball sufficiently and Mistra Icy Wind make the air dense enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the door, the fingerprints from previous users are probably still on the pad with only the correct numbers 'dirty', and if Mistra can lower the temperature enough with her breath they should become visible, then Victini should be able to use Confusion on the device. If i am right the psychic field emanated from the victory pokemon should be able to fuck up the processing unit just enough to accept the missing four numbers in a random order<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least i hope so, i never heard of a pokemon move designed to work against organics creatures to affect machines, but if anyone attempted such things out i doubt they would have told me, or anyone else for the matter, and they probably did not have a legendary available to test the theory anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mistra, try to use your breath on the digital pad and make it as cold as possible ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod and immediately begin to work on the device, her being a good meter in height, she reach the translucent pad with minimal effort<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look toward Victini, she seems quite focused \"Can you try to use Confusion on the control chip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me confused for a moment, then she understand what i try to do \"<i>I can try, but i never used such move on a machine before, i am not sure it will work</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do please try. We can still try something else later if it fail\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistra continue diligently with her work, and sure enough some of the digit start to become visible \"<i>Well...i am not an expert on human devices Jaden, but i am pretty sure that if my psychic field become too strong it may fry the internal components, or some of them at least, i think</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore i can ask \"<i>A few trainers already try to use machines against me Jaden, i am sure many attempted on Lugia and Mewtwo too. I remember Team Rocket attempted to capture mother using a robot when i was small, it certainly resisted to certain moves but..mother powers was not something to trifle with</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize what she is implying \"Machine are immune to common Psychic moves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mhm mhmm, i believe so, they was definitely immune to mother Psyshock and she told me her ability to sense other creatures actions wasn't working, but any moves that directly inflict damage or apply kinetic force are still effective, apparently even when a machine is made of steel it does not seems to have the same resistances a Steel pokemon have</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suppose it make sense, to a point at least. Maybe it's not the material, it's the life force of a steel pokemon that make it so effective against psychic moves?<br>\r\nI remember the professor at school telling us that Rock pokemon are not exactly made of rocks, similar sure but somewhat organic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your mother stole a few TM in her travels?\" Mew is famous due to her ability to learn every TM after all, in theory she should be able to use All moves provided we find a way to make a TM of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini blush \"<i>I..i am not sure...maybe. I know mother had a human lover once, maybe he-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneasel, sne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistra voice refocus us on the problem at hand, apparently she has finished. Looking at the pad i see four numbers covered with fingerprints, one being the one displayed in the screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A repeated number? Damn. Hopefully it won't matter, ready Victini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe float toward the device and place her hands on it \"<i>Ready</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Mistra \"I want your Icy Wind ready Mistra, no surprises\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistra ready herself as Victini hands glow faintly, as i approach the pad i notice the yellow led start to blink at random intervals, i take her powers is working, or doing something at least. I try to digit one number at random and then repeat the first number on display, then press the other two numbers at random<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital pad flicker and the yellow led blink very rapidly for a few seconds, Victini intensify her psychic field as her hands glow more pronouncedly. After a few more seconds with bathed breath, the yellow light become green and bip, the door unseal with a de-powering noise i don't recognize, maybe the doors where sealed magnetically? Wow, military shit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slowly open with an hiss, Mistra jump in and Victini place herself in front of me, probably trying to protect me from possible attacks. How thoughtful of her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sneasel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini remain ahead of me as i enter the room, only to realize it's not a room, it's a a small hallway with enormous windows giving on the lab, i immediately duck only to realize that probably the window are actually one way mirror. It's written on it, in Very small characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up ignoring Victini smile, at the base of the mirrors what seems to be a small intercom is present, a small red button blinking softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mirror, i can see clearly what seems to be scientist applying a strange strange machinery to the head of a restrained, sleeping Croconaw. I realize they are talking, my curiosity make me press the small red button<br>\r\n\\<br>\r\nThe intercom screech for a moment \"..s ready for the device test number L3A 537 alpha. Begin test\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon seems peacefully asleep, but suddenly it start convulsing madly \"End the test!\" The machine power down \"What the fuck? Did you re-calibrated the emitter?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other scientist tone is apologetic \"N-No! I thought Tim did i-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist that was talking before now scream \"INCOMPETENT FOOL! WE COULD HAVE LOST THIS ONE YOU IDIOT! AND FOR THE THIRD AND LAST TIME, NO NAMES! All the experiment are recorded, what if the authorities get one you imbecile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-u\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No BUTS! Now get out and calibrate the Morpheus Edictum, sho!\"<br>\r\n//<br>\r\nI shutting the intercom off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorpheus Edictum?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Morpheus is the something of dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdictum....no idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the other mirror, what i see freeze me in place. A Breloom is strapped face down on a table, her tail tied to her neck, her lips are swollen and leaking, even from a few meters i can clearly see her arousal. She is not the only one however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact there are at least another 5 or six different pokemon in similar condition, i can recognize a Bayleef, an Ampharos and even a Braviary. What the..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo scientist and a few grunts enter the room, one of them carry a big syringe full of a milky white liquid<br>\r\n\\<br>\r\n\"..nts ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the drug has been administrated correctly, we are ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" The scientist with the syringe approach the Bayleef, he attach a tube to the syringe and put it inside the pokemon vagina. A grunt turn on a monitor, a black and white scan of the pokemon canal and womb are show in it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin compatibility test L3A Z7 10, injecting Galvantula semen in Bayleef host. Notoriously incompatible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube easily travel the well lubricated grass canal and speedily reach her womb \"Injecting semen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef eyes are vacant, she barely react to the intrusion. The monitor show the semen pooling inside their victim womb and slowly fill it with an incompatible seed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass to fertility scan, waiting five minutes for result\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monitor show a series of histograms and numbers, among the name you recognize one as 'inducted fertility'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare the other subjects for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm sound in the whole base for a few seconds, then a voice on the loudspeakers \"Proximity alert, unknown surrounded the area, full lock down procedures initiated\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, forget the subject, secure the labs!\"<br>\r\n//<br>\r\nI shut off the intercom. So is this what they are doing here? A contraption capable of influencing dreams and a sort of wonder drug to eliminate incompatibility between pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSne!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Looking at the second mirror i see one of the grunt removing his pants and begin fuck the Braviary. What perplex me however is that the pokemon is thrusting back!<br>\r\n\\<br>\r\n\"That's a good bitch, yeah take it slut. I'll test the drug alright, let's see if this take!\"<br>\r\n//<br>\r\nOne grunt leave evidently disgusted, but the other quickly imitate the rapist and begin to mercilessly fuck the remaining subjects</span></div></div>",

All talk and no fact. And you still haven't justified why your grunts was breeding these pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me incredulously for a moment or two, then laugh openly for a few seconds, how annoying \"No no no, we are not attempting to crossbreed human and beast, if the grunt or any trainer really, want to have some fun with it's pokemon, why not?\" Then her tone become accusing \"Or are you telling me that you never sampled her pussy\" she look at Victini \"That your seed has never graced a pokemon womb...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continue with mirth in her voice \"Or that at least one of them haven't offered herself to you at least once, trainer. We merely want to break the limitation Arceus has put on it's race. To chose our destiny and to bring our pets with us, because that's what a pokoemn is trainer, a pet to used and abuse at our leisure, within the acceptable of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy anger flare again at her words, at her indifference \"Acceptable?! This is acceptable to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to understand my anger, how can she understand but still defend TS? \"Drug them and strap them down to a table? No. Fuck them silly if the handler wishes so? Yes. They are our servant trainer, they are more then tools, they are pet, and as such deserve all the care and the respect we can give them, but they are still ours to use as we see fit. I care for my pokemon trainer, but they are mine body and soul, and i do with them whatever i want to, as long as it doesn't kill or maim them of course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gesture toward the subjects \"This, is an unfortunate but necessary step in understanding Arceus thinking, we know he limited the pokemon so only IT could decide what genre of his kind walk the earth, we want that power as our for the change\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point it's clear what she is telling me \"You want to overthrow Arceus, control the pokemon very blood\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile wickedly \"No, not to that point, well yes but not in a sadistic way. They deserve to live their lives in relative freedom of course, as long as they know their place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had enough of her blabbering, they only want power and justify the methods with one of the worst excuses i ever heard \"I heard enough of your mad rambling about change, you all just want power as Team Rocket, Team Galaxy and all the others that has come before you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems genuinely sad \"A pity. We could have used someone like you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sense Victini charging her power, she place herself ahead of me and ready herself for battle. I know i am at disadvantage but i will win this, i must<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we begin trainer, i believe it's fair for you to know that this device\" she point at the purplish thing \"protect me from psychic influence, so forget about using your Victory pet to attack me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFair to know? Does TS even know what honor is? Not now Jaden! Focus, i placed myself in a bad situation by saving these pokemon, i could have waited a better moment but...no it's was for the best. Beside even if her device protect her against most Victini powers, it should be ineffective against Mistra ice, unless she leave a pokemon here to cover her escape of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTulsa remove a ball from her belt, she seems to have only three of them \"Samurott, fight for your mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nod, it's my turn to smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to kick soma shadow ass\"</span></div></div>",

I lift my hand as to ask a question to a teacher \"Ehm, not that i have anything against double battle but..\" I use my finger to make a circular motion as indicate all around us \"Isn't our battlefield a little to small for, that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman look at me with an annoyed expression \"So what? Scared of closed space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my eyebrow for a few seconds before shrugging \"Whatever, come on Victini, it's our turn\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy legendary seems quite happy to fight for me \"<i>Finally! I was itching to burn a few grunts!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure if Victini was serious about burning a few grunts, but after i saw how they treat their experiment, i am not sure i care enough anymore to prevent them to get burned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on my opponent, i quickly notice how she is carefully observing the lab walls, apparently despite her reluctance in admitting my objection, she recognize that a double battle in such closed space will be difficult, especially for her Dragonair. Despite all she still smile \"You know kid? It's refreshing to find a trainer that understand how official rules means nothing in the field\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the four move limit i presume, we are are not in an official battle and as such, i will use my team to the best of their and mine ability\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckle, her anger forgotten \"Do you believe that the last trainer i dueled complained about me using all the moves i could instead of just four? Ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recover her serious expression \"Enough blabbering then, Umbreon Faint Attack Victini, Dragonair Light Screen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair focus for a moment before opening her mouth as if screaming and a barrier made of translucent cyan light appear before it and envelop both pokemon, the Umbreon smartly await for the protection activating before charging Victini, thus giving me a good second and half to prepare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick Attack Victini, Mistra Screech\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that this strategy will still make Victini get a full hit but, as much as it pain me to admit it, part of my strategy to deal with the Umbreon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ordered Mistra begin to grind her claws together generating a sound like a thousand bugs buzzing in my ears, Victini smartly place her hands on her ears and protect herself from the infernal noise by making her hands glowing purple, she probably deafened herself for the few seconds the sound was made, all while glowing white and slamming her body elbow first in the Umbreon just under it's throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon evidently accuse the blow and feel the pain from it's weakened defenses, but still carry on and jump towards the withdrawing Victini with both front legs outstretched and slam them in her shoulder, all while the Dragonair recover from her Light Screen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini return to my side and the Umbreon to hers, i notice the dark pokemon pained expression after the blow, Victini doesn't seems fazed by the attack she just received but i know she is just better at pretending then her adversary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTulsa just call another move \"Foul Play, Dragonair Flamethrower that popsicle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's the right moment \"Brick Break the Umbreon, Mistra Agility and dodge it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, i should have taught Mistra to Surf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair move quicker then expected and unleash a torrent of fire towards Mistra, she barely have the time to focus on her move and escape, not unscathed however as the fire still glance her left 'hand', leaving her with a nasty burn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon similar to Mistra, do not have the time to charge it's move as Victini glow white once more and close the distance so quickly i barely see her moving, then she slam her right hand down the surprised pokemon head, breaking the Light Screen amd slamming it's face to the ground interrupting it's charge. I was lucky the Umbreon stood still while charging, if not hitting it after a Quick Attack would have been somewhat difficult due to the speed and the inability to make quick turn while using it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini grin and return to me as soon as her move is done, leaving the Umbreon stunned and bleeding from it's mouth, but still in the fight. That's was a lot more brutal than i expected for sure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair continue to use her Flamethrower and attempt to reduce Mistra mobility by getting closer, Victini intervene by placing herself in the path of the flames and effectively interrupt the attack, the flame seems to have little to no effect to her. Mistra jump back and return to my side, the Dragonair try to 'sidestep' Victini and instead end up facing me a lot closer then i liked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how Victiny could have been fooled so easily but nonetheless the pokemon stop<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini immediately float in front of me as to shield me from a possible attack, but nothing happen. The Dragonair head assumed a lower posture that permitted her to dodge quickly when she attacked Mistra before, thus her head is approximately at my stomach height and Victini is protecting me by facing the pokemon directly, me being taller however permit both me and the dragon poke to see each other clearly as Victini invisible barrier do not reflect light<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected her to try to attack anyway or attempting to 'sidestep' us again, instead she look into my eyes as if bewitched. Then it speak \"Draa air\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel perplexed as the awkward silence persist, only after a few more moments i notice Tulsa screaming orders to the Dragonair, which the pokemon completely ignore, then it simply slither away and return to her mistress side, pensive look on it's feature<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly at that point i notice Mistra chuckling at my side interrupted only by a small ep of pain at moving her damaged 'hand'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini return to her position \"<i>My my Jaden, seriously?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTusla ordering her team recall me to the present \"Confuse Ray and Facade, Move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that Mew gave a few good TM to her daughter i order \"Substitute! Mistra Faint Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini glow purple and an exact copy of her appear a few cm head of her just as the confuse ray reach her, parrying the attack. I look at Mistra and notice how she is still at my side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistra what are you..\" looking ahead of me i notice how the Dragonair hasn't moved an inch, it's eyes as contemplating my body. Creepy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy opponent is obviously angered by the dragon pokemon inaction, but it ignore her as if she wasn't even there \"What kind of trickery is this?!\" She throw away a ball \"I knew i should have used my team, ugh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy team? \"It's not yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took these two in the labs, no idea to who we stole them from. Fine, i can't beat a legendary alone, next time kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe throw something to the ground, a black smoke cloud my vision for a few seconds and when it clear, both her and the Umbreon are gone, the Dragonair left behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry Jaden, I'll get her!</i>\" Victini float away as the door seal behind her, an artificial voice echo in the lab \"Warning, contaminant detected, low level decontamination in progress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA orangish light pass left and right across the whole lab, Mistra reach the table where the subject are strapped to and slowly free them one by one. I look toward the door hoping to find a way to unlock it, but instead i find myself face to face with the Dragonair. I try to jump back but i find myself already in it's gentle spire, it place it's forehead on mine careful to avoiding the horn and look at me in the eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draa air draaa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure i just nod and a smile appear on her lips. Her body shift around me and remove her head from mine, she then bring her tail and one of it's under spire close and begin to massage it with the tip of her tail. It doesn't take long for a slit to appear and tell me that this particular Dragonair is a female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp as only now i connect the dots and realize what happened. My Dragon type affinity has..\"Draa air\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe use her tail to slightly penetrate her slit a few times before extracting it a licking it clean. Her vent lips are now clearly visible and i admit, the scene of her preparing herself for me is arousing. I try to call for Mistra help, but i hear her laughing madly at my expense as she carefully free the various pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair smile deepen as she lower her head and tail to my pants, trying to remove them. My objection is quickly silenced as she place her vent on my lips, forcing me to taste and smell her tangy arousal</span></div></div>",

I struggle to keep my emotion in check as my cock slowly journey inside the tight pussy of yet another pokemon, she instead openly approve of the feeling as she look at me lovingly and again gently, invite me to look as i claim her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer walls tighten and relax around my organ continuously, inviting me deeper, just a little more, a little more until i feel her wet lips touching my skin. She exhale softly and slow down her inner muscle, apparently enjoying the feeling of being filled by me. I don't take more then a few more moments before she begin to remove my hard flesh from her bumpy tunnel, in fact only now that i can't keep my muscle stiff as a rock anymore in my attempt to subjugate the pleasure her body is undoubtedly giving me, i can again feel my extremities, penis included, and only now i realize that her walls are neither soft nor smooth, her insides are sort of hardened with small bumps on the more deeper part<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my (dis)pleasure her tunnel is very effective in squeezing out from me both pleasure and my own liquids. I grit my teeth in both anger and sadness at my condition, she appear puzzled at my reaction but she still do not relent and continue to slowly extract my cock from her insides only to welcoming in again a little more swiftly then before<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to turn my head towards that chuckling betraying scum that is my pokemon and take a small measure of satisfaction in telling her \"Forget about mating for the rest of your natural life, Sneasel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chuckle immediately stop and i grin at her stunned expression, then i find myself forced to grit my teeth again as the Dragonair decide that the game are over and it's time to take this mating seriously by clenching her insides viciously, not enough to harm me but more then enough to get my attention. Turning towards her i find myself face to face with the smiling mate as she quicken the peace of her pushing, she try to kiss me but i turn my head the other side and avoid at least that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe being the 'malleable' creature she is, simply change the position by keeping me fully inside her and shifting her coils so that we are face to face again, then she resume our mating like nothing happened. i start to feel my 'emotional armor' cracking both from the pleasure she is giving me and the expression of sadness she now wear. She is genuinely care about me, or at least that what my instincts are telling me, and she do not understand why giving herself to me so fully do not seems to draw my interest towards her, or why i appear so angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a pang of compassion resurfacing under the pile of emotion i am experiencing right now, so against all the odds i simply ask her a question, a question that sounded a lot better in my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Dragonair? What..ugh, do you hag....from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rhythm slow down to a crawl, then she simply place her forehead on mine just like before and softly speak<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"air..drag..dragonair...draaair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then surprise me by kissing me on the lips with a sweetness that left me completely astonished. Her kiss is very delicate and loving, there is passion in it sure, but is affection what it remind me the most. I feel lost and weightless for a moment, she then interrupt our kiss leaving a string of saliva connecting our mouth. As soon as the kiss is over her forehead return on mine and she return to focus her attention on our mating, quickening the peace and blatantly moaning in my face, showing me how much she appreciate my cock spearing her insides<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tightness and incredible muscle control are quickly bringing me to my orgasm, despite having sex with Mewtwo only a few hours ago my resistance is already crumbling, a sign of my still relative inexperience maybe, or perhaps her tight pussy is to blame, nonetheless my attempt to delay the inevitable are only marginally successful, until she surprise me once again by orgasming before me by the seconds, her insides tighten mercilessly and relentlessly, her suction before nearly unnoticeable now increase tenfold, making me release a grunt of pleasure just before releasing my seed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair voice what i can understand as an hight pitched moan of pleasure as my seed bathe her womb spurt after spurt, she keep her forehead on mine and smile happily as she coax my essence in her body with every contraction of her pussy. Even after a good minute my reserve got emptied she still try to milk me fro a few more drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally accept that i have nothing more to give only after attempting to literally squeeze my flesh by contorting her body slightly, creepy..and somewhat painful too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mate finally release her grip and allow my ass to fall on the cold ground before encompassing my body with her own, once again she place her sex on my now flaccid cock and grind, probably attempting to revive my organ for another go. I have to delude her however as my body is tired from her and Mewtwo mating, having still not yet fully recovered from that one, so my body is not exactly at peak condition and my last 'conquest' endeavor have not helped me the recovering process either<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the best authoritative tone i can muster \"Stop.....stop\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe place her head on my shoulder and nod, halting her sexual approach, at least for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artificial voice i heard before the lab sealed speak again \"Contaminant removed. Unsealing lab...please wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange light i have even forgotten was there vanish, and i hear the main door unseal...with Victini floating inside like a flash of lightning<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jaden! Are you alright?!

But for the answer Jaden, yes it's your affinity but what you may not yet understood it's that, the more the pokemon is close to it's element the stronger is the pull toward you, male will be more friendly while female...you got it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe someone already told me something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini nod \"<i>Yes, but what she forgot to mention is that the ability of the above mentioned pokemon to resit your pull is to exert it's will and most importantly, it's discipline. That means that while pokemon close to their own element are attracted to you, pokemon trained by a human Should be able to resist your influence, or at least to a point, if they don't really try to resist or their will is weakened somehow..well, Sally is one of your mate so i am sure you got that part</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And the other exception is the youngest. Wild pokemon have less discipline then trained one so it's harder for them to resist you pull, also young pokemon are incapable of resisting your pull having little to no discipline at all, well not always but, mostly. Just don't give them reason to believe you are interested and everything Should end peacefully. Probably</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh \"Fine, and my actual condition is connected to you argument because..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I see. You didn't know Jaden, that explain it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated \"Explain what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>She is very young Jaden, barely two weeks old i believe. Accelerated growth you would call it i think, her mind is however one of a child with practically no discipline at all.

Sorry, it's just..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems quite angry and frustrated \"What i saw in those laboratories was, monstrous.

Have you seen what they did back there? They-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sound calm, annoyingly calm right now given the argument \"Yes, i know. We know. But as i have said, it's nothing in comparison of what Team Rocked wanted to do, to both our species, you see Jaden, despite my resent, my hate for them, i must admit that Team Shadow tend to care for their pokemon, they are cruel sometimes yes, and they couldn't care less about our opinion, but they would never tolerate a trainer abusing his own pokemon, well, beside use it as a cum dumpster i mean, it's bad, but it's far from the worst fate one of us could encounter. They also severely prohibits beating or otherwise mistreating a pokwmon without reason, which is far more then some official of the league enforce as rules\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continue \"Also, keep in mind that many of us are..somewhat interested in having an intimate relationship with our master or mistress.

I don't think she would need to be strapped tough. Well, maybe if he don't satisfy her things may get, difficult but...oh, you were joking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't even know he has a sister! Oh dammit \"....no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ok. Do you wish to meet my sister then?

Ah forget it \"Isn't it weird for you to offer me your sister like that? It's, kinda strange no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrug \"No it's not, As i have said, she need a strong dominant male to keep her in line, Cresselia know if she hasn't caused quite the trouble already, a trainer is the perfect solution for her, and the rest of my family, believe me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooookeeeey, i got another weird one \"I'll, eh, think about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not really<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nod again \"I hope so, she is really starting to get on my nerves. Now about the mission, as i have mentioned it may be a trap, and probably he is prepared for trouble but, i don't think he'll stand a chance against your team, do please try to get him back in one piece, i know you hate him for being a TS member and for what he may have done but he was not the lead scientist nor he had any real decision power if the information we got are exact, in fact we believe he was little more then an archivist, so go easy on him. Just a few bones ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't tempt me little mon, don't...little mon? Where did this come from?! Argh, Mesprit that damn bitch and her boon!

You seems tense\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathe slowly and calm myself down \"I am fine, do not conc- do not worry, it was just the stress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't seems fully convinced but he drop the argument anyway \"If you say so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity come back as i notice the 3d map again \"What are those black areas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe look at the map \"Those? We don't now yet, those room posses a small version of the inhibitor field generator that covered the whole base before your assault, we are unable to force the door open or otherwise crack the security code, no override attempted until now has worked. We believe it may contain their most valuable specimens or maybe even a few successful hybrids, although the latter is highly unlikely. Leave it to us, we will find a way, and besides you have far more important matter to attend to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my anger spike for a moment, how these puny pokemon dare to tell me what i should and what i shouldn't care about?! Insolent-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spike.

You sure you don't want to meet my sister? Her fighting type and skills would it be a tremendous boon to your party\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI exhale annoyed, my annoyed expression pass unobserved by him however \"Thanks but no thanks, i think to have gotten enough 'boon' for the moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly truer words were ever spoken.

Don't worry for the trainer she speaking about, their are both being treated for minor concussion as we speak\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the humor i can muster \"Nice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Lucario turn and face me, her tone slightly more upbeat \"<i>Thanks, i appreciate recognition from my potential trainer, also i am glad to hear that the voice about your famed promiscuity are false</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Ehm sure, Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe face her opponent again, the Zoroark angrily \"Leave my trainer alone blueass! Find your own pole to ride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's nearly scary how cold and calm the Lucario 'voice' is\"<i>Typical, only a pokemon of the lowest tier would try to entice a trainer with sex</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoroark reply even more pissed \"It was just the first stage of my plan! He wasn't supposed to fall for it and he didn't! Now stand aside bitch, me and my future trainer are busy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You'll go nowhere, want to prove your worth? Fight me then, show your prospective trainer what you can do</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring one hand to my temple, vainly trying to massage away the headache i know will soon be there \"Do i have any say in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the Lucario on my right and the Zoroark to my left amusingly say \"Nope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wonderful day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario \"Wait until my sister discover your dominant side\" He laugh \"If you push her as you pushed me earlier, well, if she behave anything like mother you can very well  forget sleeping for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mate Zoroark continue \"I am afraid the same can be said for Liliana, once she decided to do something any attempt made to change her mind are doomed to fail, no matter what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, nearly exasperated \"But i don't need Another pokemon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at me amused, like i was a five year old boy who's mother just explained an universal truth. Suddenly a flash of genius appear in my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if leave? They will stop right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario \"They will probably track you down\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care, my pokemon will protect me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark \"From this? No, they wont. It's not a matter of strength, after all your legendaries can easily crush both my cousin to paste at their actual level of power. But pokemon rarely interfere with mateship, if you want to say no, you have to do it yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i have to face them both alone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nod. Lucario \"Unless they threaten you or your family, other mates and so on directly, yes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This day is getting better and better\"</span></div></div>",

She is incredibly cute when asleep, now if she could just remove that damn bone helm or at least not push her weight on a protruding spike<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to get up, quickly discovering that in my actual position it's practically impossible due to the combined weight of my team plus one legendary.

Anger, Lust, Rage, all these emotion and a few more, are capable of empowering the pull you exert against pokemon, willingly or not.

To a point, better then a wild poke for sure, but they too have a limit and the more angry you'll become, the stronger your pull will be.

To become my personal psychologist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile, the sadness vanished from her voice \"<i>In a manner of speaking, i can shield you from your nightmare and at the same time help you by strengthening your personality when necessary. Cresselia then should be able to help you face your darker emotion and put them to rest, her skill in dealing with nightmares are legendary, literally</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head at her bad pun \"I presume you wish something in exchange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod \"<i>You bet, as you know we legendary cannot exactly choose our own mate, it must be assigned by Arceus or by element affinity</i>\" I nod \"<i>As you have probably guessed, i have been left with no possible match at all, condemning me to leave alone without any chance to find a mate to love. He, ironic no?

Sure maybe in the end your so called boon may even help me accomplish my goals, but i believe that beside the rule part, everything else was a lie. Admit it, it's You that want me more aggressive and dominant with your species, you are not the only legendary that has this particular kind of taste in males, most of the other legendary has at some point or another, mentioned or otherwise proved this with their acting or while mating. Am i wrong, oh great pokemon of emotion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stall for a few moment before sighing \"<i>Alright, alright, you got me. Yes, after being venerated as an Untouchable sort of god, and after having to endure Arceus rules for centuries i started to desire for nothing more then a mate strong enough to make me submit, making me beg to be fucked and used in any way he wished. Alas with age came wisdom, and pain, more then enough to recognize that no human, no matter how strong, could have forced me and the others to yield at his might, so we decided to...enhance you a little, not enough to compromise your mental integrity but more then enough to change your personality to better suit our needs</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I will not even pretend to be sorry Master, but know that everything else i told you is true, both about your affinity and Cresselia help, call me if you need me Master, and good morning!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel myself falling, an eternal impenetrable darkness surround me from all sides, i want to scream but i have no voice. Just as i begin to seriously worry for my ass, i wake up with a jump, i literally jump on my feet, launching the poor sleeping Victini against the wall and rudely waking up my whole team<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt take a good minute to calm down, and another ten to explain my unpleasant meeting with Mespirit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyrica embrace me \"<i>Poor Master, never a moment to rest</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was unexpected, and quite hypocritical coming from her, but i don't complain, i needed a good hug right now. She release me and float with the others, now more then ready to leave. I recall back all but Tierra and Pyrie before walking out of the cave, promising myself to find a real bed or at least recover my sleeping bag from Rubica, hopefully she know where my backpack is, damn it<br>\r\nGetting out of the cave it's easy, eluding the two smiling pokemon waiting for me is not. I really, really don't need this right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the Lucario and the Zoroark are patiently waiting for me to acknowledge their presence, which reluctantly i did<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario \"<i>Morning master Jaden, we wished to extend our apology for our previous unacceptable behavior, we beg you for another chance at proving our worth</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark \"What she said, so uhm, sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why all this beg this and forgive that, it's because i am famous? Because i have a few legendaries at my command? Speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Of course master Jaden, only a very talented and extremely skilled trainer could have accomplished so much in so little time. Your superior stile could only benefit any pokemon you may consider worthy enough to follow you master Jaden, and let's not forget your first gym battle where your Kadabra has lifted a whole building like nothing. All clear sign of your talent master, many pokemon would be honored to fight for you</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoroark nod wholeheartedly \"What she said, plus to keep so many powerful pokemon in line you must also be quite something in bed too\" She conclude winking, and promptly receive a blow in the head by the Lucario. Like her brother hasn't admitted that she too hoped for something similar later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enought both of you! If you wish to prove your worth, help me localize a TS fugitive.

Haven't gotten shit about what she said but okay it worked. Victini crouch in mid air, i can feel the heat emanating from her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archivist doesn't take long to understand what's going on \"Banette stop! Come ba- Damn you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanette charge forward Shadow Ball in hands, completely disregarding it's trainer orders, meanwhile i finally notice where Mewtwo concealed herself, she is levitating towards a few trees along this small practicable path, i think she is waiting for the right moment, Mewtwo is nothing if not thorough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy opponent quickly become desperate, understanding that without the ghost type advantage even with Yanmega and Espeon the battle will probably not turn in his favor against a legendary, also if he doesn't have any other pokemon with him it's unlikely he is going anywhere, especially if he doesn't carry a weapon of some sort, wild pokemon so deep in the wilderness are not exactly friendly after all<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn towards Tierra for a moment intent on order an attack, when a cyan/crystal like ray appear from behind me and strike the archivist on the shoulder, freezing it. Apparently this was the moment Mewtwo was waiting for as she propel herself in the air and jump down hand closed on the poor fool<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy opponent scream in pain as the super powered pokemon strike his frozen shoulder hard, probably breaking it, slamming him on the ground, the inhibitor device crumble in pieces just like it's master. A blast and a pressure coming from Victini tell me that she collided with the Bannette, a quick glance also reveal Victini over the unmoving ghost type with her victory posture, showoff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Espeon and the Yanmega turn towards Mewtwo just as another attack i now recognize as Ice Beam strike the bug pokemon on the back, turning it into a frozen statue worthy of a winter garden. The Espeon instead of attacking kneel down scared, evidently trembling. Defeated without even beginning to fight it seems, knowing how certain TS grunts treat it's pokemon i almost feel guilty for having fought against it, almost<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTierra however sound pissed despite our victory \"Maro!

What give? Why i suddenly- off. Damn ghost! I hate those thiiiings!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo chuckle amused \"<i>How predicable of you, didn't you knew that some Banette has awoke their power completely and are able to place a limited curse on the pokemon that strike it?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wha?! Bu..no! What curse?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's both temporary and short lived, it's power is somewhat unpredictable and undependable, when it works it's dark energy are capable of sealing away part of the attacker strength, normally it merely disable a specific attack pattern but, for us psychic our power also determine our physical capabilities more then in other types thus it also mean becoming a little weaker</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was Mewtwo teacher mode\u2122, nice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>....bugger. Oh well in that case my trainer will be more then happy to help his <b>Hurt</b> pokemon in need, right?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really, really wanted to say no knowing what she really meant, but she did got weakened protecting me so, reluctantly \"Fine, but no funny ideas Vicy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini propel herself towards me and push me back a more then a little when she embrace me \"<i>Ooh but you will like this, promise</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no i won't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring our amiable conversation, our mysterious helper make it's appearance as Tierra walk toward the scared Espeon to secure it. While the attack type should have been quite the pointer, i never expected to see the shy Kyurem walking from behind the trees<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Kyurem, you got them good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe come closer, but as before she kept her shy attitude \"<i>I..mhhhm, was just helping, Mewtwo suggested the strategy mhm, it's..fine Master</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile \"Of course Kyurem, nice job. Come now, there is a certain archivist i wish to speak with\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Of-..of course</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to walk towards my prey, only to find it gripped by the neck by what seems to be a disgusted Mewtwo \"<i>What do you wish to do with him, Master</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of things, all bad i assure you. But just as i open my mouth to speak, my pokegear start ringing, i swear one of these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and grab the annoying device and press the accepted call button, Joy, the crazy one from her look, appear on screen, oh boy what it is Now \"Yes? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appear quite nervous \"Jaden! Thanks Arceus i got through, Where are you?! My last three call got rejected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dear Joy, commencing our conversation while thanking Arceus for anything already detracted 10 points, and another 5 for screaming at me for something i have no control over \"Charming as always Joy, and yes i fell fine thanks for asking, always nice to see a friend worry about you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe become irritated \"Mph, as if! With all those muscles you bring about it's a miracle you haven't conquered the league already, a few grunts surely are no threat to your group\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head in disapproval, i agree that my pokemon are strong, but strength alone it's like bravery, without wisdom or patience to temper it an early demise is all you get \"But of course Joy, how stupid of me. Now what are you bothering me with this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignore my remarks and become deadly serious \"We don't know what exactly happened, but Acuity lake has been tainted by something, it appear to have made the local pokemon horny and..and..they attacked a few humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clack my tongue \"So that's where the missing vials are gone to, fuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy apparently heard me \"What? What vials? What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Joy, how did you get your position if you lose it like this. It's simple, TS mixed a sort of drug to force pokemon in an sort of heat like state, it should have also permitted them to breed with any other pokemon no matter the group. They failed on the latter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy calm down and breathe \"Okay, so it was you that helped the ranger to assault the last TS base we found, good, without you i am not sure they would have succeed before TS vanished into thin air. As for the drug..there is an antidote or something? Any idea how it's was made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No to both I'm afraid, they merely fucked the pokemon silly until the effect whore off, i think, maybe in one of the still sealed vault...no matter, an antidote when can't touch is an antidote we don't have. I'll call on Lugia powers and hope she can do something about the water, no promises\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nod \"It will have to do, I'll call for more support, a specialized team will be there in four hours at best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i will be there in..\" I check the map function, as i remembered it's not far \"one hour top\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, keep me posted Jaden\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut down the communicator function and sigh \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">No rest for the wicked</font>, come on girls we are moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictini place herself on my chest making me carry her like a baby \"<i>Mmmh you smell nicely Master</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i don't, and now do please shut it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But it's tr-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push your luck, Victy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Awwwww, alright</i>\" She snuggle comfortably in my arms, the little minx, oh I'll get her for this. Mewtwo efficient as always have already gathered the Banette and Yanmega ball recalling them in, the Espeon reluctantly come closer under the threat of Tierra weapon of choice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what i am gonna do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to my surprise the Espeon reply sheepishly with a Male voice! Hurray i don't have to fuck this one too! I was seriously beginning to believe that male pokemon gotten extinct!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nothing?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it seems strange, and it is! But hearing this Male pokemon talking to me, and not begging to be fucked, fill me with joy. Mother was right, the little things are always the one you'll miss the most \"Nope, how about a crazy nurse caring after you instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems uncertain if i am joking or not, unfortunately for him i am not \"<i>Will i be able to feed without a female trying to hump me into oblivion?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile like a Sharpedo that has just saw a nice succulent prey, oh how i know your pain \"No promises, but I'll see what i can do\"</span></div></div>",

I ordered the girls to keep helping the rangers in unsealing the remaining doors, who know what kind of mess it's hidden in those rooms, it could be even more of this drug or another substance of some kind, it may even be nothing and we a re just wasting our time while TS agents retreat somewhere safely.

I feel her walls rhythmically contacting and inviting me in, but it's like a distant echo in an empty valley barren of colors. I feel myself questioning how such and ancient creature could be so fitting for me, how her sex seems perfectly modeled on my own but, that thought too is distant and insignificant, like any other passing emotion incapable of fueling my insatiable lust<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this how those drugged pokemon felt?

As i get up the only sound i hear all around me are a few pokemon still relentlessly mating and the disapproving sound Reshiram is doing \"<i>That was incredibly stupid Lugy, i know you are desperate but this?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia voice is calm and collected, with a tip of annoyance filtering in \"<i>I repeat it once more Reshiram, you interrupted My Mating!

I don't know you Lugy but this is not how i imagined our family to be, not like this</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia remain silent for a few minutes \"<i>...i...i should not have used the drug, i admit my mistake on that.

I bet Mespirit is involved, her and her damn powers, stupid witch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain my hand radiated in my brain was expected, the Lucario looking at me with adoration was not. She look at me in the eyes before blushing and lowering her head \"<i>I am..sorry Master, please forgive my transgression. I am at your complete disposal</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tighten and release my fist a few times, try to discern if i have broken something, luckily not. Then her brother smile and leave, i want to call him back but his sister intercept me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What do you wish of me master?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel Lyrica laughing in my head once more, she then proceed to float away without saying anything with a mischievous smile on her muzzle<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to shake off the Lucario by walking at the edge of the camp, just as the forest begin. She dutifully follow me like a shadow no matter what. It takes nearly a good quarter hour before my bother transform into anger and i leash on her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly turn around and try to gram the Lucario hands, she react by instinct and try to execute a round kick, but i don't know how manage to grab her from behind and push her on a tree. I expected her to struggle, instead she moan as i slam her body on the hard bark. She place her hands on the tree and push her hips back towards mine, my body move on it's own as i grab her hips and slowly descend to her sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moan as i bite her neck and my hand reach her rapidly soaking pussy, i feel the moisture with my fingers as i spread her lips apart. Her breathing quicken as she push herself against me with fervor, inciting me to do more then touching<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice is thick with lust and desire \"<i>P-please Master, please</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own voice seems coming from somewhere deep, i can barely recognize it as mine \"Please? You dare to demand something from me slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself like in an invisible cage, i can see and hear, feel and touch, but i can't do anything else. I begin to panic and the same rage i felt so many times now compel me to scream with all my anger and frustration to the images in my mind. I punch the wall of my cage repeatedly with more and more strength each time, i don't feel pain only an ever consuming fire that is burning every other emotion to ashes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>N-no, Master</i>\" she moan cutely \"<i>I a-am your aaah! <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Please Master breed me claim me!</font></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my right hand finger parting the Lucarion pussy and my right reaching for my pants. Inside my cage the temperature is quickly raising, a few flicker of a black all consuming flame begin to appear on my wrist, i scream as loud as i can as the fire envelop me completely, consuming every emotion i know and the only thing i feel...is hate. The black flame envelop my vision until i find myself in control of my body again, the tip of my cock caressing the lips of the Lucario pussy, she is literally drooling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my body return mine again i push myself away form the bending Lucario and punch the back of her head with my fists. She collapse to the ground unconscious, i fall on my ass as i lose my balance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing i do is noticing how tired i feel, my own breathing is labored and i feel completely empty. My cock slowly return to it's relaxed state in the few minutes that pass. I continuously look at my hands, half expecting they somehow ignite themselves with the same flame that consumed me in my mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need nearly half hour to calm down, adjust my pants and clean up the Lucario pussy with a few stray of soft grass. She remain unconscious the whole time, and now i don't know if i should feel aroused or confused, i would not care if i cold only felt something, anything, even boredom, but for some reason i can't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to carry the Lucario on my shoulder and return back to camp. I am not sure how i am going to explain what happened, but perhaps it's better if i simply do not. I feel my logical self more then ever now, i can think so fast that i feel like an alien in my own body, and strangely the lack of emotion doesn't seems so...bad anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring my brief walk toward camp i decided to tell Lucario she was knocked unconscious by a playful Aipom that dropped on her head, i will deny any kind of sexual activity between us and she should hopefully believe it's was all a dream. My logical side remind me that this ideas while not perfect, it's more then acceptable given the circumstances, and perfectly believable as Aipom are known trickster and usually friendly when not provoked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy train of thoughts is interrupted by the Lucario stirring, a small flash of emotion begin to surface in me once more and i feel worried for a few moments as my logical side slowly relent it's absolute reign to every other piece of my mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lower the Lucario to the ground as she wake up, her eyes show confusion and then adoration as she focus her sight on me \"<i>Master, what-</i>\" she grunt in pain \"<i>My head...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had all the time to prepare my role while she slept, so i have no hesitation or doubts \"You had me worried for a moment, that Aipom got you good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face reflect the confusion she is feeling \"<i>Aipom? There was no-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"Yes there was, don't you remember? You followed me pretty much like a shadow and as i turned to give you piece of my mind the Aipon dropped on your head like a rock. Knocked you out cold. The little bastard laughed the whole time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But..didn't..you</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my poker face as best i can \"Hm, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained still for a few moments, then she look down frustrated \"<i>Nothing</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"Alright, can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe get up and latch herself at my side \"<i>Maybe i need a little help</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my eyebrow at her as she smile happily. I shrug  \"Fine by me\"</span></div></div>",

How it contract and stretch? That definitely a female, trust me i have worked in a daycare before and i can recognize a birdy in heat when i see one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wast no time to retort, given her voice a grin is probably plastered on her face \"So you stared at needy pokemon undertail all day uh, did some offered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reply strangely serious \"Of course they did, a female at the peak of her heat is not too prickly in who is helping her cope with it, pokemon or human make little difference in their addled mind, in that state for them a male is male, period. And yes that's positively a cloaca, no idea why it's on a Charizard tough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer shunted her up form a few moments, i had really hoped the argument was over \"Really now? Did seeing a bluish contracting hole dripping yellowish substances aroused you that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat with the scientifically correct analysis now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blink a few times \"Bluish..no, and their secretion is transparent or light cyan, the one of some electric pokemon is yellow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation is suddenly interrupted by a deep growling sound that attract my attention back on the creature, the stupid ranger now frozen in fear keep the black tail hight, giving me a perfectly unrestricted view of the creature genital area<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my disinterest i end up giving a look anyway, can't really avoid it in my position and i admit the last part of the argument did piqued my curiosity a little. The creature undertail is indeed occupied but a single hole that can probably be classified as a cloaca, it's not as big as the girl wanted us to believe, probably not much bigger then Sally sex and she is a Salamence so i suppose it's normal given the creature size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips are indeed bluish and she is copiously leaking an yellowish-orange liquid of easily discernible origin, probably another victim of TS wonder drug.

Reshiram and Zekrom were both airborne, having avoided the earthquake entirely. \"Dragon pulse!\" You call out as you rise to your feet. Both the dragons fire white and purple beams from their mouths. The beams hit the Charizard, creating an explosion that pushed you backwards. \"Dragon Claw! Finish it!\" Resiram raised a wing and Zekrom an arm, Both began to glow with a purple energy. Once the light reached its brightest, both dragons rushed forward creating an X-shaped pair of slashes that pounded into Charizard, forcing it to the ground and creating a crater beneath. You watched on as the Charizard laid in the hole, waiting to see if it would move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It doesn't take long for the beast to get up with another bestial roar of fury, this pokemon has been evidently molded to be a machine of pure power and strength, a few attacks no matter how strong, will not be sufficient to take it down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Legendary stand side by side completely unimpressed by the fury this new pokemon seems to posses, but my link with Zekrom tell me a different story, while not scared she is still weary of this opponent, she know this creature will not be an easy target like the rest of TS more common pokemon. Her instinct tell her the same thing i suspected since the beginning of this fight, this creature has been created with the sole intent of rivaling a legendary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd possibly, surpass it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment fragments of the creation of Mewtwo come to mind, but i refocus knowing that our adversary will not wait for my mind to settle, and as expected she make the first move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature decide to use what seems to be a Flamethrower towards Reshiram, this means that while powerful her knowledge of battle and tactics are scarce at best, and as expected Reshiram simply take the attack head on without any visible consequences. Admittedly the heat make me flinch a little despite my legendary having completely absorbed the move and being in front of me acting as a shield, don't want to even imagine what such flame can do to a man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reshiram Blue Flare, Zekrom can you use Light Screen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black Legendary chuckle softly, replying with a smug tone \"<i>Of course i can, what did you believe i trained into all those years?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't even finish the phrase that her wings contract and a cyan-transparent barrier appear on the tips of the appendages before 'launching it' forward, where it expands and 'coat' both my fighters in it's protection<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Reshiram charged her attack and release an intense stream of blue fire at our opponent, staggering the creature and pushing it back as a few blue sparks attach themselves to her body and try to reignite the flame wherever it's strength gradually diminish. I decide to press our advantage until we can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason a strange idea appear in my head \"Reshiram use Fling, Zekrom Focus Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom immediately begin to charge a reddish sphere in her right hand but Reshiram turn towards me uncertain \"<i>I have nothing on me</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head clear and remind myself that Fling require an object to throw. An object \"Then grab something and throw it damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReshiram seems confused for a moment, then she simply grab a machinery near the caged Charizard and trow it towards the creature, hitting it on the head, stunning it. The Focus Blast it the experiment immediately after, briefly shaking the ground and extinguishing the blue sparks that still surrounded her body, but still remaining on foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure if i could have really used Fling the way i ordered but frankly i don't care, and apparently it's still not enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature shake her head a few times, then lower her posture growling and look at me in the eyes. I briefly notice how her posture would have been a lot more intimidating if her undertail wasn't drenched in her own arousal, making the scene a little more weird then even i am used to. As our eyes make contact a shiver run down my spine, the creature too seems somewhat surprised as she expected to find fear not curiosity, or maybe something else as her body visibly tremble afew times<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shake her head again and bash her cranium into the ground, creating a small crater on the already blackened floor. She recover her stance and prepare herself for another attack, but i can see the determination in her eyes wavering, she is not sure what she want anymore. The memory of the Dragonair forcefully resurface and it make me break eye contact with the creature, i really hope this fight won't end up like that one, or i will seriously consider retiring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am serious damn it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she suddenly stop fighting and present, i fucking leave</span></div></div>",

Charizard flaps her wings hurriedly, attempting to avoid the incoming attacks. Both blasts connect with her back creating a large explosion, and knocking Charizard into the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she gets back to her feet.

Once it had grown large enough she focused her gaze on the struggling Charizard, and allowed the sphere to rupture. A flash of light and a deafening boom later you were staring intently into the smoke for any sign of movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the cloud a pair of glowing eyes appear accompanied by a reverberating growl.

Why i always found the crazy ones? In this case the prize is won by Luka sister, although one may mention her position on the crazyometer is dangerously close with Rubica, if ever. Not an easy achievement if you ask me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Lucario speak to me with a decisive tone, but still respectful and professional \"<i>Welcome back Master Jaden, i heard your team defeated an hybrid, impressive, our elite rangers, some of the best fighter we have, could barely keep up with the rejected ones</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy black legendary sbuff annoyingly, clearly her opinion of the best the ranger has to offer is somewhat different, and if i had to base my opinion on what i saw in there, i had to agree<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, your elite don't have a friend that can vaporize a small city in a single attack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZekrom playfully remind me \"<i>Mate Jaden, mateeeessssss</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, that one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario continue \"<i>May i speak with you for a moment Master, it's important</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at our interloper with clear mistrust, but her expression don't change at all \"<i>It won't take long, please?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me with her eyes begging for my consent, and despite my instinct telling me no, i found myself once again a sucker for a girl, don't even have the excuse of being in my team this time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI annoyed \"Fine\" then i turn toward my girls \"Regroup the others, we will leave as soon as i have done with the rangers and i don't want to stick around a minute more then i had to, Giratina know they will try to impose me another task or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragon nod, even if Zekrom has a strange smile and Reshiram appear distracted, and fly towards the rangers camp.

Mhhm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and point a finger at her \"And what do you want exactly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoroark continue to grin like an idiot, then she launch herself at me so fast her image blur, i barely had the time to register her movement that i feel myself being carried before suddenly stopping and being dropped to the ground not too gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden stop did quite the trick to my stomach, and i barely manage to not puke \"Caght, wh- caggth, what the hell..caght\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acid taste of my launch remain make me cringe, and as i look up, i see the Zoroark still smiling.

Simple, a decent master that recognize my strength, that can train me to become the epitome of my species\" She begin to caress my cheek \"That  has the guts to force me on my knees and use me like a toy, then fuck me silly till i can barely walk straight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to not spit in her face \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look puzzled and stop caressing me \"Mhmh? Why what? Why i want to become the strongest Zoroark ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunt as my stomach send a pulse of pain straight in my head \"Why every pokemon i meet wanted to fuck me, are males so inept or dense or..\"  She begin to laugh \"What!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shake her head \"Not really, mhm, it's just...a trainer has whole different relationship with us\" She use her clawed hand to gently caress me again \"Trainers can bring the best out of us, and yes the worse too, but we love it all the same. If i want an egg then yes, a pokemon would be necessary, but fucking? Most of our males are lacking....self control, i mated a few times, and all i got was a sore pussy and an unsatisfied crave for more\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe not so gently push me on my back and seat on my legs \"Humans? Sure, a few idiots here and there, but most of us have little to complain about. Human are rarely strong enough to harm us while fucking, but strong enough to give us the satisfaction we want. In exchange all of your species ask of us is undying loyalty and to follow your every order\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begin to creepily caress my pants \"Two things we will have to give to our mate anyway, or at least the first, worse end up in an open community and get bred by every male that look at us tail, or even worse where only the alpha male can, urg\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe use her hand to grip my maleness with a little too much force, making me cringe \"And most of you hare more then sized for the job, i certainly don't mind being ordered around for a purpose\"  Her creepy smile never leave her muzzle \"To answer your question, in our world the female stay Under the male, and that's how most of us like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claw away the upper part of my pants in a flash and grip more delicately my now hardened member over the underwear \"Me included\" She grip the back of my head and forcefully kiss me. Her tongue try to pry open my lips but i refuse her entry. I expected her to be pissed but instead she continue grinning when the kiss end<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zoroark release me and turn around, practically showing the darkened lips of her drenched pussy on my face, the musk make me feel a little dizzy. She slowly crawl away moving her flank left and right, trying to attract my attention more then she already have<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop barely a meter from me, lower her chest to the ground and use her hands to spread her pussy open, revealing the healthy pink color of her insides \"I pledge my loyalty to you Jaden, from now on i am yours to train..and use as you see fit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find myself mesmerized by her exotic beauty, despite already having more the a few female more then eager to spend time with me, i still find myself attracted to this Zoroark<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn her head back and lick her lips \"Come Jaden, claim your pokemon, take what's yours by right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to shake my head, trying to remove drive out my attraction for the Zoroark so openly displayed, so close i can nearly taste her</span></div></div>",

Still kept in the air by her psychic power i presume, she very gently lay my forehead on hers, somehow stabilizing the wave of emotion i felt since a few moments ago, and permitting me to finally identify what those feelings mean<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappiness, Sadness, Longing...and maybe...maybe love<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice echo in my head with a gentleness i didn't knew she possessed: \"<i>There you are Jaden we where getting worried with your prolonged absence</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugia carefully let me down, while my head feel like someone used a rusted screwdriver to fix an inexistent problem at the base of my cranium, then smashed whatever was left with a giant hammer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hand on both sides of my head, closing my eyes and trying to somehow soothe the dull pain rooted within, when an unusual noise attract my attention toward Pyrie and the Zoroark offering place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to look but my vision is blurred, unfocused and it force me to keep my eyes closed for the moment, then Lugia speak again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Do not worry Jaden, the Zoroark and the Typhlosion will reach us shortly at camp, shall we depart?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groan as the pain slowly leave my tormented brain \"No, carry them with us or..\" i pause as my body feel spent, far more then i was after claiming Zoroark \"or i will walk back with them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear an angry hiss, the one you would expect trampling a Seviper tail \"<i>Jaden, there no need to wait for these..females that-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI interrupt her whining with more emphasis that i wanted \"They.are.coming.now. Lugia.

You see, despite being wrong in saying that you are not their master, the part of using you to avoid oblivion is true, in part, no pokemon will end up in the abyss without a partner, but certainly the one that have one will live a lot better if Arceus idea come to be a reality, and it's servants while blind to the consequences are quite competent so it may even happen in a way</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I mean that basically you have two choices. One, you can take her as your mate.

If your impression of Mespirit is correct she is simply trying to save her hide at your expense, even if the trade is still advantageous for you technically speaking, it's binding and permanent. However while you are definitely the best candidate for a psychic, you are not the only one, in fact between your mates there are pokemon who do not share your element affinity right?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>In theory if you make Mespirit believe that another gifted, or at least a trainer that Arceus has it's eyes on and that it consider important can be a better candidate then you, then she will probably go and torment him instead, simple no?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think on her idea for a few moments \"But what if she doesn't want another? What if she want Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCresselia smile sheepishly \"<i>Well Jaden, if she wished for you to be her mate or if she genuinely find you attractive and your gift merely empower her feeling towards you...then nothing will ever dissuade her, nothing.

But my more tactical side recognize the possible value a pokemon like a Dragonair can do for my team, and admittedly it's evolved form is universally considered quite powerful, one of the most effective pokemon a trainer can master<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealistically with so many legendary at my back and call this addition to the team could have been considered unnecessary, however i doubt most gym or even tournament judge would allow a powerhouse like Lugia or Mewtwo to compete, maybe the elite section would, but those tournaments are invitation only and they reward skill more then raw strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem is, no matter how retrained, even Victini could probably easily blow up a whole stadium with all pokemon and human within with a reasonable contained effort, if she get the chance to build up enough power of course, so it wouldn't matter anyway, any move they use can be considered overpowering strong, no matter what. As such, i still need a good team of 'normal' pokemon to compete, and a Dragonite would definitely be a good choice, and hopefully, a sensible one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tighten the grip on the ball as i prepare myself to release the pokemon contained within, i know that the rest of my team could help in case she decide to become too amorous, but i need, i must being able to control my team by myself, without having the rest of the group acting as enforcers as i was a petty dictator<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a good, steady breath, i return to the spacious room i was sleeping in and open the ball with my fingers, releasing the Dragonair as far as possible form me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light quickly dim and the Dragonair look around disoriented for a few moments, then she look at me intently and reveal her toothy grin. She lose no time and rapidly cling herself around my body, with her muzzle barely a centimeter from my face, looking at me as mesmerized by my eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dragonair, how do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupt me by placing her lips on my own. Surprised i use my hand to delicately push her away, and she let me, but her wicked smile rapidly return as she bring up to my level the underside of a part of her i now know quite well, her vent rapidly becoming visible as the lips redden<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look i just want to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to silence me by beginning to lick her own vent, she sensually use her tongue to spread apart her lips and showing off her willing tunnel, already moist from her arousal. I blink and ask myself how such horny creatures as pokemon can even exist, by the speed their body get ready to mate you could easily mistake their whole race for succubus or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy small distraction end quickly however as she use the same trick as last time and use the tip of her tail to slightly penetrate her sex, conveying me her readiness to mate, and just like before she place her now quite ready vent on my lips as asking me to sample the quality of the goods she is offering<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDifferently from last time however my hands are free, and i manage to push away her offering and firmly grasp her winged head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Dragonair, i understand that..something of me make you feel all giddy, but i need you to focus ok? Focus and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe try to use the rest of her body to slip down my new pants, fortunately tightening my grip on her head make her stop and seems to have somewhat restored that flicker of intelligence i had hoped to find in her black orbs, even if it's barely a rowboat in a raging sea of lust<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must now play my part carefully if i want to get out of this room with both her obedience and all my stamina still intact \"Do you want me Dragonair?\" She doesn't even let me finish and nod \"Do you Want me as your master?\" She once again nod \"Then if your master would told you to stop...would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look conflicted and in doubts, but still nod \"Then your master is demanding you to stop\" she tremble slightly as scared \"Now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stand still for nearly a minute as if in doubt or awaiting the final line of a joke she hasn't realized i was telling. But eventually she release me and uncoil herself from my body, she still keep her sex close to my mouth tough, as hoping i change my mind on the subject<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower it please\" i say referring to her sex, a command she slowly obey \"Good, now, i want you to know that i am not refusing you\" She speak her name for the first time since the beginning of our 'conversation' \"No, i am not. But you have to understand that you cannot simply immobilize and and fuck the living sh..thing out me. If you want to remain with me then a few rules must be respected, clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod eagerly \"Alright, first rule, no mating unless i agree BEFORE we begin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems confused but nod nonetheless, not sure if being scared or laugh at her doubting this rule, but maybe strong pokemon just come out and mate with any willing, or at least available mate? Anyway..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule number two, when i ask you something, i expect my order to be carried out at the best of your ability\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile cutely as telling me that that's was obvious, tell that to Mespirit \"Rule number three, don't expose yourself or otherwise try to seduce me in public\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confused expression on her face make me understand that common pokemon do not have the same idea of modesty we human have \"How to...don't show off your vent around unless we are alone or with the rest of my team ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me quizzically but still nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile \"Good, now i need to recall you back in the ball and meet a friend, i will let you out later and we can continue our discussion\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover her pokeball that only now i realize has fallen on the floor and prepare to recall Dragonair in, only to realize that it's undignified keeping a pokemon in your care without a name, it's like treating them like slaves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before returning, can i chose i name for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeal in happiness, obviously understanding what such things mean \"Ok, how about Laria?\" She remain silent but seems to like the name \"Come on then, get in\" The pokeball recall my new team member in, leaving me finally alone to think<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has gone a lot better then i expected\" But my more cynical part remind me that now i had another pokemon to feed and care for, and pleasure, of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least i am finally getting some measure of control over my life...i hope\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recover my belt that right now only having the Zoroark ball attached as the other are probably with Joy for a check-up, or outside training with Rubica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know Joy know her craft at least, a few up points for being crazy at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI check up my gear one last time and recover my backpack, checking if i have everything to continue traveling north, and noticing how my pokedex is missing</span></div></div>",

So, unable to find it, you decide to ask Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her in the lobby speaking with a young trainer. You wait politely for her to finish the conversation. While she was speaking the girl's eyes flicked towards you, a fact not unnoticed by Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"HIIIIIIIII-YAAAAHHHH\" She quickly spun around and threw a backhanded strike. You block the swing with an arm, before you respond \"Lay off the caffeine Joy, seriously!\" She drops her arm and breathes a sigh of relief. \"Oh Jaden! I was afraid Team Shadow was attacking!\" \"Paranoid much?\" \"You can never be too careful\" she huffed. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm working with someone\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy turns back to the trainer only to find her cowering and utterly terrified. You step over and pat her shoulder, \"Don't worry she's a little, how should I put this- insane, but she's a good nurse. Your pok\u00e9mon will be in good hands\" The girl nods slowly and stops shaking. \"Oh yeah, Joy have you seen my pok\u00e9dex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Sylvia had it\" \"Thanks\" You rub your chin as you step outside, wondering what Sylvia could want with your pok\u00e9dex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of battle draw you to the training field behind the center.

I think team shadow has more than just hybrids and trainers on their side\"* she showed you the pok\u00e9dex *\"this is Yveltal, he is the very incarnation of destruction.

No further details are available on the matter, nor even the type as it's marked as ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that what is told to the public. A small link under the pokemon name is available on my dex, and pressing it a whole new screen opened where certain private information where requested to authorize my access<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp down as after requesting for my fingerprint on the display, i reply the question about Lugia apparent genital size and remind myself to ask Joy how in Tartarus they acquired This particular kind of information, and possibly ask her Why they couldn't just ask for a personal ID or something. Nonetheless my answer proven to be correct and a new window appear, revealing a police report about the event<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that the part told to the public is true, but in these report much more details are present, it seems that the village was investigated after many citizens where unable to contact their relatives living there, no one was answering the phone or any other attempt of communication after a particularly vicious storm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe authorities, here reporting the name of two gym leaders and a bunch of other police officers, where dispatched to verify why many pokemon in the area where wailing in what seemed to be pain and acting aggressively towards each other far more then usual, reports of unprovoked attacks follow with all the relative links, apparently checking out the village was merely a cover for the operation, which explain why league officials where sent to lead the operation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipping this section i scroll down to the pith of the main report and discover that this Yveltal as it has been named due to it's shape, was present at the center of the village and was, based on the witnesses, absorbing some kind of energy from a swirling, wailing vortex over it's head. The reports of every witness is available for consultation but the gist of it is, that all agree that this pokemon was rejuvenating while the vortex became smaller and smaller<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny attempt to contact the pokemon where vain and any attempt to disable this exemplar where deflected by the strange vortex of energy looming over them. After more then half hour of failed attempts, the pokemon simply spread it's wings a flew away faster then any of the officials pokemon where able to and vanished without leaving a trace<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe autopsy carried on the number 2 body recovered did not point out any evident cause of death, but most internal organs where shriveled and some part of the body has evident sign of necrosis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was concluded that this newly discovered entity was probably responsible for the event, and that somehow among it's capabilities there is one that permit the creature to absorb the life force of living being in a limited radius of approximately 1.2 kilometers, slowly depriving the victims of their energy and causing their premature death<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's also assumed that the range of the ability is proportional to the strength of the victims, as stronger the target, smaller the radius<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExam on the body with ghost type pokemon revealed that it's not the life force of the body to being assimilated as originally theorized, but rather the soul of the victims is being drained out from the body, and then released once emptied of energy to the distortion world of Giratina directly, causing the physiological effects reported in the autopsy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe report contain many more technical data of little use to me but the final assessment recommend extreme caution when encountering this particular pokemon and to avoid a direct confrontation if possible, another note indicate that this pokemon ability of drain away soul energy seems to be available to it only when grievously injured as reported in another two encounter from league officials, apparently a powerful attack with so called 'Fairy' energy is capable of disrupting Yveltal charge of it's deadly ability, and force it to flee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general report on this pokemon end with the note of it's probable type, Dark/?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ? is hypothesized to be Ghost or Flying, as Fighting type moves where not as effective as expected when fighting the creature and no psychic field where detected during the confrontation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close the dex, terminating any connection with the service database and walk toward my team lazing about. It's Sylvia that once again come to me and ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Master! Are you ready?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to say yes, but seeing most of my team seated doing nothing give me an obvious idea \"What about a sparring match before we go?\"</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless the flash of light dim to reveal the rest of her team<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst to the left there is Sally, the Salamence i already know quite well, considering we mated a time or two, which was a little awkward her being trained under another master, and i still can't understand how such a big pokemon can have such a snug and tight vent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDispelling further thoughts about Sally genital area i look toward the second pokemon released, only to find nothing where the i was sure another light materialized barely a few seconds ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing me more then a little confused is Rubica that shed some light on the matter \"Ignore him, Shadow has always been a prankster at hearth, he will probably reappear in the shower or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to her \"Shadow? What is it, a dark type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile \"Close, Gengar\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Ghost?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smugly reply \"Yep, was father favorite pokemon, still is i think, more then once i suspected he saddled me with him not as much for my protection, but more for his amusement\" She shake her head in denial \"He played more prank on me, mother and a few friends that i dare to remember but he never hurt anyone, well sometimes their pride sure, but nothing serious\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my eyebrow \"Like materializing in the shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore, but before? Yeah, a time or two. But he quickly found out that a human punch do not ignore Ghost type physical resistance particularly well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look again at the position the ghost type should occupy, and for what i know still do, but it will be a matter for another time i suppose, hopefully not  for the bathroom, or bedroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore i can return to check out the rest of Rubica team, i find myself fiercely hugged from what i rapidly recognize as an over affectionate Sally, that apparently decided that i have ignored her for too long, a minute, i think. Rubica of course completely ignore her pokemon actions, deciding to mock me instead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a charmer Jaden, merely your sight make even the strongest pokemon fall in love with you now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply ignore Rubica vocal jab and focus on how to get out of my position without end up under, or over an aroused dragon type. Knowing my limited options i opt for hugging her back, and caress her side wherever my hands i could reach. She respond to my caress by purring softly, before i manage to make her release me and tell her to return in line, from her expression and her whine it doesn't take a genius to figure out she wanted more then a few cuddles, but i think i am safe from further avances for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free from interruption, i return to examine the fourth member of Rubica team, considering Sally first, Vulcan second, and the mysterious Gengar as third, ignoring how Shadow is such a clich\u00e9d name for a ghost<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes fall on the next member, revealing as one may expect that she posses a Grass type to balance her team out, namely a Grovyle, that remain there still as a statue and intensely looking at me, as expecting me to attack it or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jaden, he always do that to people he don't know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause for a moment \"Looking at me like i am a dangling piece of meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggle \"That one, if he wasn't vegetarian at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, more then happy to hear that and focus on her next pokemon, and discover that i don't like this, not even a little bit. While Rubica seems to have figured out most of my so called affinity, apparently she must have let one slip, because the creature that stare at me from the ground completely mesmerized by my presence is a Dewgong, an Ice type<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy memory remind me that actually it's a Water/Ice combo as it's shape clearly is made for swimming with as little resistance as possible in the water, but frankly even my Sneasel as Ice as secondary element and that did not reduced the affinity effect on her by even an inch, on the contrary this Dewgong seems positively smitten by my very existence, a problem that need to be cleared out before it's too late, and by too late i mean finding myself relaxing in my bathtub after a long journey, only to find an horny Dewgong jumping in and trying to impale herself on my staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Rubica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI point at her Ice type \"It's a she\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica come closer to me and reply with a confused tone \"Yes, what's the problem\" Her tone become playful \"Want to add another notch to your belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn toward her \"My last affinity is Ice Rubica, that's the problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica stare at me for many interminable seconds before making the connection, her eyes widen considerably at the revelation \"Dewgong, return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathe a sigh of relief \"Sorry Jaden, i was merely joking about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, just, keep her away from my room or sleeping bag and we will be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod and replace Dewgong ball on her belt \"You sure the ice-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Psychic, Dragon, Electric and Ice, i had Fire too but i managed to remove at least that, was assured that removing another affinity is possible but it would make the remaining ones practically impossible to resist so, yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems surprised by this knowledge, i thought she already knew that, wasn't she paying attention?  Also..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why only five pokemon, the restriction was reduced to 8 since the cataclysm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile \"10 for elite trainers actually, even if i am not one yet. Well, differently from you, being a female is not a sufficient prerequisite to enter my team, Mr Secret Agent\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah yea, rib me a little more, then she ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, still want to spar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain still as what could have happened if i haven't mentioned my Ice affinity to Rubica..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, i leave you the first move, who do you wish to challenge first?\"</span></div></div>",

Sadly while Grovyle pokemon are pretty well know, Zoroark are some sort of a mystery to most trainer, unfortunately i have to include myself in that whole as even the dex doesn't seems to have much on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the above mentioned device from my belt, i open it and use the scan function hoping to obtain more information now that Zoroark is charging her energy to attack, admittedly i am not sure it will make any difference, but it doesn't hurt to try<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica walk a few meters away from me and my pokemon as her grass type obediently follow her like a shadow. It take nearly a minute for Rubica to choose an appropriate distance in her opinion, before finally turning towards us and order her Grovyle to remain on the defensive. I believe she committed a mistake in revealing her main tactics before our confrontation even begin, but admittedly Rubica is simply being cautious, as just like me even she know very little about my new partner and i will probably need one of my psychic pokemon assistance in reading Zoroark thoughts and inform me of her possible moves, unless of course i stupidly remind myself that i could just simply ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoroa-\" She interrupt me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liliana if you will, master\" She put an emphasis on the word master by feigning to stretch her legs and bending over, causing her fur normally covering her sex to part just enough to reveal her the outline of her sex. Of course as if wasn't sufficient, she feel the need to use one of her 'hand' to expressively part her lips open, in a very unsubtle attempt to make me reconsider the reward thingy i bet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat however end up shaking me a little is not her crass imitation of the attract move, despite i bet more then one trainer would say that this is the correct way to use such move, perverts, but it's that her attempt it's actually working, i really begin to find myself attracted from her exposed form, and i feel a little ashamed to admit how an action such as this, that would have provoked a mixed reaction at worst before the beginning of my journey, is now clearly exciting me, as i realize to have stared only when Zo- Liliana recall my attention on her head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why master, if you like we can postpone our match and you can..\" she use once of her claw to penetrate her moistening sex \"train me in obedience. Teach me what happens to unruly pokemon such as me, that just question their master opinion so directly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again i find my attention focused where i shouldn't even look, i think at least a trainer shouldn't..or should? I don't anymore...anyway. With an effort of will i managed to look away and my eyes fall on a unhappy looking Rubica, who is nervously beating her left feet on the ground with more then a little distaste lingering on her feature<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice managed to break the monotony of the small clearing \"If you two are done..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI calmly breath in and out, attempting to focus my attention to the battle once more and promising myself to look out my renewed attraction on pokemon later. Liliana meanwhile recover a more dignified combat stance now that the chance to get an early 'reward' slipped right trough her clawed fingers, and evidently glare at Rubica for a few seconds to no effect before choosing to adopt a neutral expression for our fight, for now at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile i finally managed to recover a semblance of mental fortitude and sufficient focus to think somewhat clearly again, which bring me to inevitably notice the annoyed expression some of my team is understandably directing at Liliana, Lyrica and Victini are understandably livid at the dark type seductions attempt. Disturbingly however, Pyrie seems to ignore most of the present events, and simply remain there, painting as she has just run a Pokeathlon all day non stop<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as i ask myself why my Typlosion seems so tired about, i feel the distinctive presence of Sylvia gently asking permission to speak in my head. I look toward my lover and nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am sorry do disturb your concentration Jaden, but Pyrie mental conditioning is overbearingly pushing against her will, demanding her, i am paraphrasing, ''to take it like the good little slut she is''</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? what the...\"oh fuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize to have spoken with my mouth only after i did it, not sure what Rubica is thinking now, seeing me cursing like this for no apparent reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless the memory of what Joy told me about Pyrie when she dropped her in my permanent custody are resurfacing from the depths of my mind. Pyrie was abused and probably trained to be a slut for her ex trainer and all his team since the day she hatched. The mental programming instilled in her head force her to behave like a nymphomaniac in need of her fix if she isn't mated regularly, and apparently nearly daily, and it passed nearly two days since her last..activity<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply back to Sylvia using her mental link \"<i>Try to...soothe her as best you can, i will..help her as soon as i am done here</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes Jaden, as you wish</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia cut the telepathic link, making me feel alone again in head, witch is a good thing actually, but her reverence toward me as her master is somewhat annoying now that we have become closer since that day, but i suppose it's inevitable given the situation, i am still her master and she is still my pokemon despite anything that may happen between us<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if her father has found himself in the same situation once or twice, but i digress. I need to focus on the now, after all i still have a battle to win</span></div></div>",

Even girls curse from time to time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling somewhat brave, and deciding to ignore Pyrie now renewed lust gaze on my lower body, i decide to give my traveling companion a simple hint regarding etiquette<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that i know anything about it, or care more then necessary, but when even the wild pokemon hidden between the trees suddenly go silent, you know that something must have gone wrong somewhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh..Rubica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn towards me, metaphorically slapping my face with a glare that would have make even a Golem freeze in place and rethink it's decision, whatever it may had been \"There is no need to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, i wanted to conclude the phrase with 'be upset', but her intensifying glare open me new options to conclude this brief battle intermission with, and considering this new fact, i like to name this new opportunity 'don't get strangled in my sleep option', and rapidly to apply this new plan before it's too late<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...use such outdated curses..yes, there are so many more...forget it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica glare relent, as she attempt to refocus her attention on the battle. I shrug off the awkwardness of the situation and simply do the same, or at least i tried to, until Liliana decided that this battle must have been too boring for her taste and i find myself embraced from behind by the illusion pokemon, as she completely disregard our opponent and the ongoing battle, speaking of which i can clearly see Grovyle recover his strength and return to a somewhat intimidating combat stance, or it would have been intimidating if he wasn't slightly bleeding from his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel Liliana muzzle slowly caress my ear, removing most of my concentration from the battle once again \"Come on master, can't we do something more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe of course lose no time in clarifying what she mean by fun, grabbing my right hand and placing it on her moist lips of her sex. I manage to pry myself from her weak embrace and without removing my sight from the improvised battle ring i reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Liliana. Fight this match for me and prove to be a poke..no, a member of my team i can rely upon, or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe try to 'hug' me again, managing to escape her clutches by mere inches \"Or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI steel myself, and answer her in with all the confidence i can muster \"Or i will leave you at the next breeding center we find. If you can't control your urges, not even in battle, then i will find a way to give you all the sexual relief you crave in the most constructive way i can manage\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remain silent after that, and without saying a word she walk towards her still ready opponent, a loss that the seriousness of the moment is ruined by her choosing to use a battle stance that involve being on all four with her hips raised towards me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the irresistible urge to slap my hand in my face for some unknown reason, but i resist the temptation as Liliana briefly turn her head towards me an say in a tone i am unsure if it's dark or huskily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love when my Jaden take charge of his humble pokemons, hoping he reconsider the idea of fucking me silly at the end of this farce\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? what she is talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone return sweet and seductive as before \"After all, our happiness And satisfaction should be one of master main priorities right? It's funny how most trainer thinks to have us bending to their will, when in truth the opposite happen far more often..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have the time to ponder what Liliana just told me, that Rubica order another attack and force me back to the now and our battle..but why she called this a farce? Is she so sure of her victory or just...there is something else i am still unaware of...or maybe she is just playing with me..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy focus on reality return when the smell of something foul smash through my nose and make me recoil in disgust. Looking on the battlefield i notice how Liliana and Grovyle have exchanged place, and a still seethe purple mark on the ground just a meter or so from the grass pokemon, along with another bad looking slash just under his arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana too sport a small cut just above her muzzle, but not even remotely serious as the poor Grovyle wounds...why i am fighting again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a voice calling me from the other side of the battlefield, and i need a moment or two before i manage to push away all distraction and focus on Rubica voice, she look more concerned then angry for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden, what happened? Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her confused \"Sorry? What..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe i finally realize from the position of the two battling pokemon that the battle has stopped, and from the not anymore boiling toxic attack on the ground, has so fro a good minute or two, at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas i distracted for so long? How couldn't have i noticed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine Rubica, let's continue\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe evidently doesn't agree with my statement \"You sure Jaden, did the Toxic attack hit you or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No!</b>\" I found myself replying with far more emphasis then i wanted to, my eyes looking at the ground as i realize what i just did \"I am fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even look at her and just, deciding to ignore the nagging feeling in the back of my head, telling me to behave like a man and excuse myself for my somewhat erratics actions as of now. Instead, i look at the improvised ring and grunt in mental pain as the now ever increasing pile of question accumulating in my head, and given my position, i know that revealing anymore then already aper to my psychic team would have been a bad ideas, i even doubt they understand what it mean to be...human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging off the weird, senseless train of thoughts that had led me here, i look at Liliana and her knowing smirk just before Rubica order her Grovyle to use Swords Dance, a wasted effort so long after the beginning of this match, and Liliana grin deepen as she probably think the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish it off Liliana, use Foul Play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica seems to spit out half her lungs when she hear my choice of move<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Grovyle use-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Liliana reappear in my side of the battlefield and Grovyle lay out in the grass at her feet, out cold, with no visible form of additional physical injury beside the one taken before this move, how the heck this move even work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBah, i have enough things whirring in my head as it is, i should just, drop it for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana calmly walk out of the 'ring' and stop just before touching me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was i good my Master? Does this pokemon satisfied you with her performance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not even sure what i should, want, do to her, not that she doesn't have a few suggestion on the matter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Liliana, now please acting like a broken CD and tell me what you meant before\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purr as she get closer, touching her nose with mine \"We are what we are, Jaden. I am a pokemon with needs and desired like anyone else, and just like many of them i wished for something, more then being breed during my season, eat and drink to continue living, and sleeping to continue walking\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe press her hot furred body closer to mine, the heat of the battle still linger on her form, like her quicker heart beating or the more elaborate breathing \"What i wish for, like many others before me Jaden, is someone that complete us, that make us feel whole\" She doesn't lose the occasion to caress my genital area with her claws \"Something, or someone that can quell our needs, without renouncing to what we are\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recover a perfectly erect posture a walk by me \"I am pokemon Jaden, and conflict is our language, battle our breathing, strength our intent...and mating, our fire. What better to give us all of this, if not a trainer, Master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walk away and joining the rest of my team, all the while Lyrica look at her like she want to fulminate the illusion pokemon where she stand, but relent and prefer to cont the leaf in the tree or something, anything but assaulting her team member and smashing her somewhere painful i bet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly i am not sure how to feel, if what Liliana say is true, then i am hardly using my pokemon, it's them that use us, the human race to fulfill their purpose, and in exchange permit us to do much, nearly anything in return...turn out fucking the brain out your Arcanine in heat is exactly what she wanted all along....it's creepy, and a somewhat scary thoughts too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's that why a pokemon rarely rebel to it's master or mistress will? It's because we have a mutual exchanging most of us didn't even knew we agreed upon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, must be those damn fine-prints none even bother to read, or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of a balls getting open remind me once again that introspection is all good and dandy, when you re Not in the middle of a fight, and as i look up i notice that Rubica has called out</span></div></div>",

Now resolute and confident in my decision, i remove Nysa ball from my belt, wondering for a moment why she wasn't relaxing with the rest of the team, then i push away any distraction and stray thoughts until the end of battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nysa, come out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI throw the ball to the ground at my feet, and as expected a beautiful Milotic rapidly take shape from the amorphous energy escaping the ball. Then when she finally fully materialized a few seconds later, she rapidly turn around to notice me and decide to hug me, (although strangle would have been more appropriate)fiercely enough that for a moment I'd would have swear to have seen Giratina with a purple colored scythe ready to...yeah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen i am finally released from my affectionate Milotic, i rapidly try to recover from the impromptu hug i just received , only to find myself nearly turning red from having my left cheek licked affectionately. After a brief struggle, i managed to pull my self up and push Nysa cool tongue away from my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ok, i got it you hare happy\" i gently pat her head \"feel better now that you have hugged me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa nod happily, before returning to face her opponent with a stoic professionalism i never expected to see in a pokemon. At least she merely wanted an hug and not, ok enough, let's focus on the battle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVulcan remain perfectly calm despite having now to face an element that can easily spell his figurative doom, Rubica too seems to have calmed down after our last round, how curious, was maybe her small success against my team to have put her back in a more manageable mood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica decide to have lost more then sufficient time waiting and order Vulcan her new orders<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready Vulcan, use Double Team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horned quadruped waste no time to obey his mistress order and rapidly begin to run between two close position until two distinct copy of himself stand on the improvised ring, i cannot avoid to notice how different his method of using this particular move in comparison to Sylvia, but i guess it had to be expected given he cannot simply project an image or afterimage with pure mental power<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite me finding Vulcan method a little barbaric, it's nonetheless effective as no matter what, i am unable distinguish anymore the real Vulcan from the copy, and given how Nysa is growling in annoyance neither can she<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Nysa, let's cool him down, Rain Dance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my water type begin her strange 'dance', Rubica angry scream attract my attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What!?</b> You little, i only have this shirt clean you damn-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Rubica chosen method to express her disapproval with my battle tactics, i was unable to see Nysa perform her move, but it must have worked because it was impossible to miss the thunder clap that just interrupted Rubica rant<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air around us rapidly become humid and the light of the sun is quickly obscured by a few ominous gray clouds that appeared just above the battlefield and it immediate surrounding area, but leaving the rest of the forest and the pokecenter completely undisturbed. It's incredible what powers pokemon seems able to posses, i know the legendaries declaring themselves my mate are capable of doing even more, but i never seen such finesse an control over such a thing as whether, after all the last time Kyurem decided to improvise a little distraction a whole city suffered a snowstorm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment i wonder how can responsible adults leaving creatures capable of such a feat in the hands of ten-twelve years old boys and girls with little to no training whatsoever, with a very limited knowledge of act and consequences baffle me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother small scream of agony attract my attention back to Rubica, whose shirt is now completely wet and due to the her choice of fabric, rapidly becoming transparent and revealing her lack of bra, fortunately for her, her jeans like pants are mostly unaffected by the curiously perfectly temperated water now hammering our bodies, at least trasprent-y wise<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in Tartarus this rain can be anything less then chilling cold is a mystery to me, but perhaps it has something to do with the energy used to 'conjure' this phenomenon, it's not natural rain anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica angry glare at me while using her hands to cover her upper torso, manage to send a small shiver down my spine, seriously that girl has issues. I raise my hands in sign of peace, trying to make her understand that her half nakedness side effect wasn't in my plan, which is true but i doubt she care anyway. Once again fortune seems to be on my side as a small purple like dome begin to appear above our heads, big enough to cover our human body but leaving the rest of the battlefield and the pokemon in the rain<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards my team i notice how a similar colored cover seems to shield my whole team from the rain, and the soft glow emanating from both Sylvia and Lyrica hands make pretty easy to understand the pokemon i have to thanks for their efficiency. I nod towards them both, them replying in kind, before returning my focus to the battle at hand. Much to my and Rubica relief, it seems that her shirt is now perfectly dry, probably still thanks to one of my two psychic, even if still a bit crumpled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica wisely decide to ignore any further comments and prefer to resume our battle instead<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unable to get out of the way Nysa is caught up in the cloud. \"Water pulse\" an orb of water shot out of the cloud and hit Vulcan square in the head. The attack pushes him back but doesn't knock him out or confuse him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vulcan, Dark pulse\" \"Twister Nysa\" Vulcan opened his maw wide and a burst of black energy shot towards the serpentine Pok\u00e9mon. The blast hits her midsection and she cries out in pain, but continues to fight. Nysas eyes flash and she lets out a deafening roar. The wind began to pick up and soon a small vortex had formed in the middle of the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the twister pulling at you but it was nothing compared to how it was pulling on Vulcan. He slid for a few feet before he was lifted off the ground and sucked in. The vortex progressed and you could see small rocks and debris were also hurtling around in it, colliding with each other and he hellhound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Nysa allows the small but powerful storm to dissipate allowing Vulcan to crash into the ground, where he remains unmoving. As the storm cleared so did the rain, retuning the sky to its former sunny glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNysa finds her way over to you and gives you another hug. \"Alright Vulcan get some rest you did good.

Like...oh, ah ok \"So, they may not obey if..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they chose a mate that oppose you directly, there is no guarantee they will follow your orders. As such, the only way to ensure their loyalty is usually finding them a mate you can control, or one they don't see too much, like any pokemon in the breeding centers or another member of your team\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sigh \"I hoped to match her with father Arbok, but..\" Her face become grim for a second \"it didn't work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp as i process what Rubica just told me, of course an idea easily form in my mind, i don't like it but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figuratively grab my balls and \"What if..we offer her something to bite then?

Simple, Pyrie dependency problem has made her needy of a male attention, her mate attention to be more precise, and Rubica action are precluding such attention by forcing me to be shared with who know how many lust crazed female that surely inhabit this center, or at least that is my unbiased opinion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Rubica has anything to do with this breeding center or my so called duty with my 'organization', but i have all the intention of making my lust crazed pokemon think otherwise......know that Rubica revenge will be probably swift and merciless, but right now i frankly just don't care<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe releasing of Pyrie manage to create a diversion and make Rubica step back confused, or at least try to because evidently i must have underestimated my fire type tenacity or maybe just her lust, causing her to jump towards my waist and missing only by an inch due to Rubica involuntary intervention as she fall back due to the unexpected pokemon action, and reflexively grip my shoulder as the closer thing around to avoid falling on her ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course a woman in white coat decide to come out to greet us in this very moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene must have been hilarious to her, a trainer with an over affectionate Typlosion rubbing herself up and down it's leg, a girl that seems awkwardly embracing the boy from behind, all the while the lad try desperately to shake off the pokemon and get his leg back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even notice her presence until she manage to clear her throat loudly enough for us to hear. I look up from my yet to be ransomed leg, and finally notice the new presence in our midst, to her credit she manage to not laugh at the scene and manage to tone down her reaction to an amused smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond woman smile at us sincerely amused as she recover an electronic pad not different looking from the one i have seen Joy use....by the way, why are all Joy look alike?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman begin to calmly speak \"Good day young ones, how can New Nuvema Center help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubica rapidly recover a more dignified stance, blushing all the while, and Pyrie of course don't give a damn and continue undeterred ignoring everything but me, at least i manage to make her stop rubbing her hips on my pants by beginning to petting her as best i can given my the circumstances</span></div></div>",

This is a Breeding and Research center right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth employee nod \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice temporarily interrupt our conversation \"Angie! Can you came here a second?

I would recommend starting with a small tour of our subjects, but it's up to you, i can explain everything on the way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod briefly, feeling a little dejected already \"Lead on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to consult my pokegear while i am being lead to my begin my 'tour', i don't even want to wonder want kind of tour i am gonna get in a breeding center, figure, nonetheless as long as i am not getting too friendly with the subjects as impersonally they was called, I'll be fine with it. Of course when i notice the plaque restricted area in the last door we passed as i tried to get a stable signal for my gear, i knew i was just gonna get in trouble again, why? Call it gut feeling, plus as soon as the normal looking door closed behind us, the signal bar on my gear instantly dropped to zero<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole section must be the 'real' research center, where the..whatever they do is really done<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we calmly pass a few others researcher on our way, i notice how many of them seems quite interested in my person, i manage to hear one whispering a few words about, <i>\"young\"</i> or <i>\"who in tartarus is this kid\"</i>, and i think i heard one say something like <i>\"it's Him?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim what? Special agent and all that league affairs? Or Him about something else i don't know yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, probably both<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris lead me to another more spacious corridor then the one with the Mareep, same purpose too i think, complete with reinforced viewing windows, and of course, my tour cannot begin more expediently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the window, i can clearly see a not so spacious room, must be 7x5 or something, barely 1m meter tall, inside an Eevee on her back is restrained and completely surrounded by a ditto, giving us an unrestrained look of the above mentioned Eevee cervix, as he, well at least it's acting as an he, fuck her silly with a transparent cock definitely thicker then necessary, and pushing with enough force to endanger even her last barrier of defense<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blink, not only at the situation, but i also asking myself why the ditto is fucking his mate so close to the window. Not sure why i cannot divert my attention from the spectacle before me, especially seeing the Eevee more then a little disgruntled with her position, not that she can do anything about it, but at least the first question find an answer when my guide press a button on the side of window and nearly scream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ditto, it's more then an half hour already, finish her off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen as the ditto suddenly stop, then resume thrusting itself in and out of his unfortunate mate with wild abandon, until finally a few seconds later with a silent cry from the Eevee, he manage to just just as told. From this distance i can clearly see as the ditto manage to widen the the Eevee small cervix, how he stop thrusting and instead push part of his 'cock' inside the Eevee womb, then still keeping his mate leg wide open and pushing her hips a little forward to give us a even better spectacle, he begin to form a white viscous liquid from inside it's body and push it inside the womb he just claimed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eevee stop her struggle as her mouth remain open with a small rivulet of drool coming out from her lips, not sure if in pain or pleasure given my experience with pokemon, it should be painful but at this point i am not so sure anymore, and let her mate finish unloading what probably is his seed in her for a good minute or so, before unceremoniously pull out of her body, and letting her form fall on the soft looking ground with little to no care about her wellbeing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris manage to attract my attention back to him by weaving his hand in front of my eyes, his wicked smile make me feel dirty for a moment giving his evident joy at the scene before us \"Like the show? Just one of many to see everyday, a loss we reach them this late, but i can locate a new pair that haven't yet started if you wish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at him with a mix of disbelief and...and something else, then simply ask \"What? It's that what you do here all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shake his head and chuckle \"Of course not, this is merely the breeding section, the actual research happen down below us, but it's always entertaining to see them\" his smile become even bigger, using his hand to indicate the exhausted Eevee trying to catch her breath, her sex still parted from the stretching she took and dribbling the ditto semen in a steady rivulet \"Play\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have trouble understand this, man, logic, if i can even call it man, he is really enjoying seeing their subject getting pretty much raped everyday? I decide to not mention him this particular line of thoughts, and instead continue with my questioning as calmly as i could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile diminish somewhat \"Well, try is the right word i am afraid\" He pass his hand on his hair in evident frustration  \"Our research is focused on how exceed the pokemons actual physical limitations using a less invading procedures as possible, you see, there are many kind of pokemon in the world, some posses only a single element to call upon, while other have two, but despite the type nearly all pokemons can focus with elements that are not their own while using what we have come to call as Moves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sign for me to follow \"For example, a Buzel which is a pure water type, can use a few Moves that are neither water nor normal in nature, like Agility, true it may only be our classification to be wrong, could very well be that Agility is actually a..Body type move instead of a Psychic one, altrought such class dosen't exist, but what about Toxic then? Or even Blizzard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stop at another viewing screen and this time i am actually not sure i want to look through<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again one can explain it that both those move are not learned naturally, but i, we, as the league, do not understand how that could justify it's use, after all not all pokemon can learn Toxic or Blizzard, even with the right TM. So it's pretty obvious that there is something else that allow certain pokemon to learn and use certain Moves while other cannot, Arceus limited them for a reason\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulp down and pick up the courage to look at the room i know being behind the reinforced glass, only to find the glass missing completely, pulled open in the middle by two mechanical arms and revealing a calm looking garden with a Lucario, no, a pokemon that look like a Lucario but..but it's reddish and it's staring back at me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon in question literally vanish from sight in a blur and reappear not a meter from me, startling me and nearly making me fall back on my ass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris immediately help me remain on foot and glare at the not Lucario \"Luka! how many times we told you not to do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not Lucario get even closer and bow jokingly at me, completely ignoring Chris \"Sorry for have startled you Master, but i was really excited to know about your arrival!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster? Master?! Who in the....oh shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris clear his throat \"This pokemon claimed to be yours Mr. Jaden, and while we had no confirmation for her claim, we thought it was better wait for your arrival before using her as a test subject, in case you didn't agree with our, ehm, policies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain still, and try to clear my eyes with my finger with mixed result \"Luka, as like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile and come so close her nose touch mine \"Yes master, i told you i would come back to you, haven't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently lick my nose while i ponder how my guts feeling where right<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not Lucario finish my phrase \"Feel free to me whatever you want, Master\"</span></div></div>",

Her arms and legs were tipped with red fur and and smaller extra spikes behind the originals. Her cream fur had grown longer on her back, giving the illusion of a cloak.

I try to close an open my eyes a few times, hoping that forcing my brain to refocus my vision a few times could somehow help to free me from this distraction, but this methods prove to be mostly ineffective, and more then a little annoying as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am so distracted by both the event i just saw and my own incapacity to understand why i can't those memory out of my head, that i didn't even noticed when something gently tapped my shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a reaction i literally bolt forward with a not particularly manly \"eep\" and turn to see my aggressor wanna-be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go of a breath i didn't had realized i was holding when i see Luka amused face with her paw still at my right height. Se evidently try, and mostly fail, to keep herself from laughing at my, in her opinion probably, an excessive reaction given the stimuli i received, but if She was the one to enter a cage, because no matter how pretty the grass and clean the air is this room Is still a cage, without even having the common sense to know what kind of creature is contained within....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, last room experience didn't helped, and Dittos are more then a little creepy in my opinion, not necessarily in a bad way but...damn, those image again...anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally calming down as i see no other pokemon around beside Luka, i take control of the situation once more \"What the fuck Luka! You nearly gave me an hearth attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her using the same paw that touched my shoulder now used in a doomed attempt to cover her mirth, i add with a little spite \"And change your name for Cresselia sake, it's so clich\u00e9 it hurts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's my turn to grin as all her mirth seems to disappear so quickly that the air all around me seems to freeze. Then after looking at me with enough intensity to drill an hole in solid steel, she simply sbuff with an irritated tone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you can give better names, look at my sisters, what the heck does even mean Pyrie or Sylvia? Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow i know she is mocking me, and for her information those names has a meaning, actually why she mentioned Sylvia? Isn't it a more then decent human.., right, human name<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug \"I haven't chosen Pyrie name and Sylvia was named by her parents, beside while i can understand Pyrie name can be confusing, what Sylvia has wrong as a name? It's because it's a human name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka attempt to reply is thwarted by a loud grinding sound, so improvise and irking that i am tempted to use my hand to shield my poor ears when the noise vanish as quickly as it came, then a rather large door i haven't even noticed, being the same identical color of the wall, split open on the far side of the room, revealing a well lit corridor completely covered in reinforced tubes of various sizes at the sides and  walls/floor with what seems to be cold steel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even realizing it i say \"A service tunnel, but why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, dull sound reverberate around us, it take a few seconds before i both realize and accept that what i am hearing, are merely steps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electronically distorted voice of Chris coming from the speaker reassure us \"Don't worry, we have allowed the mother to visit his child in the hope to improve his mood and hopefully, cure him. It's one of the attempt we spoke earlier, unfortunately, didn't helped much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Luka attention remain fixed on the tunnel, i turn towards the viewing window were i can see a perfectly calm Chris with his finger still on the intercom, the reverberating sound become louder \"This subject mother is a..\" He look at a tag somewhere i cannot see from here \"Tenea, female Tyrantrum\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyran what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hand in a pocket and retrieve gear, quickly i call the search function and digit Tyrantrum and confirm, i find myself distancing from the gear in reflex as the pokemon image appear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere isn't much to say about the photo, it look like a big lizard with massive jaw for it's size and frontal 'arms' so small they appear to be merely ornamental, the description say that this creature, is usually very territorial but for some reason, not directly confrontational with humans, apparently this particular species find an human a quite curious little thing, something that inspire apprehension but not to the point of fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these details point out that the Tyrantrum is a far smarter species then it look, despite having a very limited brain power in comparison to others poke. In short is mostly brawl and limited brain instead of all brawl and no brain as it appearance would suggest. I skip the diet and recommended food info and try to look at this creature attitude and generic behavior, finding out that there isn't much about this pokemon habits, mostly scientific information on how this creature was reintroduced in modern times after it's extinction a not yet determined period ago, and how it readapted badly with modern pokemon without human supervision, till now at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few mumbo jumbo about future project and blah blah blah, nothing else. I just scroll up again to the photo, in search of something more useful about the poke i am about to meet, when my eyes fall on the type classification, apparently the experts classified this pokemon as Rock/Dragon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sound and a small suction feeling on my back forcefully take away my attention from my gear and towards the source of the distraction, of course given my luck, could have been anything else that the pokemon in question looking at me with curious eyes? Yes? Yes it could have been, a lusty monster wanting nothing more then me ravaging her, or it was the opposite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless the creature before me is all but lusty, she actually seems curious more then angry, a little on edge maybe, but not aggressive or anything<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am even not sure why, but i find myself raising my hand on her snout, an action she follow closely with her big curious eyes but allow without fuss.Tthe first this i feel when my hand reach her scales is how pleasantly warm they felt, curiously very uniformed and smooth, not jagged or rough as i expected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe close her eyes briefly as i caress her snout and she gently push her muzzle towards me as encouraging my touch, i feel a sort of connection with her, a pure lust-free feeling much different that with other dragon type i have yet met, something more akin to a hole, to an empty shell that desire nothing more then affection and respect<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrantrum open her eyes again and awkwardly walk back, then she simply turn away from me and walk somewhere else in the room, of course given her size, it's pretty easy to track her form approaching a small obviously fake shrub. She growl playfully at the object, and when no response come from the inanimate thingy, she carefully put her muzzle inside an forcefully push whatever creature was hiding it it, out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA not particularly small yellow creature roll out the shrub, and with my gear already in hand i simply point toward the poke and press the identify button<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small window open over the Tyrantrum bio, telling me that this pokemon name is Heliolisk, an electric type pokemon that result far stronger then it seems, apparently it can generate a constant flux of electricity sufficient to power a not so small laboratory by itself, or multiple habitations without problem, apparently someone really did try and the notes mention how doing so is severely detrimental to the pokemon health<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid some trainer really require a note to remind them that pokemon are Not portable electrical generator? Yes, apparently so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther info claim that this pokemon has a very precise control of his powers, permitting  it to empower itself significantly for a short time, and move so fast it can even rival the Extreme Speed move that seems unable to learn, although only for a small amount of time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkable if a trainer wish for a sweeper member in it's team, but definitely not my first choice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small warning window appear on my gear now that i kept pointing it at the Heliolisk without even realizing it, the smaller window say that the Aura energy of the pokemon is desynchronized. Not sure what it means, but it can be a good argument to start the conversation with my newest tour guide<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my gear and leave the mother to nuzzle her child in peace, the door open automatically as i approach it, no doubt Chris unlocked it for me, but before reentering the corridor i turn toward a distracted, smiling Luka as she silently observe the mother-son bonding expirience<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tone that leave no doubt about my irritation i ask \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka finally focus on me \"Well what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resist the urge to facepalm \"Why didn't you warned me she was practically on my back?!\" I immediately place my hand on my mouth and look at the Tyrantrum, hoping to not have bothered her or her child, seeing that i haven't i continue \"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Why you didn't warned me?!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply grin like a fool \"There was not need Jaden, just like i don't need to use my aura to speak with you anymore, i know when something that wish you harm come close, and she was merely curious, and had no intention of causing you or me any harm. Because you did notice i was not using 'aura speaking' anymore, did you Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain still for a few moments, then rapidly recover \"O-of course, how can i not notice that? Come on, we have still much to see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly reach me and grab my arm possessively \"At once Master\"</span></div></div>",

Luka clung tightly to your arm like a lover would, resting her head on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door you found at the location he had indicated was not unlike the other doors you had encountered save for the fact that it had yellow and black stripes set at an angle to the ground along the bottom. You rapped softly on the door and it slid open, this time without the terrible grating sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab itself was mostly filled with rows of computers and strange machines that you couldn't identify. Chris was sitting at a computer going over some data. \"So, what are your first thoughts?\" You pull a chair away from one of the desks and take a seat. \"Physically, he seems fine, but I'm not a doctor. If I didn't know there were a bunch of others just like him, I would like something psychological\" you pause for a moment taking out your pokedex. \"This little thing said something about Heliolisks' aura.

She took a single stomping step forward and he was tripping over himself trying to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUKA STOP\" she freezes in place as you yell and slowly turns around. \"you don't think it's my fault do you?\" She whispered fearfully, her ears drooping \"No I don't think you are the cause of this issue\" you say and she throws herself into your arms \"thank you\" you are stunned by her sudden change in attitude 'she's scared shitless of being abandoned' \"but I do think you might be able to help, you are an aura Pokemon after all, and quite a special one at that\" she blushed and licked your lips, hugging you tightly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not sure why Luka reacted so badly when Chris nearly accused her of this..'desynchronization' as my pokegear said, in truth i am not even sure what being desynchronized actually mean, obviously in a human it would have something to do with the neural pattern in the brain or, the subjects being pokemon maybe it's their aura that is not correctly synchronized anymore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why i think Luka can help me solve the issues the pokemon are having, although i personally think that the biggest problem here is how they live, i mean, how healthy could it be for an Eevee to have her womb penetrated by a ditto? On a daily basis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...now that i think about it however and, after a brief consideration what i saw pokemon do, or ask for sometimes, i should probably say that mostly is, so maybe it's better if i drop this line of thoughts entirely, yeah, yeah good idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka doesn't waste any time in reminding me her offer as she grind her lower body on mine, but thankfully she limit herself to a lusty look or two before returning to her own chair<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh once again, tired of being treated like a freaking, living dildo for my team, oh i am sure they love me thoroughly most of the time, but it's difficult remaining impartial and keeping myself cool when all the persons and pokemons i met are halfway crazy, or have plans on their own that involve me fucking them silly without my knowledge, which is exactly exhilarating as it's sounds, or are mad scientist that enjoy seeing their subject daily used as cock sleeve for whatever reason, even if being this a breeding center i doubt the male are treated much better really. Ok, that sounded more perverted then strictly necessary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris recall my attention, evidently still a little shocked by Luka reaction \"Well, ehm, if i can explain, perhaps we can avoid further misunderstanding...\" He smile forcefully at Luka while looking at me with the corner of his eyes as suggesting me to intervene, a suggestion i promptly agree on<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, feign that i don't have any real knowledge of aura or how it work\" I really don't \"and explain to me your theory and why believe it's right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris relax significantly at my words evidently liking proving his knowledge, Luka not so much but, she nod, then proceed to grip my hand with a tiny little bit too much strength as to reassure herself that i am there and not running away somewhere, reminding me again that old joke about why when a pokemon act all cute and ask for a snuggle, you should first ask yourself..is that a Fighting/Steel/Rock-Ground type pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the answer is yes, then your one should be no, for your own sake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think there is one for fire type and heat but i don't remember that one, perhaps is for the best. Forcing myself to keep the pain hidden, i use my other hand to slowly push away Luka steel like grip, and while i don't succeed in that she at least loosen her hold a little<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris open a few drawers seemingly a random on his desk, before retrieving what seems to be a laser pointer with far more buttons then seems necessary on it, then pressing a button, a quite big digital screen appear levitating behind him, must be an hologram of some sort and Chris press a few buttons on his device and the screen become a little bigger, then he begin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As i am sure you know, all living being posses as aura\" He begin to draw a very stylized shape of quadruped and a human with a black color \"Even trees has an aura of their own, although is significantly less intense then a more complex organism like a pokemon or a human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begin to draw differently colored 'cloaks' over the humanoid (Blue) and quadruped forms (Yellow), then he add a tree and design another cloak with a much less visible effect on it (Green)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For familiarity we human like to bind a colors to certain types of pokemons, like yellow for electric types, or green for grass types, but in this example i am ignoring this concepts so this pokemon here can very well be an Aggron ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well, based on this facts, we have studied the aura of pokemon for..i don't know, centuries? We called it differently by then, but it's always been this what we studied\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris then press another button and the screen become blank again \"Now, our more recent researches permitted us to discover how pokemon are able to do what they do, like discharging great quantity of electricity, spitting ice and of course use psychic abilities; all this talents are directly related to their auras or ability to focus both Inner AND Outside energy, this can be easily proven when an attack become more or less efficient in certain environments, one quite famous attack among trainers in particular even change type based on the environment it's used in! Ehm, sorry, anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris begin to draw what obviously is a Lucario given the shape and spikes \"Certain kind of pokemons are able to exert an even bigger control over their own auras, but all pokemon do it with various degree of efficiency, and this capacity is what usually differentiate what we commonly categorize a powerful pokemon by a meek one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stylized Lucario appear near the other one, then a pretty impressive yellow cloak is draw upon the first Lucario, and a far more smaller one on the second \"No matter how much powerful a pokemon is, it's aura reserves are always pretty limited in comparison the the energy required to power most of it's attacks, as such even the most strong pokemon in existence will eventually need to learn how to channel the environmental energy to his advantage, of course a skilled opponent may attempt to do the same, but we can talk about that later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris draw another aura effect over both pokemon, an enormous one over the second Lucario who had the smaller aura before, and a significantly smaller over the first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been proven that many champions have a very limited aura reserved within themselves, but are able to draw a significant amount of energy from the environment, as such giving them an enormous advantage over their opponents no matter how deep the reserves the other pokemon have, and when inevitably the opponent energy depletes, the match is practically over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon with the originally bigger aura get crossed in red while Chris add...sweat? Overt the other Lucario<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why many trainers decide to specialize in only one or two types of pokemon, every type has a difference method of accumulating energy and a significantly different method to store it, and knowing all the in and out of this process often mean the difference between victory and defeat in any match\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing another button the screen become blank again \"Now, there is so much more arguments we can talk about, but given your rank as an agent i am sure you know them already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not really, so i decide to ask \"You mean that the capacity of a pokemon like speed or strength, in the end are directly related to how well they can channel the environment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems baffled for a moment, but professionally answer \"Well, not exactly, i mean yes a pokemon with more talent in focusing it's aura in specific ways can significantly become more capable in certain aspects, this of course would probably penalize something else, and our studies are confirming that this skills seems hereditary. But channeling is only part of the process, an important part to be sure, but merely a...lets say a third of it, the rest come from training and of course personal talents, i never saw two pokemon channeling in the same identical way, similar maybe but never identical, and sometimes the trainer aura too seems to influence this ability, but ultimately the answer is...in part\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the trainer aura can influence the pokemon ability to restore their own reserves? This could be the key in understanding my..gift, i need more info<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI interrupt him again \"How much the trainer aura can influence a pokemon, to what extent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile return again \"We are yet unable to determine the exact level of influence a trainer can be for it's charges, but the unique experiment conducted here in this very lab, proven that in certain circumstances the trainer can alter the pokemon ability to restore it's aura quite deeply, to the point the pokemon may become so reliant on it's master, that it may even become incapable of replenishing itself at all without it, only a long and scrupulous rehabilitation that we still are developing, can theoretically restore the pokemon original ability to 'recharge' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this are borderline cases, most of the time the effect is much more manageable, but it's possible. Our research also discovered why, well mostly. It's pretty easy actually, when a pokemon train with it's master, it constantly replenish it's aura near him and therefore the energy used to replenish it's reserves are..changed by the trainer presence. Stronger the trainer aura is, more effective the pokemon become as part of the energy is already 'processed' for him, or her. Obviously the pokemon use the already naturally converted energy it's trainer knowingly or unknowingly provides, and the pokemon body adapt it's ability to channel this modified energy more effectively in time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, combined auras are more energy rich for the pokemon, but channeling this modified version for a long time, or a particularly energy rich version may make the pokemon unable to effectively channel basic environmental energy as before. Also it seems certain pokemon feel physical-mental pleasure in absorbing certain combined auras, we are still not sure why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck</span></div></div>",

But it can't be this easy, can it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping down what can very well be my last chance to get out this whole mess about affinity i ask \"There is a way to..prevent a pokemon to absorb a specific aura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris think on it for a while, then shake his head \"Not that we know of, not even sure it's possible. Our experiment proven that a pokemon May chose to not absorb most of the additional aura provided artificially, but we are not sure if it's even possible for them to do so with a real one, coming from something alive i mean, nor a method to prevent a pokemon from channeling a specific source, so we are not really sure it's possible either, most of us would say no if asked, me included\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it? That's all the great league know?! So what, i just had to...accept my fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gloomily ask \"It's that why many pokemon are so, condescending with their masters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nod \"We think so, aura is life, for pokemon this is doubly true as they use aura for everything, as such standing physically close to their trainer most pokemon feel..better, and if you are referring to sex the answer is definitely, having him Inside them or being inside her, boost this effect by a significant degree, at least temporarily. So yes, trainer pokemon prefer a human partner for a very scientific reason, and it help most of them see the trainer as their alpha, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so if a human fuck a poke, it will feel much better for her than mating with another poke, is that what you are scientifically saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..That's, is a very crude manner of saying it, but yes, it can be summarized that way, provided the human aura is something that this specific pokemon body 'like', otherwise the boost is minimal although still present\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother, i need to know more \"And will not another pokemon suffice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shake his head \"Usually no, as i have said before a pokemon naturally try to channel environmental energy, with training and practice this effect increase exponentially, but the pokemon body literally consume the energy they channel, releasing a sort of dark energy we are still actively studying, probably as a compensation for the environment, we still don't know, but in any case nothing effectively usable remain behind, not for a normal living being at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breathe deeply, taking time to formulate a better answer i hope  \"Humans however, do not consume aura to live, sure we use it to a point, but we do not literally nullify it in the process, and most of it when not used by martial arts or other kinds of methods or technique, end up literally spilling away like in a river that has too much water, it's perfectly natural for us, for our body to do so, and differently from them, what we release it's perfectly usable, an advantage pokemon are quite willing to use, as i said before we are not even sure if they can actually refuse to use it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence awkwardly permeate the air between us...until i decide to ask a last question \"...Are pokemon being designed this way? On purpose i mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris seems surprised for a moment \"Not sure what do you mean by designed, as pokemon naturally, well okay, human significantly influenced pokemon development a lot in the years, but still they evolved naturally this way. But if you mean Arceus 'made' them this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flinch in hearing that name<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I cannot scientifically answer that question Mr. Jaden, but personally i think yes, it has been done on purpose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think Ar..\" I take a deep breath \"Arceus made pokemon this way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe confidently answer \"It's too precise. The whole process is too fine tuned to be a mere chance, it would have been far more logical for evolution to use other pokemon aura or, natural adaptability on specific environments to focus their channeling ability on, the fact that it's so effective with humans and practically useless among pokemon suggest a specific intent, but the reason? No idea, beside making human and pokemon co-dependent on each other, i see no other logical explanation, but i am a mere scientist, not a entity capable of shaping worlds if what said of it it's true, so i don't pretend to comprehend what goes on 'his' head, if it even had one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't even know what to think, if this if all true, then i have no real way to get out of this mess, not conventionally at least. Decided that we had lost enough time, i ask Chris to explain his theory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, we lollygagged quite a bit uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clean the screen again, \"Now, my theory is that the aura of the pokemon of this center, is being forcefully altered in some manner, not completely sure how, but i believe someone is feeding our pokemon energy boosters and then give them no choice but absorb an artificial aura similar to the one we used in our experiments, specifically tuned to an opposite frequency of the pokemon in question. Sadly, i cannot prove it, as whatever is given them must be completely metabolized by the time we make the analysis, so it must be completely consumed in less then 6 hours, and we didn't found any anomalous energy source in the complex, so it must be a portable version turned on for a small time span, I'd say less then an hour\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod at Chris explanation, a little paranoid but, it does make sense<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait for a good half minute before it was clear Chris has nothing else to say, and if it's a theory he probably has no proof<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the other think about your theory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally wake up again from his torpor \"They said i have no proof, and our investigation turned out with no significant result, i think someone on the inside is doing the job, probably one of the orderly, but the pokemon are reluctant to talk to us, and if there is a mole in the security office it will take too long to get any substantial proof, we cannot wait for them to make a mistake, you have saw how badly that Heliolisk took it, and a desynchronized aura would explain why he felt so weak\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why, what would they gain by doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sbuff, obviously angry \"They probably want to replicate our results, it's well known which pokemon undergo the experiment i spoke about, probably whoever send them hope to gather enough data and make the experiment themselves, it's a foolish endeavor, but no matter their reason they must be stopped\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"How can i help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen is replaced by a map of the upper complex, the breeding center \"You best bet would be gaining the trust of the electric and dragon type pokemon contained here\" He point to a rather large room \"and use them as a distraction  catch the bastard while he is using his device, we already tried this method but the pokemon do not let anyone remaining inside their room for too long, they probably resent us a little for the constant mating, don't really blame them. WE of course also attempted to use cameras, but the footage is always clean, that why i am sure someone in security is involved\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod again, then a small, pang of doubt surface in my mind \"So you want to use my affinity for dragon and electric type to gain the pokemon trust trust is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the pokemon gender..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrug \"Mixed, usually pokemon inhabiting this room have completed the planned mating cycle and are placed there to rest, but some may still be..ehm, active, but with your experience as an agent and your...improved Lucario you shouldn't have any problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fake smile appear on my lips, then i turn towards a grinning Luka<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she doesn't set me up first</span></div></div>",

Deciding that at this point it doesn't really matter if i encourage her or not having she already made up herd mind about it, i satisfy my curiosity by pushing my hand up and...yep, my fingers are definitely caressing something both hot and soft, i also curiously find how easily the lips of her sex are parting at my touch, i would have expected the body a fight type pokemon to be more, eh, resilient?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka doesn't certainly waste any time to express her approval as she press her hips down on my hand, rubbing herself a little on the limited surface my hand can offer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone assume a low purring like qualities \"Mhrrrr, Master, have i finally met your approval?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing slowly i manage to calm down somewhat, it's difficult given the situation but focusing on a calm and relaxing image of a peaceful, deserted beach, i manage to pull away my hand...well no, i don't as Luka use her paw to keep my limb pretty much pinned against her tights<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the tone of my voice as even as i could \"More like piqued my curiosity Luka, tell me, how much aura can you actually manage to absorb from me in this position. Enough for a simple move? The equivalent of a satisfying sneak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka purring intensify a little, as she press herself on my hand more vigorously \"Not as much as i would like Master, but why knowing what we can do should change anything between us? Our relationship with trainers and close friends alike have always worked this way, and Chris did told you that our, mmh how to call it; feeding does not affect a human at all, we are simply using what human end up losing no matter what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stop ribbing herself on my hand, and now try to bend my finger up, to push them inside her i wager \"Nothing changed Jaden, i am the same Lucario you met less then an hour ago, nothing more, nothing less\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my lack of cooperation, she manage to bend two of my finger the way she want without causing much more then an uncomfortable stiffness on my hand, then as expected she push her hips down keeping my finger just where she want them. A hot, tight sensation envelop my two unwilling fingers as she manage to basically masturbate herself using my hand, the sensation is unlike anything i have felt until now, it just like a bolt of..something just crawled up my spine and released pure unadulterated pleasure in my brain, fortunately the effect is brief, as i find myself nearly falling to the ground as my legs suddenly seems barely capable of sustaining my weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka purring diminish just enough for me to notice \"Like it Master? This is what i am feeling with just your fingers in me;\" she let a few seconds pass to ensure her point is clear, her vaginal walls are still holding my fingers hostage in their delirious pulling \"Imagine what i will feel when we will mate for real, with your hard, rigid cock spearing my insides and taming me like the bitch i am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally recover most of my strength, and manage to push myself away from the now unresisting Lucario, her purring now slowly fading \"Is that your game Luka?\" I breathe deeply a few times \"Using me as nothing more then a living battery charger for your pussy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka expression completely break in a melodious laughter \"Mhahaha, But of course not, Jaden, how can you not understand? Yes, we pokemon take sustenance from human in a sense, but we are not parasite; our emotions, our feelings are real just like our pleasure and pain; in exchange we allow humans a significant control over our lives, and we enjoy giving our masters pleasure as much as you like taking it from us, we are more then willing to share our bodies and our feelings with anyone that treat us with at least a modicum of respect, often far less then we deserve\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka manage to embrace me from behind just like before, but this time a soft warmth and a sense of happiness is all i feel coming from her \"We merely want to coexist Jaden, and possibly getting a good mating or two in the meantime\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly it's my own mouth that speak \"Or three or four, and possibly a place to live and someone to care for you while you are at it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tighten her embrace a little \"Wouldn't mind it, and perhaps a decent training for a species that love to fight just as much as you like to watch us doing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy witty side can't resist the succulent plate \"Fighting or Mating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reply by giving me a gentle lick on my neck \"Id say Both, right Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ping of the elevator make us both jolt and interrupt our light hearted conversation, as she remove herself from my back and i recover most of my composure just in time to see the woman who greeted us when we arrived, patiently waiting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she spot us a sincere smile appear on her lips \"Finally, i was beginning to think that Chris explanation had the same soporific effect it had on our supervisor last week, poor dear collapsed on his chair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can hear Luka giggling behind me as we get out of the elevator \"Actually i found his explanation quite interesting, at least it was if what he told me is true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman i now recall to be called Angie, or at least by nickname, look at me with an unreadable expression, something akin to amusement and pity at the same time \"If i know Chris and his reasoning, and i do, probably yes, if he also explained to you his Master Plan, and again i am sure he did, depends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie sign to me to follow, before walking towards to dreaded observation windows \"While i agree that it's probably an insider job, his conclusion on why they are doing it or how are sketchy at best, all our security personal is thoroughly examined before even having the chance to know what we are really doing here, and even then all our our surveillance system is mostly automated, no matter their clearance editing the video is far beyond their knowledge and skill, i should say impossible but as a scientist, i learned to not use such word lightly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur impromptu guide stop, inviting me to look at the window; inside the not particularly spacious room a Charizard is pinned down by what seems to be a Muk and vigorously fucked, much to her displeasure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie continue \"Normally permitting a Muk to mate with pretty much anything not acid resistant would be quite foolish on a breeder part, as his insemination would probably severely damage the female reproductive organ, possibly even killing her. As such this and all our Muk specimen as been implanted with a gene that drastically raised their base Ph, rendering them mostly innocuous, if not still slimy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Muk completely ignore us as he suddenly stop and evidently unleash his seed inside the Charizard, as the base of her tail get literally plastered with a sticky white substance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie voice become like a commentary on a learning channel as i look at the poor fire type being used just she was little more then a hole to breed \"While our research in the aura field of pokemon is quite important for our goals and understanding this world a little better, it's our genetic labs that are the real hearth of our work here, and it's thanks to this field of our research if this Charizard not only will survive this insemination session intact, but will also have a good change of exiting this room as a mother, despite normally such breeding would produce nothing but pleasure, well for the Muk at least, maybe the Charizard too is she was in this kind of thing, sadly our data say she is not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ponder her words for a while, not sure how much really, i only realize that time has passed when Angie lead me to another window<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Differently from Team Shadow our goal is not to create the kind of creature you encountered while assaulting their base, we are simply trying to remove some of the limitation Arceus has imposed on pokemons, in particular we are trying to successfully breed a Dragon and and an Electric type in the hope to obtain anew unique species, our calculation estimate that such union would give us the best possible base to further our research, but sadly we are still unsuccessful yet.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie with a more sad tone continue \" For now we only managed to abate the probabilities a little, and even the Charizard you just saw inseminated will probably end up with all Charmander, perhaps a Grimer but i wouldn't count on it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie then become all smile again \"By the way, you may be interested in one? We already have three successful breeding session from those two and we certainly don't need all of them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn toward Angie \"Wat?\"</span></div></div>",

So, interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain still for a few uncomfortable moments before realizing i practically froze over at her simple question and restart my higher brain functions \"Ah, okay. What do you mean by 'interesting inclination to fight', aren't all pokemon inclined to fight each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie seems amused by my answer \"As with many other things in life, things are rarely what they seem to be, and pokemon make no exception to this rule. Yes, most pokemon have a what we can call a natural attraction to various form of combat, but not necessarily all of them like it, more then once i happen to find a pokemon skilled in combat, but unwilling to fight unless absolutely necessarily, in truth is most of them doesn't really have a choice; if a female in the wild do not want to become the main attraction of horny males, be she in heat or not, the only choice she has are either accepting it, or fight back; sometimes a particularly desirable male may find himself in similar circumstances, especially when he is the only candidate available for reproduction, or when he need to establish a territory for example\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing my incredulous expression she clarify \"You really thought that only a male can be the active perpetrator in a forced breeding? Female pokemon can have very convincing arguments when they are interested i assure you, i assisted in more then a few Gardevoir forcing their chosen mate to inseminate them, once i even saw a Raichu using her Thunder Wave to paralyze a Buizel before having her way with him, may not be as common as the reverse, but it happen from time to time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain stunned for a moment at the revelation, but perhaps i shouldn't be surprised, given what just happened in the elevator \"Can i guess the 'Excellent Docility' being..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie smile become an amused grin \"Let's just say that during our test, we had no need to promise a sweet reward to get our lastest batch obey orders, on the contrary we nearly had to nearly fire a temporary employee for abusing her position and..entertain herself with one of the males\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise my eyebrow as i hear Luka giggling behind me \"You actually have temporary researcher working on special project like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie pull out her PDA and press a button at the side of the viewing window \"Of course not, but it's sort of tradition to let aspirants breeders and sometimes trainers to handle a few minor jobs in a breeding center, especially city folks who only real pokemon sighting are pets and the casual trainer passing through;\" she press a few buttons on her PDA and a red light begin to flash on her screen \"most pokemon center or mart are usually on the outskirts of a city to allow trainers a quick rest or the rapid medical support if necessary, most trainers don't bother exploring a city unless there is something interesting to participate or see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red light on Angie PDA stop flashing and is substituted by a warning text \"Now what...how no\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to not let my worry apparent in my voice \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shake her head \"It's that damn Zorua again, she love the enhancers taste we give to pokemons just before their scheduled breeding cycle, apparently their flavor is unique and quite appealing to most of our residents, more then once she managed to elude the image recognition and manage to sneak inside the breeding room...you know what? I am not saving her this time, let her see what happen when a single female get locked up with a bunch of drugged, horny males roaring and ready to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback from Angie sudden change, i find myself stepping back a little as she press a series of digital buttons on her device. Looking at the window i notice a single pokemon, an Umbreon, happily munching on some sort of 'orange snack bar' left on the ground; the scene remain peaceful until a group of five new pokemon are let inside the room, it's easy to recognize the Houndoom, the Flareon and the Sandslash among them, not sure what the other two poke are, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out their that their compatibility group for breeding is the same<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie finish her small adjustment to what i think is the breeding cycle tables and say \"I saved that little troublemaker from this very same situation trice already, but given she completely ignore our instructions, i think it's time for her to see..ah, here we go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Umbreon, that at this point it's clear it's actually a Zorua, doesn't even notice the new arrival so absorbed in her feast, until the Flareon unceremoniously mount her, forcefully pinning her front half to the ground and grind his quite visible erection over her rapidly moistening sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zorua uselessly try to free herself from the male grip, but both given her positioning and probably the drugs now circulating in her blood, are preventing her any real chance to escape the amorous Eon on her back. The Zorua still manage to remain 'cloaked' in her illusion but this doesn't help her as the Flareon experiencedly realign himself and manage to bury more then half is meat in his new plaything with little fuss, rapidly pushing her down and slowly forcing more and more of his rod into the now very sorry dark type<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie press what i recognize is the intercom button near the window \"Turn her around, i want this recorded\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flareon quickly nod and extract himself from his unwilling mate, then the group growl at their surrounded prey as daring her to escape while the Flareon use his muzzle to push the unruly Zorua backside and make it face us, i barely have the time to look at the still open and healthy looking Umbreon pussy, that the Flareon immediately mount her again, rapidly forcing the female under him to readjust to his size<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI force myself to turn my head away, as i find the spectacle far more arousing than i expected; What's happening to me? am i day after day slowly becoming what my predestined mate want me to be? Or, or i am just adapting as any human would \"Isn't this..cruel? I get she disobeyed but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She disobeyed repeatedly despite perfectly knowing what those 'tasty snacks' are used for, i had to personally rescue her from a similar fate three times, and a colleague mentioned at least another, so; no, it's not cruel, it's simply what would have happened in the wild in similar circumstances, and she is not even in her fertile state yet, so no risk of ending up with an eggs either\" She nod at her reasoning \"Hopefully she will learn this time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to look at the window, seeing how the Flareon is now mating her with gusto, pushing himself as deep as he can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away for good i ask \"What pokemon was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braixen, a Vaporeon and three Zweilous, all with the new Genic alteration sequence we used for the Charizard. Should have been a test group for the next insemination batch, but no matter, we can reschedule this same group for next week. I actually feel sorry for the females, all that preparation and now;\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a chuckle escape her lips \"I guess even pokemons sometimes may end up frustrated and deluded\" she chuckle again \"can't really blame their scheduled males trough, not this times at least. After all, with such a fresh playmate to partake with, I Am sure in a reversed situation the females Would have done the same, believe me i saw it happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes and try to relax, breathe deeply as a palpable sense of dread begin to manifest itself in my brain \"Angie? Where the scheduled females are kept?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn to me \"Hm? Oh, in the temporary preparation room, just beside the secondary genetic lab\" She lead me to the appropriate viewing widow just a few steps ahead, where sure enough, five quite anxious looking pokemon are kept \"Here, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod nervously, noticing the door with the initial GL2 laser marked over it \".....It's that...the only access to the lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie look at me confused \"Of course not, the main...right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression become soft, with an evident tendency to pity \"The main access is sealed during the night, leaving only this and the emergency door available for tonight, and obviously opening the emergency door would trigger the alarm so;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish her phase, or try to \"So if i want to capture this turncoat or whatever; i must...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy trembling voice allow Angie finish in my place \"Remain the whole night with five sexually frustrated females that may or may not prefer an exotic mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find my right eye twitching for some reason \"That..that one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie tone is evidently meant to give me courage \"Unfortunately we cannot relocate them, as the other preparation room is occupied by tomorrow scheduled group, and in their current state putting them back in the general recovery room is probably a bad idea, sure the males in there are probably tired but, we cannot risk it, and their assigned cell are occupied right now as this group should have been quite busy....cannot release them outside in the breeding facility ranch either, too risky\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Angie with a disheartened expression as saying 'that's your encouragement?' as she merely shrug \"Sorry, forcing them to sleep with the drugs already in their system may seriously compromise their metabolism, but we can calm them down, a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka lovingly embrace me from behind \"Don't worry Master, if they try something i do not approve-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sarcastically reply \"Will take their place instead\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say that even Angie appeared surprised by how Luka grin could stretch</span></div></div>",

I didn't knew about your affinity with the Dark element\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking my head i reply \"No, she is merely vicious enough to use certain moves that i wouldn't normally use on my worst enemy, but all considered, i will probably end up to\" I look at her in the eyes \"Beside, she made pretty clear what she want and what she offer in return, being with me for a permanent joyride in exchange for her own body and soul; or the body at least\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can reply \"And no, i don't need another member of the team like that, one like her already overfill the ranks, so, prove your abilities to me, prove that we can work together seamlessly And, Always be honest with me; respect these base lines and i will be more then happy to welcome you aboard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka seems to remain lost in her thoughts for a small while, then she nod \"Very well, do i assume that successfully protecting you tonight will be my field test..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"Yes, it goes without saying that i won't give you any order, as there may be an occasion where i am unable to do so, and i want to see what kind of strategy you will end up using tonight, it will also give pointers on where your training is lacking if at all and where to focus my effort in improving your combat skills, nothing earth shattering\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nod again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue \"Good, now, the first time i met you outside that TS base with your brother you where 'just' a normal Lucario, at least physically. Now, well, i am sure you have guessed what my question is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sign the duo to follow me towards the labs, better scout the ground a little to find a good ambush spot for our guest of honor. Luka remain silent for nearly a whole minute before uncertainly begin her explanation \"I can't tell you much, only that my evolution isn't only the result of my intensive training. When they found me just after leaving you, i was desperate to get your attention, i knew that with you i would have been able to finally realize my potential, i felt it; but....but i knew that i would have never being able to compete with the rest of your team, as even the weakest member aura i felt was significantly more focused then mine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my composure at the word they \"Who are this, they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....The league, they knew that i wanted to be in your team and...offered me a deal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait for her to continue \"........I....the term where simple...qualify as a full member of your team at any cost; report any possible contact with legendary pokemon as well as the general status of your mateship with them. In exchange, i get subjected to a mostly safe experimental procedure with a particular recently discovered evolution stone that has the power to temporarily evolve certain kind of pokemons\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curiosity is piqued at her mentioning of this stone, the cloak and dagger part from the league i expected by now, heck probably all my transmissions with the pokegear are monitored \"Temporarily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, sort of. The stone permit my body to accumulate a greater amount of energy that i normally could, and permit me to channel it in my aura to force my body to, sort of superevolve, i don't fully understand the procedure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur walk is nearly over \"Go on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...As long as i manage to keep my aura level beyond a certain threshold i will keep this form, but if my aura is reduced under...fifty or sixty percent they explained, my body would deevolve and return in the shape of a mostly normal Lucario. As soon as i gather sufficient energy i will be able to reevolve again in this form, but, apparently this suoperevolution is quite stressing for the body, so they recommended me to not reevolve until at least a half a day or more has passed to avoid any possible complications, apparently even they do not know all the details of how it work, or why it work only on certain pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeddling with something they don't understand? Check<br>\r\nSpying on me? Check<br>\r\nEncouraging me to mate with the Legendaries? Check<br>\r\nGiving me any answer to all this mess?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As an afterthought you prepare a few more sandwiches for the night. While putting them together you hear Sylvia and Luka conversing in pok\u00e9speak. While you couldn't understand them you felt relatively certain that Luka was asking how to appeal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile bleakly, \"I doubt I'll be able to get out this\" you whisper to yourself. \"Jaden\" \"Yeah Luka?\" \"We don't want any distractions tonight right?\" \"Right\" you answer slowly, peering cautiously at the Mega Lucario. \"Well, if we don't want anything getting in the way we should take care of any urges or needs we might have\" you chuckle and lean on the table. A furtive glance at Sylvia confirms your earlier suspicions as she develops a sudden interest in the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well I can't ignore the needs of my Pok\u00e9mon\" Luka gazed at you in adoration before leaping into your arms. \"I love you\" she pulls you into an embrace and guides her short muzzle to your lips. Her longer canine tongue invaded your mouth and pulled your tongue into her mouth where she sucked on it tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka breaks the kiss slowly, leaving a string of saliva connecting your mouths. \u201cCome with me. I know a place we can be more comfortable.\u201d \u201cJust a second, Sylvia what do you want to do?\u201d I think I\u2019ll explore for a while\u201d She smiled sweetly \u201cHave fun\u201d with that, the impatient fighting-type grabbed your arm and pulled you out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon found yourself in a small bedroom with room for only a midsize bed and a small dresser. \u201cThis is the room I\u2019ve been staying in\u201d Luka explained as she closed and locked the door. \u201cThey said I could use it for as long as I wanted\u201d She roughly pushed you onto the bed, nearly drooling in anticipation. \u201cAnd I think I want to use it for the next couple hours\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Luka leaps up onto the bed with you under her. Her paws skillfully unbuckle your belt and yank your pants off your legs. She tugs on your shirt \u201cOff, take it off\u201d you heed her words and remove the garment, exposing your torso to the Mega Pok\u00e9mon. She slowly strokes your chest, her paw glowing faintly. \u201cWith this energy you\u2019ll be able to go for hours\u201d she grins devilishly \u201cLet\u2019s see just how long it\u2019ll be\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile one paw massages your chest the other slides down to your waist and finds the waistband of your boxers. You are struck by a sudden pulse of pleasure as she grips your shaft and begins to pump. In response you grab her breasts and begin to knead softly. Her breasts, while not overly prominent, were soft and sensitive as evidenced by her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega Lucario moans and stops moving for a second as she relishes the pleasure. The pause lasts only for a moment before she returns to her ministrations. The paw gripping your member alternates squeezing gently and rubbing up and down your shaft. Your thumb gently rubs one of Lukas stiff nipples while you begin to nibble and lick the other. Your empty hand slides down the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s body, stopping between her legs. You had expected her to be wet, but she was far more aroused than you had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tease her outer lips for a moment before sliding one finger in. \u201cAhhh\u201d Luka sighed as you slightly penetrate her sex. Encouraged by her reaction you began to pump in and out. As your finger slid in and out, you could feel the quantity of her fluids increase. After a moment you add a second finger making her shudder in delight. \u201cUnh, l-let me turn around\u201d Luka mumbles. You give her a small kiss before removing your fingers. The Lucario stands up and turns herself around placing her cunt above your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms wrap around Lukas waist and pull her closer. She shivers as your tongue slides into her folds. You weren\u2019t surprised to find that she tasted slightly metallic. It becomes your turn to twitch as you feel Lukas breath on your member, followed by her tongue. She drags her tongue up along the length of your shaft, giving it a liberal coating of her saliva. A few beads of pre exit your tip only to be swept up by the canine licking your dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to be outdone, you press your tongue as deep as you can into Lukas\u2019 snatch trying to find her g-spot. Your efforts are rewarded when every muscle in her body stiffens at once and she lets out a little howl. \u201cOooh, don\u2019t stop\u201d, hearing her pleas you focus your efforts on that one spot, driving her closer to the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her orgasm coming on Luka suddenly engulfed your entire length in her muzzle and sucked hard. You inhale sharply as her teeth brush against your vulnerable area, but don\u2019t move to stop her. You feel your own climax approaching as she continues. Choosing your moment, you lightly bite her clit as you re-insert your fingers into her sopping wet sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka suddenly goes limp with a cry and a rush of liquids flow from her cunt. She lays on you for a moment before speaking in a shaky voice \u201cY-you didn\u2019t cum\u201d \u201cWell I can think of a way to change that\u201d you respond. The Lucario grins and turns herself around so that she\u2019s facing you. Still a little drained Luka aligns herself with your member and lowers herself onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo much\u201d Luka moans as you fill her up. \u201cSo deep\u201d Her tongue slips out of her mouth and she pants happily. Her vaginal walls ripple and contract around your manhood, trying to milk you of your seed. Her hips sway side to side, sliding your member around inside her. You run your fingers through the soft fur on her belly and hips, enjoying how it feels. Luka makes a contented sound and slowly rises up until you only slightly spread her folds. Waiting for a moment she then drops back down taking you inside her again. Taking a second at the bottom to grind the Lucario keeps moving up and down. You lean up and, careful of her spikes, hold her tightly as she slides up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new angle causes your member to rub new places in Lukas\u2019 sex, earning a moan from the fighting type. You continue to hold her and press upwards in time with Luka, getting deeper than before. You can feel your climax welling up inside and thrust harder, intent on release. Luka responds by clenching down on your shaft, vastly increasing the friction. \u201cI\u2019m close\u201d you say through gritted teeth. \u201cYes, cum. cum inside me, I want to feel your hot seed filling me up!\u201d Luka practically shouts as she nears climax. You shove up once more before you explode firing shot after shot of hot sticky spunk inside her canine cunt.<br>\r\nLuka yells and spasms slightly as she orgasms with you. You slowly flop onto your back pulling the tired Pok\u00e9mon with you. You rest for a moment before you have to report to the habitats for your investigation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just waiting for the right moment to strike? Given how she firmly grabbed my arms and pinned them to my sides it would definitely seems so<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy black pokemon purr gently with a mischievous grin promising far more trouble that i can manage at the moment, as she continue to stimulate my arousal relentlessly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Master, was she good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little strength i manage to free my arms from my horny but still somewhat gentle pokemon grip, only to have her place my hands on her hips instead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah, isn't a trainer duty to satisfy it's pokemons needs at the best of it's capabilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to glare at my newest source of tiredness with confidence \"It isn't a pokemon duty to obey it's master orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smile back at my retort, and relaunches by pushing her hip over the head of my now quite rigid organ, and angle herself so that her chest is fully over mine, her nose gently tap my nose as she let my naturally rising cock to angle herself just right and, as soon as the head slip in position she decisively push herself down and engulf my whole tool in one go, making me grunt in a mix of pain and pleasure as her insides welcome my presence a little too eagerly for my yet not fully recovered member<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to think straight while much of your blood is pumped elsewhere, but i will never cease being appealed at how easily pokemon can achieve full sexual readiness in such a small time frame, or how they manage to get so wet and relaxed that i can reach full penetration in one go, definitely not what i was told in sex ed, although admittedly it never included pokemons....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy partner, differently from me, doesn't even flinch when our hips touch and immediately begin to ride me with fervor, always pushing me as deep as i can go before lifting herself up for the next push<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whine pleasurably and answer \"Order me then\" she whine again \"Order me to stop\" she push herself down hard, eliciting a full moan out of her and another grunt of pain from me  \"Master\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last boasting words manage to trigger a surge of strength within me, a feeling vaguely close to an anger i remember have felt a few times already since i became a trainer, a dark inscrutable emotion that i can't really define, pushing me to act seemingly without reason or purpose and demanding an immediate reaction against anything that could lower my status as the alpha in my team<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the limited freedom at my disposal i manage to push down on my hips the amorous Zoroark, she hiss in pleasure and stop moving, perhaps hopeful that she finally managed arousing me enough to get a more active mate, instead i raise myself in a setting position and grab the fur on her chest, managing to push her unresisting body down on her back with me on top of her; her triumphing smile is however quickly replaced by confusion as i pull myself out of her and somehow manage to lift her up just enough to throw her on the ground at the side of the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned from my sudden action, she remain on the ground where i casted her; my irrational emotion push me to get up from the bed and...before i can do anything else hes shape rapidly dissolve into nothingness, incredulous i turn to the bed only to see it dissolve as well, everything rapidly dissolve until i find myself alone in what seems to be an immense white room, with no visible source of light despite being perfectly illuminated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around a few more times, feeling my anger leaving me nearly as fast as it has come, before spotting a small figure lazily levitating towards me, with the perfect visibility this 'room' is giving, it doesn't take more then a few instants to recognize Mesprit in all her annoyed glory<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continue to float lazily in the air until she stop barely an inch from my face, crossing her arms on her chest and pouting \"You really had to do that Master? Was that a natural reaction to have one of your female not just bending over your bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my teeth in frustration as i reply \"You! It's one of your dreams again, is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit nod relaxedly, still keeping her annoyed expression \"Yes, i wanted to see how far i can push you, and what kind of female you prefer\" she uncross her hands, using them as scales to explain her idea, \"submissive\" she lower down her left hand, \"or aggressive\" she lower her other hand, then she raise them again, \"eager\" she again lower her left hand, \"or demanding\" as she lower her right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesprit then rapidly close in until the gem in her forehead touch mine, her eyes looking straight into mine \"What kind of female do you prefer, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my right hand i not so gently push her away, irritatingly replying \"What is this nonsense?! Why are you in my dreams?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrug nonchalantly \"Wasn't that obvious? I wanted to know how to approach you, and experimenting a little in your dreams seemed a good idea, never see anyone react so strongly before, but then again i am relatively new to this sort of thing...mmmh, perhaps i should ask to another female in our team, they should know if....mmmh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my nonexistent teeth harder \"You are Not in My team! And i am not your master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignore me for a few more seconds before happily nodding \"Yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the room vanish and i feel myself falling; i wake up startled, breathing in like a man who has been denied air for far too long, then realize i am still on the bed i must have fallen asleep in, Luka still resting peacefully at my side, no sign of anyone else being here either<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Lucario wake up worried \"Master, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring an hand on my chest, feeling my hearth beating a thousand mile per hour, but slowly calming down, i force myself to breathe more slowly \"Yes Luka, i am...fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look unconvinced, but accept my answer before dragging me down in her embrace \"Can we rest a little more Master? I still feel a little tired\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI embrace her back, enjoying her soft warm fur on my skin \"I am afraid not, we still have to prepare for tonight and beside, i bet the others will start to worry if we don't get there on time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk managed to find it's way on my lips \"And, i still have to test your skills and see if you are good enough in battle before letting you officially join...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sbuff angrily and tighten her grip, she reply mentally \"<i>I am not even bothering considering such demeaning insinuation a possibility MASTER. And if you value your unique gender characteristic</i>\" she use one of her paw to grab my still exposed jewel \"<i>you shouldn't either</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her paw grip tighten a little, not enough to hurt but more then enough to get her point across, i eagerly nod \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">You made you point</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grin sheepishly \"<i>I knew you would have see it my way Master, now, let's get ready, the sooner we finish the sooner we can return relaxing</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka gently release my family jewels and get up, depriving me of her soft warmness, not angry at her for her low blow, as a trainer i should have expected something like that, and i may have sort of deserved that; will still make her regret doing it later tough</span></div></div>",

That and she is a female, trying to understand her way of thinking is just wasted effort i know<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the room and using the few laser marked signs on the walls, i manage to reach what seems to be a central corridor fairly easily, but i end up forced to choose between two nearly identical paths, as i do not remember the correct acronym from where one i came from, i chose the right one and hope for the best<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of silent walking i begin to notice how Instead of the familiar rooms with initials i expected to find, i end up in a single well illuminated viewing room, significantly larger then any since entering the labs; inside various pokemons are apparently relaxing and playing under a calm artificial breeze, in what is must be a quite well done imitation of a large open park, complete with a small lake and a few shrubs of wild grass and trees here and there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop looking at the thick looking glass, perplexed by the scene before me, \"Why not make a small park like this on the surface?\" <br>\r\nThen i remember the programmed breeding session, and realize how much more convenient and secure and convenient must be this underground park in comparison to a real one in the open, for the researcher at least, it's far easier to monitor everything here and there is no risk of contamination from another 'donor' managing to bypass the possible fence/defenses in a way or another<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one else here and questions still running in my head, i decide to stop here for a bit an relax for a few minutes, i know that i have an investigation to run but, frankly i am Not looking forward remained closed inside what can probably be defined as a gilded cage with 5 sexually frustrated females that may or may not looking for something a little more exotic then usual, or just for something to scratch their hitch regardless. I shake my head and return to the matter at hand, my attention being attracted by a four legged cyan pokemon stretching just before the glass<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon seems to luxuriously test out all her limbs one by one, as to check if everything still work as expected, maybe after a long nap. The pokemon begin with her front legs and rapidly pass at her hind ones; until turning it's head to the side it must have noticed me staring through the glass as  the unmistakable Vaporeon figuratively freeze in it's place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curious pokemon get closer to the glass and begin to stare at me back intensely for a few seconds, until a sheepish grin appear on it's face; unsure on what it's grinning about i let my curiosity get the better of me and i walk closer to the glass, expecting pretty much anything to happen at this point, but at least i will know what the heck it's grinning about, beside, the glass seems more then thick enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen moments later i reach the viewing window so close that i can touch it, the pokemon lie itself on it's side and move the fin like tail out of the way, revealing the it as a clearly excited her, with reddened swollen lips, already partially parted in arousal, revealing glimpses of a moist bluish tunnel demanding some deserved attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, and look up from the Vaporeon, finding out a few pokemons engaging in a more personal kind of interaction, although most of them seems uncaring of the sporadic events and prefer continuing with a more conventional methods of entertainment, aided by a few gummy balls and toys<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distinct squeal brought back my attention to the Vaporeon, where a eager looking Pikachu try to mount the lying water type; she doesn't seems receptive to his explicit advances however, as she get up and decide to literally chill down the electric bully with a kick in his lower abdomen and shooting a well aimed Ice Beam to his...exposed male parts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knot in my stomach make me realize that despite not being the receiver of such cold reception, and agreeing that he probably needed the cooling, a small speck of sympathy still linger somewhere in my mind when i find where my hand instinctively covered my clothed male parts a little too strongly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that i have seen enough natural interaction between pokemon for today, i give a last brief look to the Vaporeon and notice how she ignore the whining Pikachu and look intensively at me, licking her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly leave the viewing room still feeling more then a little indisposed and confused, until i notice a small partially faded warning notice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokemon Recovery 9.3A - Humanophilia Reacclimatization Area<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...of all the places i could end up in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back at a brisk peace with a few pang of phantom pain coming from my groin every time i see a blue colored pokemon from the viewing room lined up in the correct and only other corridor, i manage to reach our arranged meeting place just in time to see Angie arriving, a door leading to one of the last place i want to be in right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimental breeding room 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....... at least this ones don't, shouldn't' have a human fetish, i hope<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy self-chosen bodyguard are already here chatting, with Zoroark sporting an unnatural big smile to an quite proud looking Luka; figure if a Dark and a Fighting type aren't managing to find something to Not turn into a competition of sort, better sleeping with Nysa tonight, at least she won't allow anyone <u>else</u> demanding attention while i am asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni don't even bother consider sleeping alone by now, my team won't let me anyway, plus with Mesprit sharpening her dream manipulation abilities on me, i will definitely feel safer with at least one of my mate around....did i just called them mate.....yep, i just did<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie clear her throat a little too hard to gain our attention, looking in my direction with a friendly but still serious expression<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening boys and girls, given the limited time frame available to us before security start it's routine patrol of the labs, i will be brief\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raise one finger in her left hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beside us and our dear over-talkative Chris, none one else has been informed of our plan to minimize any possibility of our saboteur escaping, as such, security has been informed of a malfunction of some cameras inside breeding room 2, this one, and a few other unimportant public rooms upstairs, this will permit you to walk around the habitat freely, as long as you don't come too close to the viewing window\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second finger join the first<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The security not knowing mean not being able to count on them for support, nor having disabled any alarm to avoid out target getting suspicious, that means no getting out the habitat till tomorrow morning, or, as soon as a guard spot you or our target. Do not worry about keeping the target subdued, as soon as you catch him or her, feel free to trigger the alarm on purpose, your personal security access as a top agent of the league permit you to do this and more without suffering repercussion, at least in any official league building like ours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triplet replace her hand duo<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The female inside this habitat has been treated with what can be generically described as an hormone enhancing drugs, and despite the chemical being more than just that, it will make the pokemon inside act just like you would expect from a bunch of extremely horny teenagers on leave, they Will try to seduce or even force to mate with them any compatible male they came across, as compatible i mean physically, not genetically, pokemon hardly care about this distinction even when calm, as many trainers can attest. Defend yourself Jaden, by any means you assume necessary, because if you don't, you will hardly get any time to get up, figure finding the time to ambush someone. Just, don't hurt them if you can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and a fourth finger join the trio<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourth and last point, remember that at night nearly all the habitat light are turned off, only a few are left on to avoid leaving the pokemon in total darkness, so, you won't be able to see much, your girls here are the only one that will be able to help you navigate the room safely, that and the need of protection will force you to stay close to one another during most of the night, so please do not engage in any kind salacious activities if possible, you Will end up attracting unwanted attention, being the other females or our target\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy black furred mate sbuff in annoyance, while Luka grin smugly at her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Kadabra will remain outside, ready to generate a small psychic bubble capable of interfering with teleportation or other mind manipulation abilities once active, just in case, unfortunately, we cannot have her keep it active the whole night, not only it would be quite stressful for her, but it also may tip our target that something is wrong, won't be surprising if among night vision goggles, our target used devices capable of detecting such suspicious interference\"</span></div></div>",

The habitat posses an artificial ventilation system right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie nod and sigh \"Yes of course, being underground means having a forced ventilation system but, being this a research lab and not just a simple breeding center, all the air being feed down here is strictly analyzed by an automated filtering system capable of detecting hundreds of possible dangerous components, the alarm is directly fed to the central security mainframe and cannot be disabled manually without authorization\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look at me apologetically \"Any attempt to sabotage it will be detected from the security station, and causing any event significant enough to stop the ventilation system in an area will also inevitably draw attention, that the last thing that we want right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, \"Plus we cannot alert anyone or risk our 'target' suspicious, i get it\" It's pretty obvious that at this point any feasible solution has been at least considered even before i came here, the only way to be sure in our little operation is to catch this agent or whatever he will consider him/herself, red handed, possibly with any devices it's using to avoid both the electronic alarms and placate the pokemons just enough to do his/her thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whatever device he is using that is capable of calming down a poke even during what i understood is a drug induced estrus, is definitely something I want to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPossibly keep too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done everything we have time to do, my bodyguard approach my sides and gently push me toward the door; wasn't exactly taking a genius to know i didn't, and still don't wanna, but duty is duty, albeit not exactly a chosen one, not by me at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's sad how little my personal opinion seems to matter these days<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie manage to keep a serious but friendly expression even with my personal guards escorting closeness, and as she press the button to unlock the door, i manage to spy a small sense of proudness and..envy? In her eyes, but i don't manage to tell her that she can gladly take my place if she want to capture this target so badly that i am literally dragged inside, the door sealing behind us with and angry hiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even the doors are subtle in this place, figure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment or two i nearly expect the probably now quite reluctant given their condition, occupant of this room to storm us the moment we set our foot in, once again, nothing more then wishful thinking, an open battle with my confident bodyguards would have been preferable to being stalked in the darkness through most of the night, and even without a clear victory, they would have learned to keep their distance, hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr wait with my reduced team at the ready, with me carefully looking at every close shadow, leave us in what i perceive a clearly awkward situation, stationed like morons with our back to a sealed door waiting for an attack that will never come, at least the cameras are off<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka move closer to my right while my Zoroark move forward to scout ahead; looking at my acquisition i must say to be impressed, beside moving a lot closer to me that i would retain then necessary she maintain a calm and serious behavior, a near perfect professionalism that i would expect from a real bodyguard or a combat veteran, her eyes focus on our surrounding and on her teammate with absolute, nearly unnerving precision. I can barely recognize the whiny canine like pokemon nearly begging to be taken from our late lunch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis duality all pokemon seems capable of is quite something, something either really good or a psychological derivation of a minor case of schizophrenia. But i doubt all pokemon of the world to be mentally insane, i would bet more on an adapted instinct of sort, enjoy the life without too much pretense and all, would make sense for a species that is literally more or less born to fight, would explain their stronger emotional reactions too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka gently push me forward toward a signaling Zoroark, now leading us toward a more isolated area of the habitat. Now that i am not too distracted with the imminent feeling of being ambushed at any moment, i manage to take a netter look to our surroundings; due to the lack of proper illumination my limited human eyesight can't discern much in the distance, but up close the dim light projected by the few lamps still active manage to give me an idea of the size and the condition of this habitat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally i would have thought the air heavy, saturated by pheromones, the ground dirty or at least looking 'lived' per say, and a few other probably too imaginative things i don't want to bother to remember; instead the room smell impressively clean, the air fresh and completely devoid of any strong smell whatsoever, despite a light lingering sweet scent i think it belong to the estrus induced females, this habitat look quite pristine all in all. Even the grass under my feet look quite healthy and smell..right<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dark pokemon signal us to hide inside a small glade, the trees and bushes around us should give us sufficient cover from outside, but still permit us a good visibility of the only entrance of this room, perfect place to spot and stalk our guest of honor if, when it finally decide to make it's entrance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, we speechlessly decide to lie waiting at the border of our temporary natural fort, with my two team member pressed closely to my sides, both trying to embrace me with the their closer arms and promptly getting pushed off by the other, forcing me to initiate Any kind of conversation in waht i already know will probably be a vain attempt of softening newly born rivalries<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the fifth or sixth attempt on both sides i grab both arms and force them down \"Stop it, damn it, what king of perverse bet have you made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka answer first \"Liliana said she could make you orgasm harder and in less time that i did, and i challenged her to prove if she could even manage to embrace you for more then a minute without trying to coax you into mating her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana? Oh, right, she told me that the other day..eh, alright; wait, just a minute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dark girl reply annoyed \"If you don't even let me touch my Master, how can i prove you wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka reply with an hint of anger \"Because i know you won't, you'll just try to remove his pants the first chance you got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana shrug \"So? You would do the same, or do you want me to believe that without me here, you'll won't be already on your back, legs up trying to seduce Master in rutting you silly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka blushes \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">i like seeing him while-</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana interrupt her nodding \"Me too, it's why i prefer a human over a pokemon any day, i can finally been fucked properly without tasting dirt every.single.time \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conversation is escalating a little too quickly for my tastes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka timidly ask \"How many times..you...you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana shamelessly \"Had been mated?\" She remain silent, as lost in thoughts \"the first time i was just...6-7 months old, just beginning to finally master my body as a Zorua, i was close to my first heat but not there just yet.\" She pause a moment \"Then a Grovyle decided to take a stroll just over the old fallen tree i decided to use for practice...he was...not gentle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana scoots a little closer \"My second time i was willing, mostly, and that Scyther was so skilled with his tongue, i just couldn't say no; he was surprisingly gentle, and quite small too where it counted but,\" she shrug again \"could have been worse\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka seems a little disturbed by the revelation \"A..bug? You mated with..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and if it wasn't for his..size, and my restlessness, he would have been a keeper\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana smile is almost creepy now \"We can't all be lucky and get our first rut with our beloved Master, could we now?\" She return to scan the ground for anything suspicious, and scoot just a little closer \"My last time before Master was an Arcanine and a Luxray during my last heat, i wasn't exactly willing but, i wasn't as determined as recently became, and thought it was better mated Then bruised And mated anyway, so i obliged, repeatedly....i still don't know why their seed haven't taken, i like to believe it was fate\" She come even closer and place her head on my shoulder \"or maybe the poisonous berries i eaten afterwards, that could have helped\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka take the other side and place her head on my other shoulder. I feel just like a couch on discount right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask \"Poisonous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm. And old trick that most female in heat use to prevent unwanted eggs, sometimes work, sometimes you'll get an egg And a stomachache. Worth the try I'd say\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the unexpected short revelation, i finally have two behaving and focused bodyguards at my side, ready to battle at the minimal sign of trouble; for the first time in a while, i finally begin to feel comfortable again beside my team</span></div></div>",

You check your watch to find that a mere thirty minutes had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liliana, how far away can you project an illusion?\" \"Practically anywhere I can see\" she said with a hint of pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's the plan. When they show up we're going to set off the alarms. At that point secrecy is no longer needed so we will be charging right through that door. Now by the time we get there the target will have probably already taken off, but that's actually to our advantage. The security system will have locked all the doors and sealed all the windows. Sylvia will be interfering with communication devices and teleportation, leaving them with only the option of running and trying to evade us inside the building. Luka, you should be able to keep track of them by using your aura. Liliana, I want you to trap them in an illusion as soon as you can\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once they are trapped we'll probably have to knock them out, or we could just let them wander in an illusion until the authorities arrive\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish explaining the hairs start to rise on the back of your neck, and you can tell you are being watched. \"Luka what's in the area?\" The Lucario's eyes glow as she examines the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master there is a Noivern aproaching our position\" \"Would you mind trying to get it to leave? We don't have time for me to get raped\" With a nod the fighting type stands and goes to confront the dragon type Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe isn't gone long and she returns \"Master, she doesn't seem to want to mate, I can see her aura. She is just curious as to why we're here\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to explain it, but I think that if we got close enough to talk she would be affected by my affinity. It's happened a couple times now. I don't want to risk it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, master\" Luka once more goes to address the Noivern. She doesn't seem to take kindly to being refused and lets out a rather loud growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luka we need to be quiet, can you shut her up\" you receive no affirmation but hear a quiet smack. Moments later the Mega-Lucario returns dragging an unconscious dragon. Luka lays her against a tree and takes her spot beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you continue to sit in silence as you wait for your target to arrive. Another hour into the night leaves you tired and still without any sign of the culprit. You are about to nod of when Liliana gently shakes you awake. \"Master I see someone outside the window\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright get ready to move\" you move into a cruch and focus on the glass pane. Sure enough there appears to be a human figure on the other side. They slowly move to the doorway and out of view. The door slides open with a pneumatic hiss, allowing us to see the culprit. A middle aged man wearing a lab coat over all black clothes steps into the room. His ginger hair is cut short and a goatee adorns his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense as he reaches into the interior of his coat. He pulls out a semi spherical device and places it on the ground. It slowly opens like a flower and the man presses a series of buttons on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go\" the two Pokemon at your side rush out of the grove and towards the man. In a panic he abandons his device and sprints out the door. You charge after them and out the door. The door slides shut at the press of a button preventing any of the inhabitants from wandering out, and the alarms go off as you slam the large red button on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving done that you follow the sounds of running footsteps to see the man simply running back and forth down a hallway, a terrified and bewildered look in his eyes. He doesn't react to your presence as he dashes past. Luka and Liliana are just watching him as he runs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got him in your illusion\" Your Zoroark nods happily \"good job, both of you\" </span></div></div>",

Clutching its' side in pain. You ran over to it ingoring the threatening snarl it gave you when you got close. you kneel beside it and take a lookat its' side. There is a large gash that looks infected just below the ribcage. Despite its' protests you pick it up and carry it into you house. In your house you bring it to your bed and lay it down. \"Stay here while I go get some medicine,\" You tell it. It seems to understand you but you are unsure whether it will listen or not. Despite this you run down the pokecenter/mart and pick up a full heal and a hyper potion. You were gone for less than five minutes but you were still worried \"Who knows how much trouble it could get into\" you mumble to yourself as you jog home. Sure enough the zoroark was trying to leave when you got back but had only made it as far as your door. It snarled when it saw you not wanting to be kept there. You lead the Zoroark back inside to your bed. As it sits down you notice that its' movements seemed pained. you quickly brought out the antidote you bought and began to spray the gash. When it felt the medicine sprayed onto its' wound the Zoroark howled in pain and knocked you back. \"Oww\" You grumbled \"Don't be such a baby\". You spray it again this time holding its' arm down so it couldn't whack you. You look at the wound and see that the toxins appear to have been neutralized. You then take out the hyper potion. The Zoroark sees this and tries to get away, but in its' weakened state it doesn't get out of you room before you drag it back to your bed. \"Stay here I'm trying to help you!\" As you use they hyper potion the Zoroark seems to realize that while it may sting it's actually healing it. when you finish the bottle the Zoroark jumps forward knocking you onto your back.

After some deliberation you decide on last nights' pizza. Taking a bite you sit on the couch and turn on the tv. You flip through the channels, eventually settling on a rerun of The Mentalist. You watch tv for several hours before you become bored and go outside. Your backyard ended right next to a forest so you saw quite a few wild pokemon in your yard. sitting in a lawn chair you take out a novel you had started, but after  a few chapters your eyes grow heavy and you begin to sleep in your chair. You wake up at about 6pm. wondering where the day had gone. You pick yourself up and head inside hungry once again. Little did you know that all this time you had been under constant surveilance. The Zoroark you had helped earlier had been watching you. She had thought that all humans were selfish and cruel but you had helped her for no apparent reason. She was very confused, she didn't understand why you had helped her, so she decided to watch you and find out what you had gained from helping her. Her special ability allowed her to get as close to you as she wanted with you being none the wiser. She used this to great effect keeping watch on you all day untill she concluded that you had gained nothing by helping her. This made her think \"What if humans aren't all bad?\" She thought back to the way you had helped her without even thinking about it. She remembered how you had held her as you carried her inside and her heart fluttered. I that instant she made up her mind, you were going to be hers, whether you wanted to or not. With these thoughts in her mind she slunk back into the forest already searching her devious mind for a plan.</span></div></div>",

You smile slightly and mumble\"Kids\". Closing the door you notice something on your door step. It was a flower but it was unlike any other flower you had seen before. It had six spearhead shaped petals, each had a black center that abruptly stopped and became crimson red. You gingerly pick up the flower and inhale its scent. You barely get a whiff but it makes your head spin! \"Whoah! Thats an intense flower\". You bring the flower into your kitchen and fill a small cup of water for it.

You looked and saw a long burn mark running across her arm \"Dang...\" Was all you could say you moved closer only to get your neck clamped by the other. \"AARRRGH\" 'I guess she doesn't want me near her...' You thought panicking but one of the only things that ran through your was 'What would the neighbors think' Your dying but your wondering what the neighbors would say after this day is over a brief imagination came up in your mind. ' \"I knew that Ethen was no good got killed by them Hydreigons I heard.\" \"I heard his head got chopped clean off!\" ' But your imagination didn't last long realizing your situation you quickly say \"I-I'm not gonna hurt you trust me...\" That's when you notice your up in the air it took a few seconds but the hydreigon finally let you go you went to go get that full heal, and max potion from your room.

Trying to dissuade any fear she might have you extend your arms and show her the medicine. She extends her head forward and sniffs them for a moment, before deciding they weren't a threat. You reach for her arm and tell her that this will sting. She nods her head in understanding and grips a tree branch in her jaws. When you see she's ready you spray her burn with first the full heal relieving the burn and then with the super potion to repair the damage. \"There you go, good as new!\" Hydriegon inspects the arm that had been injured before cooing happily and nuzzling you affectionately. \"Driegon! Hy! Hydriegon!\" \" Woah your welcome!\" you try to pry her off you, but to no avail. Her grip was like iron. \"Now that your healed you should probably get home\" you grunt. She responds by clutching you tighter and shaking her head. \"You don't wanna go?\" she shook her head \"You want to stay with me?\" she nodded vigorously. \"Well umm\" you looked away for a moment and when you et her gaze again she have you puppy dog eyes until you groaned \"Alright you you can stay\" \" Hydriegon!\" she cried hugging you very hard slightly depriving you of oxygen. Placing you on the ground she licked you on the cheek causing you to blush slightly. \"O-okay um. This is my house.\" you gesture over to the small building. \"It's not much but it's home\" Hydriegon picks you up and carries you over to the porch bridal style. \"You don't need to carry me\" her only response is to nuzzle your cheek and coo softly. To your surprise she opens the door with no problems despite not having thumbs. Walking into your living room, she places you on the couch and curls up around you. \"Hey, Hydriegon are you hungry?\" she nods her head excitedly. \"Well then lets get you some food\" you extract yourself from her grip and open your pantry, revealing all the food stored there. You grab some ingredients and quickly have a meal prepared for the dragon Pokemon. \"Here you go, I made it specially for you\" after a small taste she dove into the food devouring it in mere minutes. \"Wow you were really hungry.\" you grab the dishes and place them in the sink to be washed later. \"What would you like to do now?\" She wants to...</span></div></div>",
