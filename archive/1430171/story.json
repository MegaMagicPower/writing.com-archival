            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once every year grows a very strange and wonderful flower. It's quite different from that of a typical flower: all its petals are different colors, sort of like a rainbow. It's also resistant to over-watering, bug bites, pesticide, and even fire. The flower blooms for a month before it withers away completely, and its location changes each time: the sole seed it leaves after death is so small, it can't be viewed with anything but a microscope. It needs very little water and sunlight to live, so it can grow anywhere at any time...even on mountains and underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts newest location just happened to be in the same spot as young, spirited 19 year-old Laura Carley. The energetic girl had her short brown hair covered with a hat to protect her from the sun's rays, and she was sporting a pink tank-top and light blue shorts while on her daily walk, holding a water bottle in her right hand and her iPod in her left. Usually she enjoyed the outdoors, but the recent summer weather prevented her from going outside too much until today, where it was a much cooler 75 degrees outside. The reason for this concerns the pollen level: ever since Laura was a little girl, she sneezed from sniffing most flowers. In fact, one of the very few plants that didn't cause her to sneeze were cacti, which she kept 3 or 4 of at home in her windowsill, watering them every day. As the joyous woman continued her walk, she noticed the previously mentioned rainbow flower. The first thing she did was sit on the grass on her butt to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a flower quite like this before\", Laura said to herself as she gently plucked out the flower from the ground and took out her headphones from her iPod. She then slowly sniffed the flower, wondering whatever or not she was allergic. Much to her surprise, though, she didn't feel a thing. No sneezing, no watering eyes, nothing. Curious about the flower still, Laura quickly stood on her feet again (the flower still in her hand) and ran back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes had passed for Laura by the time she headed back home. She sprinted from the door straight to her bedroom on the second floor. Her room was right to the left of her brother's, with light blue walls, a drawer in the upper left corner of the room for clothes, her bed on the upper right, her TV on the bottom right corner, and her CD player and school bag on the bottom left. And in the middle of the farthest back wall was the window, which her cacti were currently residing. Laura quickly got out a flower pot and dirt from one of said cacti and placed the flower in it as soon as she could. She then poured a tiny bit of water from her water bottle on the rainbow-colored flower's dirt, as well as a little on the flower itself. The flower seemed to sparkle a little bit afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. It's so pretty\", Laura smiled at the flower, admiring its beauty. She then left her room and quickly went downstairs to get a replacement pot for her cactus she took out to make room for the flower. Right after getting the pot, though, Laura's eyes started to water, and her nose started to itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh...another sneeze is coming on..\", Laura told herself as her eyes watered even more, seconds away from a mere sneeze. She tried her hardest to hold it in, but to no avail. She then snorted soon afterwards, her eyes still closed from the sneeze. As she moved around her fingers and body, though, she felt...different somehow. Like a part of her body had changed size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Laura, the rainbow-petaled flower she found earlier was not your typical, run-of-the-mill flower. When wet, it caused nervous allergic reactions that can actually change at random the size of a person's body part. ANY of them. Hair, legs, head, eyes...you name it. But did a body part of Laura grow, or did it shrink?</span></div></div>",

I've gone blind!\" the woman cried as she placed her hands on her head and covered her eyes. As she did so, though, she felt something...hairy. After a lengthy time of removing the hair from her eyes, Laura found out that her hair simply grew from the allergic reaction...her eyesight was perfectly fine. Still, though, this wasn't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura quickly ran back up to her room and checked out her mirror. She was quite amazed that her hair was now over 8 feet long! Not only was her hair longer, but it was richer and prettier, too. Laura proceeded to quickly grab her scissors and, in a gradual process involving clipping one side of her face at a time, managed to clip all the hair around her face area to once again see clearly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was still confused by the recent growth of her hair, though. She decided to look at the rainbow flower once again and see if something wasn't up with it. Hair doesn't grow quite that fast, right? At least that's what she thought to herself. Unfortunately, she made the mistake of sniffing the flower once again, and felt another sneeze coming on. Perhaps Laura catches a break and the sneeze was a false alarm?</span></div></div>",

It wasn't her legs...she would've bumped into the ceiling if that were the case. It wasn't her arms or hands, because she could still move them normally. Then what was it? It took a very short trip to the mirror to realize that her chest was the next part of her body to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't exactly what you call a woman with a nice chest. In fact, her bust was a modest 32 inches, practically unchanged from her sophomore year in high school. This, coupled with her short hair, didn't exactly make Laura stand out among her peers. However, the short hair was a necessity on the swim team back in her high school days, as Laura hated putting her hair in a bun and preferred cutting it so her hair fit better in a swim cap. Laura seldom let her hair touch her neck even after high school, and she still had it cut every other 3 to 4 weeks to this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things were different now. Laura now had a beautiful, very long head of pretty, curly brown hair, and her chest was now at least 10 inches bigger than it was previously. Although the chest was quite taxing on her body, Laura felt pretty for the first time in her life. The giddy woman was actually looking forward to what the next sneeze would bring her: a bigger butt, taller, skinnier legs, bigger hands. Anything. The excited woman almost took another whiff of the flower before asking herself something, smiling as she did so:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I show Dave this?\"</span></div></div>",

The confused boyfriend of hers was wondering what the woman was so happy about, but all she told him was that it was a big surprise and that there would be \"more of her to love\". Confused by this cryptic (to him) message, Dave told Laura he would be there in 15 minutes, which was okay by Laura since she had more hair to cut off before he could come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as easy as it sounded, though: Laura's hair was quite thick. She couldn't even tell where her hair ended, much less where to cut it. Taking the same pair of scissors she previously cut her hair with, Laura then spend the next 10 minutes or so snipping at any hair below her butt, which was quite a formidable task as she had 8 feet of long, curly, brown hair to plow through. Although she did (eventually) manage to cut all the hair off below her butt, the results were less than satisfactory: her hair looked it was caught in a lawnmower or vacuum cleaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\", Laura sighed as she proceeded downstairs to get herself something to drink from the fridge. She pulled out a can of Pepsi when she heard the front door ring. Excited as to who it could be, Laura placed the can off Pepsi down on the kitchen table and dashed to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think he'd come THIS soon\", an excited Laura said to herself as she opened up the house's big, light blue door. But who was it?</span></div></div>",

Afterwards she inched her way to her mirror to see that she no longer could move her hands around! It seems that her arms had shrunk from the previous sneeze, and her hands felt like gigantic weights on her 4 inch long arms. Laura quickly proceeded to her bed and placed her hands on her pillow to avoid hurting them all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just getting weird\", the confused woman laughed to herself. \"I guess that's the price of long, beautiful hair, though.\" Her eyes then proceeded to look at her windowsill once again, where the beautiful flower with the rainbow petals sat in its little, brown clay pot. Laura was soon to discover that this was no ordinary flower...it was magical! So magical that it could change the size of an ordinary adult even! The kind of discovery that could get Laura fame...or ridicule. Noticing her 4 inch long arms and her 8 feet of hair, she decided that until her body was in more stable alignment, she couldn't even lift anything, much less walk leave her bed. Her only idea was to wait until either the rest of her body shrank, the rest grew to match her long hair, or until at least her arms could support the weight of her hands again. And Laura felt a sneeze coming on again, too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Laura was little, she was one of the smartest girls in her class as well as her grade. Her teachers were delighted by whatever work she handed in, and not once in her elementary, junior high, and high school years did she fail or come close to failing a class in school. Although her academic progress slowed down in high school, Laura was still in the top 20% of her grade every semester of every year. She graduated with the 50th highest average out of 300 graduates, even. She even had the nickname of \"Laura Big-Head\" in high school, which to her was both a compliment and a really goofy way of referring to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it came to no surprise to Laura to find out that her next growing body part was her head. Funny enough, though, her arms were now their normal size, but her hair was still long, and her head (including her eyes, nose, mouth, and ears) was now thrice its original size. As Laura walked up to the mirror to examine herself, she felt like she was carrying a bowling bowl for a head. She had to use both her hands just to keep it balanced and not have her head fall on the ground. She then sneezed as she looked (and giggled) at herself in the mirror, her arms and hands now twice their original size. Her now giant hands were at one with the floor below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monkey woman\", a confused Laura told herself while looking at the mirror still, thinking that her new proportions made her look a little like a monkey. Her arms were now almost as long as her room, and the growing woman tried to experiment with her new, longer arms to see if she could lift them. To her surprise she could, but not nearly as high as before: she had a hard time lifting them above a 30 degree angle. At least Laura could stand up again, and the woman proceeded down the stairs and to her living room, hiding her longer arms and hands in a blanket as she cuddled on the couch and watched T.V. She used her thick, long hair as a pillow of sorts as she sat down on her side on the couch and started flipping through the channels for something good to watch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura felt sleepy after her walk, so the sleepy giantess in the making decided to rest on the couch as a rerun of \"Happy Days\" played in front of her as she slept. She dreamed about being as tall as a skyscraper, her body continually expanding part by part until she was not only taller than the town, but of Earth itself as well! She dreamed of becoming so big that planets and moons started orbiting around her like she was her own solar system!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of her dream several hours later, Laura yawned as she noticed a significant change in her body. In addition to her big head, long hair, and long arms and hands, her butt had elevated the woman to the stop of the ceiling (her couch long destroyed while asleep), and her breasts had to at least be two feet tall each. As the now naked Laura proceeded to sneeze again, her hair grew even longer, filling up almost the rest of the room that her gigantic body hadn't already covered up! It had to at least be 20 feet long now. A second sneeze resulted in her stomach growing several times in size, followed by a third sneeze that resulted in the growth of her feet and legs, now at least four times longer than they were before! When all was said and done, Laura had destroyed her house just by trying to move her body around. Once she broke free of her crumbled abode, the naked giantess proceeded to look around her significantly smaller surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura did the math in her head to determine how much she had grown since first sniffing the flower. Her legs were already about 4 feet long, and after the growth they were now at least 17 feet long. Her feet grew 4 times their size as well, boosting her height up by at least 9 or so inches. Her stomach and neck areas combined were at least five times its normal size, adding an extra 10 or so feet to her increased height. And finally her head was three times its normal size, adding an extra 4 or so feet to her. Adding up the math, Laura had to at least 32 feet tall, give or take a few feet. She was stunned by her new size, and used her long hair to cover up her privates, glad that it grew to such a long length. Unsurprisingly, the naked giantess attracted quite a few males to her attention, who quickly took out their cameras and cell phones and started taking pictures of the naked giantess Laura. What does she do now?</span></div></div>",

The naked giantess found herself stopping at the town lake, quickly dunking her entire body in it. Thankfully the lake was still big enough for her to hide her body in it, but she was soon spotted by a boy no older than 3 or 4 years old. He had short, blonde hair, green eyes, and was wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and beige pants, a plain white cap sitting atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...I hope I don't scare him\", Laura said to herself as the boy continued to glance at her as she dunked all but her head into the fairly warm lake. To her surprise he showed no fear: in fact, he started walking over to the water to get a better look at her, extending his hand out to her. Laura was amazed at the boy's lack of fear as she extended her hand out to him in return, then placing the boy on the top of her head. She then rode across the lake with the boy on top of her head, who used Laura's hair as a seatbelt of sorts as she rode too and from the lake area. After a few minutes of traveling she placed the boy safely back on land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", the boy smiled to the girl, whose father had just returned from the forest nearby to get some firewood. It appears the young boy was told to wait there for his father to return with the firewood from nearby, as the father and son were camping near the lake area. The father was about 30 or so years old, with a full head of brown hair, green eyes, and wore an attire consisting of a brown jacket (with a red t-shirt underneath) and black sweat pants. Unlike his son, though, the father was quite shocked by the naked giantess in the lake, speechless as to how to respond. Laura, too, was speechless in how to respond to the boy's father, worried that he would report her to the police. But the man attempted to be calm around the giantess as much he could before finally introducing himself as Matthew McCohern. He then introduced his son, Cory, who bowed to the woman as he addressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you\", she smiled to the two, feeling a little better now about being spotted by the two.</span></div></div>",

I still don't believe you!\" This caused Laura to be stunned and surprised! She had even already shown the man proof she changed size by sneezing, and he still didn't believe her. Laura seemed quite surprised, on the verge of tears even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's the trut...AH-AH-AHCOO!!\" she went as she proceeded to sneeze once again. Laura's once very tall legs then returned to their original size, as did her arms. Now all that was left was her butt, stomach, chest, hair, and head. The weight of her head causing her to tip over, Laura found herself waiting for her to come to shore, firmly planting her head on the more dry soil near Matthew and Cory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see! You did that to make me sneeze again\", the cheerful sounding Laura said to Matthew, understanding hiss earlier skepticism. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. I didn't want to see you get caught by the police or the FBI or Area 51 or whatever would happen if they saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have a bit of shrinking left, though. Can I count on you and your son to help me?\" the worried looking woman said to them, still surprised that she didn't get caught earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, but keep low on another side of the lake until then...faker\", Matthew snickered to the woman, causing her to get upset again. Now he was doing this on purpose, Laura thought to herself. It still made her a little annoyed, even though Matthew was only trying to help the poor girl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not funnEH-AH-AHCHOO!\" Laura yelled at the man before she sneezed once again, this time her head shrinking back to its normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry once again, but hey! At least you can hide your body in the water now...kind of. Want us to help you out, Laura?\" Matthew asked of her. Cory then repeated what his father said, albeit not as intelligible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sporting pretty, medium-length brown hair that went down to her shoulders, pretty blue eyes, a white hat, and a pretty, light blue dress that went down to her knees, the girl was surprised to see the beautiful rainbow flower on the ground before her on her walk, undamaged from the crumbled remains of what was once Laura's house. The young girl's name was Alicia Bertingston, and she was surprised to see such a lovely flower before her lying down on the ground, right outside of its pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll save you\", she giggled to herself as she placed the flower back in the pot, soon putting the fallen door back into it. Thinking that the flower looked a little dry, Alicia then decided to take out the 20-ounce water bottle from her red purse and poured about an ounce or two of liquid into the pot. She then took a whiff of the flower, admiring the wonderful smell it gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go\", she said to the flower as she held it with both her hands, amazed by its beauty. \"I know! I'll show to Mother and Father. Won't be they surprised to see you? Maybe they'll left you stay in our garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia then started to run back to her house, which wasn't easy in her black, high heel shoes. After a few minutes of running she approached her house, which was one of the nicest looking houses in all of the city. It was two stories high, standing about 20 or so feet tall. Its paint job was white, and the door was painted light blue, with a carpet rub with the words \"Welcome to the Bertingston Household\" written on it. To the left of the front door was a porch big enough for three people, and behind the house was a backyard about 20 square feet long altogether. All kinds of beautiful flowers grew in that backyard, from petunias, carnations, and chrysanthemums, to lotus flowers, eudicots (including forget-me-nots and buttercups), and many others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo excited to await planting of the flower, Alicia quickly ran to the backyward and planeted the rainbow-petaled flower on the ground to the far left of the rest of the garden (so as to not block the sunlight or water of the other flowers). Once again she sniffed the flower upon burying it in the dirt, which was one of the best smelling flowers her nose ever laid upon. She felt a little odd after the second sniff, though..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...like a sneeze is coming on\", Alicia said as she itched her nose mere seconds before the sneezing commenced. \"Ah..ah...AH-CHOO!\" Her eyes closed right before sneezing, Alicia was yet unaware of the rainbow flower's ability to grow or shrink a part of a person's body at random. But what ended up being the case for the young girl?</span></div></div>",

It was around this time that Bryan got a call from his parents on his cell phone. He explained to them he was hanging out at Alicia's house, telling them that he was staying over the night in a guest room. The two weren't exactly thrilled to hear the news, but they thought he had his reasons and allowed him to stay over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoo. That was close\", sighed Bryan, sitting down on the dirt ground on his butt, Alicia soon joining him. It was then that he finally got to take a good look at the slowly forming giantess that was once a cute, sweet tomboy he knew in his classes in school. The sad, timid girl sneezed just then in front of Bryan, a little bit of her snot drooping down his face (causing the girl to apologize quickly, wiping it off with her dress). Her hair was the next thing to grow, slowly covering her friend in hair as her hair was now 10 times as long as it used to be. It was also richer and more colorful as well, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bryan, I'm sorry for dragging you along with me. I'm sure you have other things to do right now..\", cried Alicia as she wiped the tears off her face with some tissues in her ripped dress. Bryan then tugged on the girl's dress to get her attention, the girl lowering her head (now red from crying so much). He stroked her hair with his hands and told her not to worry so much, calming down the girl as she stood up on her feet again and reached her left hand down to Bryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Bryan! I won't give up! We're going to find a cure for this growth of mine and return me to normal\", Alicia assured herself, pointing in various directions where to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting dark, though\", pointed out Bryan, noticing the night sky above them.

It was old, decrepit, and probably more than a little untidy, and the wooden floor squeaked like a chew toy. Plus the windows were broken. But at least it was safe; there were no broken glass shards or animals anywhere around them.And it was still a better alternative than staying outside and getting noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlicia was the first to lie down, stretching out her long legs on the floor before him as she patted her hair and used it as a pillow below her normal sized head.

Bryan tried to resist, but the saddened look of his friend changed his mind. It also marked the first time Alicia kissed him, as she kissed the boy on the lips and said to him \"good night\" out of habit (her parents still kissed her good night whenever she went to bed).

Alicia was the first to change, watching her recently wonderful figure deflate like a balloon, her leg size cut in half, her arms pulled back into her body, her head getting smaller, her hair getting thinner and curlier, her eyes getting slightly bigger, and her fingers and toes shrinking in size as well. At the end the poor girl was barely 3 feet tall...and less than half her original age. She used her cloth from before as a full-sized shirt/skirt combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryan was next. First up was his butt, causing his tattered pants to fall straight to the ground. His arms and hands were next, watching them get engulfed at his smaller size. His shiny, long hair shrunk into a buzz cut, his once more muscular legs shrunk in muscle and height, his head shrunk and looked more youthful, lastly followed up with the shrinking of his torso. Like Alicia, he too stood only 3 feet tall or so at the end of his shrinking, holding up his pants with his arms to keep his legs from being exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened to us!?\" Alicia whined as she hugged Bryan, surprised by her recent surroundings. Everything seemed bigger and scarier to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We seem to be 4 years old\", Bryan noted, remembering being kind of short for a little boy when he was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fwower! Maybe it can fix us!\" Alicia said aloud as she grabbed the flower. However, the fight from earlier for it caused it to fall to the ground and out of its pot, only to be picked up by a fairly strong wind just then. It flew just high enough in the air to make it impossible for the two to grab, even together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!!!\" both kids cried in unison as they hugged once again. Now what do they do!?</span></div></div>",

They were a peppy, pretty, smart, and well-coordinated group of women, some of which have been learning gymnastics since they were in grade school. Their uniform consisted of a red shirt and dark red skirt, with blue pom-poms completing the package. They also wore white sneakers when performing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the five was the young Emily Cosgrove, who was only a college freshman. However, the spirited, blue-eyed 18 year old brunette had so much talent and grace that she was made the captain of the team shortly after entering college! It was a lot for her to take, but her peppy, happy attitude made her both a great friend and a sort of mascot for the other girls (the latter being due to her being the shortest on the team at 4'11\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest of the girls was 20 year old junior Amanda Waring, who stood at 5'10, with long, skinny legs that made Emily sort of jealous of her. She had curly blonde hair and green eyes, and her chest was a D cup on top of that! However, she wasn't a show-off, and like Emily was a generally friendly person. The two were far and beyond the best of the five cheerleaders, though they never admitted it aloud (or ever).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls included 21 year old Rose Hawthorne, a red-haired, blue-eyed woman of 5'5\" who liked cheer leading as well as science. She was the only one of the five who wore glasses, and she wasn't embarrassed by it. Next was 19 year old college freshman Saki Nakahiro, a Japanese girl who stood at 5'3\" with short, black hair and hazel-colored eyes. She was energetic and yet shy, but had more than enough coordination skills to get around it. Rounding off the five was 22 year old college senior Elizabeth Sanchez, a Spanish-American woman with long, shiny brown hair, green eyes, and a size C chest that complemented her tall, 5'9\" figure very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five were almost done practicing for today when the flower landed by from an open window. But does it gently touch the ground, or does it get cut up by the ceiling fans above, its pollen being spread to all five beauties at once?</span></div></div>",

His nose also felt funny, but he didn't mention it to them. The pollen was inhaled into all six of them (Amanda and Emily inhaled more than the other<br>\r\nfour did). Robert did not shower after putting all of their gear away; he just went around to the other side of the locker room to wait for Emily to come out. Not all of the girls liked showering with hot water, so they divided their showers into two shifts. As soon as the water turned cold, Saki and Amanda would start showering. Pollen likes water, so all the girls staring to grow imperceptibly larger. (Something that was going to change later that day for the three who took hot showers.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls were slowly transforming internally into the rainbow flowers. Since Richard was the only male affected, his body would experience very different internal changes. All of their changes will be undetectable to anyone else, and it will take the girls and Robert several months to complete all of their changes. They will not realize anything is different until Emily completes her first wave of changes. She will be the first to complete the change because she was sort of dating Robert. The next time she insists that he French kisses her, his tongue will involuntarily travel all the way down her throat to fertilize both of her lungs. Within days she will crave sunlight so much she's compelled to go live at an all-night tanning parlor so that she can absorb more ultra-violet light during the night time. Through photo-synthesis the plant will transform all five girls' sweat  glands to secrete a nearly unnoticeable odor that will cause people to sneeze. They will only be able to cause sneezing after intense physical activity like  cheer-leading or sex for whoever does it with any of the girls. The person that sneezes will grow or shrink similar to what Laura and the others have done in this story. When the girls cause someone to sneeze, the body part affected will be whatever is closest to the girls' face. Another wrinkle will be that since the transformations will no longer be instantaneous, no one will connect their<br>\r\nchanged condition to the girls, even after it happens several times to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Elizabeth, Emily and Rose had taken hot showers when they went out into the sunlight. they all felt a very pleasing warmth in their busts that Amanda and Saki didn't experience that day. The girls said their good byes and went off their separate ways. Emily and Rose decided to go swimming, so they walked over to the campus swimming pool. Both of them noticed that for some reason their tops were tighter than usual. They put it off to not properly drying them the last time, so they dived into the pool for their usual laps. By the time they had done 10 laps, Rose noticed that Emily was doing much better than usual keeping up with her. They were still almost even at the end of the pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Rose, the funny part is I don't feel as tired as I usual;y do when I do this many laps without stopping\", Emily noted to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a 15 minute break, they started off again on another 10 laps. And this time Emily not only broke her personal best, she out swims Rose on the final lap! With no ready explanation, they decide to shower and go out for dinner. Emily so enjoyed the hot shower that Rose was forced to physically drag her out, completely drying her body and then dressing her. Once that shower started, Emily turned the faucet up to full and was in a trance, drinking in the warmth enveloping her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Emily didn't have much trouble squeezing into her bra, Rose's turned out to be completely too small. To her it made no sense, since it fit when she entered the locker room to change into her swimsuit around an hour earlier. And by the following morning, <i>all</i> five girls were having a lot of trouble fitting in their bras. Amanda and Elizabeth were the most annoyed with this because they both felt that their present size was big enough. A week later, all five girls' busts had grown at least an inch larger. They were also a half to a full cup size bigger as well; Amanda, for example, was now a very full DD. She was becoming very depressed from all of the comments on her new silhouette. Robert's growth was a pleasant surprise for him and Emily the next time she 'jumped his bones'. (The French kissing happened later.)</span></div></div>",

His clothing attire consisted of a plain white shirt and jeans, and in his right hand was a marble notebook, his pens in his left pocket. As the scientist attempted to inch closer to Laura, the annoyed giantess just shouted for him to go away and to leave her alone. Quickly he sat down on the ground and started writing this in his notebook, barely phased by her emotional outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you writing?!\", an inquisitive Laura asked the man, finally lifting her head up high enough from her knees to see him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?

We tried on a cat earlier, and his tail grew to 5 times its regular size. We also tried it on a dog, and her nose tripled in height. However, it seems that eventually, the flower's effects wear off...the cat and dog's normal sizes have been restored recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how come I'm still so big!?\" Laura impatiently asked, trying to free herself once again from the shackles of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems the bigger the person is, the longer the effect takes to wear off..if we didn't gas you earlier, who knows how big you would be right now..\", Anthony told a sad-looking Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...how long will THAT take!? And can I go home afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. It could be days before your normal size is restored, and you'll either continue to grow or, even worse, shrink down to levels unimaginable..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be big-AH-AH-AH-CHOO!!\" sneezed Laura, her head growing another foot or so as it bumped into the ceiling, causing her to rub her head in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again...\" Laura then meekly moaned to herself.</span></div></div>",

I've heard of women growing to heights as tall as even 8 feet, but over 30? I thought it made as much sense as Bigfoot shopping at a 7-11 in broad daylight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what does that have to do with you not being scared of me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...because I think you're cute?\" Anthony smiled to the woman as he continued to jot down information on his notebook, attempting to make as little eye contact as possible with the woman as he could. Laura, meanwhile, looked down at her body and noticed that she was dressed. She was wearing a sleeveless purple shirt and a medium-length, pink skirt. And now that she thought of it, her hair seemed shorter, now barely halfway down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we cleaned and dressed you while you were asleep\", pointed out Anthony to the confused woman as she looked at her clothed body. \"They're made of a super elastic fiber, so they won't come off even if you grow to be 1,000 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert\", Laura sneered at the man, giving him a stare that intensified in its paralyzing ability due to her taller height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! I wasn't the one who dressed you! In fact, it was the women who work here that did that\", Anthony defended himself by saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling the truth, Anthony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then thank you\", she smiled to the man, winking her left eye at him. \"If my height ever gets restored, maybe we can hang out sometime...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see the harm in that.

Of course, the increased size of her hands was also suffocating them, as her hands were still in the back wall's handcuffs and were cutting of the circulation of air of her hands.

He had brought a cart larger than himself and about 15 feet long, and it contained everything from fruits, vegetables, and even the odd piece here and there of junk food. He placed the cart right next to Laura's feet, who was smacking her lips in excitement of all the nice good in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite a lot of stuff\", remarked Laura, wondering what to eat first as she picked up a whole bunch of bananas, peeled them, and ate all of them at once.

Although now breathing comfortably, Laura could still feel the pain from their being tightened, and she was still crying (thought not as much as before) as her tears reached up the 3 foot mark of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this was not something Andrew was aware of when he opened the door to check up on the woman, getting drenched as the water went sailing down the hall. Not only did Laura's tears wet not only the rest of the floor, but it also seeped into every room on that floor, as well as the staircase below. Andrew found himself draining out the water from his clothes as a saddened Laura looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you crying?\" he asked the sad woman as he closed the door behind him, then coming up to Laura and massaging her big left toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chains were cutting off the circulation of my hands. I thought they were going to fall off\", a drooping Laura explained to Andrew as she then hugged him in a tight embrace with her hands, placing the scientist's head directly on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm glad they're off of you. I hope you feel better now\", he comforted the woman, stroking her long brown hair with his smaller hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Bless you\", Laura whispered into his left ear as she kissed his forehead. \"I'm so glad you're concerned about a freak like myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a freak, Laura! You're a beautiful woman, and I would say this if you were the size of a speck or the size of a planet! Don't be so hard on yourself.\" Laura proceeded to use her shirt to dry off the tears from earlier, feeling calmer now by the scientist's kind words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Andrew. So....do you have food for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but....you wet the food and ruined most of it. I'll have to go get more, Laura.\" However, as Andrew proceeded to get off the giantess' lap, he found himself forced upon it once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I don't want you to leave me!\" she demanded, looking at him with a face that expressed both selfishness and worry. \"Please....I'm scared.\"</span></div></div>",

While it wasn't quite a perfect shrink (her hair was 2 feet long, her feet were a little bigger than they would normally be, her ears were almost two-thirds the size of her head, her chest was still fairly large considering her size, and her legs made up almost 75% of her body's height), it was still quite a sight that the former giantess was but the size of a girl barely a quarter of her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing these clothes change size with me\", the woman sighed before the towering (to her) scientist, noticing the long cart of food before her. \"Wow! That's a lot of food! Is that for the whole building's staff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...it was originally meant for you\", Andrew explained, Laura gasping in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I could never eat that much! Even at 100 feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we didn't know what foods you liked, so we got a little bit of everything\", Andrew explained to the short woman before him before another scientist grabbed hold of her. She was about 5 foot 3, had short, brown hair, blue eyes, and a very skinny build (with a chest as flat as a plank of wood). Her clothing attire consisted of a plain white shirt and jeans, and she also wore glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\", the woman said to herself. \"She can shrink to this height as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, stop it!\" an annoyed Andrew told her. \"Let her go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer?\" a confused Laura asked her holder. \"Um, do you and Andrew happen to be...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. We're not lovers or anything. I'm his little sister\", the female scientist smiled to her as she lifted the little woman above her head. \"Wow you're a cutie! What's your name, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....Laura\", the nervous woman replied, scared to be 6 feet in the air, which to her looked almost double that size (and more than enough to kill her if she fell). \"Laura Carley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jennifer! I'm a high school student currently working part time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! High school! And you work part time here?\" an amazed Laura asked of the girl, who blushed a little in response to what Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only work here part time with my big brother. They say someone my age can't work here full-time until they finish high school. Though that won't take too much longer since I'm in my last year.\" Jennifer then placed Laura back on the ground, sitting down on her butt so as to see her better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, how old are you, if I may ask?\" Laura asked of the bigger girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"16.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! And you're already graduating so soon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She skipped a grade or two back in elementary school\", explained Andrew. \"Jennifer's one of the smartest girls in the country. She even took the SATs recently and scored a near perfect score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're really something!\" Laura gasped in shock once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it! You're embarrassing me\", Jennifer gushed as she hugged Laura in gratitude. \"Though the really amazing one here is you! Look at you, so small and cute. I wish I could be that small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you just sniff the flower, Jennifer?\" Laura asked the young scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's a bad idea\", chimed in Andrew. \"Who knows what will happen to her if she does? She could shrink to the size of an ant or grow as large as the Statue of Liberty. Either way chaos might ensue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't think that with me, Andrew..\", Laura added in, Jennifer nodding alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Whatever.

Jennifer first felt around her chest area to see if hr breasts got any bigger. After sighing a little, she then felt the rest of her body for anything that might have changed. Her prespective hadn't changed, and neither did her hair, butt, or chest, so that only left some part of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a mirror, Andrew?\" his little sibling asked of him, watching him crack a big smile as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you laughing about?\" Jennifer asked him, unamuased by his laughing at her. \"What could possible be so funnEH!!!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jennifer found out what part of her body grew: her nose!

There was a big, flat-screen T.V. on the side of the room, with a couch about 10 feet or so away from it. The kitchen was about 15 feet away from the front door, and contained a microwave, oven, and dishwasher. The bedroom were about 20 feet or so away from there, with Andrew's room being on the left and Jennifer's on the right.

Just don't get mad if I screw it up\", Dave chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Laura said her goodbyes and hung up the phone. Working fast, Laura and her hair ran around her house gathering some basic hair cutting supplies so Dave could get started right away.  She grabbed a sheet, a comb, a hair brush, and of course some scissors. Figuring that was all she needed, Laura sat down at the table with her hair cutting supplies and waited eagerly for Dave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew somewhat impatient, Laura began to fiddle with her long hair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>AH AH ACHOO! Laura let out a great sneeze, her lengthened hair once again set off her allergies. Her hair, though straight, was still rather wild, and that made it hard for her to control her sneezes. Laura opened her eyes and parted her heavy hair. For the first time since this whole mess started, she wasn\u2019t surprised her hair was growing again. Slowly it was billowing out from her head growing longer, and fuller. It passed 20 feet long as it began to fold and cover her poor couch. It finally stopped between 25 and 30 feet. Despite the uncontrollable growth, her hair was perfect; no split ends, no knots. It was perfectly straight. If she could just get it cut properly, she would look great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura shook her head and put the thought out of her head. She looked around her family room; her hair was everywhere. And somehow she knew it was only gonna get worse. Even Laura herself was simply covered in hair! Only her face and arms could be seen under the massive brown mop coming out of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God where is Dave!?</i> the worried woman cried to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking a little, Laura wondered over to the window facing her home's driveway, hoping Dave would pull up any second. When she saw a car turn in, she was shocked by her luck. Sadly it was more bad luck. It was her brother Charlie, who she thought wasn't supposed to be home today! He only usually visited on the weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it was long, Laura knew she could hide her hair. She loved her brother, but he couldn\u2019t keep a secret to save his life! Laura ran up the stairs and into her room. Once inside she grabbed as much hair as she could and started reeling in the rest of it. When she finally got all of it inside, she slammed her door shut and locked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Charlie just walked in. He was just over 6 feet tall and, like his sister, he had green eyes and short brown hair. He was around 250 pounds, so he was definitely a big guy. He was into botanical biology and had come home to get some of his old college books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laura!\u201d he called. \u201cAre you home?\u201d He paused for a moment but heard nothing. He shrugged and figured his sister had gone out. He headed up to his old room to rummage though the closet. Then he stopped at Laura\u2019s door and tried the knob. It was locked\u2026He gently knocked on the door and asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laura! You in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of his voice on the other side of the door sent a chill up her spine. Laura covered her mouth; she didn\u2019t want him to even hear her breathe. However, letting go of her hair was not the best idea. It brushed by her nose and Laura realized her mistake when she felt her nose twitch. She still covered her mouth hoping to muffle the sound. AHCHOO! Laura sneezed and thought it was a quite sneeze, Charlie still heard her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bless you. So you are home. Are you ok? Come say hi to your big brother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura heard him but didn\u2019t respond at first. Her hair was growing again. Slowly like before, but still steadily. It was starting to cover the entire floor of her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, uh, I\u2019m fine! I just have a bit of a cold. I don\u2019t want you to catch it, so I locked the door.\u201d She lied. Her hair was showing no sign of stopping. As it piled up it had already reached her ankles and was still going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright,\u201d Charlie replied. \u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks. I just need some some AH AH AHCOO!\u201d Laura sneezed again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on cue her hair started growing faster. In a matter of seconds it was up to her knees. It was almost like she was standing in a pool of hair. Unfortunately, this made it impossible to hide as a few stray strands crawled under the door and rustled against Charlie\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026 What\u2019s this? Hair?\u201d he murmured. \u201cLaura, what\u2019s going on!?\u201d But Laura didn\u2019t respond. \u201cAlright I\u2019m coming in!\u201d Charlie went to the master bathroom and grabbed one of his mother\u2019s hairpins and returned to Laura\u2019s room. He used the hairpin to effortlessly get past the lock. Growing up with a sister, Charlie knew how to get into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the resistance from all the hair, he got the door open and saw his little sister completely covered in hair. Her hair had finally stopped growing, but regardless she was caught. She gave up trying to keep it out of her face, and she let her hair completely cover herself. She could only assume she looked like \u201cCousin It\u201d from the Addams Family at this point, as her hair was everywhere. On the bed, the desk, everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura, what happened to you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a little effort Laura was able to repress the sneeze. She sighed with relief; she just wanted to relax until this whole thing could be resolved. She parted her long hair out of her face and grabbed the TV remote and started flipping though the channels. Strangely, after a few minutes Laura started to feel very tired, like she hadn\u2019t slept in days. She tried to shake it off but couldn\u2019t. Rather then fight it, she started to make herself more comfortable, laying down and even using her massive mane as a make shift pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura started to drift to sleep, she was rocked out of her slumber when she heard the doorbell ring. After a moment she mustered up the strength to get up. She knew it was Dave and was somewhat happy, but her fatigue just made her want to sleep. Still she opened the door, as she had to do something about her hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby!\u201d Dave called very happy to see his girl. \u201cWhoa\u2026You weren\u2019t kidding when you said you needed a haircut! What happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d, she yawned. \u201cI think it has to do with this flower I found\u2026 Could we get started though? I am really tired all of the sudden\u2026\u201d  Dave had noted she looked tired but chose not to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura led Dave to the kitchen table where she had all her supplies laid out. She sat down and Dave started. First he grabbed all her new hair and pulled it behind her shoulders. Then he tied the sheet around her neck, grabbed the comb, and ran it through her locks a couple times. Dave picked up the scissors, and started to cut just above her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Laura, what\u2019s up with this flower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura yawned a big yawn and started to explain. She told him about the rainbow flower and her sneezing fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right. Can\u2019t you come up with a slightly better excuse?\u201d Dave joked. Laura didn\u2019t respond; she was just too tired! If Dave didn\u2019t believe her, fine. This whole thing would be over in a bit anyway. Then she could forget about it and pretend like it never happened. After a few minutes Dave had finished with her trim, she looked like herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot Dave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, no problem. Want me to help you clean all this hair up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura went into the kitchen and grabbed some garbage bags. Together she and Dave packed up the cut hair and got the house cleaned up. Dispute the length of her hair, it only filled 2 garbage bags. After they got the bags filled, Laura tossed them by the door leading to the garage. She would toss them in the garbage can later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Dave plopped down on the couch and asked his girlfriend a question; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do you want to do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she grew somewhat impatient, Laura began to fiddle with her long hair. Unknowingly a stray strand broke free and floated to her nose. Suddenly Laura felt a familiar tickle in her nose. AH AH AHHHHHH AHCOO! Laura sneezed again. She slowly opened her eyes and realized that her breasts had grown substantially. They were round and heavy, each one roughly the size of a cantaloupe. Laura cradled each one in her hands and fondled them gently. She didn't do this for pleasure, but to see if they were real. They were indeed real, and they were spectacular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got to be kidding me\u2026\u201d, Laura sighed. \u201cDave will be very happy to see you two\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura sat their looking at her new endowments and hair extensions, the thought of the rainbow flower crossed her mind. These things didn\u2019t happen to her until that flower entered her life. And she did smell it. Maybe the pollen had something to do with it\u2026 Laura got up from the table and headed for her room. She decided to Google the flower and see what she could come up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even take two steps, she tripped over her own hair and fell flat on her face on the carpet. Her spill was so great it kicked up a light cloud of dust right in her face. AH AH ACHOO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sneezed again, but before she could see what (if anything) had changed, she felt another tickle in her nasal cavity.  AH AH ACHOO! She sneezed once more and the sound of her sneeze was followed by a loud tearing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing something had changed, Laura picked herself up and tried to look down to see any change. Unfortunately her increased bust made it impossible to see past them. Thinking quickly she ran her hands down her body and was shocked to find that her waist had shrunk considerably! So much so that her hands where able to touch each other, making a perfect ring around her shrunken waist. Slowly she ran her hands down further, surprised by what she felt..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, anything but that!\u201d she cried. Whether it was the first or the second sneeze that caused it, Laura's hips had grown to incredible proportions. They had at least tripled in size. Laura tried to take a step but found she could only waddle thanks to her new proportions. They were at least 3 feet wide; she could only imagine how she looked now. Their growth caused the seat of her pants to rip wide open. With her bust and hips blown up to outrageous proportions, Laura now had a perfect hourglass figure. And her long hair made her truly a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura just sighed and continued to her room, pulling out her computer chair and plopping her wide self down. Hitting the net, she started to search for info on the Rainbow flower. After about 15 minutes she found something plausible. The site was about exotic plants and the rainbow flower was under \u201cMyth\u201d section. The page read that the flower grows only once a year and blooms for only one month. It also said that the flower could grow in almost any environment, and that it was believed to have been used in ancient times as some crude medication. Its pollen was believed to have magical powers, but it's considered a myth due to the rarity of the flower. A sighting of the flower hasn\u2019t been reported in almost 200 years. Interestingly enough, the webmaster was offering $1000 for anyone who could provide actual proof of the flowers existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of her predicament, Laura figured a thousand bucks was a thousand bucks! She grabbed her cell and snapped a picture of the flower. She saved it to the phone's micro SD card and emailed it to the site\u2019s webmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther research didn't pull up much to Laura. She didn\u2019t get much info out of the Internet other then that the pollen was indeed the cause. Thinking logically, Laura figured that if one sniff has caused her to grow so much, another sniff could make her shrink\u2026Or at least become proportional again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the flower, she brought it to her nose and took a big wiff\u2026</span></div></div>",

Before she knew it she felt a sneeze coming on, and she could feel it coming fast. She sneezed and again a part of her began to grow..</span></div></div>",

That's awesome.\" Deciding not to let his new-found manhood go to waste, Dave jacked off while picturing Laura's new body. Then he cleaned up and went back the Laura's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Laura, how do you explain this new body of yours?\" Dave asked as he sat down, glaring at the flower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura decided to drive to her boyfriend's house after thinking it over. Before doing so, though, she took off her shirt and unequipped her bra, as her breasts were too big now to support her nearly endowed chest. She also got out a bigger shirt to support her new figure, stealing a plain white t-shirt from her older brother's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he won't mind\", Laura said to herself as she closed his door and ran down the stairs. She then grabbed her car keys from the little container her family kept for keys and other things near the front door, then closing set door behind her as she proceeded to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer car itself was nothing special: it was a fairly old Nissan (a '01 model) with a red paint job and gray, plastic seat covers.  It did have a CD player, but aside from that it had none of the more recent features of a car, such as an indicator of how many miles left before it was out of gas. She didn't mind, though: it was her present for high school graduation, and it still beat walking everywhere for her. As Laura drove away from her house, she opened up the window and let the cool air breeze through her face and hair, excited about what was going to happen to her once she arrived at Dave's house. She imagined him being freaked out and touching her chest, insinuating that she had basketballs in her shirt, only to take off her shirt and prove to him that they were real, kissing him on the cheek afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be great!\" the excited woman said to herself as she continued to drive, so excited that she wanted to speed (but she didn't). A few minutes later she arrived at Dave's house, noticing  that he was outside on the front lawn at the current moment, mowing his yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\", Laura whispered to herself as she pulled up her car closer and closer to her boyfriend, who at that moment finally notice Laura inching her car ever closer to him. He waved to her as she stepped out of the car and bolted over to the guy, hugging him after sprinting over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Laura, you sure are happy to see m...wait, something feels odd\", Dave said to his girlfriend as he walked a foot or so away from her, noticing her newly endowed chest. \"Wait...Laura, when was your chest so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, you can touch them\", she replied to Dave as she winked her left eye at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no way!! I would never do such a thing!\" he gasped in shock, wondering what was wrong with Laura. He was used to her being more open in their relationship than he was, but not THIS much. He had barely kissed Laura, much less fondled her body. And to him, the breasts were one of the most sacred parts of a woman's body, one he didn't want to gawk or stare at in fear of an annoyed look from his girlfriend...or a possible splitting up. Dave had several girlfriends before Laura, and he didn't want to look for another one. She was cheerful, funny, kind, and pretty, and he didn't want to lose her for acting like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. I'll show you myself\", Laura explained to her boyfriend as she took off her shirt, walking closer to him as she did so. Soon enough he saw her exposed breasts for the first time since the two dated, and he liked what he saw. A lot. So much that he could only simply drool at the sight of his busty girlfriend, his penis solidifying like crystal at the sheer size of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how are they?\" Laura smiled once again as she covered her breasts up with her shirt and kissed her boyfriend on the lips, who was too speechless with the wonder upon him to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" he finally said to Laura, who simply smiled at the excited boyfriend of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go out right now, Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sure!\" he quickly blurted out to her, clumsily putting away his lawnmower and getting his wallet and car keys from his house. As Laura waited for him, she felt some of the floating pollen in the air from a nearby neighbor's garden. Laura tried to keep her nose and mouth shut, but eventually she had to breathe, inhaling some of the pollen through her nose. Could Laura prevent herself from sneezing, or was she not so fortunate?</span></div></div>",

She started to feel sick, and her next sneeze didn't quite have the feeling she got when her breasts grew. It felt like she was about to hurl up last month's breakfasts and everything that came after it. She passed out from the pain that was in her stomach but now traveled down to her legs. She awoke alone in a room; it was Dave's bedroom. The bed was king sized, with golden bed sheets and all. The room itself wasn't so fancy, it was white with cracks here and there, and a radiator under the window sill, the window looking out into the front yard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n        Laura got up and started walking. Despite the earlier events she stood very well on her feet. She looked out the window, and noticed Dave was still mowing the lawn. If he was still mowing the lawn she couldn't have been out for that long. She looked at the calendar and it was still Saturday. She went outside, barefoot in her baggy, and long for her size, jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Are you okay?\" a worried Dave asked Laura upon seeing. Laura replied with a short nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"I really don't think you should be up and around only five minutes after you fell over,\" he said, but he was glad that she was fine. Then she felt that nasty feeling again, again with last month's breakfast, and.....no wait, something was different. Laura smiled at the nearly orgasmic feeling she was getting. Her pants, her BAGGY pants, were now just right for her. Both in width and length her pants were a perfect fit, and the once baggy pants were now a pair of tight slim fit jeans fitted onto a pair of very long and very sexy legs. Laura however didn't see this sight, but she could feel it. She looked down and saw what Dave saw; a pair of long, sexy legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Laura then ran to the house and looked for a the mirror in the hallway. The mirror was quite tall. As she looked at herself she said, \"I must be at least 6'3\" with these sexy babies\". She loved the feeling of the pants being so tight on her nicely trimmed legs. Then she turned around and looked at her ass. It was very tight but not fat tight, but instead sexy muscle tight. It was protruding about 5 inches from her backside. This whole ordeal made her very, very horny. She was now sexy enough to get any man she wanted; her tits were big, her legs were longs and sexy, her ass huge. She felt a temptation to go flaunt it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Laura ran out of the house, and as she passed Dave he only gawked at what was once his modest chested short girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"I'll be right back!!\" she screamed as she jumped into her car. As she was driving once again she sneezed. This time around her whole body grew. She felt her legs get even tighter in her jeans as they began to rip at the seams. Her once baggy shirt was now rising up and tightening. She took off her shirt because she didn't want it to rip, and now she was driving in her car in only her bra (which was now barely supporting her now DDD boobs). It was a now measly-looking CC sized bra, and it could not contain a DDD without struggle! She got home, by which time the growth had stopped. She put on a black push up bra and a white tank top. She left her pants the way they were, they were sure to astound Dave. Now standing at 6'8\" Laura could barely fit into her car, and she had to move the seat all the way back for her legs to fit. She then started driving back to Dave's house.</span></div></div>",

However, she was driving at the moment and couldn't afford to stop to plug her nose. This time her head was the next thing to grow, growing to nearly twice its regular size. This made an already difficult drive that much harder, and Laura proceeded to stop at a nearby street corner to see what was up. She quickly took out a mirror from her purse and saw her significantly bigger head. She was quite dismayed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Laura could react any further, she sneezed once again, this time her torso growing several inches in height to accompany her growing frame. The pressure at this point was getting too much for Laura's car, and slowly she could feel the top coming off from the pressure of her growing body. Another sneeze resulted in her hands growing twice their size as well, pushing against the top of the car as she attempted to make room in it. This was soon followed by another series of sneezes, including her hair, then her feet and arms. Now Laura was more or less evenly proportioned all around...though now a little over 9 feet tall as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura found it difficult to move in her car, much less drive at this point. Her clothes were tattered and shredded, her shoes feeling like that of a four year old's on an adult person's feet, and her bra and panties that felt like they were meant for a big a quarter of her height. After further pushing on the top of her car, Laura managed to break free of her metal prison, quickly getting out and stretching her body. She then look at the damaged top of her Nissan, which looked like it was bitten by a giant, metal-eating bug or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did always want a sunroof\", Laura tried joking to herself, in reality nervous of not only her car looking trashed now, but now wearing clothes that were several sizes way too small for her. Any minute now she thought her clothes would fall off and expose her mini-giantess form to the public. It certainly didn't help that several guys were gawking her as she continued to run on foot to Dave's house. Thankfully her longer legs made it less of a travel than they would otherwise.</span></div></div>",

Through street lights and a shortcut through several neighbors' yards, she was able to vault over her the fence like they were obstacles in an obstacle course in a gym class. Through it all Laura's clothes held on, though her constant running and moving made her clothes start to fall off a little faster each jump she made, ahd wasn't long until she found herself in little more than an undershirt, bra, and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her last few steps of energy left, Laura literally fell down on Dave's backyard, breathing heavily as she did so. Seeing her exhausted and red completely in the face, her boyfriend lifted her into his house, though the lifting of a 9 foot tall woman was not an easy one, as Laura weighed over 1.5 times the amount she used to, making her almost 200 pounds! And Dave wasn't exactly the strongest guy in the world..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more struggling Dave placed his tall girlfriend on the floor of his living room, quickly grabbing her several bottles of cold water, which she drank down extremely quickly. Now feeling a little better, she began to stand up on her legs, only to bump her head on the ceiling. She then proceeded to sit down on the couch right behind her, which thankfully held up against the mini-giantess' weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much, Dave. I was really tired\", Laura faintly panted, still tired from running. \"If I weren't so tired I would kiss you.\" She then began to stretch her legs and fall asleep on the couch, her head resting on the wall behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...don't you want clothes or something? Laura? Laura??\" Dave asked of her, hoping for a response from his tired girlfriend. What he saw now was basically a near-naked woman in his house, and he was worried of how awkward it would be if someone were to come in during Laura's nap. He then called out to her again, hoping for a response this time..</span></div></div>",

Her butt grew to almost 10 times its typical size, and it had already grown earlier that day as well. Then she sneezed again, her breasts being the next thing to grow, also to 10 times their normal size. The imbalance in weight caused her to plop right on top of Dave, who foolishly was standing right in front of her during her spurts of growth while asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough happy with the view of giant, naked breasts, Dave found himself unable to enjoy this for long as his girlfriend kept sneezing and growing, continuously outgrowing not only the room, but also his house! Amazingly enough, each cycle of sneezing grew every part of her body before she sneezed and grew another body part. First Laura sneezed until she was 50 feet tall, then she started to sneeze yet again...and again..and again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, am I glad this house is insured!\" Dave said to himself as he ran outside of his house as Laura continued to grow!

It was then that Dave and the police got to see the giantess in front of them how tall she really was; they couldn't see the top half of her body as she was so tall! As Laura proceeded to yawn again, she felt really cold...and light headed. She was so high in the air that the oxygen was barely getting through to her! Laura then looked below her and saw a very familiar sight..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" she asked herself, feeling her body and realizing she was naked. She could see some houses and tress below her, but the rest looked like a blur to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I seem to remember going to Dave's house and falling asleep. Before that I saw this flower, it made me grow, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura continued some more, she decided to turn her whole body to see the environment around her. In fact, she could see the rivers and factories from places miles away, with no obstructions in sight. Then she saw what looked like a fairly big bird flying at her, confused by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...that's not a bird...that's...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Laura put two and two together and realized she grew in her sleep....and by a lot, too! And that the \"bird\" flying by her was actually an airplane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!!! HOW BIG AM I!??!?!\" the giantess proceeded to shriek, ducking her body as the airplane went above her. She then strained her eyes to look down at the people below her, but found it hard to make out anything..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello?\" she quietly whispered as she placed her head near the ground, hoping for a response. She <i>did</i> get a response, but it was too faint to hear, like a little mouse squeaking after inhaling helium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks!! I'm too big to move around, and everyone's too small to me for me to hear them...\", Laura began to cry as her giant sized tears hit like a tidal wide on the city below her. Unfortunately for her, Dave and the police were right underneath her, and they were caught in the drenching tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!! Now my tears are flooding the town below me!! Oh, I hate being big!!!\" Laura continued to cry as she attempted to tickle her nose, hoping for the shrinking of some part of her body. Any part. It didn't matter anymore.</span></div></div>",

Her head then landed on a small town below her, one that thankfully had most of its townsfolk below secure and away from the growing woman before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fits of sneezing were just as painful; her legs, her arms, her hands, her butt, and her torso then grew in that order until they reached the size of her head. By this point the oxygen was so little for the 8,000 foot tall Laura, she passed out from the lightheadedness. It was at that time she was put down with a tremendous supply of tranquilizers, the most anyone had ever seen. Fortunately Laura didn't continue to grow even in this state, but now there was the question of what to do with her. Some of the police officers wanted to put her down for good, but Dave pleaded with them to wait...hoping that, perhaps, Laura would slowly shrink back to normal if not exposed to any more of the flower (which she hadn't for quite a while)...</span></div></div>",

Were they fake, or did she really just hit some kind of growth spurt? He hoped that she hadn't spent a lot of money just to get breast implants to impress him, because he liked her just the way she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis inquisitiveness finally got the better of him. \"Hey Laura,\" he said, stopping at a red light \"How did you get your breasts to grow bigger like that? I mean, I saw you just a few days ago and they weren't that big, so I'm just wondering why this happened so suddenly, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura turned to face her boyfriend and thought for a moment.

Like her legs, her arms did not look any fatter or bigger than earlier, but simply taller, like she was a living Stretch Armstrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\" Laura smirked. \"Make me sneeze again, Dave! This time with more tickling!\" Laura suggested to Dave, who did what he was told, watching her grin like she won the lottery just then. By the time she finally around to sneezing, her hands were the next thing to grow, now almost twice their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...now I feel a little off-balance\", Laura sighed as she fell on the bench and became one with the ground beneath her feet. Her longer arms and bigger hands was hard to support with her new frame, and since her feet hadn't changed height yet there was no way for her to properly stand up. So what did Laura do? Why, she crawled! And fairly fast at that with her longer arms. The two decided to get away from the park to a more secluded area in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad no one saw that\", Dave sighed happily to himself as his girlfriend tried to sit up against a nearby tree, having a difficult time doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope my butt is the next thing to grow. This is very uncomfortable\", the annoyed woman complained as she found herself back flat on the ground. \"Um...Dave, a little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but if your clothes fall off, don't look at me.\"</span></div></div>",

He tried for at least 5 minutes for a reaction to Laura sneezing from the tickling of her nose, but nothing seemed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the flower's effects are wearing off\", Laura told her boyfriend, drooping her head down. \"That means...I'm stuck like this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't stay here. People will get suspicious. You can stay at my place until you either return to your regular size or I go get the flower that caused this to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm too big for your car...my legs and arms are so in-proportional to my body that it would be a tight squeeze..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we're staying at a hotel together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was extremely shocked by her boyfriend's suggestion, and especially at how easily he said it. She wasn't aware that he was this cool with her that sleeping together in the same room wasn't a problem. She gave him a slightly unsettling stare in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look me like that, Laura. I have no other options, and if we take you back home now your family will think this is somehow <i>my</i> fault. It's just one night. And besides, I'm sleeping on the floor. <i>You'll</i> be sleeping on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave then struggled to get Laura back up on her feet, holding the woman's long, skinny arms on his shoulders as he helped her proceed back to the park area, past the park, and down a few streets to a nearby hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for making you do this, Dave\", Laura sighed as she placed the tip of her head on the back of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my girlfriend, Laura. You know I would do most anything for you. At least you haven't grown since we stared walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then proceeded into a nearby hotel. It was a five story hotel, and its outside interior was simply painted red. The name of the hotel was simply \"Sunshine Hotel\" (again, causing Dave to sigh in annoyance at its stupid name), and fortunately for them rooms were still available. They quickly checked into a second floor room and quickly proceeded in the elevator and to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here it is. Room 208\", Dave pointed out as he took out the key he was given and started to turn the door. \"I sure hope it's worth it. Damn room set me back $150.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay you back as soon as I can, Dave\", a still sad Laura told her boyfriend, simply wanting to sit down on her bed already and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

As soon as she flopped down on the bed she immediately passed out, not even able to muster enough energy to slip under the covers, fluff the pillows, or say good night to Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave couldn't help but chuckle slightly; it was kind of cute how tired she was, seeing her lying there, snoring softly. He knew he'd have to use his cell phone to call up his and Laura's parents and tell them what was going on, and he was certain that all he had to do was say the magic words \"me\", \"Laura\", and \"hotel\" and he would immediately have to deal with two sets of hopping mad parents who would automatically leap to the worst possible conclusion that that scenario would lead to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, he wasn't eager to pick up the phone just yet. Rather, he lingered awhile in a chair in the corner of the room, watching Laura sleep, admiring her long, shapely legs, her lanky arms, those huge, perfect breasts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Dave suddenly shouted in his thoughts, grasping his head and shaking. \"No!\" He knew what was happening. Right now his entire body was pressuring him to touch her, fondle her breasts, run his hands over those legs, kiss on her cheek... no, on the mouth... passionately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Dave cried out in his head again, his upper body jerking forward violently. He couldn't do it! He didn't dare risk alienating Laura! If she woke up and caught him fondling her, she'd immediately think the worst of him and would probably break up with him on the spot, and that would just devastate him. Even worse, if she told her parents, they'd get angry and call his parents... and maybe even the police! He might be looking at a sexual harassment charge if he did what he thought about doing right now! He would be in so much trouble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again... what if she wouldn't be upset? What if she didn't wake up? Even better, what if she woke up, found out what he was doing, and actually liked it? What if she wanted him to go even further? What if she wanted to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was fighting a fierce internal battle. He could either play it safe or give in to his lust. Could he really gamble with Laura's affections like that?</span></div></div>",

He started subtly, walking up to her bedside and softly running his hand up and down her smooth, slender, long legs. Her skin was so soft, and the feel of it sliding beneath his fingertips felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Dave's lust deepened, and his eyes began to wander to her chest. He began by simply nudging his hand against one of her breasts softly. Slowly, his hand opened up as he gently laid his fingertips onto the entire round mass and softly began to grasp it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is what it felt like. Dave had never been this close to a woman before, yet now he could see why everyone always talked about this particular part of a woman. It felt amazing, all of it did, the feeling of the large, bulbous boob against his palm and fingers as he grasped in gently. He silently wished that it could never end. </span></div></div>",

It was Dave's old high-school not-quite-girl friend, Mary! A year his junior, she sported short, wavy red hair, green eyes, and a small, skinny build supported by some very ample sized breasts. She was on the short side at 5'1\", but the pretty young woman looked quite good on most anything she wore. Today she was wearing a light green summer dress that looked quite good on her, with brown sandals and a straw hat to go with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I forget my own strength at times\", apologized Mary as she turned around quickly after seeing the near-naked couple in front of her, who quickly gathered themselves in a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here!?\" screamed Laura as she hid herself deeper in the sheets. \"We were about to make love here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you not see the state that you are in!? You have to go to the hospital to see what's wrong with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you followed us here?\" wondered Dave, not nearly as annoyed by this as his girlfriend was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw you two at the park\", remembered Mary. \"I thought to myself, 'Hey, that's the nice guy I knew in high school: Dave.' But I was confused by the strange girl you were with whose arms and legs were really, really long. As such, I followed you two to this place and...well, that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" demanded Laura. \"I'm fine! Dave and I are fine! Ah..ah...AH-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's butt then grew to accompany her taller legs and arms, causing one side of the bed to fall to the ground as a result of the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly caused these growth spurts of yours anyway?\" Mary asked Laura as she pointed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, my name is Laura.

I'm stuck inside my room right now because my head, arms, shoulders, butt, and stomach have grown to five times their original size, and I want you to...t-to...AH....AH...AH-CHOO!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Laura could continue her call, she saw her hands, one finger at a time, swell up like a balloon. Her palms then grew shortly after. Frustrated by her new growth, Laura accidentally crushed her cell phone in her left hand, destroying it in mid-call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sulked her giant head as she began to cry. Her parents weren't home, she couldn't escape her room, and now she lost contact with the outside world with the destruction of her cell phone. Laura secretly hoped that whatever growth came up next, it would help her at least get out of her room...whether it'd be by shrinking or growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Note: For the next path, there can be only straight-up growth or shrinking from here on out. Nothing in-between!</i></span></div></div>",

The feeling of water being poured into her nose was absolutely nasty to her, but it was necessary to wet them had she ever want to get out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura soon found herself unable to stop sneezing, with each sneeze causing her to grow somewhere new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up was her chest, which finally grew to match her stomach. Laura happily caressed her \"big\" breasts, glad that they grew with her at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later she sneezed once again, causing her cute little toes to balloon one by one until they matched her giantess-sized hands. The rest of her feet soon grew to match the toes' size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third sneeze resulted in her hair growing to match the rest of her frame. It was actually a lot longer than it used to be, probably about down to her butt now. Laura felt her hair with her hands, where she was stunned to realize there were no knots or tangled ends! She also noticed that her chipped nails on her fingers and toes were now perfect, and her waist was slightly thinner than it was before. The rainbow flower wasn't just making Laura bigger; it was also making her more beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the fourth sneeze, which finally meet her legs grow. Laura used her growing legs to kick her way out of her house, but in doing so she also caused it to fall to the ground, destroying her abode in a manner of seconds. Laura comically fell down on her butt to the ground seven feet below her, rubbing it before she stood up and stretched her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow about 30 feet or so tall, the naked giantess looked around her surroundings, the neighbors and drivers on the road giving her strange looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....hello?\" Laura meekly muttered, waving her left hand slowly as she blushed red.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be too long now before Laura would pass out from lack of air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as if someone from above was smiling down on her, Laura sneezed a third sneeze quickly after, finally shrinking her massive back to match the rest of her shrunken frame, followed quickly by a fourth shrinking her head (including her hair). By the time all the sneezing finally ended, Laura was finally balanced out in size once again. However, she was also only about 7 inches tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!\" Laura sighed to herself as she looked at the bathtub water around her, looking like a lake at her size. \"Now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Still, Laura managed to get there somewhat safety, the water on the floor somewhat breaking her fall.

Her shorts didn't come off yet since her butt didn't shrink (yet), but they were definitely slipping. Laura slowly inched her way to the door on her back and closed it, hoping no one would notice her or knock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should wait until more of my body shrinks so I can climb on my bed\", Laura sighed to herself. \"At least if my body shrunk all at once, I could at least explore my room or the house.

And if I try to climb my bed and fall, I might just do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored out of her mind, Laura took a tennis ball which she had around in her room for some reason and batted it against the wall.

When Laura proceeded to look at said, she found out that her hands had shrunk to a height slightly smaller than her shrunken feet! Now she couldn't even climb up her bed in a desperate attempt to hide in her blanket: her body mass was too disproportioned to do such a thing. Disgusted by this sight, Laura wiped her booger-filled hands on her shirt, which she found a disgusting sight and wouldn't do otherwise if she could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only means of transportation now being her shoulders, Laura sluggishly hid under her bed to avoid being seen. Fortunately, her shrunken body allowed her to fit in considerably better than it would otherwise, and she (very slowly) managed to cover herself in her light blanket she kept under her bed for warm nights (or for when she slept in the day). Despite her shrunken hands, it was still light enough for her to cover herself in. The worried woman decided that if she was going to shrink, she might as well sleep through it. Quite tired from her walk earlier, sleeping was a short enough thing for her to do, and off the woman went to Dreamland. A couple of hours later she finally woke up...but were there any changes in her body?</span></div></div>",

Now I'm stuck here\", she annoyingly sighed, until she realized she left something on the ground next to her under her bed. It was her cell phone, and it was even open and on! Slightly rolling her way to her cell phone, Laura started to dial up her boyfriend's number, hoping that she could get him to give her a ride to her college campus. Perhaps one of the college professors would know what to do? It wasn't easy for the woman to use her nose and tongue to operate the dialing process, but she DID manage to break through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Laura.

Wondering what he meant, the shrinking woman rolled to her mirror to see what was up, only to be shocked by what she saw. Her head had shrunk to barely any bigger than her hands! Not only that, but her neck and hair shrunk as well. Oddly enough, though, Laura's ears didn't shrink, giving her the appearance of Dumbo, causing the woman to, surprisingly, laugh at the sight of her big ears on her small head. It was the first genuine laugh she's had with the shrinking since it began. She then rolled back to her cell phone and proceeded to talk to he boyfriend once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I recently got a cold.

Laura knew it was her chest as her stomach and butt remain unaffected, her clothes barely keeping up to her shrinking stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ringing the doorbell once again and knocking on the door, Dave found out that the door was actually open this whole time. Inviting himself in, he then shot straight up to Laura's room and banged on her door. \"Laura! It's me, Dave! I have the soup ready for you!\" he continued to knock, wondering why his girlfriend wasn't answering. However, like the door of the house, Laura's room wasn't locked and he slowly opened the door (hoping he wasn't walking in on her changing). To his surprise he saw nothing there. Befuddled at the lack of Laura, Dave decided to head further down the hall and knock on her older brother's door. Still, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close\", Laura sighed to herself, wiping the sweat off of her tiny head with her tiny arms.

He had already looked around Laura's bed to see if she was there: perhaps she was under the bed? Dave remembered that when Laura was still in high school, sometimes her cheerful exterior hid some rather actual sadness from her boyfriend. She would sometimes lock herself in her room and hide under her bed to relieve herself. Usually she took a nap under there, feeling fine and cheerful afterwards. It never made much sense to Dave, but then again, he still slept with his baby pillow from when he was little, so he really had no right to question his girlfriend's stress relief habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave proceeded to look under the bed, he noticed a small lump hiding underneath a blanket. He pressed on it to see what it was (in reality, it was Laura's unshrunken butt), confused by the feel of it. It felt like...a human butt? Laura tried her darndest not to yell at Dave for teaching her inappropriately, but before she could yell she felt another sneeze coming on. She sneezed via covering her mouth, and Laura's butt shrunk down in size like the rest of her body, her transformation into a tiny, barely 10 inch or so tall woman fully complete. And with her shrinking came the coming off of her panties and shorts, leaving the woman butt naked underneath the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?? Now they disappeared\", the confused Dave told himself, lifting the sheet up and seeing an unusual sight before him: a 10 inch tall Laura! Covered in nothing but her tank top, the man was so shocked by what he saw he literally collapsed on the ground, the impact leaving an earthquake-like effect on the tiny woman. Meanwhile, Laura wondered what to do about her new, shrunken situation. She was too small to reach her drawer, her boyfriend was passed out on the ground, and her voice was too high-pitched and squeaky for her family to take her seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Laura asked herself in disgust. \"I thought Dave would help me fix things up, but it turns out he could not. I COULD try to reach my window sill...it'll be tricky, but I could try. Of course, I could always slap Dave around until he woke up.\" Laura contemplated what to do next, the tiny woman uncertain about either idea giving her satisfactory results that would restore her original height.</span></div></div>",

At least, I HOPE it only shrinks...\" As Laura continued to explain to her boyfriend not to water the plant, Dave himself took a big whiff of the flower, admiring its great smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave! What did I just tell you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said not to wet it. You never said I couldn't smel...ah...ah...AH-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave closed his eyes from the sneeze, he felt a weird sensation in his body, like some part of his part changed. He circled around Laura's mirror to see what it was, but he didn't notice any difference. Laura did, though...she was hypnotized by her boyfriend's bigger butt, about twice the size it used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\", the shrunken woman drooled before slapping herself in the face. \"No! This is not the time for sexual fantasies! Come on, Dave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Laura...this uneven growing and shrinking could be interesting. Right?\" he winked at his girlfriend, who was confused as to why he was acting the way he was. Usually Dave was the polite, level-headed one of the couple, so to see him act like he did just now came as a big surprise to Laura. On one hand, the idea of a taller, more built Dave caused Laura to imagine some quite nice (to her) fantasies. On the other hand, she wanted to get big again!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he playfully took the tank top off from the tiny Laura, Dave got very excited at the naked girlfriend of his standing before his feet. This was actually the first time he ever saw Laura naked in all his life, and it wasn't a surprise that the sight of her naked body turned him on greatly. He immediately picked up his girlfriend with his hands and nearly shoved her face into the flower that caused her to shrink in the first place, pouring water into the pot in the process. Laura struggled to get free from the flower, but it was no good; her boyfriend had a pretty tight grip on the 10 inch tall woman. After placing her near the flower for over 3 minutes, his right finger covering her mouth so she had no choice but to breath in with her nose, Dave then placed the still-naked Laura right on her bed as he proceeded to sniff the flower for a long period of time himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!!? Laura panted in-between breaths as she lay naked on her own bed. \"Who knows what's going to happen to us now!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Laura. After all these years of simply playing it safe, you're going to chicken out now out of our relationship?\" he smirked at the girl as he sat on her bed right besides her, playfully twirling her hair. \"I want to see you grow...or shrink. Either way, I haven't been this turned on by you since your growth spurt in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was speechless. It's true that a giant-sized Dave would look so wonderful in her eyes, or that she wanted to have sex with him for as long as she could remember. But she wanted to play it safe: she wanted to wait until after marriage, until after she was done college too. She was not prepared yet for this kind of thing. It also didn't help that Laura proceeded to profusely sneeze, as did Dave just then. As their eyes stayed constantly closed during their sneezing fit, one wonders what happened size-wise to the couple?</span></div></div>",

When the now gigantic woman saw herself in the mirror, she was more than a little surprised: she had to at least be 15 feet tall now! Her legs were at least 9 feet long each, her feet triple their normal size, her hair at least 3 feet long, her head 4 times as big as it normally would be, her chest at least 4 times bigger, her stomach 3 times bigger, her arms 6 feet long, and her hands at least a foot tall each. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boyfriend, meanwhile, was barely 3 feet taller than he was earlier, most of his growth centered on his taller legs (at least 2 feet longer now), his even bigger butt, and his noticeably bigger penis. His arms were more muscular and bigger, and his hair was about a foot long or so now, but not enough for him not to see the towering Laura in front of him. His hands and feet were also about twice their size, as was his stomach, though his head and face remained normal sized. Dave's pants were all but shreds of their former glory, and hiss shirt and shoes were being pushed to their limits, barely keeping on his body. After a long pause of their new, bigger heights, he finally said something to Laura in response to her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-L-Laura...you're huge!\", exclaimed the man as his girlfriend covered her breasts with her left arm and her crotch with her right, embarrassed by the front row seat her boyfriend was seeing of her naked body. As she tried to turn away, Dave grabbed the tall woman with his beefier arms and hugged her backside, proceeding to tickle her. At first annoyed by this, Laura eventually caved in and sat back down on the ground as she giggled from the tickling Dave was giving her, which she was increasingly happy with as he continued to do so. After a minute or so he stopped, and once he did Laura gave the guy a mighty hug in her arms, proceeding to then kiss him with her fairly large lips. Since Dave's head (including his own lips) didn't grow with the rest of his body, the sensation of her giant tongue in his mouth shocked him, but as the kiss continued he grew more accustomed to it. He then kissed Laura in reply as well, along with giving the woman a second tickling, this time on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Dave, I'm sorry I doubted you. This feels great!\", the happy woman said between bursts of giggling as Dave continued the tickling job he was working on her stomach. He then proceeded to tickle her feet, but that didn't last for long as she kept kicking him as he did so. At the end Laura cried so much from the giggling that tears were running down her face, but she was not sad one bit by this recent development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should wait until we're smaller again and move this someplace else\", Laura suggested to her boyfriend. \"How about your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I can't\", the saddened Dave told the gigantic beauty in front of him. \"My house is being checked for termites right now, and I can't return for two days. How about we go to a hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice\", Laura smiled in reply, winking seductively at her boyfriend. \"Let's get the biggest suite there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, my gigantic, gorgeous goddess\", Dave said half-mockingly to his girlfriend as he proceeded to kiss her left hand, causing her to blush deep red. Laura then hugged the boy in what would otherwise be the equivalent of a bear hug. But do they go with the hotel plan, or continue \"experimenting\" here?</span></div></div>",

After a couple of sneezes, Dave felt himself pressed against the far reaches of the woman's bedroom as her legs grew 4 feet longer and her chest another 20 or so inches bigger. Although a little cramped, he certainly didn't mind the increasingly bigger view of his girlfriend, and neither did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, though, Dave himself felt a great series of sneezes coming forward, and proceeded to cover his mouth with his hands, noticing that they felt a little smaller with each progressive sneeze. He was right to think that: Dave was shrinking in size! Measuring from his head to his feet, he was barely more than 4 feet tall now, his head, stomach, hands, and legs now about 75% of their normal size. Only his hair, hands, and feet were still moderately big, and the weird size difference caused Laura to chuckle at this sight. A second series of sneezes resulted in Dave's all evenly sized, and now he was barely three and a half tall. Only his arms, which were noticeably bigger than the rest of his otherwise small body, seemed to have grown in the result of the second sneezing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel too bad. Now there's more of me to love\", Laura smiled to Dave as she placed him on her naked lap and kissed his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, in this position, you kind of feel like a mother than a girlfriend. It's kind of...weird\", Dave noted to his girlfriend, who looked a little sad by what he said. She found what he said to be quite a turnoff from the fondling and kissing they were so happily doing mere minutes ago, letting go of him slowly but assuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should stop\", Laura sighed as she placed Dave butt first on the ground, proceeding to cover her privates with her knees, being careful not to bump into the ceiling. \"If you keep thinking with that train of thought, well...it's not that fun anymore. I knew we should've gone to see my professor.\" As Laura contemplated why she didn't end up going to her college that day, she felt quite a tingle around her chest area, like something was groping it. A quick look down revealed it to be Dave, who was laying his face into her left breast like a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, feed me\", Dave mockingly said to his girlfriend as he pressed his face into her breast once again, causing the girl to giggle to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, naughty boy. Not until you eat your din-din!\" Laura snickered back as she lay flat down on the ground and proceeded to hug Dave once again. It seems she was happy once again with the \"experimenting\".</span></div></div>",

Her boyfriend quickly followed suit, lying on the stomach of his girlfriend as a sort of bed. He worried at first about doing this, but she didn't seem to mind..in fact, she started unconsciously holding the guy like a teddy bear in her sleep as she tossed and turned. Thankfully Dave wasn't hurt by the erratic sleeping movements of his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a bit of time had passed for the young couple before they finally woke up. It had to be at least 7 or 8 a.m. now, and as Dave stretched his body, he noticed something odd..he seemed to have returned to normal size. So did Laura, actually...well, mostly. Her breasts were still nearly twice their regular size, as was her legs, but every other part of her body seemed to have been restored to their original proportions. As Dave tapped his mini-giantess girlfriend's left arm, she swatted him away like a fly as she proceeded to turn on her backside and roll to the left corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five more minutes, Mommy...\", she moaned in her sleep, still more asleep than awake. Dave, naked and a little chilly, decided to get out a blanket from Laura's room and covered himself in it, slowly opening the door and rushing to the bathroom. As he dashed to the bathroom, though, he heard something! Uh-oh! It was probably one of Laura's family members!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, if they see me like this, I can kiss my relationship with Laura goodbye\", he nervously told himself as he dashed to the bathroom and locked the door.

Mistaking it for a knock, he then proceeded to move to the shower, closing the curtains behind him and lying on the ground. Hoping that whoever it was would mistake him for another member of Laura's family, Dave waited for the scratching sound to go away. It was then that he realized how foolish he was for cowering in a bathroom shower in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what am I doing this? I should be a man and accept my fate\", the formerly cowardly Dave said with confidence, opening the door and revealing himself to Laura's household. Instead of a fellow family member, though, he was greeted with a grey and black cat. Her name was Rubik, and she just stood in front of the man, meow-ing at him in an attempt to ask for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, cat\", the annoyed Dave told her as he attempted to bat her away, only to be scratched on his left leg by her fairly sharp claws. Resisting the urge to scream, Dave covered his mouth in the blanket he wrapped himself and and proceeded to muffle out swears in somewhat silence. Once that was over with, he quickly sneaked back into Laura's room, her family none the wiser that he was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time Laura proceeded to stand up and stretch, only to bump her head on the top of her ceiling. After rubbing it a few times, the rudely awakened woman then proceeded to sit on her knees on her ground, noticing the normal-sized Dave before her. She also looked down at her chest and noticed her big it was still..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the flower's effects are only temporary\", explained Laura to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I already figured that out..\", quipped Dave by the news he already found out minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how long until my chest and legs grow back to normal...?\" Laura asked herself as she stretched her arms across the room. Just then she froze in shock as she remembered what day it was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Today's my science exam!\" a worried Laura shrieked, proceeding to move around the room in worry. \"Ohhh...I can't go out like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then sneeze, Laura! Sneeze like the wind!\" a rushed Dave told her as he once again placed the rainbow flower (which fell on the ground the previous night) and placed in front of the woman's place, who then proceeded to sniff it in one long, continuous sniff. He then started tickling her nose with his left index finger, hoping it would speed up the process of a new sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...ah...AH-CHOO!\" went Laura, hoping the sneeze went into effect as she closed her eyes in anticipation. Dave, however, was quite shocked at what happened to her.</span></div></div>",

I still think you're very beautiful..\", comforted Dave, but to no avail. Laura was still crying up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave, I'm glad for the compliment, but..look at me! My breasts are almost 160 cm in size, my legs are at least seven feat long, and now my hands are almost twice the size of my head.

He then opened up the window of Laura's bedroom and proceeded to  stand next to it, seconds away from contemplating jumping out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Dave!?\" Laura questioned her boyfriend, now over the shock of her enlarged hands. \"Don't jump!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Laura, but I have to..\", he told Laura as he placed his right foot out the window and into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Dave! Don't jump for my sake!\", Laura pleaded as she inched closer to him, grabbing him with her big hands and firmly planting him butt down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Laura, I have to do this. I mean, I HAVE to come out the window. If I leave through the front door, your parents would kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura proceeded to stop crying when Dave explained this tidbit to her. She then nodded up and down in reply of what he just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Be careful, though\", she told her boyfriend as she walked up to him and hugged him with her big hands, like a mother hugging her child. \"I'll try to stay calm for your sake. But could you please tell my professor I can't take the exam right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do so\", Dave said to Laura as he slowly proceeded out of her window and down to the ground below. Unfortunately, he forgot that Laura lived on the second floor of her house. Fortunately, though, her family had recently thrown out some bed mattresses, and (in a case of  extreme convenience) had placed them directly underneath the area of Laura's bedroom. Dave shrugged it off the (thankfully cushioned) impact with the ground below him and proceeded to his car, which he parked a couple of streets away from Laura's house to avoid suspicion from her family.</span></div></div>",

Here are some ground rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Absolutely no instant growth / shrink (except through a foray of sneezes). I want this to be a gradual process. There are literally HUNDREDS of other stories on this site you can read if you want instant growth / shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Not a rule, but note that the flower can affect ANYTHING alive; men, women, even animals. Feel free to choose your victim after the opening chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) When adding a new character, please describe him / her in some sort of detail so that I may add it to this page here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Clothes can't grow / shrink with the character, and no nasty / toilet stuff. Sex is okay if consensual and doesn't involve underage people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) All chapters must be one paragraph long and written in third person (i.e. \"Laura decided to sniff the flower\"). Remember to add breaks between long paragraphs if possible. I'll edit for spelling if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you abide by the above and contribute, then thank you very much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate: 8/3/2009 150 chapters! Whoo!

In a cruel bit of irony, though, she's allergic to many different kinds of flowers, and as such has a frustrating time enjoying said outdoors. She's been known to go into a sneezing fit whenever she smells a particular flower she's allergic to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Dave Notten<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\"<br>\r\nWeight: 180 pounds<br>\r\nHair color: Black with blue streaks (he dyes his hair)<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nUsual attire: black t-shirt and jeans<br>\r\nRelatives: Mother (41), Father (42)<br>\r\nBio: Laura's doting boyfriend. You wouldn't tell from his somewhat untidy looks, but he's actually very passionate about being organized and keeping everything in check. As such, he often clashes with his girlfriend's more spirited, carefree nature, but the two love each very much. He is fully aware of Laura's allergies and tries his best to make sure they're never around such flowers when dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jonathon Dowe <br>\r\nAge : 30<br>\r\nHeight: 5'11\"<br>\r\nWeight: 190 pounds<br>\r\nHair color: Black<br>\r\nEye color: Green<br>\r\nUsual attire: Blue police shirt, blue jeans<br>\r\nRelatives: Wife (29)<br>\r\nBio: One of the many police officers of Laura's hometown, Jonathon discovers the rainbow flower after Laura grows to giantess proportions and runs away, leaving the flower behind. He takes the flower home to his wife as a present for their fifth wedding anniversary. Commonly a man of good morals, he feels guilty about taking the flower but was surprised still that it survived the crumbling of an entire house! He then tells himself that he will take it home, both as a present to his wife and to further interrogate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Alicia Bertingston<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nHeight: 5'4\"<br>\r\nWeight: 120 pounds<br>\r\nHair color: Light brown<br>\r\nEye color: Blue<br>\r\nUsual attire: Light colored dresses that go down to her knee<br>\r\nRelatives: Father (37), Mother (37)<br>\r\nBio: A girly girl if there ever was one, Alicia was raised since birth to be a proper lady and is usually extremely polite. She sometimes, however, finds herself embracing her childish, more tomboyish side, such as her love for racing, and even has a guy friend who likes her tomboyish side. She owns a white-and-black beagle named Oscar, who just turned three last month. Her family is fairy rich (her parents make $400,000 between them a year), but despite their wealth they live no differently than anyone else. Once a week her family gets together and do family activities, such as going to the movies or even skydiving. Her family is also into flowers, with a beautiful, award-winning flower garden in their own backyard. In fact, this is what prompts Alicia to take the rainbow flower in the first place: she wanted to give it to her parents to add to the garden.</td>",
