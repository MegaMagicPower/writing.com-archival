You are renting a small apartment at the outer rim of the city. This area is very sleepy and nothing really happens all day. This is what you like about this place, being a shy and silent guy. After some cleaning and sorting, you decide to get a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been the body-aware type of guy, not really doing sports. But, at least, you are keeping yourself clean and tidy. After showering you take a closer look on yourself in your big bathroom mirror. While being 5 feet and 9 inches tall, you bring your 176lbs on scale. It's not like you are looking like a fatty, but you're not small either. At the moment you let your average brown hair growing out, as you are to lazy to visit a hairdresser. Except from your emerald green eyes, you got a pretty average face. Nothing out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you realize</span></div></div>",

It seems like the first changes are starting on becoming visible, which is a sign of success.<br>\r\nHappily, you grab a towel in which you roll yourself in to get dry. Afterwards you are applying the lotion and dressing yourself up. You notice your Shirt being slighly baggier around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want to do with the rest of the day?</span></div></div>",

Na, thats it!\" you thought to yourself, closing the apartment door behind you. After around a fifteen minute walk, you arrive at the public swimming pool and pay the 10 bucks charge. \"This have been cheaper a year ago...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the poolhouse was very nice, they spent a lot of money in some improvements and innovative new things inside. This was probably the reason for the increased charge. As predicted, the place was pretty empty so you got a lot of room to yourself. After swimming a few laps and getting tired, you decide to take a closer look on the new features. There was something you thought of being a hot tub. You skipped reading the description because your body felt sore from the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself down into the empty tub into the extraordinary hot water. You were not expecting this, being close to getting burned. But it was very relaxing on the other hand and your muscles just needed it. So you got yourself in, down to the neck. After some quality time and deep relaxing, you left the hot tub nearly drifting off to sleep without realizing that you elimated all of your body hair in this thing.<br>\r\nWhat you realized is, that your swimming trunks were obviously not made for this kind of high temperatures, they shrunk and now sit tightly on your behind and hips. \"Shit\", you mumbled, \"this is my last pair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left for the changing rooms, dried yourself up while noticing the towel feels a bit harder than usual, proceed with covering your body in the Lotion, dressing up into a seemingly tight brief and your remaining clothes, finally heading home. After strolling home for 20 Minutes, you fell into bed exhausted only in your briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
