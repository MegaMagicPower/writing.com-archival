As a soldier it was my job to follow orders, my job to know and hate my enemies, my job to know the price of war and kill all those who dared to indulge in its practice. I\u2019ve killed before, more times than I would like to admit but I always lived by a set of morals, morals that I could be proud of. Who could of guess that in the year 2059 all those morals I lived by would be a burden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod forgive me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is no more. All of society has gone straight to hell, and hell itself has come to earth. Nobody knows how, no body knows why, or even where it started, but in the year 2059 the dead started to rise from there graves. Was it the rapture, the second coming of Jesus Christ, fuck no, it was a slaughter. The dead rose from their graves and attacked the living. Any military force was pretty much useless when it came to injuring the undead, the only way to affectively kill them was to destroy their brain, but even this posed a challenge because as time passed the undead started to evolve into greater monstrosities that wielded devastating power, even worse those who where bitten by the undead would in time join their ranks. In the end any since of government has fallen, society is in ruins. The world know belongs to the dead. In this kind of world without government, without law, what is a solider to do other than abandon his morals, and fight to survive, but even know as I walk down this wet asphalt  road I can\u2019t help but think back to that night when everything was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASHBACK (third person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small city of cypress was set a flame, a horde of zombies flooded and ran wild throughout the streets, slaughtering the masses. On the small street of Everest Hill in a small two bedroom apartment 21 year old Phillip Jackson with blood all over his body holds the hand of a women covered in shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make it, I\u2019ve, i\u2019ve been bit.\u201d Phillip says tears running down his face. Phillip hadn't  cried in a long time he almost forgot what it felt like. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been bit as well so take this.\u201d Phillip says in a quite voice that sounded like a whisper. Phillip holds up a small vile that held inside it a light green liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH FOWARD (third person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHY, WHY DID YOU GIVE THE ANTIDOTE TO ME! WHY!!!!\u201d Phillip screamed with great sorrow as he held the women in his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gently grabs Phillips hand and smiles as blood starts to poor out of her eyes and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASHBACK ENDS (first person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed I still don\u2019t know why she thanked me, specially when I couldn\u2019t save her, it should have been me. But in the end you can\u2019t change the the passed, all I can do is Continue to walk down this cold wet asphalt road focused on nothing but my survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Phillip Jackson and I\u2019m a solider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnabelle I\u2019m sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I had walked for days without rest and finally on the day Thursday Nov 12th, my leg muscles were straining Themselves to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was surrounded by giant thick trees, it didn\u2019t take me long to realize that I was walking through the Sequoia National Forest which is one of California\u2019s greatest national forests, or at least was one of California\u2019s greatest national forests before the outbreak started, whatever this place had become, it was a good place to rest, to regain my strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down on the cold wet ground, the trees stood over me, protecting me from sight. My rifle which I had strapped to my back, rested on my lap, as I sat crisscross on the ground. My rifle was my most prized possession, in times like these, guns are very valuable, for that reason more than most, my rifle never leaves my side, nor my two pistols that are strapped to my two gun holsters that hung at my wast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was coming, the days were getting cold, nights colder. I wore a black leather jacket, a white t-shirt with more than a couple stains on it, and black jean pants, with military black boots covering my feet, and a red scarf \ud83e\udde3 wrapped around my neck. I wasn\u2019t to worried about the coming winter but I knew I would have to find somewhere to stay for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down trying not to worry about the future, I was trained to always keep my mind on the present not the future, but I was also trained to never be without a plan, and as I sat on the damp ground I couldn\u2019t  help but think that I was truly without a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus.\u201d I said closing my eyes, thinking back to my military days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes after hearing a loud scream that echoed throughout the whole forest. The scream sounded like it belonged to a young girl, and whoever she was, she was in danger. I stand up holding my rifle in my right hand, clearly my break was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI run through the forest passing tree after tree, the cold air of the morning rushing through my face. Time was of the essence, therefore I had to move fast. As I got closer to my destination the girls scream grew louder and I soon realized that whoever this girl was, she was not the only one screaming. I soon realized as I grew closer and closer was that the girls voice had split into two, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA girl and a boy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick up my speed and as soon as I do I see 7 figures that stand in the distance. I slow down my pace and quickly without fail hide behind a tree, rifle in hand. I slowly peek around the side of the large tree trunk to see a young teen age girl with black curly hair \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83e\uddb1 and a young black haired boy \ud83d\udc66 who seemed to be around 10 years of age hiding behind the young girl. They looked alike. So they had to be siblings. Siblings or not they were surrounded by 5 infected, each one slowly inching their way towards the kids, eyes completely gray and skin totally pale and lifeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that these Zombie bastards were just turned a few day ago, heck they were barley level 1, which was good news all around, anything higher than level 2 would kill me and the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes, allowing the whole world to fade away, I breath in and out a total of 3 times, and swiftly begin my attack. I leave my hiding spot my rifle in hand and aim at the first zombie, closet to the two kids. I aim for the head not wanting to wast bullets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Swift motion and 1 zombie is lying dead on the ground. The 4 other zombies stop their assault on the two kids and turn to look at me along with the two kids themselves. I wast no time as I move on to my next target \ud83c\udfaf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBANG! BANG!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more zombies drop dead at my feat. I turn to face the next two who were already on me. I quickly put my rifle around my back and take out a military grade knife \ud83d\udd2a. I no longer needed to wast bullets. I move fast not stopping to rest until the job was done. I run to the first zombie and quickly without pause plunge my knife straight through its skull. Black blood gushes through the opened wound my knife caused. I pull the knife out and turn and attack the other zombie \ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I tackle the zombie down on the ground and once again plunge my knife straight through the skull, and I watch as the zombies body stops moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was breathing hard. The job had finally been done, and yet it still wasn\u2019t over just yet. Pain started to envelope my whole entire body. My body started to shake as sweat fell down my face. I was so hot it seemed like my body was on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, calm down, please calm down.\u201d I whispered to myself as I closed my eyes gripping my head with both my hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t... lose... control.\u201d I said every word slowly, each word, finding myself more calm then the last, till finally I had returned to normal. The burning was finally gone and the pain had vanished as if it had never been their.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up retrieving my knife, returning it to its chief that rested on my belt. I turn, slowly facing the two kids, who each had a frightened look on their face. I honestly couldn\u2019t Blame them for being frightened, I just hoped they wouldn\u2019t make thing difficult for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d I said trying to be polite, taking a step forward with both hands in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay back.\u201d The girl says in fright, pointing a large stick towards my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap.\u201d \ud83d\ude20<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm a fourteen-year-old boy named Jayden Erickson.  I'm sitting in the back of the bus on my way to school.  My best friend Stacy is sitting next to me talking about what we plan to do over the summer.  I look out the window to see a garbage truck coming towards the front side of the bus colliding with it.  I get knocked over and blackout.  I wake up looking around me and find Stacy Miller right next to me.  I reach over and wipe the hair out of her eyes and see a small gash on her forehead.  I stand up using one of the seats for support.  I look around noticing the bus is on its side with the front portion on fire.  The smell of my burning classmate's bodies wafts up my nose.  I see my classmate Jake get up and I go to check on him.  I say \"Hey, Jake you okay buddy that was a hell of a crash,\"  He turns around slowly growling at me and outstretch his arms towards me.  He looked pale and I didn't like the way he was coming towards me, so I push him down.  I get on top of him and start chocking him, but he's still squirming.  I notice my fingers are ripping into his neck and I notice that his skin smells rotten.  With all my strength, I detach his head from his body and throw it into the fire.  Jakes's blood is all over my hands.  I look at his body in shock at what I just did.  I get back up and pick up Stacy and use the handle to open the back of the bus.  I close the door behind us and notice more of those monsters that look like Jake walking around.  Stacy starts to wake up and notices that I'm holding her bridal style and we both blush.  I carefully set her down and she gives a small smirk.  She looks around us and asks, \"What's going on.\"  \"I'll explain later, but right now we need to get out of here and get ways from those things,\" while pointing at the walking corpses.  I look down and see a bloody crowbar and pick it up.  There were two other cars near the crash: SUV and a jeep.  I point to the cars and whisper \"Which one do you want to take?\"</span></div></div>",
