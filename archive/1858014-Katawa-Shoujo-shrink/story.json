            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's your first day at Yamaku Academy. You were transferred there because of a unique illness that you've been plagued with from birth. Simply put, at periodic intervals you randomly begin shrinking! This dangerous and potentially life threatening ailment has been stalled for several years now, by regularly taking several types of medication, and in the end, the decision was made for you to be transferred to your new school, where your condition might be better accepted. As you take a seat in your new classroom, a pink haired girl sitting next to you, greets you enthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be new here! I'm Misha!\" The girl next to Misha begins signing something with her hands. Could she be mute? Regardless, Misha immediately begins translating for her. \"And this is Shizune! But I call her Shii-chan! She wanted to tell you welcome!\" The three of you converse for a short period of time, before Misha gets down to what she really wanted to talk about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shii-chan was wondering if you might be interested in joining the Student Council! It's really fun, and we need all the hands we can get right now!\" After some contemplation, you give a simple reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might like to check it out, but not right now. I'm still trying to get settled in.\" Misha's face sets into a frown as she hears that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass continues as normal, with Misha not saying a word. Then, in the middle of class you feel it. Those twinges that usually proclaim the onset of your shrinking! This is terrible! You can't shrink in the middle of class! You scramble through your bag, attracting a reproachful glare from Shizune, but you don't care. Anything to avoid what was going to happen if you didn't get your medication. After searching your bag thoroughly, you begin to realize with horror, that, in your anxiety to start the new day, you'd left your medication in your dorm room! You could try sprinting out of the class but it's too late now! You feel the onset of the shrinking coming on.... and then it stops. It was a small one (no pun intended). Phew. It doesn't look like anyone noticed. You must have only lost an inch or two. Totally unnoticeable. You think you catch a Shizune giving you a curious look out of the corner of your eye, but it's fine. She's suspicious it seems, but doesn't know anything. You'll have to explain it to her at some point if you ever join the Student Council... which you're doubtful about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass proceeds as usual, and when the bell finally rings, everyone starts packing up. The teacher leaves in moments, leaving you to try and gather your things. Misha and Shizune leave the room with a glance that tells you that this isn't over. They must really want people to join the Student Council. That level of dedication actually scares you to a degree. They'd probably be waiting for you outside the room, now that you think of it, so there's no reason to go out right now. You're busy thinking of how you're going to get back to your dorm and get your medication when you feel it. A second twinge. Oh no! You're going to start shrinking again any moment! Shizune and Misha take a back seat as you get up from your desk and sprint for the door. But you're too late! Everything around you blurs, and begins to grow exponentially, as you shrink much more than last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last, everything stops, you look around in despair. The desks tower over you. Your bag, that you left by your desk, may as well be a mountain. You don't think you could be any bigger than one or two inches tall. And then things got worse. The door opened up, and Shizune and Misha re-enter the classroom. \"Shii-chan is it worth waiting for him? He's taking so long!\" You see Shizune sign something to Misha and the girl laughs loudly. \"You're right Shii-chan! We really do need the he- huh?\" She looks around the classroom in a confused manner, while Shizune seems to ponder your apparent disappearance. As you try to quietly creep by the two girls, passing through the space between them, suddenly one of them glances down and notices you! Which one is it?</span></div></div>",

Slow down Shicchan. I don't get a word you're trying to say..\", Misha snaps. You saw this as your golden opportunity for an escape. Without thinking twice, you bolted out of the classroom and straight to the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune saw you running off and quickly chased after you. \"Hey Shicchan! Wait!\" Misha exclaimed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite your efforts, Shizune catches up with you in a matter of seconds. You hear her footsteps crashing down at your heels until her foot slams down in your path, stopping you dead in your tracks. You look up at the titan schoolgirl looming over you as her hand descends upon you. You raise your arms in resistance but she makes short work of your struggles and you find yourself being lifted like a toy in a claw machine. You marvel at the length of Shizune's legs as you're carried past them. Considering the sheer enormity of them, it's a wonder she didn't catch up to you sooner. She holds you up to her eye level so that she can get a good look at you. The playful glint in her eye and almost hungry smile suggests that perhaps she somewhat enjoyed chasing you just now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shi-chan! What's gotten into you!?\" Misha pipes says as she catches up with you two. Shizune dangles you in front of Misha like a prize she just won. \"What is tha-- Oh... my...\" her eyes widen as the realization hits her. \"That's the new guy!!\" Shizune nods and starts making her way back into the classroom. Misha follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel so defeated as you are placed back at your desk with the girls sat around you. You were so out of breath, you felt like you'd run a mile but Shizune got you back here in mere seconds and that was just at a walking pace. As you go to sit down in an attempt to catch your breath, Misha pokes you, knocking you on your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop that!\" you call up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you've already talked to me today, you know I can talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, that was when you were normal sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would that make any difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I'm not really familiar with my classmates shrinking.\" there is a pause before she lets out an obnoxiously loud laugh. \"So, is this why you're at Yamaku? 'Cuz you get all tiny sometimes?\" you notice Misha has been signing both yours and her parts of the conversation. Most likely for Shizune's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Look, girls, I could really use your help here. I need to get to my room to get my medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I don't know, new guy. We're two very busy ladies.\" Misha smirks at her own attempt to be playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! As students reps, it is your duty to help a fellow peer in need, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, good point! See, that's the type of debating we could use on the Student Council!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already said, I'll think about it. But, right now I'm more focused on other things like getting back to normal size again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune's eyebrows perk up and she quickly taps on the table, scaring you witless. Misha looks over to her and you realize that's how Shizune gets her attention. The two girls sign to each other, giving you no clue what they're talking about. Misha giggles a couple of times, though, so it can't be good whatever it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha lets out one more giggle and a nod before turning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, new guy. We'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuut!!\" Misha pushes her finger on your chest, effectively pinning you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you--!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to join the Student Council.\" the girls smile wickedly at your predicament. Shizune shows an unnerving amount of glee to see you pinned down like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy!? I said I will think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll just think about whether or not we should help you. I mean, you can get to your room by yourself. At your size it'll only take about, I don't know... All day? Maybe longer! Wahahahaha~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've got you there. She makes a compelling argument; the journey to your dorm is not a short one and certainly not a safe one. It seems as if you have no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit, fine! I'll join your stupid club. Now get off of me!\" Misha raises her mighty finger and pats you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta' boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune picks you up and you all begin the trip to the boys dorm. \"Don't worry new guy!\" Misha says, \"Even at this size, there's loads of jobs you can do for your Student Reps! Wahahaha~!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you check to see if you remembered your medicine for the third time (you don't want a repeat of yesterday at the meeting, after all), Misha manages to sneak up on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo!\" she grabs your shoulders and shakes you a bit. \"Ready for your first meeting, Recruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be...\" you reply, \"don't try and scare me, by the way. It's not good for my condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if that was true or not. When you were diagnosed, your doctor <i>theorized</i> that sudden changes in heart rate may be a factor in your size change and its severity but it was as much a mystery to him than anyone. Not many people shrink these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted! But from now on, myself and Corporal Shi-chan will be the ones making orders!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe less military speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha~! Affirmative!\" she salutes as Shizune approaches, \"Looks like we're all here! Shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and nod, following the girls out of the classroom until Mr. Mutou interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry girls, but, might I borrow our newest student rep for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sir! You remember what room we'll be in right?\" Misha turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the one.\" you say, waving them off. You lean against a desk while Mutou finishes talking to another student. He asks the boy a couple of questions about his condition and you wonder whether or not you should be listening. You opt to feign ignorance and look around the room pretending not to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mutou wraps up their conversation and summons you over. You sit at his desk and pass the other kids bag over to him, getting you a smile and a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New student. Like you.\" Mutou explains once the room is empty. \"I'm just wondering how the two of you are getting on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like me, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, no! Not the same condition!\" Mutou chuckles, \"Hisao and yourself are just new together.\" he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" you say, a little embarrassed. As if you would find another person who could shrink. \"Well, I'm doing okay. Thanks.\" you hope to get this over with as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evidently. I've seen Shizune and Misha try and rope countless students into the council and you're the first to agree.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered reporting them for their behavior towards you yesterday. You didn't exactly <i>agree</i> as much as you were forced into it against your will. Against your better judgement, you stayed silent. Maybe the student council won't be too bad and hanging out with two cute girls for a couple of hours can't be the worst thing in the world. Not to mention they <i>did</i> help you get your medicine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to see you getting involved in the school spirit.\" Mutou says in a blatant attempt to fill the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should get going, sir. Sorry, I just don't want to keep the girls waiting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, don't let me keep you. Just stay on top of your studies and we'll get along famously!\" you shook his hand and left, closing the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your journey to meeting room was an uneventful one. School was over and the halls were practically empty. You spotted Hisao in his gym kit with a short girl walking around on prosthetic legs. Weird time for a run but you assume they're a pair of fitness freaks. You smile to yourself at that thought. <i>'What kind of place am I in when I question the time to go for a run before I question the girl with no legs even running!?'</i> you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to meeting was open ajar, you peer in to see Misha sat with her feet up on the table and shoes kicked off to the side. You walk in and she looks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here! We thought you'd bailed on us!\" Misha stood to give you a hug which ended up being a face full of breasts and a death squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We..?\" you noted once you were free, observing the lack of Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shi-chan went to get some drinks from the vending machine. She was hoping to bump into you so she could drag you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you take a seat and Misha follows suit, perching herself on the table this time. \"So, what do you do in these meetings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually, we discuss tactics to make people join the council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we're a lot busier around this time of year with the festival going on. We make banners and flyers and talk about what our class is going to do as a project. But today we figured we'd get to know you a bit. Like an initiation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you can't help but say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Board games! We play board games sometimes, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So, getting to know me? Do you mean questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, interrupting the two of you and Shizune walks in with cans of soda in her arms. A devious smile creeps across her face when she sees you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now we can start with the questions!\" Misha says, rolling onto her belly. Shizune sits next to you and leans in as if examining a new specimen for an experiment. She looks over to Misha and begins signing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, then! Question one: can you control it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shrinking! Can you shrink whenever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. It just kind of happens whenever.\" Shizune's shoulders drop when Misha relays the message to her. Was that disappointment? She <i>wishes</i> you could control it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question two! What makes you the perfect candidate for the student council?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect candidate? You remember how I ended up here, right? You pinned me down and forced me to agree. I'm the 'perfect candidate' because you chose me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, nice! Shi-chan liked that answer. Good going, new guy! Question three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha's voice began to fade and you felt yourself getting sweaty. <i>Fuck, not again. Not now.</i> Your bones began to ache and your legs start to tingle. <i>Here we go again.</i> You close your eyes and open them to find yourself still sat on the chair. Still sat on the gigantic, wasteland of a chair. To your left you see, for the second time, the titan Shizune smiling down excitedly at your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he just do it?\" Misha says, looking over the edge of the table. \"He did!\" she cheers, reaching out for you. Before you can even fathom what's happening, you are once again lifted into the air by a giant hand. You are dropped onto the table and Shizune brings her face right up close to you, examining you again at your new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, guys. We know the drill. Just get my medicine from my-\" Shit. Your bag. You left it in the classroom. How did you forget it <i>again!?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Did you forget your medicine again?\" you bent over backwards trying to get a look at Misha's face and nod. \"Wahahaha~!\" she booms down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it in the classroom. Can we go get it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha looks at the clock. \"The classroom will be locked by now. We'll have to get it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. That's great. Perfect. So what now then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha and Shizune had another one of their private conversations before coming back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shizune and I both agree that...</span></div></div>",

You're gonna <i>be</i> a piece!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be joking.\" you laughed, \"That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\" you still fell under the assumption that they were joking until you notice Shizune was on the other side of the room sifting through the board games on the desk. The reality slowly sunk in; they were serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! No joking! Don't look so worried, it'll be fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune eventually came over and puts down a giant chess board on the table and began placing the pieces on the squares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww chess?!\" Misha pouted, signing her words simultaneously, \"Chess is so boring! You always beat me, Shi-chan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded in your direction whilst signing in response to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh!!\" Misha said knowingly, \"Good idea, Shi-chan!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What did she say?\" you tug at Misha's sleeve to get her attention. A shadow is cast over you and you look up to Shizune's hand coming right for you yet again. You fall backwards trying to evade her and are dropped on the board behind Shizune's pawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be Shi-chan's king!\" You turned around to look at Shizune who wore that all-too-familiar grin you'd learned to hate. \"I wouldn't let her down if I were you!\" Misha warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started off as engaging as your average game of chess. Well, an average game of chess that involved a tiny man. Shizune made a point to keep one hand close to you at all times, most likely in case you tried to run. To her credit, the idea of that hand snatching you up was easily enough incentive to stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha's moves appeared rushed and lacked foresight. Shizune's moves were calculated and deliberate. You watched her eyes dart to every single piece on the board as if she were a computer analysing every single outcome before making a decision. You found yourself slowly losing interest in the game as you watched Shizune. She's such a fascinating girl. Everything she does oozes with passion and whether that terrified you or exited you, you were yet to decide, but you had to respect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check!\" Misha called out happily in her sing-song voice, \"Your King is all mine, Shi-chan!\" she stared at you with a malicious grin before laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Shizune but her eyes weren't zipping around the board anymore. She was looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you look back over to Misha, \"is she okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your turn!\" Misha informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the King. It's your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really wished you kept your attention on the game instead of Shizune now. There were three available spots you could go to but whether they were as dangerous as your current position you were yet to find out. And would you be messing with some kind of long term plan of Shizune's if you move to a certain spot? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... here.\" you say, carefully stepping over to the square to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahahaha! Too easy!\" Misha sang as one of her bishops came gliding over to you. Misha grabbed you with her other hand and put the bishop in your place. \"I finally did it! I beat you Shizune!\" she boasted as she dangled you in front of the blue haired giant. She didn't look pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Misha. What's sign language for 'I'm sorry'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha put you on the table and showed you. You turned to Shizune and mimicked the hand expression as closely as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[I'm sorry]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune smiled and made some hand gestures back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she say?\" you ask Misha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said you're demoted to rook. I think she was joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that you threw her entire game in one single move, she probably wasn't joking. Despite the fact you hated the idea of being a chess piece, you had to give the girls credit; it had totally taken your mind off of your medicine. But now, back to the real world with its real problems. You decided to address the most glaring problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now? I can't exactly go back to my room tonight...\" you hoped you weren't coming across as forward or even creepy. But the solution seemed obvious - you were gonna have to stay in one of the girls' bedrooms.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You'll have to stay in my room!\" Misha chirped. This worried you. She wasn't exactly a subtle girl and after the day you've had, you were hoping for some peace and quiet when you turned in for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to..?\" you figured you'd challenge her before it was too late. Maybe she has a genuine reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't stay with Shi-chan! She won't hear you if you need anything! What if you have to go pee and she has her back to you? Wahaha~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated the idea of hearing that laugh all night, she had a valid point. At least you can communicate with Misha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win. Your room it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha~!\" Misha celebrated, swooping you up like a prize. \"Let's go then! I can't wait to show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou met Shizune's gaze and raised your eyebrows at Misha's hyperactive antics. Shizune raised her eyebrows back understandingly. You shook your head and laughed. You'll have to learn sign language for <i>'Help!'</i> at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing held by Misha was strange. You were used to being picked up and carried but mostly by family and doctors. Everyone tended to be careful. Every movement was very deliberate, as if the slightest step too fast or fist too clenched would cause you to detonate. They could've used you in the hospital to train heart surgeons in developing a steady hand! But Misha was different; as you sat in her palm, holding onto one of her fingers for stability, she practically jumped with every step. You'd be forgiven for thinking you were on a roller coaster with the amount of sudden jolts and fast turns you'd endured but she didn't carry you like a baby bird or someone with a disability. She carried you with confidence. She knew she had you and wouldn't let you fall and part of you knew you were in safe hands too. You weren't being carried by some overpaid doctor or an overbearing parent. You were being carried by a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune matched her pace, if not her giddy mannerisms; her back remained straight and her eyes focused forward. She even walked with determination. You hoped she didn't mind you and Misha sharing a room tonight but she seemed like a pragmatic girl who'd understand the reasons. You'd have to let her know that given the choice, you'd stay with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Shi-chan, this is where we part ways!\" Misha announced, signing with one hand. Incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune signed something to her then looked down at you and signed something. You stared blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shi-chan is saying good night.\" Misha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, uhh...\" you stood up and waved, \"Good night!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha giggled, \"Here, let me show you.\" you were brought forward towards Shizune and slowly dropped onto her hand. You turned around and watched Misha. She made some slow hand signals and narrated them for you, \"Gooood... niiight... now you try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to Shizune and cleared your throat (you're not sure why you did this to talk with your hands), <i>\"[Good night.]\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune handed you back to Misha and returned the same sign, only faster and somehow more fluent. You watched her go through the door behind her into her room and then you were alone with a pink-haired giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is my room!\" she turned around and opened the door. You laughed. Of course she'd have a room directly opposite Shizune's. You looked around and found yourself surprised; Misha's room was neat. Everything was tidy and she even had some box files on a shelf on her desk, each labelled for a different class. The only file in your room was the one that you think was left by whoever stayed there before you. \"I guess I'll just..\" Misha lowered you to the ground and you climbed down from her hand. \"Make yourself at home!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps across the vast carpet before you. As you made your fifth step, a shadow cast over you. You looked up and noticed Misha was stepping over you. You quickly looked back ahead of you so as not to see any more of her up skirt than you already had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just need to take my shoes off.\" she explained as she crouched down to slip them off. \"Feel free to take yours off too, just keep them next to mine. I'm sure we won't get them mixed up! Wahaha~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obliged and and headed over to where she placed her shoes. As you passed her socked feet, you couldn't help but notice a faint odour, one which would no doubt become stronger if you were to come any closer. You made a mental note to avoid her feet at all costs. You kicked off your shoes and placed them next to Misha's, feeling slightly emasculated as you noticed her enormous loafer completely dwarfed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha excused herself and left the room, offering you free range to explore until she came back. Though it was nice of her, there wasn't much to look at on the floor unless you had a fiery passion for carpet fibres. She returned after about twenty minutes with a slice of cake wrapped in a napkin. She placed it on her bedside table and laid her hand flat in front of you. \"All aboard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed you on her bed and sat cross legged with the cake between you. \"One of the girls in the dorm had a birthday yesterday so I swiped us some cake. I was going to get two slices but I figured you wouldn't eat a whole one by yourself. Wahaha~!\" she broke off a piece about the size of you and popped it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said before taking a few crumbs from the mountainous cake for yourself. \"So, how long have you and Shizune been friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince the day we met! Shi-chan's great and it's really a shame not many people can understand her because she's always saying really funny stuff! Like this one time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha went on talking about every little anecdote and memory she'd shared with Shizune. Which is to say, she talked for a long time. The cake had been devoured (mostly by Misha, of course) and after listening to maybe a million more words, you glanced over at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, it's late!\u201d you keenly observed, \u201cOr early, I guess.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 1:30AM. Misha really can talk. She looked over at the clock too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! Wahahaha~! I haven't stayed up this late for a long time! We are so going to sleep in tomorrow!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think Shizune will let us skip class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not. We should turn in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, Misha...\u201d Your heart thudded at the idea of sharing a bed with this giant. \u201cMaybe we shouldn't... y'know... sleep together. Not only is it wildly inappropriate, it's very dangerous for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared blankly at you until her lips twisted into a smirk, then quivered before letting out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWahahaha~! Anon! We are not sleeping together! I already have a place for you to sleep!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretended not to be offended that she found sleeping with you such a novel concept and watched as she opened a drawer on her bedside table and start rummaging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d she declared as she triumphantly pulled out a sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed it on the table and picked you up, gently setting you down on the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go! It's like a sleeping bag! Wahahaha~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Misha? A sock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! It's clean! C'mon, just try it!\u201d She beamed down at you expectantly. You sighed and shimmied your way into the opening of the sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to argue that you should be able to sleep somewhere a bit more dignified than a garment meant for one's foot but as soon as you cocooned yourself in the soft material, your body begged for sleep. You were tired and had to admit it wasn't so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY'know, it is actually very cosy in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWahaha~! I knew you'd like it! Good night, Anon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night, Misha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, it was lights out.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d finally settled in and didn\u2019t feel so odd anymore - the other students barely looked up from their desks when you\u2019d shrink in the middle of class. It was honestly kind of nice. Like you belonged.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBeing part of the Student Council has proven to be good for you and for the girls - you\u2019d learned from your classmates that Shizune and Misha have always come across as kind of unapproachable with Misha being known as over-the-top and loud and Shizune being, quite frankly, scary. Having you on board gives the council a friendly face that doesn\u2019t intimidate the students.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe bell rings, signalling the end of class. You pack up as usual but you\u2019re stopped by Mr. Mutou on your way out. He motions for you to sit at the desk in front of his and you both wait for the rest of the class to clear out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIs everything okay, sir?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not in trouble.\u201d Mr. Mutou gives a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m just checking in, we haven\u2019t spoken one-to-one for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well, things are good. I\u2019ve been pretty busy with the whole Student Council thing.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t let it effect your studies. I\u2019m impressed, Anon. I hear Misha is also teaching you sign language.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it. Never learned a language before so it\u2019s been tough but she\u2019s a good teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m impressed. And I\u2019m sure Shizune will appreciate having someone else to talk to.\u201d Mutou chuckles. \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t keep you. Student Council duties await, am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cRight. Thank you, sir.\u201d you shake his hand again and leave the classroom where Shizune was waiting for you. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c[Hey.]\u201d you signed.<br>\r\n\u201c[Hello.]\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c[No Misha?]\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c[No. I sent her on a task, you and I have other business.]\u201d<br>\r\nThis was different. Every council meeting included all three of you. For Shizune to send Misha away was - in a word - weird. Regardless, you headed to the usual meeting room, walking beside Shizune. You struggled to keep up with her as she marched on with deliberate strides. You hated to admit it but you kind of preferred being carried. The journey was predictably quiet, any attempts to sign to her would probably go unnoticed anyway. Sadly this meant you couldn\u2019t ask her to wait while you grabbed a soda from the vending machine.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe door to the meeting room opened with its regular squeaky fanfare, yielding the darkened room you spent most of your evenings. Shizune flicked the light on, adding some much needed life and took a seat.<br>\r\n\u201c[We need decorations in here. It\u2019s very boring.]\u201d you joined her at the table, taking the seat opposite.<br>\r\n\u201c[Misha is of the same mind. We only decorate for Christmas.]\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c[I guess that makes it more special.]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune nodded in agreement. You sat for a moment, occasionally glancing at the door hoping Misha would show up. As much life as the light added, nothing can brighten up a room quite like her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt\u2019s strange to experience an awkward silence with someone who cannot hear.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c[Is there something you need to speak to me about?]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune watched your hands then looked around the room. Something was on her mind but she was impossible to read.<br>\r\n\u201c[Is that why Misha isn\u2019t here?]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune nodded.<br>\r\n\u201c[Are you going to kick me out of the Council?]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune frantically shook her head, wide-eyed.<br>\r\n\u201c[So what\u2019s wrong?]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune thought for a moment. Her shoulder dropped and she began to sign.<br>\r\n\u201c[I was hoping you\u2019d shrink by now. It would be easier to say if you were small.]\u201d<br>\r\nYou smiled. You got up out of your chair and got on your knees.<br>\r\n\u201c[How\u2019s this?]\u201d<br>\r\nShizune laughed. It was a unique laugh, one you came to enjoy. She couldn\u2019t vocalise, sure, but laughter is innate; for Shizune, it came out similar to panting. But her eyes creased with happiness just like everyone else. She stopped laughing and her eyes narrowed, her smile turned wicked; flirtatious.<br>\r\n\u201c[Smaller.]\u201d<br>\r\nYou sat down and lowered your head, looking up for approval.<br>\r\n\u201c[Smaller...]\u201d<br>\r\nYou lied on your back, your head towards her. You watched her as she pondered your new height.<br>\r\n\u201c[I can\u2019t go smaller.\u201d] you told her. She raised an eyebrow. \u201c[I can\u2019t go smaller ON COMMAND.]\u201d you clarified. She laughed again.<br>\r\n\u201c[But I can go bigger.]\u201d she stood up from her chair and stepped forward, her legs either side of you. You looked away upon realising you could see up her skirt but reasoned you\u2019ve seen up the girls\u2019 skirts when you\u2019ve been tiny and looking away from Shizune removes your ability to listen to her. You looked back.<br>\r\n\u201c[Can you tell me now?]\u201d<br>\r\nShe thought for a moment, perhaps relishing the position you two were in. \u201c[I suppose.]\u201d<br>\r\nShe began signing but the door burst open, presenting Misha triumphantly holding a trumpet and an alarm clock.<br>\r\n\u201cI got the stuff, boss! What did you need these for any\u2014\u201c she stopped when she noticed the scene before her; you on the floor with Shizune stood over you and all of you looking bug eyed at each other. It was at that moment you shrunk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou were still laying on your back as you watched the now giant Misha stomp over to her friend. She looked at you and then back at her.<br>\r\n\u201cWaaaait a minute... I don\u2019t think you wanted this stuff at all, Shi-chan! You just wanted to get rid of me so you two could be alone!\u201d<br>\r\nShe kneeled down and pointed a finger at you, large enough to almost block your view of her stern face. \u201cWas this your idea, Recruit?\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, Shizune placed a hand on Misha\u2019s shoulder. She stood up and faced her friend to hear her out.<br>\r\n\u201c[It was my idea. The truth is, yes, I felt I needed a moment with Anon to discuss his future with the Student Council. Think of it as a monthly review. I\u2019d like to do one with you also, now that we have more members.]\u201d<br>\r\nMisha considered her words. She looked at you again and smirked.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I just barged in and made Anon shrink! Wahaha~! I\u2019ll leave you two to your review in that case. If you need criticisms for him; he needs to work on staring up our skirts. Byeeee~!\u201d and with that, she was gone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShizune scooped you up and placed you on the desk.<br>\r\n\u201c[So, where were we?]\u201d you asked, not wanting to take the wind out of your previously very flirty sails. But Shizune seemed deflated. \u201c[Is everything okay?]\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c[I had every intention of telling you that I liked you. Because I did, and I still do.]\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d you spoke aloud unintentionally, but it seemed Shizune got the message.<br>\r\n\u201c[Seeing Misha just now has made me realise, if we were to start anything, it could completely change the council\u2019s dynamic. Perhaps Misha and I wouldn\u2019t be as close, perhaps she\u2019d feel pushed to the side. I would hate for her to feel that way.]\u201d<br>\r\nYou stayed quiet for a moment, formulating a response. The beauty of learning sign language is there\u2019s no room for \u2018ums\u2019 and \u2018errs\u2019, you can take time to think about what you\u2019re saying. You can say the right thing if you just think. </span></div></div>",

It was a smirk at first, slowly smudging into a wide grin, until he was choking up from his jaw straining to keep up with his ego. Struggling, Hisao said \"Kenji, my good friend, we're close right?\". Kenji lit up at the sound of Hisaos' words, his glasses skewing slighty, but just enough to reveal another spark of maddness behind those thick spectacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, Kenji, why didn't I think of it sooner? I don't need Shizune, as long as I got my good pal here!\" grabbing the shoulder opposite to his in a friendly embrace. \"You know what, she's at he most vulnerable right now,\" he slurred with difficulty \"why don't you pay her a visit and BEAT some MEANING into her!\" Hisao choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs diligent as a soldier who gives his last dying breath to his comrade, Kenji checked his watch, only to discover that his battey had died. Damn it, feminists! He scanned the horizon but the sun hid behind the clouds. Foiled, again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHisao was struggling for a breath, his heart disorder kicking in. Kenji, contrary to him, hadn't noticed it. \"I'll do you good Hisao, you'll see that wench come begging to you in no time!\" Kenji trumpeted out, breaking into a mad sprint and trampling some dandelions. As Kenji dashed away, Hisao was blacking out, his chest heaving and his vision blurring. He didn't even try to shout, accepting this as his last stand. In his last dying moments, Hisao looked towards the distant Kenji, ready to ruin moods and kick some feminist heiny. Hisao only grinned, a shit eating grin at that, and with a final breath, released his momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He has been sinking your ships ever since they appeared on his radar, one operation failed after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second passes, and in that single instant he mows down Lily, knocking her head against the railing and shattering her scalp on impact. His face is a deformity of determination and savagery, with a trail of embers fleeing from his dark sockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of your work, hard earned and wagered, has been torn to shreds in a single instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is collapse onto the linoleum and cradle your limp comrade, tears leaking from your eyes. Your comrade leans in, sparks flying from the crack in her skull, eager to spread her last words to you. Her mouth moves, but all you hear is silence. Her words don't need form to reach you, because before your eyes, she dies before you, her last message still fresh in your mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moonmans' been smooth since the days of killing jews\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(**EXUNT**)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were transferred there because of a unique illness that you've been plagued with from birth. Simply put, at periodic intervals you randomly begin shrinking! This dangerous and potentially life threatening ailment has been stalled for several years now, by regularly taking several types of medication, and in the end, the decision was made for you to be transferred to your new school, where your condition might be better accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned the corner to get to your first class you mistakenly bump into another student! She was much taller than you, and long blonde hair that was curled at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl rubbed her head a bit in recoil, you hoped you didn't hurt her! \"Oh my gosh, I am so so sooo sorry! Ya see it's my first day here and I was just really nervous and I was just turning a corner and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, really. I should have heard you coming. You said it was your first day?\" the girl says with a blank stare in her eyes and an ever so slight smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, y-yeah, it is. Wait, you said you should have <i>heard</i> me?\" you ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, well yes, of course! What did you think--oh, of course you wouldn't have known, silly me. You see, everyone here has some sort of disability that prevents them from functioning regularly in a normal school. I for one, am blind, as you can probably see from my eyes,\" she informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! That makes me feel even worse! I really am sorry again\" you apologize once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly, it's alright, I can tell you didn't mean it. Hey, why don't you join me for tea during our lunch break so we can chat a bit more?\" she asks. \"It's a right on the second floor, can't miss it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well okay, sounds good, I'll see you then!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, see you then...\" the girl mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I didn't mean it like--\" you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly, it's alright.\" the girl pardons herself and then walks away, leaving you to go to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, I didn't even get her name!\" you curse yourself. \"Oh well, I guess that's what the tea chat is for. And hey, she was pretty cute, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk merrily into class and anticipate your coming lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime during the middle of class you can feel your body get those all too familiar tingles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again! Not in here!\" you think. You suddenly feel your body lose about an inch or two. You quickly look in your bag for your medicine, but can't find it! You must have forgotten it in your room with all the excitement of your first day! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to interrupt class to go to your room save for being labelled a delinquent, so you wait it out until the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass ends and the lunch bell rings in a matter of minutes and you quickly rush out of class to the boy's dorms, ignoring how much height you lost in that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang it! You forgot your promise to have tea with that pretty girl! She'll probably think you're a huge jerk if you don't show up on time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll just run in, tell her an emergency came up, run back to my room for the medicine, and then run back to enjoy the rest of lunch with her, easy!\" you reason with yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn around and bolt up the stairs. But by the time you make it to what you assume to be the tea room, it was too late. You were only about a mere 2-3 inches in height. Students in the outside hallway towered over you like giants and giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps approaching behind you and see the tall blonde girl walk into the room, giving you a quick glimpse underneath her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tall before, but now she was like a skyscraper, no, bigger! You couldn't believe how absolutely miniscule you were compared to her towering figure! You had to get her attention, you needed her help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl sits at a table near the windowsill and silently waits, probably for you. You run over to her and attempt to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoot, wait, she's blind! Now what're you gonna do? Maybe she'll be able to hear you if you scream? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss! Hey, miss! Excuse me! Down here! Hey!\" you call up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the girl hear your cries?</span></div></div>",

I'm standing right next to your shoe!\" you call back up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'm all for having fun once in a while, but what you're doing is just seems a bit rude. I'm blind, not dumb,\" she says, annoyed. Dang it, she think you're making fun of her! How do you convince a blind girl that a shrunken man is at her feet!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you get an idea. You grab onto her loafers and start to climb her shoes. Once you reach the top, you call up to her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! I'm standing on your shoe! Please pick me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, fine. But this isn't funny in the slightest...\" she says, still a bit miffed at you. She reaches her hand down towards the floor and you. You see her feel around a bit before her finger finally comes in contact with your body. You tap it to notify her that, yes, it is you, and her hand grasps your body and gently lifts you up. You zoom past her knees, skirt, chest, and finally reach her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her face for a moment and then look into her empty blank eyes. It's not that they were weird, they were just so...mesmerizing. Finally the girl snaps you out of your trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I guess this is your disability, huh?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you finally believe me that I was telling the truth?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I deeply apologize. I can tell that, and please don't take this the wrong way, no doll could feel as lifelike as you are at this size, so I'm going to have to believe you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no hard feelings, it is pretty unbelievable. The doctors said I'm the first case of this shrinking phenomenon they've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how rude of me, I know this might not be the right time, but this will probably help for future reference. My name is Lilly, Lilly Satou.\" she says, giving a slight bow (she's still sitting in her seat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to finally meet you Lilly, I'm--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I know who you are, I <i>am</i> Class Representative after all.\" Lilly cuts off, giving a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, well I'm glad we both know each other now. Anyways, I'm gonna need you to carry me to my room so I can take my medicine to get me back to normal size,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how it works? How interesting...\" Lilly ponders your request, putting her free hand on her cheek. \"I think the bell will ring soon, so I promise to take you to your room after school, but I can't be late for class today, we're working on the stands for the school festival coming up and I don't think I'd be setting a good example if the Class Rep was late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't miss class on my first day!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, students are allowed to miss class if their disability may interfere with their education\" Lilly retorts, trying to give a dignified pose. \"And I think this qualifies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fine, but where will I be all day?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a few ideas...\" Lilly says with a somewhat worrisome and yet calming smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

No pockets at all. So we'll have to get a little more... creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot giving you a chance to ask what she meant, Lilly gently lowered and tilted her hand to let you down onto the floor between her two feet, your head barely peaking over the top of her brown leather flats that were settled on either side of you like colossal mountains. Two black stocking legs stretched impossibly by your perspective high up before disappearing under her green skirt, over which you could see Lilly's torso stretched forward so she was facing down towards you, more for your comfort then because she needed to stretch to see you. For obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm afraid I'm not following, Lilly.\" You'd be lying if you said that looking up at her gracefully shaped, pale face unbelievably high above you, filling a portion of the sky like the sun at high noon didn't make you a bit nervous. Her lips were curved in her trademark smile, one that was unbelievably tender despite any situation that went on around you. Her cheeks were curved with the elegance of a crafted statue, and her cloudy, unfocused eyes somehow seemed to be filled with affection. It took your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of responding, Lilly slowly lifted her dainty foot from the shoe on the left of you, inadvertently lifting the heel of the shoe up with her foot until her toes left it, allowing the heel to fall back down with a resounding boom, one that probably sounded like a soft thump to her but to you sounded like a building collapsing on itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You're kidding, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly shrugged, absent mindedly wiggling her stocking covered toes. \"I can't think of somewhere better. No pockets, and carrying you around like that would certainly get a lot of unnecessary attention drawn to you. I'm sure you don't want a bunch of people ogling over you at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding your teeth in thought, you mulled over it. She had a point. \"But... there's no way I can be in there safely. You'll be squishing me under your foot, I'll barely be able to get any air, the motion sickness will be insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Lilly started, her foot now freed of its shoe still boredly wiggling uncomfortably close to you, tapping on the floor, cracking her big toe (which sounded like a gunshot to your ears), and twisting her ankle back and forth. \"But on the other hand, you're small enough that you could easily fit into the space between the end of the shoe and my toes, and I'll be able to feel you so you can tap on my toes if you're feeling uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your hesitation still lingering, Lilly continued. \"I'll put you in the very end of my shoe, and we can have a system for you to tell me how you're doing in there. Tap my big toe once for telling me you're feeling comfortable enough, twice to tell me you're feeling a little uncomfortable, and three times if I'm hurting you. Would that make you feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised with how adamant she was being about this. And she did make some good points... \"Alright, we'll give it a try.\" You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded, then slipped her other foot out of her shoe, almost unnoticed by you due to trying to prepare yourself for what was going to happen next. Carefully using the big toe of her right foot, she pushed you between her big and second toe on her left foot, molding the fabric of her stocking and gingerly wrapping her big and second toe around you, covering your body from your ankles to the top of your torso. Lifting you up slowly she pushed her foot, and consequently you, into the end of her shoe, before unwrapping her toes and allowing you to get acclimated to your new setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, she was right. There was more than enough space to comfortably lay down at the end of her shoe, and the material inside of it was surprisingly moldable, not stiff as you were expecting. It didn't smell the best, but that was more from the leather of the shoe than any uncleanliness of her foot. \"Okay, tap on my big toe once if you're feeling okay down there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her directions, you gave her digit a soft punch, immediately followed by a jostling of your container and a muffled giggle from above. \"That tickles a bit, but it's better than not being able to feel you at all. I'm going to stand up and start walking back to class, a representative can't be late after all.\" You can almost picture her dignified pose, chin barely pointed up and that smirk that characterized her so well plastered on her lips. If she wasn't unimaginably larger than you her self confidence and pride in her position would be horribly cute. \"Just remember, one tap for alright, two taps for uncomfortable, three taps for pain. Even if you don't need to tell me you're uncomfortable, tap once every few minutes or so just so I know you're alright down there.\" Despite the crude position you two have been forced into, Lilly still managed to keep a very formal and kind disposition about it. It was awfully charming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have time to dwell on this for long, as true to her word, Lilly began her walk back to the class. The constant motion made you uncomfortable, but the actual vertigo was surprisingly manageable, perhaps because of her slow, graceful steps. This wouldn't be so bad after all. </span></div></div>",

You never imagined that you'd be riding around in a girl's shoe, much less comfortably, but there you were, and the weirdest part was perhaps how weird it <i>didn't</i> seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, the longer the day went on, the more comfortable Lilly also became with the situation. By the end of the day she'd occasionally poke your chest with one of her toes, or ruffle your hair with her big toe, uncharacteristically playful of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut indeed, time passed surprisingly quickly, and before long her dainty foot lifted out of her shoe, followed by her lifting her shoe up and gently tilting it so you could step out on a table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, you kind of expected her to take you back to your room, so you could get your medication and return to normal... but this wasn't your room. It was as barren as yours was given you didn't have much time to decorate since you arrived, but the walls were painted a pale orange instead of the tan of yours, and the furniture though assuredly the same design as the one from your room were arranged differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your confusion, Lilly explained. \"I had to bring you back to my room, as it's not allowed for the ladies to just wander around the boy's dorms after classes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Well, I guess that's alright, for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly awkward silence ensued, before Lilly decided to break it. \"I'm glad you seemed to not mind the ride. It wasn't too bad, I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! It was perfectly fine. I'll have to learn to trust your judgment better than mine in the future.\" It was half jokingly that you said that, but Lilly's calm decisiveness <i>was</i> a bit impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour earnest response stimulated a giggle from her. \"My my. Already planning for our future, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and stammered a few syllables, caught off guard with her comeback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widened. \"Just kidding, no need to get so flustered.\" That response which you think was meant to reassure you made you feel more self conscious, if anything. \"Anyway, despite festival preparation taking up most of the day, it's still pretty early in the evening. Would you care to join me if I go to get some dinner? I'd rather not sit around in my room for next few hours, not that your company isn't entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, no problem. Where'd you like to go? And how are you going to bring me there?\" You tried your best to regain your composure, but the atmosphere alone that seemed to surround Lilly made you feel terribly self conscious. She was a pretty wonderful person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't have to go back in my shoe, don't worry. I won't need both my hands as much as I did in class so I can just carry you in my closed hand if you don't mind. I was planning on going to a small tea shop a short walk away from the school grounds, it's usually very empty so you'll be able to sit on the table without too much attention.\" Gently scooping you up in her palm, Lilly grabbed her walking cane and headed towards the door. \"That sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh, yeah, sure. Would give us the time to talk we didn't get to have over tea, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then. Same routine as before, just give my fingers a few taps if you're uncomfortable.\" Lilly gingerly closed her fingers around you, blocking out the world and wrapping you in what felt like the biggest hug you've ever received. You blushed lightly again, giving her fingers a single tap to let her know you're alright, and away she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly kept her fingers closed the whole time, navigating doors and such by leaning her cane against the wall to open doors as well as to close them. She kept her hand level, clutched against her stomach, and the graceful bobbing of her body as she walked was rather calming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said, the walk to the cafe was rather short indeed. Sitting cross legged on the mat on the floor, Lilly laid her hand palm up on the table before unwrapping her fingers, allowing you to walk off. Also true to her word, the building was very empty; one server that was slowly making her way towards your table was the only other person here. A quiet melody and the smell of tea filled the air. You had to say, this really was the perfect place for Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Yuuko.\" Lilly greeted the hostess with the familiarity of a friend, which the server reciprocated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too, Lilly. Just by yourself today? No Hanako?\" The auburn haired lady you now knew as Yuuko clearly hadn't noticed you on the table; who could blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Hanako, she preferred to stay in her room and read today. I'm not alone, though. I brought a new student from Yamaku with me.\" Lilly gestured towards you with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuuko's eyes settled upon you and seemed to reach some level of familiarity that you really were a person, you decided to try to take the initiative. \"Hey there, my name's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" The auburn haired lady jumped a bit, squeaking a response which cut you off. \"S-sorry! Didn't mean to interrupt you! You just... surprised me.\" She slumped her shoulders and looked towards the floor, clearly feeling a bit awkward about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's not the worst response I've got. Like I was saying, I'm-\" \"So erm, what would you two like?\" Yuuko interrupted you again, either not hearing you continue or trying to pull herself back into a mode of professionalism, or both. You decided that life would go on if she didn't know your name and gave up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you can see, my friend here won't be eating much,\" Lilly joked before continuing. \"So we'll be splitting our meal. How does hojicha to drink and tonkatsu to eat sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about tea, so I'll trust your taste here.\" You figured that was the least awkward way of continuing the conversation, and it was true anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hojicha and tonkatsu, I'll bring that out to you two in just a second.\" Yuuko clumsily scurried away on her heels, prompting a giggle from Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you told me that the hospital hadn't heard of any case of someone shrinking before you came along? Must be interesting to be so unique.\" Lilly seamlessly moved onto the small talk, catching you a bit off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It took quite awhile before they managed to figure out what kind of medication to treat me with... My parents didn't want me missing out on classes, so they sent me to my old school before I got the proper treatment. Going through school at a few inches tall.. wasn't fun, exactly.\" You looked down, a bit embarrassed to be telling this to her, but you felt comfortable enough to continue. \"People are already mean enough, being so short just makes it easier. I'm sure you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly's lips pointed downwards, a sympathetic pout for you. \"That does sound awful. Even with the medication, you still seem to shrink sometimes, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm.\" You sat down on the table, starting to feel a bit more comfortable. \"Since I'm the first person with this... situation, the medicine isn't perfect yet. I'm glad you were close by this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly gave you a bright smile, setting one index finger on your back. \"I'll be more than glad to accompany you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you don't need to trouble yourself with that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shush. I'm the class representative. What kind of role model would I be if I didn't?\" Lilly's finger gave you a gentle pat on the back before withdrawing again. \"Besides, you seem rather nice. I'd like to get to know you more anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, but were saved having to respond by Yuuko setting the sandwich and tea on the table, klutzily almost setting the plate directly on you. You realized her awkwardness was going to be a running theme, and politely dismissed her apologies as Lilly listened, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal passed by quickly, Lilly lifting you up to the cup of tea to allow you to drink and breaking off small pieces of the sandwich for you while you continued to talk. You learned quite a bit about her, happy to listen and ask questions. She has lineage in Scotland, she was blind from birth, she has a close friend named Hanako, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lilly paid, she gingerly lifted you back up in her palm, only this time cupping you against the base of her neck instead of down at her stomach. It was subtle, but you got the idea, and blushed once more.</span></div></div>",

It's a...\" Lilly pauses, starting to kneel down carefully.  \"...a piece of jewelry.  It belonged to my grandmother and is quite fragile, so be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly to the rescue!  You're gonna have to thank her later for her quick thinking.  Hanako's going to watch her step now, and probably not stomp you into the carpet.  She might even find you this way, which you might actually prefer over Lilly in this case, with her hands making sweeps of the carpet in front of her, which are gentle but look like they have the power to level a city.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey!  I think I found it!\"  You look up to see Hanako's face looking right at you, quickly blocked out by her palm falling directly towards your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering the presumption of you being inanimate, you're not sure what to do.  If you move, you might startle Hanako, and you're not sure how she'd react.  Otherwise, you could keep yourself still and just let her pick you up, hoping that she isn't too rough with it.  You shudder at thoughts of being accidentally crumpled between those dainty fingers.<br>\r\nWithout another moment to spare, the shadow of Hanako's hand is hovering over you, her fingers ready to pluck you from the ground.</span></div></div>",

You're too scared to see it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, her warm grip is very gentle, even at your scale.  As you're lifted into the air and take in the view of Hanako's body as you go, in your head you thank Lilly for stressing your fragility; she's definitely proven she knows how to handle a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself being turned around a bit between the fingers, with the same gentle carefulness as before.  As your eyes meet with the massive violet wells of her eyes, partially obscured by a theatre curtain's worth of hair, she pauses moving you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this isn't jewelry.  This is... a doll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Hanako!\"  Lilly's voice interjects.  \"However, I think that's what I was looking for.  Just put it in my palm gently and I'll explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your neck and see Lilly approach, extending her palm.  Hanako places you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely stop yourself from kissing Lilly's hand.  Instead, you seat yourself comfortably and calm down, looking up at the faces of the girls above you.  Lilly's looking at Hanako, preparing to speak with her, but Hanako's looking right at you, and odd smile on her face, like she's really happy to see you.  Even with what little you know about her, that seems a little unlike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Hanako,\" Lilly begins, \"to put it simply, this is actually the new student in your class.  This is his disability... rather, shrinking like this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly pauses a moment as Hanako gasps and takes a step back before speaking up.  \"Th-thats... it's him...?\"  Hanako's smile fades and her hand raises to cover her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're startled by a booming laugh coming from Lilly, which may have been just a giggle in reality.  \"My my, Hanako, you don't have to be so scared all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako shakes her head.  You can't help but feel a little downtrodden.  She liked you a lot better when she thought you were a doll.  You sort of wish you could go back to that.  It wouldn't be so bad, being doted over and useful as a companion to a cute girl who seems kind of lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your wild daydream in time to notice Lilly has been speaking for a while longer.  \"-and so if he doesn't, he ends up... well, like this.  It's not really his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako is still unmoved, looking like she just wants you to get out, but Lilly refuses to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako, come on, just look at him.  There's nothing to be scared of.  What could he hope to do at this size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if Lilly is serious or joking, but your thoughts are confirmed by a sudden jab to your side, sending you flat on your face with what you assume to be Lilly's finger pinning you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako giggles momentarily.  You can't see her, however, due to being shoved partially into Lilly's palm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  You yell out.  Lilly's obviously not pressing down hard enough to hurt you, but you really don't appreciate being bullied.  You bang on her skin with your fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... speaks?\" Hanako asks, probably just surprised you've been quiet this whole time more than anything.  Though the whole ordeal has left you speechless, you should probably say <i>something</i> to her.</span></div></div>",

I didn't mean to upset you or anything. I just really needed help finding my medication so i could return to my normal height. I never meant to upset you. So if you don't want me here, I'll leave quietly and you won't have to be worried about me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just how do you plan on leaving by yourself?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. Just lower me to the floor and I'll walk back to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By yourself? I'm afraid i cannot let you do that. Not like you are now. What if someone mistook you for a bug and tried to squish you?\" Those words hit you hard. Just the thought of being killed underfoot was enough to make you feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about me Lilly. I may be small, but i can still take care of myself. And if you won't lower me down, then I'll just have to climb down you.\" You said still upset as you made your way over to her shirt sleeve. But before you could even get a good enough footing, Lilly picked you back up and brought you up to her face, which turned from her normal expression to a more upset /angry one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen to me young man. I forbid you from trying to do anything like that ever again while I'm the one taking care of you, do you understand?!\" The tone Lilly was using, it wasn't just scaring you, but also Hanako as well. She herself took a few steps backwards while looking just as scared as you. It was then Lilly expression changed into one where she almost looked like she was ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if Hanako doesn't want you, a tiny, young, and defenseless young man who can't even hurt a fly to be in the same room as her.....then i guess I'll have to leave with you. To make sure you stay safe.\" Then you saw some tears escape Lilly's eyes. It was then Hanako looked shocked. And then she herself looked like she was ready to cry. At that moment, Lilly turned for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly! Wait!\" Hanako shouted, stopping Lilly from taking another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.....the little doll man can...stay.\" At that moment, Lilly started smiling a sly grin. It was then you started putting two and two together. Lilly knew that if she guilt tripped Hanako enough, she would give in and let you stay with her. It was a cruel way of doing it, but you were sort of happy nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...at the very least...could you please...</span></div></div>",

To preoccupied thinking like about how today will go to notice you seemed to have shrunk .5 inches to 1.5, you <i>did</i> know this was Hanako's drawer from the familiar smell..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako felt inattentive &amp; somewhat groggy from just waking up, actually having <i>forgotten</i> your presence in her panty drawer. Well, she actually thought Lilly might've put you in <i>any</i> drawer, or snuck you back, after yesterday she was still a bit confused as to why she yelled at you for wanting to <i>leave.</i><br>\r\nGoing about her morning routine, you felt your own stomach nagging at you for food. You were helpless as you heard repeating &amp; soon to-be quieter stomps &amp; a quiet yawn, Hanako going first to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\nAbout six minutes passed before the roar of the shower was over &amp; you heard a 'whoosh' ring-clattering sound, no doubt the shower curtain opening. Echoing quiet steps &amp; quiet breathing is all you hear again for a minute or so? Then they were coming closer. \"Hanako! Hanako, in here!\" You yelled to get her attention as her shadow loomed in what little light was available, your ears were suddenly then pierced by the sound of wood-scraping-wood! <br>\r\nYou knelt down &amp; would anticipate this again, covering your ears with her surprisingly warm &amp; soft silky panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you Hanako didn't even hear your voice, you were so tiny &amp; so miniscule you'd have to be quite close to be heard, or yell at the top of your lungs! \"HANAKO!\" Yelling as soon as she closed the other drawer your voice was forced quiet, the screech of it driving you crazy. Then after she put on black socks she'd fire open the panty drawer- you ended up falling to your side &amp; feeling disoriented from the sudden g-forces. Hanako scanned the drawer hastily to see if the tiny man was sleeping on any pair, &amp; unfortunately for you she didn't see that you were blended in well with a pair of dark-green panties! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scream as she picked it up was loud to you &amp; real- deafened by her own breathing. Miles high it looked like you were lifted, &amp; having to hold onto the arch underneath was the only way to be safe! \"HEY! HEY! H-\" She twisted the panties around &amp; would grab onto the sides, you freezing for a second as she lowered them to her feet... How? How could she be staring right at her panties, but not see you? Your vision being focused on Hanako's body scars &amp; bare, slighty scarred right breast for a second before seeing her slightly curved lips, she either <i>really</i> forgot or thunk of Lillie taking you, or.. Is just being weirdly assertive? Unanswered, you rushed to try &amp; climb <u>into</u> the arch to climb her panties up from inside- only you barely made it up the panty front. <br>\r\nThe panties shot up &amp; you surely weren't getting away, the floor appearing like two hundred feet down. Hanako\"s wide pussy loomed just a few inches under you &amp; then you were forced against her pubic hairs, your body sinking into the short-shaven things. You felt a slight bumpiness from her skin &amp; heard her heartbeat barely, her insides making chruning-like noises &amp; immense warmth quickly setting in. Her walking made you move down some- NO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing on her panties as she was walking, you <i>really</i> didn't want to be found below her honey pot! \"Huh..\" You heard her speak to herself as she looked into the drawers, only a dark green light visible for you in this sweat-musky &amp; tight area. Unaware that Hanako now <i>might</i> think Lilly took you back, you were shocked when the tightness increased &amp; the panties were squishing your face &amp; body, light also getting more dark, she put pant-stockings on! Now better than never to move feeling its getting worse here, you held on tight just incase &amp; tried to flail against her body- It wouldn't work. <br>\r\nIf she wasn't moving some as she put on her bra she might've noticed you before, without the stockings, but now the panties were keeping you pressed against her crotch all snugly. Your flailing only caused you to move down a few centimeters, this scaring you wild &amp; making you stop, feeling its slightly hotter down <i>there.</i><br>\r\nWell, you figure if your gonna be in this situation you could wait until she sits &amp; crawl out from atop, it'd probably be better then scaring her as she just woke, with her anxiety &amp; likely <i>mad</i> reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like your stomach is caving in on itself &amp; being parched isn't a nice combo, this heat not really helping.. Ugh.. Now her skirt falls down, ripping what little light was left &amp; leaving you unable to see a centimeter away. Hanako walked again, you felt a small slip, so you <i>had</i> to grab on despite the tightness anyway. Finally putting her shirt on- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw some light come from above as she tucked her shirt outside of her panties, below the skirt. Not even did you have a outline, just a almost unnoticeable tiny bulge. So ready for the day she left her room, hastily heading to Lilliy's door &amp; knocking twice. <br>\r\n\"A-Awake?\" She asked, you actually heard well, though wach bounce is disorienting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. Just drinking some morning tea, you may come in.\" It must be seven or seven thirty, if they have so much spare time.. <br>\r\nHanako entered Lilly's room &amp; would just look around for a few seconds, Lilly sitting on the floor in boxers &amp; her school shirt. \"Have a good night, Hanako?\" She asked after a few seconds of silence, Hanako heading to her bed to sit on! This gave you a chance to get up more as the direction shifted- her stockings were <i>forcing</i> you into her now, though crawling was almost impossible! No! <br>\r\n\"Yes.. That.. The Tiny Guy was interesting..\" Speaking a bit weirdly, you couldn't figure out her tone. Lillie was looking in the general direction of her, \"Speaking of, is out unnamed little friend awake?\"<br>\r\n.......<br>\r\n.............<br>\r\n.................. A lengthy silence, you flailed against Hanako now, her feeling a barely feelable poke. Her face was quickly flaring up red as she shot her eyes down, you could feel her body heating up now that she noticed you. <br>\r\n\"Y-ye-s, I th-ink he mightbeinmy drawers still!\" Hanako got up &amp; you felt yourself fall down just a bit, her quickly making way to her door &amp; her face staying the same.. <br>\r\n<i>-I can't believe.. how was I so blind? Unfeelable? I thought.. I just met him! He- he really has this condition!? How!?-</i> Thinking to herself in some panic, Lilly could recognize the quick-paced loudness of Hanako's panic-mode tone. She didn't know what she was doing it for though- \"Well be hasty, please. We should get that boy to his dorm for medicine before school starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako bolted into her room &amp; would shut the door silently, though internally <i>thrice felt,</i> she was very nervous, annoyed, &amp; a bit apologetic for throwing you around in the morning.. She let her skirt fall to the ground before pulling her stockings down to her crotch- <br>\r\nThe fresh-ish air was nice &amp; as light floods the cloth prison, things got looser for you. \"Oh.. My, t-tiny, y-your down there..\" She felt her crotch &amp; pressed down some, you yelled in some pain as her skin forced you to the right, she could see your bare outline now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. P- Please don't be mad, or.. Speak about.. This. Please be okay..?\" Yah, nice to hear her ask that before asking if your ok.. But her anxiety must be shooting high, you could see why she asked so. Then light flooded you from above- before you could look up, two of Hanako's fingers wrapped around your waist. <br>\r\nSuddenly light hurt your eyes &amp; fresh air flooded your nostrils, Hanako had a trembling hand as she set you atip her dresser, sitting on her bed &amp; looking <b>right</b> down at you. <br>\r\nTaking a few seconds to adjust to light, you looked up to see her hands covering her crotch &amp; Hanako bearing a very small smile. Then she bent close to you, her breath was slightly rancid &amp; peachy- \"Tiny, sorry- what's your name? S-sorr-y for.. Just a.. Few minutes ago.\" Well.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you feel you have to word this right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you crawl to the entrance, you meet up with Lilly's hand, likely coming in to search for you.  You allow her to gently pick you up.

She's got you in a corner.  Might be a good time to own up to what you did.  You owe it to her after making her worry that she smashed you under her foot anyway.

You were transferred there because of a unique illness that you've been plagued with from birth. Simply put, at periodic intervals you randomly begin shrinking! This dangerous and potentially life threatening ailment has been stalled for several years now by regularly taking several types of medication. And in the end, the decision was made for you to be transferred to your new school, where your condition might be better accepted. As you take a seat in your new classroom, you spot a girl sitting across from you with long-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Author note-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry to do this mid story everyone, but I don't know what Hanako's hair color is.

So I'll just leave it to Kataki to correct the color of Hanako's hair for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-hair covering the right side of her face. Which was also the side you were looking at. For a moment, she looked back at you, only for her to quickly look away. Whoever she was and whatever her disability was, she was a very shy girl. Class continues as normal, with the girl sitting next to you not saying a word. Then, in the middle of class you feel it. Those twinges that usually proclaim the onset of your shrinking. This is bad. You can't shrink in the middle of class. You scramble through your bag, attracting the attention of the girl sitting across from you. But you don't care. Anything to avoid what was going to happen if you didn't get your medication. After searching your bag thoroughly, you begin to realize with horror, that in your anxiety to start the new day, you'd left your medication in your dorm room. You could try sprinting out of the class, but it's too late now. You feel the onset of the shrinking coming on...and then it stops. It was a small one. (No pun intended.) It doesn't look like anyone noticed either. You must have only lost an inch or two. Totally unnoticeable. You think you catch the girl across from you giving you a curious look out of the corner of your eye. But it's fine. She's suspicious it seems, but doesn't know anything. You'll have to explain it to her and the rest of the class at some point if you ever did miss taking your medication again. But from now on, that was highly doubtful. Class proceeds as usual, and when the bell finally rings, everyone starts packing up. The teacher leaves in moments, leaving you to try and gather your things. Then...</span></div></div>",

When your sight returns you are surprised to see that you had yet to shrink any more.  The sensation seemed to pass and you tried to relax a little.  You were now fighting a bit of a headache and the sound of your schoolmates bumping around in the hallway seemed like it would make you feel worse.  You decided to sit for a moment and collect yourself before heading out.  As you stood up to leave you noticed that everyone had already left, except for the dark-haired girl you noticed before.  She was looking down at her desk but there was nothing on it.  Her face looked a bit red and she had a nervous expression on her face.   She looked up at you as you walked to the door but quickly looked back down when she caught your eyes.  She seemed really shy, but you couldn't help but think she was kinda cute.  You felt the twinge again suddenly and it made you stop mid step in the doorway. You realized that you likely didn't have much time left so you began to book it back to your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you made it outside that you noticed that you forgot to take your bag with you, the bag that you had you new room key in.  You wanted to kick yourself at your absentmindedness.  You were so focused on getting back to your pills that you neglected to make sure that you could even get into your room.  You turned around and began running back up the stairs.  You felt the twinge again, even stronger this time.  You tried to resist at you continued to climb the stairs.  You staggered down the hallway looking for the 3-3 class sign.  You saw 2-3, then 2-2, and then you realized your error.  You got off of the stairs too soon and only got up to the second floor.  It was too late now.  You felt severe nausea as you began shrinking rapidly.  By the time it stopped you were the size of a bug.  You cursed you luck and your own stupidity.  If you had managed to avoid any one of your errors you might have gotten your medication, or at least your phone to call for help.  Stupid pocketless uniforms.  Now you were stuck on the second floor of a strange new school.  There was no way you could climb up to your bag and it would take forever to get to your room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could figure out what to do, you heard what sounded like footsteps.  The rhythm wasn't consistent with someone walking but it did sound like shoe on floor.  You looked towards the noise and saw the dark-haired girl from your class, only now she was a hundred times bigger.  She was walking very strangely, was that her issue?  She was looking intently at the ground, more hopping than walking.  You didn't really want to share your condition with people, if you had your pills at all times you might have been able to finish the year without incident.  Given the situation though she was your best chance for getting back to normal.  She was getting closer and you began waving and calling out to her.  You see her look towards you, and then you saw her foot heading right for you.  Terrified, you tried to scramble back to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A deafening crash of rubber on tile rings out and you feel a wave of air rush over you as the giant foot lands right where you were standing before.  Your heart was pounding from the near-death experience.  Over your heavy breathing you heard a high-pitched gasp from above.  You looked up to see a big, purple eye looking right at you.  You picked yourself up and called out to the giantess, \"Hey!  Down here!\"  Her eye twitched in surprise, a look you had seen a few times before when people found you.  She bent down closer, giving you a look up her skirt.  You snap out of your gaze as you notice that she stuck out her hand for you to climb onto.  You step up to her finger and notice something different.  There was a large amount of scarring on the side of her hand.  You finish pulling yourself up and crawl into her palm so she doesn't drop you.  Gravity pressed you into her soft skin as she raised you up to her face, something that always happened when strangers handled you.  She brought you very close to her face as she was still trying to figure out what you were.  From here you could see her entire face like a movie screen, including what was behind her hair.  The entire right third of her face was covered with scar tissue and it looked like it ran down further.  You can't help but feel a little creeped out by the sight, especially this close up. Fortunately you seem to be too small for her to see the look on your face.  You decide that you'd best try to make friends with your classmate now that your life was literally in her hands.  \"Hi,\" You call out as friendly as you can.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're the n-new boy, aren't you?\" She stammers, almost not believing the words coming out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's me.  I'm Nick,\" You introduce yourself to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know.  I'm i-in your class,\" She replies meekly.  Suddenly she moves her hand away from her face and lets out a sharp gasp.  Crap, did she see you looking somewhere you shouldn't have been?  She looks around franticly before moving to a table on the side of the hallway.  She turns her hand at an angle and begins shaking a bit.  The unexpected motion causes you to tumble off her hand and onto the hard surface.  It takes you a moment to pick yourself back up as you try to figure out what happened.  You see that she was still looking at you but from an arms length away.  Guess she really is shy.  \"Sorry.  What... what h-happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like talking about your condition, but you couldn't really avoid it when people bore witness to it.  \"Well I sorta... I guess you could say that this is the reason I'm here at Yamaku.  I shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks on at you, her visible eye so bright that you could see your own reflection.  \"You... shrink?\" She parrots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" You sigh frustrated.  \"I forgot to take my medication and I had an episode in class.  Sometimes I just lose a few inches.  Sometimes it's... this.\"  You throw up your hands to accentuate your point.  \"I'm glad you spotted me before I got stepped on by someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stepped on?\" She repeats in a scared voice.  An unhappy look appears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you take me back to the classroom, I could really use a hand,\" You ask.  This girl seemed nice so you figured she was sure to help you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" She stammers, clearly conflicted by something.  \"I...\"</span></div></div>",

Please!\"  You don't know if she heard you but after another second she is gone.  You sigh and wonder what went wrong.  At least you didn't have to worry about getting stepped on up here.  You look around the table and find it completely barren.  The seats are wood and about a full foot below you, the floor another few feet below that.  You then realized your new predicament.  You were now stranded on the table.  If the floor was carpet or there was something soft to fall on you could jump off but if you fell that far at your current size onto something hard, you'd probably break a leg, or worse.  You cursed your luck and try to replay the conversation over in your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to say how long you were there but the light coming in from the windows was diffidently setting.  A few students walk through the hall but they are to engrossed in their own conversations to notice your tiny pleas for help.   You start to run out of hope.  You were getting hungry and tired.  With nothing better to do, You lie down on the hard table and try to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a soft, almost angelic voice call out your name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nick, a-are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the voice again.  Someone was talking to you.  You pick yourself up and open your eyes to see your dark-haired classmate again.  \"You came back?\" You ask, still a bit out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods sheepishly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes and look around.</span></div></div>",

I don't like it...when other people...look at me. They often think...I'm a monster or demon...and that i deserve to die.\" Hearing her talk about herself like that was depressing.

I can stand you...looking at me because...i don't have to worry...about you hurting me.\" Is that what she was worried about? Because she thought you were going to hurt her because she looked different? Boy she was more shy than you thought she was. But it was good that she found someone she could call a friend. Even better, that someone was you. And now you could get her to help you out even.</span></div></div>",

She seems to have calmed down a bit.  \"Do you live in the b-boy's dorm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I forgot my key in my bag back in the classroom,\" You confess.  \"We'll need to head there first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.  It's just up another floor,\"  She tells you, clearly not fully realizing that you were going to need help getting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but, would you mind giving me a lift?\" You ask carefully, unsure if this might cause her to bolt off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fears were partially right as she diffidently reacted as though you had just asked something very shocking.  She clutches her hands and starts staring a hole into the floor.  \"Um...  mmmm...... sure.  Of course.  Sorry.\"  She looked like she was going to pass out.  Maybe she was afraid of physical contact, or boys.  She slowly reached out her hand to you much like when she got you off of the floor.  This time though she used her left hand.  There was no visible scaring on this hand, not that you cared which hand she used.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you in tow, she began walking towards the staircase.  Her movements were slow and deliberate, likely due to her nervousness.  You didn't mind at all though, as her slow movements made the trip much easier on you.  It might not be fast for a normal sized person but when you got this small, relativity made a simple stroll feel like you were on top of a speeding car.  She was holding you close to her stomach.  You could hear it churning away like mad, again likely due to her nervousness.  Her face was blocked by her modest breasts.  They bounced slightly as she stepped up the stairs.  You blush and are glad that she can't see you right now.  It had been a while since you were this close to a girl your age, and she was pretty cute past the scars and excessive shyness.  Before long you were at your classroom.  She opens the door and moves to your desk.  You see that you bag is...</span></div></div>",

The look on your new friend's face however was one of worry.  Was she perhaps a delinquent?  From what this skittish lady has shown you so far though the seemed unlikely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you could show me to the student council room is?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumps a little as if you woke her from deep though.  Even after that she doesn't respond right away.  \"O-okay,\" She finally says, a note of discomfort in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask why she seems so bothered, your view is blocked out by her other hand.  Your world went dark and you felt your carrier began moving again.  After a short walk, she moved her hand and allowed you to see that you were at your requested destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" A quiet voice whispers behind you.  Turning around you find that you had been brought up to her breasts.  Her face was quite close and she was speaking very softly.  \"The s-student council... can be difficult to work with.  The president... likes to u-used people in t-the name of 'helping the school as a whole'.  She also... umm... doesn't like m-my f-friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked scared but you could hardly do this on your own.  \"I want you to know that I really appreciate this Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hanako!\" She quickly interjects.  \"Y-you can call me Hanako, Nick.\"  She blushes and looks away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intimate moment between the two of you is interrupted by the sound of the door in front of you opening.  Hanako lets out a gasp and quickly covers you back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikezawa?\" A booming, somewhat familiar voice cries out.  \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I... ummm,\" Was all Hanako could reply with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me that Satou sent you here on business she couldn't be bothered with.  Boy Shicchan that's not very hospitable.  Ikezawa is still our classmate.  Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden jerking motion tells you that Hanako was just yanked into the room and from this person's odd way of speaking, it sounded like someone else was there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now *Clap* to what do we owe this surprising, late visit to the student council to Ikezawa?\" the loud voice continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell that Hanako was nervous as you could feel her hand shaking beneath you.  After some stammering, she finally got out, \"I... need to get... a b-bag  from... l-lost and found.\"  She was so quiet compared to this new girl that you could barely hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A forgotten bag?  Well we did find a bag in our classroom today but it belongs to that new kid, right Shicchan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's the one... that I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shicchan says that lost items can only be picked up by the person who they belong to.  Trying to find out things about the new boy?  Looking for an edge so you can win his heart?  WAHAHA~\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken off guard by the roaring laugh .  Even if you weren't tiny it seemed like it would rattle your bones.  It was then you remembered the voice.  It belonged to one of your classmates, the one with the pink drill hair.  You didn't speak with her but you could her from across the classroom and her choice of hairstyle was certainly eye-catching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not missing much anyway.  All that was in there was some textbooks and a set of keys.  Shicchan wants to know what you are hiding there, and now I'm curious too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, now they were suspicious.  \"I-i-it's... I-I-I...\" Hanako wasn't handling this interrogation very well.  Knowing this was only going to get worse if it went on, you tried to make your presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako!\" You shout out in hopes that she can hear you.  \"It's okay, you can show them.\"  The trembling stops and after a moment, the hand carefully shielding you began to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room lights were eclipsed by the massive head of the pink haired girl.  She looked closely at you as she tried to figure out what you were.  \"Is that... what on Earth?\"  She was understandably perplexed by what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could introduce yourself, a hand shot out from behind the side and snatched you up.  \"H-hey!\" Hanako cries out.  \"P-please be gentle with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand brought you to a gigantic set of spectacles.  Behind the glasses was a pair of piercing blue eyes that looked at you intensely.  You were quite startled by the sudden grabbing and you began to struggle out of reflex.  A look of surprise slowly replaces the stern gaze and she begins moving her free hand in a strange way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on Ikezawa?\" The pink girl asks Hanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's um... This is Nick, the new boy.  His... condition causes him to shrink.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls both look closely at you, the blue haired one poking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cut it out!\" You shout.  She doesn't react immediately, but you see the pink one flashing several hand signs before your captor stopped prodding you.  \"Would you mind giving me back to Hanako?\" You continue.  More hand signs are exchanged before a pout appears on the blue haired girl's lips.  Reluctantly, she turns to Hanako and places you back in her palm.  Hanako on the other hand looked relieved.  She cupped her hand and pulled you closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... w-we need his bag so he can take his medicine.  I-it helps him... be normal.\" Hanako states, trying to steer the focus back on the reason you came here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hanako was talking, the pink haired girl's hands were a flurry of motion.  When she finished speaking, the two girls continued moving their hands with great speed and precision, sign language maybe?  After what might have been a heated discussion, they turn to you and Hanako.  \"Forgetting your medicine is serious Nicchan,\" The pink one says while signing. \"This school is a supportive environment for those who need it but you are still responsible for your own well-being.  Because of this, the student council does not return items entered into the lost and found so easily.\"  They both are sporting mischievous smiles.  \"You need to earn your misplaced items and you can do that by...\" </span></div></div>",

Too bad you could hardly resist and Hanako was to timid to oppose them.  \"What kind of game?\" You asked suspiciously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha~ don't look so tense Nicchan,\" The loud pink haired girl bellowed.  \"The student council has a wide assortment of board games.  You will play Shicchan in the game of your choice.  If you win, you get your bag back and we send you on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I lose?\" You ask cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later.  Come on Nicchan, it's already late.  Pick a game and let the battle begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey certainly seem excited.  Whether they truly enjoyed playing games or they were thinking of what they would do to you when you lost you had no idea.  Hanako moved over to a set of shelves loaded with games.  Unfortunately, you never had much chance to play board games over the year and you had no idea of the rules of really any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you think?\" Hanako asks.  She looked down at you, clearly concerned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... I'm not really familiar with any of these,\" You confess.  \"Do you know which of these games is most reliant on luck?\"  You were only have joking about that last statement and Hanako didn't look amused.  She began scanning the boxes herself.  It didn't take long before her eyes lit up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would it be okay if... I played in Nick's place?\" Hanako asks the pink haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl gets into another silent conversation with her companion before addressing us again.  \"That's no fun Ikezawa.  Shicchan wants to get to know our newest student.  Also this is all due to his mistake so it doesn't seem right to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not his fault!\" Hanako blurts out, stunning everyone in the room.  \"Umm, I mean... I could have helped him earlier.  He... asked for my help before but...  anyway it's my fault too that we are here now.  Please, let me do this... for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two seem quite shocked at Hanako's outburst.  While they continue to wave their hands around.  Hanako picks up a game and places it on the table.  They look at the game that Hanako choose.  \"Chess huh?  Very well Ikezawa.  Shicchan respects your determination and will allow you to take Nicchan's place in this competition.  However, we must remind you that the stakes are still the same.  Also, you have to use Nicchan as your king.  Wahaha~ that's good Shicchan.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako looked at you.  Her eyes told you that she was worried that she may have made a bad decision.  \"You've got a better shot at beating her than I do Hanako.  I'm leaving it to you.\"  You tried to flash her a reassuring smile, but you aren't sure if she can see it at your size.  She perks up a little and gives you a nod before setting you on one of the squares.  You didn't know how to play chess, but you knew it was supposed to be a game for intellectuals.  It was a bit nerve-wracking as the two colossal girls set their monstrous pieces around you.  How does Hanako fair?</span></div></div>",

If we are going to still provide services for our fellow students such as running the lost and found during this trying time, we are going to make sure those who utilize them are giving back to the school by aiding the student council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, you want us to help with the paperwork?  Run an errand or something?\" You ask, sincerely hoping that they weren't going to try to take advantage of your size for their own twisted desires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of you to offer Nicchan but no,\" She continues.  \"We were actually just wrapping up for the night and heading back to the dorms when we discovered you two.  However, we are stressed and exhausted from our work and the building pressure of getting everything ready.  You can best help your school but helping us keep in tip-top shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so you want me to pamper you,\" You groan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicchan please.  This isn't going to be anything so lavish.  Shicchan and I have been running ourselves ragged.  We haven't had anything to eat all day except for junk and we're going to go straight to bed once we get home.  You're just going to do one little thing for us so that we can keep going.  We're practically relying on you Nicchan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a load.  Hanako was right to warn you, they probably try to get away with as much as they can in the name of the greater good.  Unfortunately you were not in much of a position to argue.  \"Don't you think I might be better able to help you if I was normal sized?\" You query hoping to appeal to logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk, we can't just give you our only leverage Nicchan.  You might try to weasel out of our agreement if we give you the chance.  Sorry, but we don't know what kind of person you are yet Nicchan.  Don't worry about your condition though, we'll give you something easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for that.  They diffidently wanted to play with you in your present form, something you were woefully familiar with.  With no other options, you had to relent.  \"Fine, what do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey begin another silent conversation.  You could only look on as their smiles grew larger as figured out what they could do with you.  The silence is broken by another \"Wahaha~\"  They turn to face you, \"All right Nicchan.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What?!\" Was the only thing you could manage to say to the bizarre request.  You had suspected they would try to take advantage of your unique characteristic for this task, but you didn't expect something so bold.  \"You are out of your damn mind if you think I'm going to let you put me in your mouth!  I'm <b>not</b> going to get eaten today thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahaha~ Nicchan, please don't be so dramatic.  We care very deeply about the well being of our fellow students.  The last thing we want to to hurt you, let alone kill you.  Shicchan says that she has some food stuck in her teeth and she just can't get it out by herself.  You know how popcorn is right, it gets in there and sometimes you can't even brush it out for days?  Well she had a bag earlier and she still has some stubborn kernels that are wedging into her gums.  How can you expect her to get everything ready for the festival if she has to endure this constant irritation?  She's just going to pop you in, let you work, let you out, and then you can take a quick look at mine!\"  Pink punctuates this by flashing you a big, toothy grin.  You look over at Blue and she appears significantly more curious than in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look back up at Hanako, though you weren't really sure what she could do to help at this point.  You met her big, purple eyes as she was already looking right at you.  This time though, she didn't look away, allowing you to see her face.  Her scarring was quite extensive and went down to her neck.  It probably didn't stop there if her hand was any indication.  You wondered how long she had had it, if she had ever been made fun of or taken advantage of because of her condition.  You let out a sigh and looked back at the student council.  Before you could tell them to get it over with, you heard a tiny voice from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let m-me do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all looked to Hanako, causing her to flinch at suddenly becoming the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dangerous... to make Nick do this.  Please Misha, ask Shizune if she will let me help in his place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako...\" Was all you could really say.  You were touched that this girl that you barely know, with noticeable social anxiety, would stand up for you like this.  The student council also seemed shocked by this interjection and begin conversing again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat?!  Come on, that's not fair Shicchan,\" Misha wines.  A stern look and some more hand movements seem to indicate that Misha didn't like Shizune's decision.  After another moment, they turn back to you.  \"Shicchan agrees to let you two split the work.  This way it will get done faster.  Ikezawa will do me...\" Misha pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeaning that Shizune will get you all to herself.  You were glad that Shizune at least lightened your workload but it also made it clear that you weren't going to talk your way out of this.  \"Fine, you win.  Let's get this over with.\"  Hanako looks worried but you try to put on a brave face and flash her a reassuring smile.  She gulps, nods, and moves over to Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune plucks you from Hanako's hand and looks at you like a cat that cornered a mouse.  She didn't waste much time before showing you where you were going.  Her lips parted silently and the temperature began to rise as a warm, humid wind rolled out.  Her teeth were quite white and straight.  While she doesn't have to worry about people seeing them very often with her not talking, she certainly seemed to take good care of her chompers.  As she brought you closer you felt more and more intimidated.  It was very unlikely that they would hurt you, at least on purpose, but there was something unnerving about being at the mercy of another's body.  You passed through the threshold and dropped a short distance to the tongue where you promptly fell on your face.  The soft impact didn't hurt but if felt super gross and wet.  You pushed against the wiggling muscle as you tried to stand but only succeeded in tumbling over.  You had almost forgotten what it was like to be completely covered in a near stranger's saliva.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWahaha~ looks like fun in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back and see a big, golden eye looking down at you framed by a set of smiling lips.  Looks like Misha was enjoying your slapstick moment and Shizune could feel you moving around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on, leave him alone,\" You hear Hanako say from somewhere you couldn't see.  You then see Misha move away as Hanako stepped in between them.  You couldn't see her face, but you could see her long, dark hair.  She probably didn't want to see you like this and you were a bit glad she didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the peanut gallery distracted, you scanned the interior of your student council president.  Her breath was pretty stale and ripe with the scent of assorted junk foods.  The salty air burned your eyes a bit but you managed to endure it.  You could in fact see some bits of popcorn kernels wedged in between several of her teeth.  Eager to get out as fast a possible, you made your way around and struggled to remove the leftover food.  Each piece was about half as big as you, but with your tiny fingers you were able to get a good grip on them.  Eventually, you manage to yank out all of the bits that you could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I think I'm done in here.  Get me out of here!\" You shout out to your host.  No response other than your own echo, the rushing of her lungs, and the not so far off rumbling of her belly.  \"HEY!\"  You call out louder.  Still no reaction, not even a tormenting laugh.  Wait... was she deaf?  That would explain the hand signs and the fact that she had yet to say a word to you.  You could wait for Misha to check on you, but you were sick of soaking in your classmate's spit.  You grab one of the kernels you removed and poke a pointy bit into her tongue, hoping to at least get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do get a reaction this time, but not the one you were expecting.  Her tongue begins to move lower, squishing down as far as it could go.  The sudden terrain shift caused you to slide to the lowest part in the middle.  A finger came in but not to give you a lift.  The digit went to the back side and pointed out one piece that you missed.  You groan and climb up the slimy flesh to get the spot you missed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you reached out to get the last of the junk stuck in her teeth, there was an unexpected shift in gravity.  The slick tongue you were standing on went completely vertical and you plummeted towards Shizune's dark throat.  Before you could even react, you collided with her uvula and triggered a reflexive swallow.  You tried to grab hold of something to stop your decent, anything at all, but there was nothing in reach other than frictionless wet flesh.  You tried to cry out, but the clamping of the throat muscles smashed the air out of your lungs before you could utter a peep.  You had one last look at the outside world before you were completely engulfed by the esophagus.  The florescent lights of the classroom shinned in, framed by a gasping jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressing of peristalsis was an unreal experience.  The kneading of the slimy, warm, supple flesh made it hard to tell where your body ended and Shizune's began.  You could hear the whooshing of her lungs above you, the squirming of the bowels below, and the pounding of her heart right next to you.  The incredible thumping seemed like it was speeding up.  You had more important things to worry about than her heart rate though as you soon felt the pressure release from your legs.  You fell a short distance into a pool of sickly brown liquid.  The pool had a strange current in it that seemed to be pushing in every direction.  You couldn't see, but you could feel tiny bits of what must be food swirling around in the soupy mixture.  When you finally broke the surface to get some much needed air, your nose was stabbed with a horrid stench.  Seeing as you were swimming in vomit, you shouldn't have been surprised that it smelled like it too.  As you tried to stay above the surface while gagging, you realized that your skin was feeling itchy.  Digestion.  Was it really kicking in so quickly?  You didn't have the luxury of sitting around in your classmate's stomach all day.  You had to get out NOW!  You strained your lungs to take in enough of the caustic air to scream out, \"HELP!  GET ME OUT OF HERE!\"  If you weren't in such a panic, or at least been at school for longer than a day, you might have remembered that your plea was falling on ears that were actually deaf.  You tried to swim to the stomach walls so that you could pound on them and get out of the acid.  At your size however you were no match for the randomly churning waves.  It took everything you had just to stay floating so you were at the total mercy of the human digestive process.  You weren't the new transfer student here, just another scrap of meat.</span></div></div>",

A wad of indeterminable food smashed into you and forced you under.  Was this the end?  The foul juices stun your eyes so you forced them shut tight.  The movement and noise around you continued to intensify and you realized that resisting was pointless.  With no other option, you held your breath and waited for whatever was going to happen.  What you felt next was not your life slipping away, or even your flesh being ripped from your bones, but a hard impact on a cool surface.  What's more, you no longer felt the pushing and pulling of the stomach walls.  Hell, you weren't even floating anymore.  Confused, you wiped the slime from your eyes so you could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that him?\" A loud, familiar voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see the giant figures of your student council looking down at you.  Before you can muster the energy for a response, Shizune reaches down and scoops you up from the puddle of vomit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God it is!  Oh God Nick I'm so sorry!\" Misha cries out.  She sounded like she was fighting back tears.  Shizune looked down at you with a hard to read expression.  It was like a mix of shock, discomfort, stress, and relief.  She brought you in closer to her chest as she reached for something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm ok,\" You say weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune lightly drapes a handkerchief next to you, giving you an opportunity to wipe her sick off.  You gladly take her offer and begin rubbing the corner of the cloth all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all happened so fast,\" Misha continues.  \"I coughed and startled Ikezawa which made her jump back into Shicchan and knocked her over and she swallowed and... and... oh Nicchan!\"  Misha couldn't stop a few tears from coming out, she was too worked up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like the brush with death was an accident seeing how upset they were and the fact that they got you out.  Shizune bent over you a bit more, a small smile creeping over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikezawa, he's ok.  We got him out alright,\" Misha says to someone behind you.  She tapped Shizune on the shoulder and signs something to her.  Shizune turns around and you see Hanako.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't look good.  Hanako was sitting against the wall, curled up in a fetal-like position.  She didn't seem to be responding.  Shizune walks over to her and holds you out for her to see.  What little bit of her face you could see behind her hair had a look that reminded you of sheer terror.  \"Hanako,\" You call out to her.  Her visible eye looks down at you.  \"I'm ok  I'm going to be ok.\"  You give her a tired smile and use a strained, reassuring voice.</span></div></div>",

Your throat was burning, likely due to the acidic fumes you had been exposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikezawa, are you OK?\" Misha asks from somewhere behind Shizune.  \"Everything's going to be alright, Nick is safe and were going to take you guys back to your rooms.\"  She appears beside you and gives Hanako a light shake.  Hanako however remains inactive.  \"Oh no, we really did it this time,\" Misha sighs.  She signs something to Shizune.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Shizune takes one of Hanako's hands and pries open her fingers.  Before you could ask Misha what they were doing, you found yourself being dumped into Hanako's tense palm.  As soon Shizune lets her go, Hanako snaps her hand back to her chest and her fingers close around you.  You were startled by the sudden darkness but fortunately, her grip wasn't crushing you.  You could feel her body trembling.  Her breathing was shallow and her heartbeat was elevated.  A film of cool sweat glazed her soft hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK in there Nicchan?\" You hear from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine,\" You reply, hoping that your words won't be too muffled.  \"Just give us a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a the grip around you tighten a bit as Hanako gave you a small squeeze.  You couldn't move much, but you didn't feel unsafe in her warm embrace.  You just stayed there with this giant, scared girl as she seemed to gradually calm down.  Soon enough, her fingers pealed away and the classroom was again visible.  You looked up and saw that Hanako was looking right at you and her expression had finally changed.  It still wasn't a happy face, but it was better than the hopeless look she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you hear a familiar voice.  \"Let me help you up Ikezawa.  I'll escort you two back to your rooms.  Shicchan is going to stay behind and clean up.\"  Misha holds out her hand for Hanako to grab, but she doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Hanako,\" You say trying to sound supportive.  \"I think we've all had enough for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight nod, so slight that it was probably only visible to someone your size, was the only reaction you got.  She slowly reached for Misha's hand and rose from the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... who's room should we go to first?  Nicchan?\"  </span></div></div>",

Plus, seeing you returned to your normal height might help put her at ease.  You gave Misha directions and slowly made your way to the boys' dorms.  Hanako silently cradled you in her hands the entire way.  Misha fished your key out of the bag and opened your door.  Your room was very plain, most of your things were still in boxes and you hadn't had any time to decorate.  Your medicine was right on your nightstand, you really had no excuse for forgetting it.  Misha opened it for you, got a drop on her finger, and let you lick it off.  The medicine was fast acting and withing moments, your body began to tingle and expand.  You tumbled out of Hanako's hands as your weight quickly became too much for her to handle.  You picked yourself up and thankfully found yourself a few inches taller than your classmates.  Misha was in awe of what she just witnessed while Hanako's face was still blank.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako...\" You say softly trying to get her attention.  \"We did it.  I'm back to normal.  I'm safe now.\"  You reached out to put a hand on her shoulder when she suddenly leaned into you.  Her now tiny hands clung to your shirt and your face was buried in her hair.  She smelled lovely.  As you moved to put your arms around her, she suddenly jumped back and clutched her face.  \"Hanako?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisha, trying her best to stifle her laughter spoke up, \"Nicchan, I'm glad you are better and I'm sure you're tired, but you should really consider taking a shower.  You stink, really bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting yourself you finally noticed that your white uniform shirt had been dyed a sickly brown color.  Everything you were wearing was going to have to go straight into the trash, even your shoes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ikezawa, let's leave Nicchan alone for now.  I'll take you to your room OK?\"  Misha puts her hand on Hanako and started leading her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take to you in class tomorrow, OK Hanako?\" You call out before they go.  She looks back at you for a moment.  She looked tired, but better than she did before.  She didn't give you and answer, or at least not one you could hear.  As soon as they were out of sight, you grabbed your soap and spent a good bit of time in the shower.  You didn't want to think about  how many bacteria you had been swimming with today but you scrubbed until the bar was unusable.  With that you put your medicine in your bag and crashed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't sleep very well that night as nightmares plagued your dreams.  Shadows towering over you, hunting you.  They would catch and devour you before doing it all over again.  Your screams made them laugh and they would taunt you and your powerlessness.  Perhaps today's experience had effected you more deeply than you first though.  Eventually, your alarm saved you from the terrors and you woke up coated in sweat.  You collected your thoughts and reluctantly got your things together to go to class.  It was fortunate you didn't have any homework due yet as you were not up for doing anything mentally strenuous.  You forced down some breakfast in the cafeteria but you felt extremely uneasy the entire time.  For some reason, you couldn't look at any of the fellow students while they were eating.  You could barely even look at your food.  You left before you began to feel too sick and flopped down at your desk, remembering which floor it was on this time.  You watched your classmates gradually file in.  Does Hanako show up for class this morning?</span></div></div>",

When the brightly colored Student Council entered, you buried your head in your arms to avoid them.  Fortunately, they seemed to take the hint and didn't bother you.  You were in no mood to deal with them any time soon.  You sat there with your head on your desk, zoning out to the chatter of your classmates in the background.  The room eventually got quiet, probably because the teacher had arrived.  You picked yourself up and saw a flash of purple to your left.  It was Hanako, and it seems that she was watching you sit there.  Before you could try to engage her, the teacher began his lecture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so out of it that you could barely pay attention to the scientific discussion.  Having just transferred, you had yet to firmly establish what you needed to know for your classes to be caught up with everyone.  The fact that you didn't get a chance to study or sleep well last night only compounded the problem.  You looked over at Hanako, only for her to quickly look away from you again.  Was she embarrassed about last night?  Was she scared of you now that you weren't bite-sized?  Whatever it was, see still seemed to have some kind of interest in you as she kept looking over at you throughout the class.  Before you knew it, the lunch bell rang and everyone quickly packed up to go.  Hanako was wasting no time too, barely giving you a chance to call out to her before she started heading for the door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako, hang on a sec.\"  She froze at the sound of your voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't respond until everyone else had left.  \"N-Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really know what to say.  You wanted to talk with her, but what did you even want to say?  Yesterday was so crazy and she seemed as skittish  as a terrified doe.    \"Umm... I'm glad to see you.\"  The silence that followed was torturous.  This was really awkward.  \"I-I was hoping we could talk.  I mean... unless you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... OK,\" She finally responds.  She sits back down at her desk, still making an effort to cover her scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" You start, really unsure what you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbles something that you think was, \"Fine.\"  She looks up at you and asks, \"Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say you were doing great, but that wouldn't be the truth.  With how much she kept looking at you during class, she was likely worried if she was asking.  \"I'm just kind of tired.  I hoping it was just due to a bad dream and not my new mattress,\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad dream?\" She echoes, her face showing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll be fine tonight,\" You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look convinced.  \"Was it, like yesterday?  Did you have a nightmare about... what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were pleading, there was no way you could hide the truth from that look.  \"Kinda, yeah.\"  You described the dream to Hanako, her face was serious as you went into as much detail as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... are you just tired?  I-is there anything else bothering you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the nail on the head again.  You described how uncomfortable you were at breakfast with everyone eating around you.  As you revisited these thoughts, you started to feel more tense and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick...\" Her sweet voice grabs your attention.  \"Last night must have been really scary.  I'm... I'm not a therapist but, I think... you might have been traumatized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words hit you hard, but thinking about it, it made sense.  Were you going to be uncomfortable around people eating forever?  Were you going to jump every time her heard someone's stomach growl?  And what were you going to do the next time you shrunk, because it was going to happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick!\"  Again, her voice snaps you back to reality.  She looks very serious.  \"It might not be too late.  If you take certain steps early enough, you can get over it before...\" She trails off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako seems like she's speaking from experience.  You haven't seen the full extent of her scarring but if she was at this school, it was likely serious.  Whatever had caused it was likely a horrible experience.  The healing alone would have been another ordeal on top of that.  Was her inability to get over her own trauma what led to her shyness?  Was she trying to save you from the same fate?  \"I think you are right Hanako.  Thank you for telling me this.\"  She blushes visibly and falls back a bit behind her hair.  \"I don't want to be scared.  What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\"  She fidgets.  \"If talked with a lot of people about... things like this.

Sure enough, a few seconds later you felt a light tap and quickly spun around.  What you saw terrified you.  A wet, dark, gasping pit surrounded by sharp boulders and guarded by a massive serpent.  You yelped out in fear and fell backwards, hitting the floor shoulders first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!\" Hanako cries out.  \"Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reopened your eyes to see her standing over you, looking like she was about to cry.  You were not happy with her little trick but you quickly suppressed those thoughts at the idea making her feel worse.  \"Ugh, yeah I'll be OK.  You... startled me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"  She looks away as she apologizes.  \"I... I just had to test something, and I was right.  You can't even look at someone's mouth without getting scared, can you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been trying to not think about it but given the new data, that did seem to be the case.  \"I... I guess that might be it.  So what... I ask Shizune to let me clean her teeth until it stops freaking me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head again.  \"I don't think so.  You need someone you can feel safe with.  Maybe a nurse, or caretaker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour folks were on the other side of the country so that was a no go.  Plus there was something unappealing of the idea about doing something like that with one of them.  The only nurse you'd met so far didn't really rub you the right way either.  Plus he might not be on board with such an unusual treatment plan.  This school was for dealing with physical problems, not mental.  Someone you trusted huh?  \"H-Hanako?  Are you sure about all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sunk back a little, \"I'm... I... I don't know.  I know... being afraid of things doesn't help though.  If... you let your fear control you...\"  She pauses for several seconds.  But you think you understand.  Her fear has probably effected her as much as her scarring.  The difference is that one can be cured, but it wouldn't be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.  Thank you Hanako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems surprised by you praise as she snaps out of her thoughts.  She blushes, \"Y-you're welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you, help me do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" She asks, visibly tensing up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you... I'm sorry this is so weird to say... let me use your mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" She shrieks.  An oddly shocked reaction to what was really her idea.  \"M-m-m-me?  W-w-why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the people you suggested don't really work for me, you came up with the idea so you might know best how we should do this, you already know more about the situation than anyone else, and... well... I'm still new here and you are my only friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Friend?</font>\" You barely heard her repeat that part to herself.  Her face turned even redder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only other option is the Student Council.  You don't want me to deal with them again do you?\" You teased.  Her mind was clearly racing as she squirmed in her seat.  If the situation wasn't so awkward it might be kind of funny.  \"Please Hanako, I need your help.  You're the only one here I can trust here.  I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she seems to calm down, but she still hides behind her flowing hair when she finally answers, \"O-ok.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" was really the only reply you could think of.  You knew this school would be a bit different, but this was not a turn you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How.. do we do this?  Do I need to lift you up like before?\" Hanako asks, still trying to get her thoughts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not now at least.  I don't have any control over my shrinking.  It just happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she replies, a hint of relief in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I usually only get a few moments warning before-\" Your explanation was cut off by that old tingling sensation.  \"Well speak of the devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Hanako asks, not realizing what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel it coming on, a shrinking episode.  I guess this is good timing for once in my life,\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako was less amused by this revelation.  \"Eh!  You're shrinking?!  What do I do?  Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.  Just keep an eye on me so you don't lose track of me, I have know idea how small I'm going to get.\"  Hanako looks at you as intently as she can, all while still looking worried.  You could easily grab you medicine, but she was right.  You needed to do this for your own good.  When the tingling stopped, you had shrunk...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pick yourself up from the plastic floor that was once your seat, still warm from your own former presence.  Hanako was staring at you, a look of wonder on her face similar to when she first found you.  She crouched down and leaned forward, subconsciously allowing her breast to rest on your chair.  She seemed to be at a loss for words so you decided to get thing rolling.  \"Well, I'm tiny.  Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  O-ok.  R-r-right.  Um, are you... s-sure?\"  Her words say she still concerned but her voice was more that of someone who was flustered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched Hanako's lips as she spoke, you could feel anxiety well up from inside.  The twisting, choking fear gave you pause.  There was still away out.  Hanako would surely oblige you if you wanted to bail and take your medicine.  But what about the next time, or the time after that?  \"I... have to.  I'm s-scared Hanako.  I n-need to... don't... let me...\"  You forced yourself to look at the ground, your arms shaking and your voice quivering as you tried to form words.  Then, you felt a warm, gentle pressure on your head.  She was ruffling your hair with her finger with a touch so light, it was as if she wasn't dozens of times bigger than you.  The tension immediately drained from your body at the simple comforting act.  You looked up as she retracted her digit, her face was bright red, but her eyes looked so tender.  \"I'm ready.  Can you give me a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods silently and extends her palm for you to use as a platform.  You were a bit bigger than yesterday, so it was much easier to step up and deal with the movement as she brought you to her face.  Warm air blew from her nostrils onto you as you slowly walked towards the mouth.  The cavity was only slightly opened, likely so the sight didn't overwhelm you.  As you gazed at her soft, plump lips, you couldn't help but feel a hint of arousal.  When you reached out to them, she let out a tiny gasp at your touch, allowing a wave of her breath to be released.  The wind was warm with a cool, minty edge to it.  The strange duality of temperature reminded you of a summer breeze.  As you slowly pushed her lips further apart, she allowed her jaw to drop.  With the oral cavity fully exposed to you now, you couldn't help but stand there and look.  It was impossible to not compare the cave to that of your student council president's.  The most obvious difference was that it seemed much smaller, but that was simply due to the fact that you had not shrunk as much.  At you current size, you were going to be a bit of a mouthful for your current host.  Hanako's teeth were fairly straight and mostly white, but not perfect.  At least they were clean.  You figured that going in feet first would be less scary as you'd be able to see the outside world instead of staring down her esophagus. You stepped one foot onto her tongue.  Unsurprisingly, it squished under your foot and wasn't very stable.  You steadied yourself with her lips as you brought in your other foot, sliding along the slick surface.  You realized a moment too late that you were about to ruin another set of clothes, not to mention your last pair of shoes.  Thinking about it though, it seemed unlikely that Hanako would have agreed to do this if you were naked, though the idea caused your pants to tighten a bit.  You spun yourself around, using her front teeth to push yourself all the way in.  Your shirt came un-tucked in the process, allowing Hanako to get an unplanned taste of your tummy.  A feminine coo rattled up from behind you as the flesh around you shook.  The wiggling muscle was slimy on your bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were inside Hanako's mouth.  Soggy, pink flesh encased you and sharp teeth flanked you.  Clear drool was dripping at an impressive rate from every surface.  The air was hot and humid, but also fresh and pleasant smelling.  You'd have to ask Hanako later what toothpaste she used because it seemed to be long lasting.  Her heartbeat was surprisingly audible over the ambient mouth noises.  It sounded quite fast for someone just sitting down.  She must be nervous too.  This was actually going pretty well, until a familiar groaning rumbled up from below.  Hanako's stomach was growling.  You hadn't given her a chance to eat lunch and now her stomach wanted something to digest.  Anything.  Even you.  You wrapped your arms around the tongue in a death grip so as to not get sucked down into the lake of pure acid within the depths of this body.  You had to get out, but if you let go, you'd surely be doomed.  It was only a matter of time before the saliva slicked muscle shook you loose.  You closed you eyes and waited for the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you felt next wasn't the sting of acid, but a sobering stroke of your hair.  Hanako could feel your panicked cling and wanted to remind you that she was there.  She was doing this to help you get over your fear, not to fill her gut.  You were able to calm down, lightening your squeeze from bear hug, to genuine hug.  Her stomach continued to churn and saliva continued to dribble, but you didn't feel any fear.  You probably could have exited at this point and been all better, but the idea simply didn't occur to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you both heard the sound of footsteps that you snapped out of your little worlds.  With someone entering the classroom and you still shrunk and inside her, Hanako closed her mouth.  It was fortunate you had calmed down, or you might have freaked out.  Who came in?</span></div></div>",

The sound of the warning bell going off a moment later confirmed that class was about to start up again.  Apparently time flies when you face your fears.  It seemed like only a few minutes ago you were fondling Hanako's massive lips.  Whatever the case, people were here and that complicated things.  Hanako was smart to hide you, but you kind of wished she'd had a chance to spit you out.  Too late now.  You were small, but perhaps a little too big for amateur sleight of hand.  The noise of activity settled and the muffled voice of your teacher was audible... time to try and get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her jaw shut, Hanako's mouth was much more cramped.  As the time marched on, the heat became more stifling now that you no longer had a direct breeze.  You could feel yourself sweating despite the staggering humidity.  Her saliva was pooling underneath the undulating tongue even faster than before.  Just as you began to worry about drowning, you were pressed up into the hard pallet.  A gulp echoed in the dark chamber along with a wet sucking sound.  The tongue returned to its resting position and you realize that you were just witness to a simple swallow.  The draining and bubbling sounds from below, while a little gross, were not nearly as scary as the would have been earlier.  Guess that just goes to show that the treatment worked.  You'd have to really thank Hanako when she finally got a chance to let you out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you felt that Hanako was moving.  What was she doing?</span></div></div>",

Within a minute, you were blinded by the light of the outer world and felt yourself sliding forward.  You landed on what appeared to be her bag in a small puddle of spit.  Once your eyes got used to the light, you were able to see that you were in the school library.  As you looked back to find Hanako, you barely managed to see her placing an open book over you like a tent.  Caught off guard by the unexpected act, Hanako managed to get the first word in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'msorryineedaminute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it sounded like she scampered away, but you were unable to see her from beneath the pages.  Seems like you had accidentally pushed her top her limit.  You just hoped that she would be returning as she had yesterday.  Your hopes were realized when you heard her flop down on a near by beanbag.  Peaking out, you saw that she was burying her face in a book.  Guess she just needs some alone time to recharge her nerves.  Figuring that you had bothered her enough for the moment, you retreated back into the dark shelter she had thrown on top of you.  Honestly, you didn't mind some private time yourself after what you had just been through.  It was a strange experience being in a girl's mouth.  You closed your eyes and reflected on the bizarreness  of the last two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than just a few minutes later, you felt light hitting your eyelids and woke up from your trance.  Hovering above you was Hanako, looking a bit less panicked.  Even so, a weak \"umm\" was all she could manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you were going to have to get the conversation going, you decided to keep things easy for her.  \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" She quietly responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a small nod.  \"A-are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unchewed and undigested so I'm doing great,\" You jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour joke doesn't seem to go over as well as you had hoped though as her face shows concern.  \"But... you're shivering.  Are you cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your hands, you saw that they were indeed trembling.  Pulling up your damp sleeve, you found that it was cold to the touch and your hairs were standing on end.  Between your adrenaline and introspection, you hadn't realized how much your body temperature had dropped.  Being in Hanako's hot mouth for so long, not drying off, and then sitting around in the cool library, you went from overheated to very cool in a small time frame.  \"I could use a change of clothes and some coffee honestly,\" You confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she apologizes.  \"I... I didn't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" You assure her.  While you've only known this girl for a day, you really didn't want to see her sad.  \"Did you grab my meds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... couldn't... during class... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">attention</font>...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, not only did she not get your stuff, but now you made her feel bad by reminding her.  \"Don't worry.  We'll just grab it after class.  I'll be fi- \" *achoo*  Uh oh.  That was a bad sign and Hanako realized it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...you're getting a cold.\"  She gently scooped you up.  Her hand was warm and soft, you couldn't resist laying down on her palm.  \"OH... um... i-is that... better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say \"much\" but instead you let out another sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhmmm... we need to warm you up fast.  S-should... should I put you back in... my mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that would warm you back up pretty fast.  You reply...</span></div></div>",

You know what they say about dogs' mouths being cleaner than ours...

Hanako had turned bright red and had put her free hand over her mouth.

The air was noticeably warmer as you felt yourself being moved.  A moment later, you made contact with soft flesh.  Instead of setting you down though, Hanako proceeded to wedge you into a tight gap.  Her rapid heartbeat sounded like it was right next to you.

You were speechless as a wave of emotions crashed over you.  Thinking for a moment, you decided it best to keep your mouth shut.  The last thing you want is to offend Hanako after extending this kindness to you.  \"This is just to get warm,\" You told yourself, \"she's just making sure I'm healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes went by and you had managed to get warmer.

The realization hit you too late, you were shrinking again.  You tried to yell out, but your mouth was filled with boob flesh.   You didn't have to struggle for long though, as you quickly shrank so small that you fell through her cleavage and began tumbling down her smooth belly.

Still, you were disoriented as you bounded down from literal heaven, and the trip was remarkably unstable nonetheless.  You had your front facing upwards, so you couldn't see where you were going to fall to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get your bearings, and luckily you would get an opportunity as the belly hill suddenly became air, and your heart nearly leapt out of your chest as you freefell.  Luckily for you, the drop was only around twenty feet by your standards, and the soft cushiony skin let you know that you were clearly still on your friend's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, noticing the depression you had fallen straight into.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako's bellybutton?\" you asked yourself.  It was like a cave, yet with perfectly round edges.  It was the only place you could think of that would stop your fall, at least before Hanako's.... ahem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you had had another shrinking fit.  2 inches was around the norm for what you experienced, but consecutive ones weren't impossible.  Taking shock of the situation, you judged the height of the bellybutton's walls after climbing out of the crease you were in, as well as the width. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled, cold fear overtaking you.  Your breathing turned heavy as you nearly had a panic attack.  Hanako's bellybutton was probably twenty-by twenty-five feet at your standards.  Hell, you could fit into it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those calculations, you were around one-eighth of an inch tall.  Among the smallest you've ever been.  You moved to the back, fear gripping you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see your giant friend's face just barely out of the bellybutton and through the fabric.  If she was big before, she was a colossus now.  Almost too big to describe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Calm down.  It's just Hanako!\" you told yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Run</i>\" your mind screams, your instincts desperate to take over.  Normal people were massive before, but still manageable.  At this scale, Hanako was practically a giant monster to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to quell your fear-addled mind to avoid panicking, but contemplated your next move.  From the look on her face, Hanako still thought you were nestled safely in her cleavage.  If she found out... nowhere on her would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you knew from experience that she couldn't hear you at this size.  You were so tiny, you had to get to a better vantage point.  You thought of many different plans, but one seemed to stick.  You needed to climb back up and get to her ear, fast.  But... Hanako wouldn't react well to a little man in her head, and you had no doubt you would have to go inside the ear canal to contact her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

The pale skin beneath you told you that you were still on Hanako's person, though her blouse prevented you from seeing your former perch.  You tried to move your legs but found them to be restricted by something.  A black band of fabric was showing through the white clothing above you and it seemed to be pinning your lower body into the soft flesh.  Thinking for a moment, you came to a horrifying realization.  You had fallen all the way down to Hanako's waist and were stuck halfway under her stockings.  You began trying to wiggle out, but it was hard to exert any measurable force at your new diminutive size.  It was hard to tell how small you were now, but your most generous estimate was still smaller than you were yesterday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour struggle didn't go completely unnoticed though.  Hanako felt a slight itch under her skirt and adjusted it slightly to relieve it.  She had no idea that you had fallen from her bosom and that she had just knocked you all the way into her underpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling of garments caused you to fall forward into a much darker area.  Your rolling was slowed by what felt like a wiry, rope net.  As much as you didn't want to believe it, you had ended up in Hanako's pubic hair.  Your hormones were swirling even more than before but you were still fully aware of the danger you were in.  If you couldn't get out of Hanako's unmentionables, you might end up getting flushed or sat on.  You tried pulling at the base of a hair to get her attention so she could get you out.  Unfortunatly, Hanako just jiggled her butt a bit to shake loose the irritant without a second thought.  It worked as far as she was concerned as you quickly slipped off the smooth hair.  With your eyes finally adjusting to the darkness, you found that you had landed within a stone's throw of the top of her vagina.  Hell, even if Hanako did find you now, there was no telling what kind of reaction she would have.  If she freaked out just from you seeing her face, you couldn't imagine how she'd take you seeing her privates.  The scent of her sex and heat billowing from it was almost enough to make you lose your young mind.  You had to act fast before the pheromones robbed you of what reason you had left.</span></div></div>",

Even if you found a way out of Hanako's panties, you'd still have to climb all the way up her gigantic body to have any hope of being noticed.  Your only realistic shot at survival from accidental squishing was to touch the most sensitive part of her young, soft, warm, beautiful, virgin... man those pheromones are not helping.  \"This isn't about sex,\" You tell yourself.  You aren't some perverted creep trying to score with some chick without consent, you were sick and just trying to get life-saving help from your friend.  You stepped towards the smooth hill that was her clit, slowly reaching out to touch it.  You hand made the tiniest impression in the supple flesh.  No reaction.  Guess you're going to have to get more into it.  You clutched the soft skin and climbed up, hoping that the top was more sensitive.  Your heart was pounding and taking deep breaths was only making it worse.  Your erection was pressing against your pants ,sliding up along as you made your way.  You could feel your instincts screaming at you to reproduce and it took all your focus to keep on task.  After reaching the top, you hadn't elected any reaction other than some more butt wiggles.  Out of other options, you began doing everything you could think of to stimulate the nerves.  You began rubbing, kneading, pounding, and even scratching the skin.  In the heat of the moment, you couldn't stop yourself from stealing a lick of Hanako's sex.  The somewhat salty, surprisingly sweet taste titillating your tongue forced you to moan in pleasure.  \"Come on Hanako.  Please notice me.  I'm afraid what will happen if I'm here much longer!\" You cried out into her flesh as clouds of desire flooded your brain.  You body beneath you did seem to be moving a bit more than before.  When a high pitch coo rang out from above, you knew you were on the right track.  The ground was becoming warmer, maybe even bigger?  You hugged the clitoris as hard as you could, unable to stop yourself from kissing it.  The noise of fabric shifting and increase of light drew your attention.  You were no longer alone as a massive, slightly burned hand had entered the panties.  Success... right?</span></div></div>",

It's a bit hard to hear the outside world amidst the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsounds of Hanako's innermost workings, but you don't really mind the background noise.  You may even call it soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen up for a good few minutes or so, until both you and Hanako are startled by what the teacher says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you, Miss Ikezawa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako's tongue tightens up against you in a bout of nervousness, nearly pushing the air out of your lungs.  A whimper, escalated to a roar at your size, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nerupts from her throat and passes over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Ikezawa, can you answer the question please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can picture it now.  All eyes in the room focused on Hanako, casually awaiting a response, unaware of her predicament and the shrunken guy that is <br>\r\n<br>\r\npresently crammed into her mouth.  It's tough to imagine a way out of this.  It certainly wouldn't go over well if she simply spat you out.  The rumors and <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninsults that arise from such a scene could be staggering to her.  Hanako's got enough problems without people thinking of her as a cannibal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what choice do you have?  She can't speak while you're in her mouth, and there's no other way out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, of course, through the dark pit at the back of the mouth, Hanako's throat.  You shiver just thinking of the idea, but it would let her answer the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nquestion without anyone seeing you.  The gulp would just be seen as a nervous habit, nobody would be any the wiser, and she could probably get you out before <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou run out of air or get digested.  At least, you hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to think about it further, time to act.  You gather air back in your lungs to the best of your ability and gingerly speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just... just swallow me, Hanako!  It's okay!  There's nothing else we can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe what you just said.  There's no way Hanako would actually gulp you down.  It's insane.  You consider relenting and just telling her to spit <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hanako doesn't give you the luxury of bailing out.  Her tongue finally loosens its death grip on you, only to undulate uncomfortably low behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you look back, the expanse of Hanako's throat opens, buckets of saliva streams stretching over and breaking at the opening of the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memories of being an unwilling snack to Shizune come back to you.  You're regretting this decision even more.  You don't want to be eaten!  What if she <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncan't find a way to get you out quickly enough?  What if her acids are stronger and start to break you down before you can be retrieved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're swiftly sent backwards, it occurs to you that you can't even fight this.  Hanako clearly wants to be done with the action as soon as possible, <br>\r\n<br>\r\npushing you ever more backwards with unrelenting force.  Her teeth become farther away.  Her uvula hangs overhead, marking your descent as you quickly pass <br>\r\n<br>\r\nunder it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanako's overwhelmingly powerful throat muscles take hold of you, you briefly worry about the possibility of getting stuck here at this size.  Or worse <br>\r\n<br>\r\nstill, getting smashed by the sheer force of her swallow, breaking a majority of bones and reducing you to nothing better than the cute schoolgirl's snack <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthat you are destined to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the most horrifying of your fears, you manage to get pulled through the expanse of Hanako's throat without much trouble.  You'd give credit to Hanako <br>\r\n<br>\r\nfor her persistence in the act, if you weren't in this predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, rumbling, squelching sound can be heard as you are promptly released from pressure and sent sliding down Hanako's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith, hopefully, the worst of it over, you try to relax yourself to the booming, yet somehow still cute, voice of Hanako as she finally answers the question <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring of flesh protecting the entrance to Hanako's stomach, hidden under other folds of her throat flesh, takes you by surprise, unmercifully dropping you <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninto the hot, caustic, and most importantly deadly, depths of her belly.  As you make contact with the 'floor', your face smacks hard against the shriveled, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmostly digested remains of a gummy bear, nearly knocking the wind out of you.  Bruise to the face due to falling onto the remains of Hanako's stomach, that'd <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbe a hard one to cover up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you're presently more concerned with not going the way of the poor gummy bear.  Besides that sweet treat, you find yourself nearly neck-deep in the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsludge of Hanako's previous meals.  It happens to be a good deal thicker than what you experienced in Shizune's stomach, acting much like quicksand, eager to <br>\r\n<br>\r\ndrag you down and add you to its mass, and soon after, Hanako's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a shot of adrenaline, you struggle and push against the relentless forces of Hanako's digestive system in order to keep your head exposed.  Even if <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe does get you out, this plan won't go over very well if you're smothered and snuffed out simply by the presence of the stomach contents.</span></div></div>",

It was too muffled by Hanako's cheeks for you to make out though, but it sounded feminine.  You were surprised when the tongue began to move and the lips let in some light.  Hanako's soft voice roared around you as she tried to say something, either she forgot her mouth was full or the response was reflexive.  Whatever she said, you couldn't make it out either.  Quickly realizing her error, you felt gravity shift forward and you slide out into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even start to regain your bearing, Hanako repeats herself to whoever came in.  \"I-I'm here Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are Hanako,\" You heard a beautiful voice sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe the saliva from your eyes and look towards the door to see a tall (by normal standards) blond girl smiling towards Hanako.

I wasn't... I haven't eaten anything.\" Hanako stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\"  The girl seems suspicious, but lets it go.  \"Alright, then shall we go to our usual spot?  I think a relaxing cup of tea is just what I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, umm... OK.  J-just... give me a few minutes to uh... finish this up.  You go on ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.  I'll go start setting things up.  Just come whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the girl turns around and leaves.  You and Hanako let out a collective sigh.  \"Are you OK?\" She asks as she brings you back up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,  I'm fine,\" You reply.  \"Was that a friend of yours?  We're lucky she didn't spot me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess you don't know Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head.  \"S-sorry, I forgot just how new you were here.  Most p-people know Lilly.  She's... my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to inquire further, but a glob of spit drips down from your hair onto your face.  \"Can you get me a tissue,\" You grumble as you wipe your face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako can't help but chuckle a bit as she gets up to get you something you can use to dry yourself.  You towel off, getting most of the goo but unable to dry your clothes much.  You were going to have to deal with it though as they were going to take some time to air dry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... are you r-ready to... go back to normal?\" Hanako asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances you would object to not taking your medicine as soon as possible.  Under normal circumstances you also weren't wearing clothes that were soaked in saliva.

Lilly is actually... blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh.  You had heard that there was a number of blind students here.  You couldn't help but wonder if this Lilly's condition was what allowed her to become friends with Hanako. From what you've seen so far, Hanako was extremely shy and even more so protective of her scars.  A blind person would have no idea what she looked like so Hanako didn't have to fear her judgement.  This also made things easier for you as you didn't have to stay hidden during lunch.  \"Well, that makes things a little easier.  Let's get going before we run out of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako grabs her bag and closes her hands around you.  A short walk later and she sets you down on a table in what seems to be an unused classroom.  As she set her lunchbox down next to you, Lilly walked in holding a teapot.  Now that you finally had a good look at her, you could see that she was quite beautiful, especially if she was blind.  Her long blonde hair was pulled back in a ponytail and she was even taller than Hanako.  Her eyes were a milky blue that just seemed to stare off into nothing.  She placed the teapot on the table and Hanako set down a pair of cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to pour the tea Hanako?\" Lily asks.  Her voice was lovely and hand an almost motherly tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Hanako replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she fills their cups, Lilly reaches down for her own lunch box.  They open their boxes and the wonderful smell of home-cooked food fills the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it you made today?\" Lilly asks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just some rice-balls,\" Hanako replies.  \"I tried some different spices though.  L-let me know w-what you think.\"  She places a rice-ball in Lilly's box and breaks off a small piece to give to you.  The glob was as big as your head, more than enough for a meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you,\" Lilly insists.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako ended up taking the first bite as Lilly suggested.  \"Hmmm,\" She frowns, \"came out a little bland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a bite from yours and found yourself in disagreement.  The white sticky blob of rice was quite good and fairly savory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one tastes fine to me Hanako,\" Lilly comments.  \"Maybe you must have dulled your taste with whatever you were nibbling on earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Hanako nearly choked at the revelation.  The food was bland, at least it was compared to your shrunken body.  After soaking in Hanako's saliva for several minutes, your sweaty, salty flesh was still all she could taste.  Seems like you were more flavorful than the rice in your hands.  Lilly again seemed a bit confused by her friend's strange reaction to the innocent comment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some awkward sips of tea, Lilly tries to strike up a conversation. \"So...</span></div></div>",

She looked down at you and you tried to smile back at her.  \"His n-name is...

I-if they find anything that was left behind they...\"  She pauses.  \"T-they take it to the lost and found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"I don't suppose I can ask for a lift to the lost and found?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm,\" She mutters.  She starts fidgeting with her fingers.  With you in her palm it was a little startling.  You could see that she was squeezing her hands very hard, clearly still nervous.  \"I-I don't k-know where it is.\"  Well that is unfortunate.  You had no idea yourself where it was seeing as this was your first day.  \"Sorry, I just don't lose my things so I-\"  She cuts herself off and you go shooting up as she brings her hand to her face.  \"Not that you're dumb or anything for losing your... Sorry!\"  Her sudden burst of volume and emotion shocks you.  Judging from her face it looks like she's about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" You say, trying to console her.  \"It's not your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" She shakes her head.  \"If I had h-helped you before, your bag would still be here.  I'm useless.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were looking like they were about to let loose a flood.  You weren't much of a man right now but you couldn't forgive yourself if you made this girl cry, even if she was a little overly sensitive.  \"Please don't blame yourself,\" You call out.  \"I forgot my meds, I left my bag here, I got off on the wrong floor, and...\" You have to pause for a moment, \"I'm the one with the stupid condition.  You were just the one that gave me a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you.  Her purple, misty eyes locked on you.  It was impossible to see her mouth from this close so you weren't sure what she was feeling.  You both just stood there in silence for a minute before you decided to say something.  \"I guess you could just set me on the teachers desk or something.  I'll talk to him in the morning when class starts.  He can probably help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps out of whatever daze she was in and moves her hand a bit away from her face.  \"Y-you're just gonna stay here?  All night long?\" She says in a concerned voice.  You shrug, not really having any better ideas.  She frowns and bows her head a little bit.  After another minute she speaks.  \"I can't just leave you here.  Something might happen.\"  She wasn't wrong.  If the janitors made another sweep they might throw you out.  The teacher might not spot you before crushing you under a stack of papers or someone less nice might try to play with you.  \"Um... I could take y-you to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't expect this latest development.  Your first day at your new school and you forget your meds, shrink, get discovered by the shyest person you've ever met, and now she was bringing you to her room to spend the night.  With your condition and general introvert tendencies you never got close with many girls, at least not close enough to get invited into their rooms.  Now this scared, scarred girl you just met was trying her best to help you in your time of need.  As she cupped her hand above you so as to hide you from anyone she passes in the hall you realize that you don't even know her name.  She was walking much faster now, likely more afraid of being seen by some now than her interacting with you.  Through the gap between her hands you could see part of the hall of the girls dorm as it wised by.  It seemed identical to the boys dorm aside from the fact that it smelled a little nicer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she came to a stop in front of a door.  She stood their for a while as if she was contemplating her next action.  Her hand that was covering you lifted up and she looked as though she was going to knock.  Was this her room?  The name plate next to the door said \"Satou Lilly\".  You didn't know if that was her name but it seemed a bit odd to knock on your own door.  In the end, she doesn't attempt to enter the room and instead moves down to the next door which she quickly opens.  Inside you see a small room very similar to yours.  She closed the door and locked it before dumping you on her desk.  The less than soft impact reminded you of when she ditched you before.  You could finally see her face again and she looked as red as ever.  Clearly this was not an easy ordeal for her.  Again, an awkward silence enveloped the both of you.  You tried to lighten the straining atmosphere.  \"I really, REALLY appreciate you doing all this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhm,\" Was all she could muster as a response.  She was clearly at her limit and she couldn't exactly run away anymore now that you were in her room.  You wanted to be friendly but you were afraid that she might break down from the slightest provocation.  Before you could figure out what to do next, she starts moving around her room.  She picks up a large pink piece of clothing and a basket of hygiene products.  Without a word she unlocks her door and bolts out.  It looked like she was going to wash up for bed, or maybe she was just using that as an excuse for some alone time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do you looked around the room.  The walls were white and bare.  There wasn't much there but the basic essentials, a desk, a dresser, a bed, a chair, and some shelves.  Everything was pretty neutral and nondescript.  An elegant, red doll was on one of the shelves, the only thing particularly feminine you could see.  On the desk where she left you there was a lamp, some books, and an open bag of cookies.  Your stomach growled and you remembered that you hadn't had anything to eat in half a day.  Normally you were leery about getting into other people's food whenever you shrank.  You had to worry about getting eaten, a truly terrifying though.  You figured you were safe though as she would likely be taking her time away from you.  You ended up just snacking on some crumbs near the front of the bag.  Despite being opened they still tasted fresh.  She must have opened it up between the time she found you and came back.  At your size they were enough to sate you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped the micro-crumbs from your face just as you heard the door open again.  The giant girl was back and now she was in her sleep attire.  She was draped in a huge, pink nightgown.  Her school uniform was in a ball under her arm and a towel was wrapped around her head.  What little of her face you could see was bright red, whether it was due to a hot shower or her unceasing nervousness you couldn't tell.  She put away the things she was carrying but kept the towel on her head, letting it drape down over her right shoulder.  She stares at you with a worried expression as if to say \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sleepy but you figure that this day has probably had enough excitement for both of you.  \"I think it might be best if we just went to bed,\" You say in fake tired voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok,\" she replies.  She doesn't move at all but she almost looks a little... sad?  She then lets out a cute yawn and you see that she actually was pretty tired.  Today's events must have been more stressful on her despite the fact that you were the one who nearly died.  With nothing else to do, you curl up and try to get comfortable on the hard desk.  Just as you close your eyes you hear a cooing voice.  \"You're just going to sleep there?\"  You looked back and see that she had gotten a little closer.  She looked slightly concerned, as if she was dissatisfied with your choice of mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" You try to assure her, \"it's not safe for me to sleep on the floor and I doubt you have any beds my size.  Do you?\"  You end with a joke and chuckle a bit to sound happy.  Truthfully it was going to be an uncomfortable sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look very happy with that though, you guess she wanted to be a good hostess.  She turns her head away from you as she seems to think.  Finally, she softly says, \"I-I guess I could let you s-sleep i-in...\" </span></div></div>",

You tried to tell her that her offer, while very generous, was unnecessary but you now find yourself getting tripped up with nervous stammering.  She slowly reached out for you so she could pick you up.  You quickly scramble up the side of her smooth finger before she thought you offended her.  She sets you down, gently this time, next to her pillow.  Unsurprisingly it's much softer on the mattress than the desk.  You look back in time to see her gigantic, petite body turn around and get into the bed.  Her weight coming into contact with the spongy ground cause it to distort slightly.  At your scale however it was like an earthquake and you would have fallen if you weren't already laying down.  She finished getting under the covers and flipped off the lamp.  The room became very dark and quiet with only the sounds of this giant woman shuffling around.  She settles in but is facing away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-g-goodnight N-nick,\" She eventually gets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, umm...\" Crap.  You answered reflexively but you still didn't know her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hanako,\" She sputters, realizing that she never introduced herself to you.  \"M-my name is Ikezawa Hanako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Ikezawa-san,\" You say, relieved she shared her name with you finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can call me Hanako, if you want,\" She says so softly you can barely hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Hanako, and thank you,\" You say.  you feel her moved a bit when you say her first name.  Embarrassed, or maybe happy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn over and try to go to sleep but you were to restless from the days events.  Hanako seemed to be having no problems though.  She was still except for her breathing.  Suddenly her whole body began moving.  She was rolling over in her sleep.  It was fortunate that she had been on the other side of the bed or she might have smashed you.  When she came to a rest, her face was on the edge of her pillow.  She wiggled a bit more before letting out a sleepy sigh.  A wave of her cool breath washed over your tiny form.  It was sweet and minty.  It was soon followed by the heavy scent of shampoo.  She was as close to you as when she first inspected you and you had a chance to see her face.  Her skin was fair and flawless, that is if you ignored the massive scarring.  You couldn't help but have you eye drawn to the irregularity, hopping that she didn't suddenly open her eyes.  The damaged flesh was blackened and rough, cracked and jagged.  In her nightgown you could see that the scar ran down to her neck and towards her torso.  What could have happened to cause damage so severe?  It probably wasn't a good experience.  You couldn't help but wonder about your new friend.</span></div></div>",

She sounded asleep by her constant breathing as you laid next to her, and taking a look at her faces left side, it looked painful. It was easy to understand the ridicule and embarrassment, but <i>why</i>?. So you sat contemplating what to do, and settled on assessing her scars. She wore clothes.. so you'd have to get under them to see it all..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, it seemed really perverted to explore her without consent, and personality-wise who knew what could happen. But after ten minutes of thinking and looking, you started to walk across the bedsheet to Hanako's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was best to start from the shirt, and you decided once done climbing to enter her nightgown through the collar. Hopefully moonlight would illuminate the pink nightgown to help you see, as the room was lit by it alone. After using the loose fabric to help climate up, you walked towards her breast and made way between them.. only slightly bigger then you, they seemed like a big bus from your perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to her collar, and looking under her chin there was burning there to. Feeling sympathetic, it was good to guess this was down her body. Did that stop you?</span></div></div>",

The scars moved up one breast, covered by her white bra. Then walking in, you could feel her chest move and the skin radiate heat. It was cozy to day the least, but these scars were really offsetting, then again life could be. Moving to her breast, you walked between her cleavage and set your hand on a scarred part of it. It felt soft, but bumpy and barely a little hole-y.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was interesting, and looking at her visible stomach it was halfway up it. Moving down onto it though, her aroma of body wash, shampoo &amp; her had a nice smell. It took several minutes to trek to her navels end, where the scars went under her shirt and Into her pants. When you came out, she still slept soundly and her face was blocked by her breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you came this far, you were certain you knew it went all the way down but couldn't stop the exploration thrill and sneaking, being small <i>regrudgeingly</i> had perks. So you easily lifted up her loose nightgown bottoms and slipped under them, closing them to trip and fall flat on her crotch. Unfortunately she moved a moment after you fell, inconveniently rolling right and throwing you to her right thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt scarred skin and some soft when landing, and the sound of her other leg smacking on her thigh, which threw you back at it. It sucked landing again, but once you stood up you saw her massive white panties and nightgown in front of you. It was <i>really</i> exciting to be seeing her 'beauty' so close, but the scarring, her self-esteem.. and the new friendship- and your size, made you feel this was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, taking a look at her scarring and the circumstances. .</span></div></div>",

It would be a violation of her trust and she might not forgive you if she found out.  You try to calm down so you can go to sleep.  You sprawl out on her mattress and get comfortable.  Despite not having any covers, you were being kept warm by the body heat radiating off of your bedmate.  It was, comforting to share another person's warmth and you quickly found your eyes becoming heavy.  You looked up at Hanako's cute face before nodding off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were woken but a loud, yet adorable squeaking noise.  The was followed however by a hot, sour smelling wind.  Confused, you opened your eyes to see a gigantic, wet, gaping maw above you.  You let out a yelp in fear as you tried to make sense of this apparently dangerous situation you found yourself in.  After a few seconds of panic, it all came back to you.  You woke up right next to Hanako's head, or more specifically her mouth, and you were stirred by a feminine yawn.  What wasn't so adorable was her supersized morning breath and scary teeth.  She began rubbing the sleep out of her eyes while you tried to get your heart rate back to normal.  She looked pretty out of it as she sat up and scratched her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Hanako,\" You call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill half asleep, she turns her head in your direction.  She looks around but not down.  Maybe she's having trouble remembering the events of yesterday.  \"Down here!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squints at you before her eyes go wide.  Looks like she remembers you now.  She recoils and covers the right side of her face.  \"N-nick!  Ummm... g-g-good morning,\" She stammers out.  Her face turned a familiar shade of red, looks like your night together hasn't helped her to get over her shyness yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of apologizing, Hanako left to wash up for the day.  You were alone in her room again.  With nothing else to do, you flopped back down on the mattress.  It was still warm from her body where she was lying and it was thick with her scent too.  It was very relaxing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" You heard in a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked yourself up from the mattress, it seems that you nodded off.  Hanako was standing over you in her school uniform.  \"Hey,\" You call out, \"I guess I fell asleep again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my bed really that comfy?\" She asks blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot softer than you desk,\" You joke.  \"Really, thanks again for doing all this for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fidgets a bit, clearly not used to getting compliments.  \"It's no problem,\" She lies blatantly.  It's at this point you see she has something behind her back.  You don't have to wonder long though as she pulls it out and sets it on her bed.  \"I got your bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, how long were you out?  \"You... already got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods.  \"A-after I got dressed, I went to the office and asked where the lost and found was.  I told them I lost my bag in class.  They just confirmed that I was in the class it was found in and they let me take it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at this practical solution she came up with on her own.  Now all you had to do was get back to your room.  With your permission, Hanako dug through your bag to find your barely used room key.  She packed your things back up, took you into her hand, and made her way to the boys dorm.  She probably got a few more looks from strangers this time, being a girl and all, but she just walked fast and stared at the floor.  Your room was at the far end of the highest level but you made it there without issue.  Hanako pulled out your key and opened the door revealing your plain room.  There, right on the nightstand was your medicine.  It was a liquid so that you could take it if you ever shrank.  You still needed help to get it open if you ever got this small, but it was still easier to deal with than a pill that was bigger than you.  You asked Hanako if she could put a drop of it on the table for you to take and she complies.  You drink in the familiar bitter taste.  You didn't like it but you couldn't argue with the results.  It didn't take long for you to gradually start growing.  Hanako backed up in shock, as if she had never seen a person become several times larger over a matter of seconds before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a heavy sigh when you finally returned to normal, \"Good to be back to normal.\"  You looked to your companion and couldn't help but notice she seemed a little on edge for essentially having completed her mission.  \"Hey.\"  She jumps a bit at your acknowledgment of her.  \"I can't thank you enough for everything Hanako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's ok,\" She says quietly.  \"I... ummm... bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say anything she bolts out of your room and down the hall.  Maybe she was afraid that now that she was no longer bigger than you that you might hurt her.  After everything she did though you couldn't imagine hurting such a sweet, smart, beautiful girl.  Either way you figure that you've bothered the introvert enough for now and let her go.  It wouldn't be your last interaction with her though.</span></div></div>",

For some reason though, she takes real issue with the idea of celebrating it or even discussing it.  Unfortunately Lilly didn't know why and it seemed unwise to press Hanako on the topic.  What's more, Lilly was going to be leaving for a little while to visit her family in Scotland.  Hanako seems to be in a real funk but we somehow manage to convince her to allow us to have a small party for her.  It will also function as a bit of a send off for Lilly and she might even get her older sister to show up.  You went out with Lilly a few days ago to look for a birthday present.  After searching most of the city, you found a cute doll that looked like it would go with the one Hanako already had.  That ended up being Lilly's gift, but the store where you found it was a bit outside of your price range.  Lilly offered to say that the doll was from both of you (partly because you had to pick it out)  but you wanted to do something more.  Hanako was really special to you.  In the past when people had found you during one of your shrinking episodes, they weren't always the most helpful.  Many had mocked or toyed with you in the past when you were vulnerable, but she was different.  Truthfully you might even be falling for her, but you didn't know if telling her so would scare her away.  In the end, you ended up making Hanako a charm bracelet with the help of the art club.  You were a little nervous about presenting someone with a handmade gift now that you weren't and elementary school student but you really tried to make something that you thought she might like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the eve of the party and you were about to knock on Lilly's door.  It was going to be a small get together likely similar to the tea party they had invited you to once before.  You had with you your gift, and a small chocolate cake. You took an extra swig of your medicine earlier, surely enough to get through the night without incident.  *knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" You hear Lilly call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Nick,\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear movement from inside the room followed by the sound of the door unlocking.  You were greeted by Lilly.  She was wearing a blue set of silk pajamas.  She motioned you in and locked the door behind you.  At the table already was Hanako, wearing her familiar pink nightgown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that everyone is here we can get started,\" Lilly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Akira busy?\" Hanako asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighs, \"Unfortunately.\"  Hanako slumps down a little bit, clearly disappointed.  You were a little disappointed too as you had yet to meet the mysterious Akira.  You sat down next to Hanako and she perked up a little bit.  \"However...\" Lilly continued.  She moved over to her bed and pulled out a paper bag.  \"She did drop off a gift for you.\"  She set the bag on the table and a small clank came from it.  Lilly removed the contents of the bag, a set of glasses and a pair of bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wine...\" Hanako says in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alcohol?  Seriously?\" I blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly giggles, \"I know it's a bit questionable, but a little shouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Akira wasn't the most responsible adult.  Regardless it was here and while you had never drank before, it looked like quality stuff.  Lilly moved to open a bottle when we heard a knock at the door.  You felt a sudden sense of dread at the prospect of being busted with the contraband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Lilly calls out like when you knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme in, I'm cold!\" An unfamiliar voice replies.  Lilly sighs and Hanako gets up to open the door.  In walked a blonde in a suit.  \"Happy birthday Hanako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-thank you Akira.\" She replies shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this is Lilly's sister.  There was certainly a strong resemblance but she had a bit of a masculine look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks over at you.  \"So this must be Nick.  I'm Satou Akira, nice to meet'cha.  You're a bit taller than I expected.\"  She smiles in a teasing way.  You glance over at Lilly.  Had she told her sister about your condition?  Lilly had found out about it before and while you hadn't forbiden her from talking about it... oh well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly couldn't see your glare but she must have felt it as she as she tried to change the topic.  \"We were just about to open your gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands a bottle to you and with a little effort you get it open.  Hanako passes the glasses around and you fill them up.  \"Here's to Hanako, and to Lilly's trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers!\" They cry as you all take a drink.  The wine is fruity and bold.  You had heard that alcohol burned if you weren't used to it but you couldn't feel anything of the sort.  Perhaps Akira got something that your untempered palates could enjoy.  The girls seemed to like it too judging from the looks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that Akira's gift has been opened, shall we move on to ours?\" Lilly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More g-gifts?\" Hanako asks surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" I reply, \"this is your birthday party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly pulled out her gift.  Hanako handles the carefully wrapped gift as though it might shatter in her hands.  She slowly peals away the paper to reveal the doll you picked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... beautiful,\" Hanako says in awe.  You weren't certain if she really liked dolls since she only had the one that you knew of, but the look in her eyes as she examined it was one of happy astonishment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.  It was actually Nick who picked it out,\" Lilly happily admits.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHanako suddenly remembers that she's not alone in the room and looks at us.  \"Y-yes, I like it.  T-thank you, Lilly and N-Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I got you something else.\"  You pull out my gift and hand it to her.  \"Happy birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same amount of care as the last, she opens my present to her.  When she sees the bangle, her eyes light up.  \"Oh!\"  She pulls the item from the box and examines each of the charms attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lilly asks.  You hadn't told her what you were doing, partially because you didn't know if it was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a charm bracelet.\" Hanako replies, now examining the rings that made up the loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my.  Where ever did you find that Nick?\" Lilly asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, actually made it,\" You admit.  Suddenly all attention was on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You m-made this for m-me?\" Hanako asked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I had a little help from the art club and I put it together after school the last few days.\"  You were rubbing the back of your head, a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" You heard her whisper.  \"T-t-thank you Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put on the bracelet and held her doll, she looked genuinely happy.  It was truly heartwarming to behold.  As she showed her new jewelry to Lilly, you looked over at Akira.  She had smile on her face as she looked over at her sister and her friend.  She gave you a nod as if to say she approved of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party goes on and everyone seems to be having a great time.  As you and Lilly sipped your wine, Akira and Hanako seemed to guzzle it down.  You thought to tell her to slow down but you decided not to spoil her fun.  Unknown to you, the alcohol was having an adverse effect on you medication.  It was going to fail and soon.  When do you start to shrink?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the night went on, you shared the cake and polished off the last of the wine.  You were feeling the effects of the alcohol a bit but you were still totally lucid.  Hanako on the other hand was starting to slur a bit.  Akira announced that she had to get back to work and you all decided it was probably time for bed.  Lilly and Hanako gave each other a tender hug, you wished Lilly and Akira goodnight, and you escorted the birthday girl back to her room.  She was wobbling quite a bit and needed to lean on you for support.  It was very fortunate that she lived in the next room over.  You opened the door for her and flipped on the lights.  Hanako, as carefully as she could, sets her new doll on the shelf next to her other.  As she steps back, she stagers and you have to catch her before she falls over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be ok?\" You ask concerned that she drank to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you and stares right into your eyes.  Suddenly, you feel her embrace you tightly.  Your heart starts beating rapidly and your thoughts start to swirl.  Whatever senses were dulled from the drinking were coming back.  You might be happy for her to be stepping out of her shell like this if it wasn't solely due to the alcohol.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako...\" Was all you could really say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dun wanna go to beeeeed.  I wanna staaaaay with you and Lillyyyyy,\" She whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can't,\" You say tenderly.  \"Lilly needs to sleep, I'm getting a bit of a headache, and you had a little too much to drink.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives a disappointed groan.  You put my hand on her head to try and get her to let go but she just holds on tighter.  Before you can protest, you get a twisting feeling in your stomach.  You close your eyes as the room starts to spin.  You feel an odd pressure on your face and try to open your eyes.  Something soft is pressing into you and you can't see a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hanako?\" You call out, unsure of what was happening.  You feel the pressure lighten and are able to see what was causing it.  You were still in her arms, but you had just shrunk by about a foot and a half.  You went from being a few inches taller than Hanako to having your face buried in between her supple breasts.  Hanako sees this too and her face lights up in delight before pulling you back into her buxom.  \"Hanako please, I have to go take my medicine,\"  You protest as you began pushing against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NoooOOOOoooo,\" Hanako wails.  \"I don't want you to gooooo.\"  She sways back and forth with you before tumbling onto her bed, pinning you beneath her.  You try to break free but your reduced weight and strength made it impossible to win.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer before you felt the sensation again.  You were terrified that Hanako would unwittingly crush you.  \"Hanako you gotta get off, I'm shrinking again,\" You plead in distress.  Fortunately she complies but she doesn't let you go.  She looks on in wonder as you continue to shrink before her eyes.  By the time it stopped you were barely smaller than the doll she just got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're like a dolly now,\" She squees, clearly pleased at this latest development.  She holds you up and nuzzles you.  Her smooth skin rubs against your face and you are bathed in her wine-scented breath.  \"Myyyyyyyyy little Ni-*hic*,\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit scared at this point.  As much as you liked Hanako, you didn't like being played with when you were so vulnerable.  You knew she cared about you but you had no idea how that care would manifest itself while she was inebriated.  Either way you were too small to escape now.  Tonight you were essentially a slave to Hanako's desires.  </span></div></div>",

Hanako was staring at you with a predatory gleam in her drunken eyes that you did not like in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myyyyyyyy little Nick.  I could just keep you forever and ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako reached out a finger and poked you in the stomach.  It wasn't much, but at your size it was enough to knock the wind out of you as you hunched over from the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive digit eventually knocked you over on your back, and then withdrew before another one pressed down against your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger then dug underneath your stomach like a spatula and flipped you onto your sore back with a resounding thud, all the while you could hear juvenile giggles from Hanako as she toyed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're so little!  Just like a mousey!  You better run or the big bad Hanako-chan is gonna get you!\" your tormentor giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly didn't need any prompting.  Pulling yourself to your feet and ignoring the aches, you ran over to the edge of the dresser, the fear in your mind never letting you realize that it was a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a colossal hand blocked your exit path, and you wasted no time in turning around and trying another direction.  The same result occurred.  Hanako was just toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't look so sad!  Come here and gimme a kissy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring your protests, the second hand scooped you up none too gently and hoisted you up to Hanako's massive face, her lips puckered as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her drunken state, she smacked you against her cheek the first time, the normally soft skin feeling like a brick wall at your speed.  That would leave a bump and a black eye tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time she managed to guide you to her lips, pressing your body into their soft, fleshy exterior.  She made a loud, obnoxious humming noise as you engulfed in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, air?\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two lips parted ever so slightly, and a gust of air sucked your entire top half into Hanako's mouth.  She giggled through her mouthful of you, sloshing your head and torso around as her tongue coated you thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph!  Mmph!\" your muffled screams barely heard as nothing but your legs were visible, wriggling and kicking on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Hanako spit you out none too graciously, and apparently none too accurately.  Still giggling drunkenly, you missed her hand completely and went plummeting, bouncing off her breast which at least helped break your fall before heading on a one-way ticket to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left shoulder slammed into the carpet, and you could've sworn you heard something break.  This game was a nightmare in every definition of the word.  Dragging yourself to your feet, adrenaline kicked in and moved your battered body to a gap underneath the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming and panting in fear, you never bothered looking back, but the pitter-patter of feet told you that Hanako was none too seriously chasing after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared the \"archway\" and entered the dusty bottom of the dresser as the thuds drew closer, moving until your back was against a wall.  You fell to your knees, shaking like a leaf as Hanako's hand made drunken grabs for you, stumbling around in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive appendage missed you a few times, until Hanako seemed to get tired of fishing for you.  You curled up in a ball, cowering until you heard a massive thud off in the distance followed by some light snoring.  Hanako had apparently passed out for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your fear-addled mind kept you cowering and whimpering in the corner underneath the dresser, not even the size of a doll.  You weren't leaving anytime soon, not even as the hours passed and morning broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point...</span></div></div>",

You seemed to have gotten smaller during the whole fiasco, as you could fit underneath the dresser with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite your mind trying to make things better, your body refused to budge from your spot.  It didn't help that you broke your arm last night.  You had just gone through the fifth-worst thing to happen to you while shrunk, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock!  Knock!  Knock!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped out of your skin at the sudden loud banging at the door.  With it, you worked up the courage to poke your head just out of your sanctuary to see what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise seemed to knock your friend/tormentor out of her rest, and she blearily yelped as the pink nightgown wearing giantess rose from her sleep, no doubt experiencing the mother of all hangovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako, it's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Lilly's voice.  She must've been here to check up on Hanako in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Coming...\" Hanako stumbled.  With the alcohol gone, the drunken maniac was once again replaced by the meek girl that you knew and loved.  Still, you didn't exactly feel comfortable around Hanako at the moment.  Did she not remember anything that happened last night while she was inebriated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, revealing the smiling Lilly behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Hanako.  I trust you had a good night's sleep?\" a chipper Lilly said.  Hanako smiled softly, but pursed her lips in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes.  L-Last night was... fun.  Why are you here so early?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ara, I just thought I'd check up on you this morning.  You were quite the drinker last night, if I do say so myself.  Nick was quite the gentleman to escort you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh... yes.  Nick... did he go back to his room afterward?  I r-remember him escorting me home...  I must've fallen asleep right after...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something felt wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, is there something wrong?\" Lilly asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako tried to recall more of the previous night, but things seemed to go black after the party.  That is, until...</span></div></div>",

She quickly drops down to her knees and feels around desperately under the desk for your fragile body. Her fingers brush past you and then snap back to grab you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meagre \"Owwww,\" is all you can let out as your tired, broken body is dragged out into daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness, Nick, I-I am so sorry, I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako. It's fine.\" you interrupt, \"You were drunk. You weren't thinking clearly. If you want to make it up to me, you'll take me to my room, get my medicine and take me to the nurse.\" you felt kind of bad for being so blunt with her, but you were channeling most of your energy into not screaming from the pain shooting through your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay. Sorry.\" Hanako replied after swallowing a lump in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk over to the boys dorm was a quiet one. Passers-by gave you weird looks as you sat in the palm of Hanako's hand. Didn't bother you much though. People always stare at you. You remember this must be the first time many students at Yamaku have seen you shrunk for the first time. The door to your room was unlocked (theft is a rare occurrence at Yamaku) and Hanako placed you on your bed before opening your beside table drawer in search of your medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it safe to sit here?\" Lilly asked aloud, hovering her buttocks above the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little to the left.\" you call up to her. She wasn't directly above you but it's better to be safe than squished under a blind girls ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako showed you a bottle with a liquid inside. \"Is this it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you say, maintaining your pissed off attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you, um... take it?\" Hanako asked, noticing the bottle matched you in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to drink some.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. Do you want me to pour it on you or..?\" she held the now open bottle above you at an angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!! Christ you'll drown me, just, put a drop on your finger or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanako complied and held her finger out to you with a drop of medicine resting on it. \"H-Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly lean in and lick the sweet smelling remedy off of the finger that proved itself a torture device not ten hours ago. A minute passes and you feel the room around you return to normal size. Hanako sighs with relief and leans in to hug you. You stop her before she gets too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get my arm looked at first. Don't want to cause more damage, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right. Sure. Yeah, let's go then.\" Hanako turns to lead the way before Lilly stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanako! Class will begin soon. You should tell Mr. Mutuo that Nick will be missing first period to see the Nurse. I will make sure he gets there without incident.\" Hanako looked down at her feet and nodded. The three of you left the boys dorm and Hanako said goodbye before branching off to class. Lilly, true to her word, stayed with you on the way to the Nurse's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're lucky.\" the Nurse said after inspecting your injury. \"It's just a sprain. The increased amount of pain may have been a result of your bones changing size at the time of injury.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked how you hurt your arm, you decided it wouldn't be wise to say you were in the girls dorm past curfew getting drunk with the girls, so you decided to lie and claim you fell out of bed and shrunk when you hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll prescribe you some decent painkillers to help with the pain, but there isn't much we can do other than let it run its course. If it gets any worse or doesn't improve, don't hesitate to contact me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Nurse.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, Nick. It's what I'm paid for!\" you smiled and shut the door behind you where Lilly was waiting out in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" she asked as you started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a sprain, nothing to get excited about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is everything okay with <i>you?</i>\" you ask, noticing her uncharacteristic bluntness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't like the way you acted with Hanako today. I understand you were upset and, I will admit, for good reasons but she is sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you. I'm not mad at her but she needs to understand that the things she did to me last night are part of the reason I can't go to a normal school; because people think it's funny to treat me like a toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Hanako couldn't go to a normal school? She is more than physically able to attend a standard public school but the way average students acted around her forced her into this place. You were rude and dismissive to her even when she was trying to help. That is exactly what she came here to avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She put me in her mouth!\" you argued perhaps a little too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly stopped and stayed quiet for a moment, most likely constructing a response. \"Like I said; you are angry and that is understandable. But you may have noticed that Hanako likes to keep to herself and me. She's let you into our circle, a circle I would say is a very elite one. Please try to make as much effort as she is to make this incident a thing of the past.\" she continued walking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lilly decided to flunk the rest of class and wait for Hanako in the usual tea room. The two of you played chess until you had yet another shrinking episode. You tapped on Lilly's shoe and she gently picked you up and dropped you on the table. You both shared a laugh at how common it had become for you to shrink and seemingly always forget your medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One would think you almost enjoy being small, Nick.\" Lilly teased. You laughed and sat on the chess board, marvelling the enormous face of Lilly. You had to admit she was a pretty girl, and the fact she can't see you staring makes it all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang signifying the end of class. The thunderous sounds of a hundred students eagerly rushing to lunch filled the corridors outside. A couple of minutes passed and the door creaked open. Hanako's head peeked in and recognised her friend. She sat down at the table and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it was just a sprain.\" you say. Hanako gasps at your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-You're tiny again? I didn't even see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I, err, forgot my medicine again, heh.\" you looked up at Hanako and her eyes darted away, much like they used to when you'd catch each other's glances in class before you knew each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's actually something Nick wanted to say to you, Hanako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Hanako asked, now leaning in towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, what?\" you turn around to Lilly. Her finger comes gliding at you and push you towards Hanako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, he wanted to apologise for not thanking you for your help today, isn't that right Nick?\" she gave you a poke and you stumbled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Hanako's face that now hangs directly above you and say...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your first day at Yamaku High! You were admitted to the school after it was discovered you had a disease so rare that some people didn't think it was possible. Every so often, you just randomly shrink! Kind of like a reverse growth spurt, only much faster, and much more significant. Also, for some bizarre reason you didn't understand, your clothes would somehow shrink with you! It didn't seem possible, and was scientifically inexplicable, without further research but it happened. The school nurse had given you a prescription that would lessen the effects, and even allow you to grow back to your original size after a short time, but it was still pretty intense. Your first classes had gone well, but now it was lunch time and you wanted to take a chance to get to see the school. Also, you were pretty hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the halls, lunchbox in hand. Seeing as it was lunch time, you figured you should take your prescription. You fumbled around in your pocket pocket for a moment, locating some loose change. But not your prescription. You started a moment, and checked your other pocket. Not there either! Oh no! You were sure you'd grabbed them this morning! Could you have left them in your classroom? Or had they fallen out!? To make matters worse, you felt a rush coming on! You were about to shrink! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, you ducked into the first classroom you found-- the art room. It didn't look like anyone was in it. With all the dust everywhere this room couldn't be used that often. Right? You feel the rush pass. Phew. You must have only lost a few centimeters. But you had to be more careful! There was no guarantee that you'd be safe from these effects every time. You look around the room, and give a sudden start, when you see two green eyes staring at you from the window. Looks like you weren't alone afterall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a girl sitting on the windowsill, though she was wearing a boy's uniform, though she was barefoot. At a glance you almost mistook her for part of the background, a furnishing or a statue, she'd been sitting so still. Great. You almost shrank in public, and you were blind as a bat. We stared at each other for a few moments, before she shifted slightly towards you, her legs dangling towards the floor, where you noticed a pair of abandoned sandals. You also noticed, quite clearly, that the girl was missing her arms. You almost felt a pang of pity to her. It must be hard without arms. Though, you suppose you had just as debilitating a problem as she did. Yamaku was probably full of people like you and her. Well. Maybe not specifically like <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" So she finally spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... hi.\" You reply awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room doesn't usually have people in it.\" She stated. Very blunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah. I just erm.... had to catch my breath! The halls made me feel a bit claustrophobic.\" You lied. She studied your face for a moment. Did she suspect your lie? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was eating.\" She said. Now that she mentions it, you notice a tray of food on the windowsill beside her, a fork placed on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" You say, unsure of the answer she was expecting. You briefly wondered how she ate. There was another awkward silence, before she turned back to her foot. Lifting one leg quite flexibly, she grabbed her fork between her toes. You almost had to admire her dexterity. She ate from her tray using her feet as well as you would have with your hands. Everyone had to find a way to cope, you supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Rin. If you won't mind me I won't mind you.\" She said, seeming to have lost interest in me. You breathe a small sigh of relief. Rin, huh? Well. Seemed she was ignoring you. You may as well get out and try to find your medication in case another rush occurred. But, as you turned for the door, you felt it occur suddenly. Another one! Oh no....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room around you swam, and extended. This was gonna be a big one... And unfortunately, you're right. Within an instant, everything in the room towers over you. Oh geez.... You couldn't be much taller than one or two inches tall! This first day at Yamaku was quickly turning into a nightmare! Speaking of which, you nervously glanced in Rin's direction. She had seemed pretty zoned out, but had she noticed your sudden shrinking? Then again, maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing. She seemed a little off, but maybe she could help you find your medication so you could return to normal! Had she noticed you?</span></div></div>",

You turned around to see a flesh like wall and vibrations coming from the wall. For some odd reason, you thought it sounded like a heart beating.

Then you looked at either side of you and saw two fleshy mounds that looked like-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my...God.\" Then it hit you like a ton of bricks.

No. Telling her where you were was out of the question. So then, what was there left to do? You could try waiting it out in her bra and wait for her to go somewhere where you could sneak out and make something up if you needed to.

You avert your gaze back to the aforementioned foot and look up to see Rin's poker face staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you imaginary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back in fear of the sheer enormity of the girl in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've sworn you were a little taller than me a second ago. Now you're not. So, are you a figment of my somewhat overacting imagination or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer surprisingly relaxed manner to this whole situation puts you somewhat at ease. At least she isn't freaking out and trying to squish you. Though, you wish she would stop tapping her big toe on the floor like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not imaginary. I'm real. I have a condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.\" Rin deadpans. You aren't entirely sure where to take the conversation from here but Rin solves that problem for you. \"Hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even have time to ask what the hell she meant, she raises her foot and lowers it down over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT! STOP! NOOOO!!\" you plead. This is it. This psycho is going to squish you. Your first day of Yamaku and you're going to die like a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her foot came close, you tried to push against it. You dug your nails into her sole in a feeble attempt to ward her off. Unphased by your retalliation, she scrunches her toes around your body and lifts her foot. You try to scream but your voice is muffled and the smell of her feet are proving it a challenge to even breath, let alone speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. It's worse than you though. You aren't going to die like a bug. Bugs get squashed.<br>\r\nQuick and efficient. You're about to suffocate between a girls toes. Slow and disgusting. By comparison, a bug dies a heroes death in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it looked completely hopeless, you were released from your god awful fate at the clutches of Rin's toes. You are on a new surface. This one is wooden and slightly warm. Unlike the cold floor from earlier. This surface was also noticeably higher up. You turned around and saw Rin with that same poker face, even creepier up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET AWAY FROM ME!\" You scooted backwards to escape the the behemoth who recently tried to murder you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU TRIED KILL ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tried squash me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was picking you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your feet!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin looks at the stumps she possesses instead of arms them back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right, sorry. But you could have at least warned me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said hold still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what that means!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArguing with her is futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you need to put me up here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin climes up onto the same surface as you and dragged her lunch over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't finished eating. Didn't want you down there on your own. Might get stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, thanks, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin holds a forkful of rice and points it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she mentions it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" She waves the fork ever so slightly at you and you dig in. Grain by singular grain of rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you continue to eat your rice until you think of something to say. \"Hey, Rin? How come where I'm standing is so warm?\" Rin smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where I was sitting. It seems you're basking in my butt warmth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, thats just great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst day of Yamaku; shrunk, almost squished, almost suffocated, and now you're being fed rice by a giant foot. Looks like you made a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Just as you're contemplating how much of the single grain of rice closest to you it would take to fill you up, the entire glob of food you're on lifts up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go, you manage to grip onto the sticky suface of the rice firmly enough to prevent yourself from falling.  However, right as you regain your bearings, you're thrown off by a hot, somewhat fishy-smelling wind blowing on you.  As you look to see what it is, all that fills your view is the rubbery, partially chapped lips of Rin surrounding a hot pink cave, which is growing closer to you by the second.  As you watch her throat open up with a slimy smacking sound you can actually hear at this scale, you freak out and scream for help in this sudden extremely dangerous predicament you find yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RIN!  What are you doing!?  Stop!  DON'T EAT ME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathes in.  The hot hurricane once beating against you is now sucking on you, almost seeming to pull yourself in closer.  Even after your first misconception about what Rin wanted to do with your miniscule fate, it's all but confirmed now.  Being squashed underfoot wasn't good enough.  She wanted to eat you all along, have you all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you're sure you're going to be part of this odd girl's lunch, the chopsticks, and you with them, are pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lowers the bit of food to the counter top and lets you get off, her eyes once again squint on your as she begins to move those lips that almost consumed you alive, speaking rather matter-of-factly.  \"Oops.  Sorry, guess I forgot you were there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?  You forgot!?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Rin lifts the glob of rice you were stuck to and instantly sticks it in her mouth, chewing your former location to a pulp without a second thought.  \"You're too tiny.  It's hard to keep track of you.  Big people are easy to keep track of.  You're more like an ant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you have a point... but I can't help it, and I'm not THAT insignificant!  I'm a person, you know, and at LEAST bigger than an ant!\"  You stamp your foot in frustration.  The gigantic face of Rin is unmoved, probably not noticing your gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin points her chopsticks at you again.  A move that, this time, makes you fall back reflexively.  \"I should go to the roof.  We should.  I was supposed to meet someone there today for lunch but this project ran long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have time for this.  You need to get your meds, though it looks like the giant Rin is in charge of your future for now, and she doesn't really seem that interested in your sad situation.  You don't know if you can really convince her.  However, if her friend's a little more mindful, they might be able to help you better.  Might be best to just play along with Rin's capricious decisions for now.</span></div></div>",

You're both thinking the same thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this gonna work?\" you finally ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I guess you could ride on my sandal.\" you look at her feet, remembering the horror you were put through. Could you cope with that smell for an entire journey? Would you even be able to stay on? Then again, what's the alternative? She can't exactly hold you like anyone else could. There's always her shoulder but falling off would mean certain death. Looks like you're going with her suggestion. You swallow a big lump of anxiety before taking a few steps towards her big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's just the way it's gonna be. You mind if we do this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Hold still.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away quickly, knowing full well what 'hold still' meant this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah!! Let me strap myself in, huh?\" you side stepped your way between her big toe and second toe and grabbed on tight. Rin's toes tightened also and she lifted you off the ledge and dropped you on the floor. That time was much better than the last. No fear of death, the smell was still something to put up with but you'll just have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin slipped into her sandals and gently poked you with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and pulled yourself onto the worn surface of the footwear. Deciding you'd need some kind of seat belt device, you, once again, took refuge between Rin's toes and held onto the sandal strap like a roller coaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" she asked. You patted down on her foot, signalling the get-go. And then you were off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride was nice and smooth until she exited the art room. Then, after seeing the vast expanse of giants and the stomping feet of your enormous classmates surrounding you, you felt terrified. It was as if the entire world had slowed down and every step was magnified. The strap pressed far too tightly around your chest and you could hardly breathe. Whenever you got the opportunity to take in one of these elusive breaths, nine times out of then they were contaminated with the hot aroma of Rin's feet. This was unbearable. You had to get out of this, or at the very least, pray you get to your room very soon lest you vomit. </span></div></div>",

While Rin absentmindedly made her way to the dorms like any other day, you were getting a very different view of your new school.  The outside world was fairly alien to you at this size.  You could get lost for days in the grass if you fell off of your new friend's foot, and that was if you didn't get trampled.  Most of the traffic was heading back towards the classrooms as lunch was nearly over.  While you knew that they probably wouldn't try to step on Rin's foot, it was still scary.  The simple footsteps of your classmate's sounded like heavy machinery designed for smashing bug sized people.  One person kicked a pebble and it whizzed right past your head before glancing off of Rin's ankle.  She might not have reacted from the impact, but you almost had a heart attack from nearly getting your head knocked off.  You held on tight to the worn leather of the sandal, doing your best to endure to stench of feet.  It was a warm day and before the end of the walk, Rin's feet were starting to sweat a little.  The rank odor and lurching movement from every step are nearly enough to take your mind off of the fear of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, the sun disappeared and the sidewalk was replaced with carpeting.  You had made it to the boy's dorm.  Before you can breath a sigh of relief, Gravity shifts in a familiar, yet still unpleasant way as Rin brings you up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never been in here before,\" She says, her expression as blank as ever.  \"Looks pretty similar to the girl's dorm though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I've seen the girl's dorm so I couldn't tell you,\" You reply, glad that the movement had finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which room is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sure.  I was up a few floors and at the end of the hall.\"  Before you can ask her to take the elevator to spare you the trip up the stairs, she resumes walking.  The stairs end up not being too bad fortunately and in another minute, you are in front of your dorm room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is weird,\" Rin blurts out as she looks at your nameplate.  She slips her foot out of her sandal, causing you to fall flat on your back against the soft, sweaty material.  She reaches with her foot to turn the knob and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just goes to show how people can overcome hardships in their lives.  It also made you realize why she wore the boy's uniform.  If she was wearing a skirt, she'd be exposing herself every time she had to reach for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a key?\" Rin asks, pulling you from your thoughts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you. \"Augh!\" You shout in frustration.  \"I locked my door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" She replies calmly.  \"A lot of people around here don't bother.  With guards and the stigma that stealing from disabled kids is bad, theft is pretty much non-existent.  Most people here don't have much worth taking anyway.  I've only got my clothes and some art supplies.  Plus I find that keys are tricky to work without hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she rambles you frantically check your pockets to see if the key had shrunk with you.  The good news is that it didn't.  You must have left it in your bag.  The bad news is that your bag was back in the classroom, meaning this trip was a waste of time.  You hop off of the sandal to get some fresher air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rin!\" You shout up.  She stops talking and looks down at you, her face as expressionless as ever.  \"I left my key in my bag back in class 3-2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't too smart,\" She replies.  This girl has no tact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had it on me then it would be too small for us to use now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything on me when I shrink shrinks with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks closely at you.  \"Oh yeah, you still have your clothes.  I didn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not realize I wasn't naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn indifferent shrug is the only response you get.  \"How does that work anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Rin, it just does.\"  She doesn't seem too satisfied with that answer but it was the truth.  \"I'm sorry to ask you for another favor but we're gonna need to go get that key before we can get into my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin frowns slightly, \"I have painting I need to do.  I've still got a lot of work to do on my mural before the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I promise to help you with your mural?\" You offer.  The last thing you need is for her to abandon you on your own doorstep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah really.  I mean I'm not particularly artistic but it's the least I can do to repay you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to think for a moment before nodding.  \"Ok.\"  She slides her sandal back and and gestures for you to hop back on.</span></div></div>",

As her lips began to seal shut, you finally realized what was happening.  Before you could yell out to Rin in disapproval, her tongue mashed you into the roof of her mouth.  You could only shiver in revulsion as the slimy muscle rubbed against you, coating you in saliva, likely tasting you too.  She didn't spit you out so you must not taste too bad, then again she likely is used to the taste of her own feet given her condition.  It took a little effort to keep from drowning in her drool and the air you could breathe was far from minty fresh.  While not as foul smelling as her foot was, Rin's breath was fishy from her lunch and the odor of digestion, while faint, was noticeable.  The sounds her breathing and heartbeat were overshadowed by the slurping and sloshing of the tongue and throat around you.

For the time being though, you were going to be stuck inside of Rin's mouth.  It was dark, hot, and dank, but you figured you might as well try to make the best of it.  With your ears already full of saliva, you had nothing to lose by resting your head on her tongue.  Tongues are soft right?  It'll be just like a giant, gross pillow.  The moment you sunk your head into the muscle, you found that soft didn't begin to describe the velvety suppleness.  It was like you were laying on a cloud... made of friendly slugs.  The constant motion of a giantess in movement was much easier to deal with than when you were between her toes, even combined with the random undulations of the tongue and bobbing of her head.  While the risk of being swallowed was still in the back of your mind, it somehow wasn't as scary as when you were watching your giant classmates stomp around.  It was impossible to keep track of time, but at some point the heat and humidity started to get to you.  Your head was swirling like you had spent too much time in a hot tub, though honestly Rin's mouth wasn't too different from a sauna at the moment.  You felt yourself spacing out.  Bizarre, colorful images began flooding you mind though you still had enough sense to realize how surreal this whole ordeal was.  You found yourself not caring though and snuggled up against the taste-buds, trying to find meaning in the strange pictures running through your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are eventually brought back to reality by a series of explosive sounds.  You still couldn't see but from the feel and smell of it, you were still in Rin's mouth.  Your theory was confirmed shortly after as the lips opened for the first time since you entered.  The light was dimmer than you expected after being in pitch blackness but you were still a little out of it.  The tongue you had been resting on began to extend outwards before forming a slope.  You slid down the slick flesh and came to a stop in a small puddle of drool on top of a plastic container.  You wiped the spit from your face and looked around.  You expected to be back at the dorm or maybe your classroom but you seemed to be somewhere outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out to Rin, who seemed to be enjoying a bottle of water, \"Hey Rin, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few more drinks before answering you,\"My throat was dry, I had to put you down so I could take a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot quite the information you were looking for but at least she was having some consideration for you.  \"Uh, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard for me to drink and keep things in my mouth.  I figured it would be a pain to try and get you out of my stomach so letting you out for a bit made the most sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit disturbed by that last comment but you decide to keep that to yourself.  \"Yeah... anyway, did you get my bag?  What time is it?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, \"Not yet.  Got struck with inspiration.  Been working on the mural.  Don't know what time it is but I think class let out a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing.  \"It's... it's been hours?  You kept me here all afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got a lot done.  I might actually finish before the last moment.  That would be nice for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have taken like 15 minutes.  You couldn't have gotten my things or at least let me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't risk it.  My thoughts are fleeting, like... hmm... anyway, I need to paint before I lose the though.  If I don't then it goes way slower.  That's why I'm behind in the first place.  For whatever reason I was on a roll so I rolled with it.  As for letting you out, I didn't really think about it.  You taste decent which was nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by her extraordinary indifference.  You thought she was helping you but she doesn't seem to understand how serious this was.  Your life threatening crisis was her back-burner chore.  You felt your body temperature rising and looked away to try and calm yourself.  Then you saw the mural.  It was... different.  A collage of body parts and oddly proportioned people.  Some parts were just outlines while others were blends of unnatural colors.  It sort of reminded you of what you saw while you were zoned out earlier.  This is what she created while she kept you captive inside her body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rin tilted her head quizzically at your comment.  \"Did you pass by it this morning?  I had some of the rough outline done but not much else really.  Crap, did I paint something I've seen before without realizing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had certainly never seen anything like what Rin had created.  The almost alien portrayal of the human body and blending of the colors was so strange... and yet so nostalgic.  \"No, I don't think I've seen this before.  And yet... I do?\"  You weren't making any sense and you knew it.  You figured any second Rin would ask you to stop talking crazy.  Looking back at her though, her eyes told you otherwise.  She didn't say anything, and yet her eyes told you to continue talking.  To just let your thoughts out, no matter how she might think you sound.  \"I think... when I was in your mouth... I saw... things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my teeth?\" Rin interjects, spreading her lips to refresh your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well yes I saw them, but that's not what I'm talking about,\" You continue.  \"I think it was... some kind of vision or delusion.  It was like... swirling colors and bodies that were contorting, mixing, and blending in impossible ways.  The closest comparison is... well your painting there.  With everything that was going on inside there, I think my brain was getting... overwhelmed i guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overwhelmed how?\" Rin asked.  She sounded genuinely curious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one there was the fact that it was hotter and muggier than anything I've ever experienced.  The constant noises of the human body coming from every direction.  The inescapable slime and goo coating me my entire being.  The inability to smell anything other than stale breath.  Not to mention the somewhat frequent sucking and licking of my body.\"  That last comment gets you a shrug out of her.  \"I mean, I guess it was better than when you were walking around with me on your foot, but I wish you would have at least said something before you dropped me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it all means?  What you saw and what you felt, how does it fit together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Some of my thoughts are conflicting and others... I can't even find the words to explain them.  While I was squished up against your tongue it was gross, but also nice?  Like I know I was soaking in your slobber, but it was soft and relaxing once I got past that.  The bubbling sounds from your belly were scary but the whooshing of your lungs was soothing.  I was alone, but your were aware of me and all around me too.  I guess while I was definitely being overwhelmed and I wanted out,  a part of me deep down ... to a degree at least... liked it.   Does that... make me weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin didn't answer immediately, she seemed to be deep in thought.  She just looked down at you on the paint container she spat you onto.  \"So you were somewhat forced into doing something that you both liked and didn't like and began to feel overwhelmed, and that caused you to see things like my mural?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess that's one way to put it,\" You reply nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she bent over, her tie drooping down just above you, her breasts flanking you and just touching the edge of the plastic top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?!\" You exclaim, afraid she was about to crush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said surprised you more than anything else she had said yet.  \"I'm hugging you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why?\"You stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back, her giant face came back into view.  She was looking down at you with her familiar dull expression.  \"Did I misread that?  You said that you felt like you were weird and I wanted to make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... thanks.\"  You could feel your face redden and were thankful that you were probably too small for her to see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" She continued.  \"You shouldn't feel bad about expressing yourself.  Besides, what you described made sense to me.  Heck you even got closer to properly interpreting my painting than most people usually do.\"  What did she mean by that?  Before you could inquire further, Rin's focus was caught by a passing butterfly.  After the colorful insect fluttered out of sight, she turned back to survey her mural.  \"*Sigh* I still have a lot to do though.  Better get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You shout out, finally regaining her attention.  \"What about me?\" With the introspective conversation over, you had remember why you had her stow you in her mouth in the first place, to get back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin thought for a moment before responding.  \"Oh yeah, you still need me right?  Well my throat is feeling better now so you can hop back in while I paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No Rin, I need you to get my bag so I can get my medicine remember?  I need to get big again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour protest solicited a nonplussed expression from your handless handler as she seemed to search her memory banks.  \"Oh yeah.  You needed your medicine so I carried you with my feet.  Then I carried you with my mouth because you didn't like me carrying you with my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and then we were going to get my key you got distracted and painted for what I can only guess was around (you look to the sky and see that the sun had dipped below the treeline) 4 hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.  I was struck with inspiration and painted for what you can only guess was around 4 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway... I'd appreciate it if we could go back to getting my bag so I can return to my proper size, take a shower, and call it a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should shower in the morning, it's a good way to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I would but seeing as I'm covered in spit, I'd rather get clean sooner than later.\"  You lifted up your arms, allowing the sticky tendrils hang and accentuate your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I once read that saliva is a natural disinfectant.  Maybe you're actually cleaner now than you've ever been before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone else had said that, you'd be certain that they were just teasing.  Rin on the other hand sounded completely serious.  The stuff certainly didn't smell clean, but you decided to not press the issue, \"I figure it out later.  Can you please take a few minutes to help me out with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin closes her eyes and thinks... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Just don't tell anyone what color they are,\" Rin says as she brings you closer to her body.  She almost looked like she was blushing.  Her other leg was bending towards her waist, demonstrating a high level of flexibility.  The toes gripped at her belt and pulled it out to make a small gap between her pants and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't doing what you thought she was doing... was she?  Your jaw dropped when you realized you were heading straight for the hole that led to her crotch.  You could only stammer as the foot holding you came to a stop and released.  Down you fell, passing by her other foot into the darkness.  Your fall was broken by a figurative haystack of pubic hair.  You grabbed at the wiry follicles before you fell any further.  The small amount of light coming in shined off of the uppermost hairs.  They radiated as red as the hair on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girls panties are her soul,\" She states from above before letting go of your skylight.  The pants snapped back into place, pressing you into her flesh.  So she's carrying you with her soul.  How... noble of her.  While dark, the area was hot and muggy.  The smell of sweat was very noticeable, but not nearly as foul as her feet.  What really set it apart though was the extraordinarily pungent feminine musk, the source of which was not lost to you.  In fact, it was making your mind go into overdrive as hormones raced through your young brain.  Before your thoughts could get too dirty, Rin stood up.  The shift in gravity combined with the thrusting of her hip (what with her not being able to push up obviously) squished you between fabric, hair, and skin.  Stunned momentarily, you slide down a short ways before stopping yourself again.  She began walking and the noise of shuffling cloth crashed around you.  The sounds of Rin's innards were only barely audible, not that you really wanted to listen to the churning of her lunch.  You began swinging as momentum started to take hold.  It wasn't easy but it was still way better than being in her toes.  As the swinging picked up, you began bumping into something soft and fleshy.  \"H-hey fella, take it easy in there,\" Rin said as she suddenly stopped walking.  Her voice sounded breathier than her usual uninterested drone.  It was almost like... oh God she's getting aroused. That \"thing\" you were bumping into was her clitoris, possibly the most sensitive spot on her body.  While you might also have sex on your mind, that was hardly your fault and you still had enough sense to keep your eyes on the prize of getting back to normal.  Not wanting to cause anymore unwanted pleasure to your carrier, you climbed a bit further down so that any swinging would miss her sweet spot.  Just before you were about to stop, your foot was clamped on by something wet and warm.  Startled but the strange sensation, you nearly lost your grip and as Rin's legs continued to rock you,  your foot sank in deeper.  Seems you had stumbled into the labia and were now at risk of being devoured by it.</span></div></div>",

Just don't tell anyone what color they are,\" She says as she pinches at her waistband.  You quickly figure out what she is doing, but you don't want to believe it.  I try to protest but her squeezing toes prevent you from getting a good breath.  When you could finally fill your lungs enough to shout, you were already plummeting down towards her pale, round cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made contact with her silky panties and slid down the sheer slope into the darkness.  Your slide was cut short by the release of the band, launching both you and the underwear towards her crack.  The fatty globes jiggle from the slam, absorbing most of the force.  Now pinned between the cloth and her skin, you pressed against the walls in an attempt to at least get more comfortable.  Before you could find a position though, the muscles beneath you began to tense.  Shifting skin and gravity signaled that Rin was getting back up.  When she began walking, the grinding started.  Supple flesh and striped fabric rubbed you from every direction.  If they both weren't so incredibly soft there is no doubt you would have been torn apart.  You were only freed when she made it to the stairs and the bouncing started.  After several floors of erratic shaking, you found yourself in a small pocket of space between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to breathe, you fill your lungs with a deep breath.  The smell, fortunately, is not nearly as bad as you feared.  The scent of sweat was thick and pungent, but it was mixed with a trace of laundry soap.  No trace of filth or skid-marks, guess her lack of arms doesn't hinder her ability to wipe.  The cheeks were still moving back and forth with every step, but the force was no longer directly on you.  Surprisingly, this does seem to be an upgrade from her nasty sandal.  </span></div></div>",

Class started 10 minutes ago,\" A female voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it?  I wonder if that's why it's so empty on campus,\" Rin replies in her usual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tezuka, you are late for class and I'm taking you there post haste,\" The stranger continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to do something first,\" Rin declines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, Nomiya mentioned you were making a painting or something for the festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's next.

You hope she doesn't decide to get up before you get there.  Luckily, she doesn't.  She remains there, absentmindedly bringing some more food to her mouth every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer scale of her body becomes more daunting the closer you get, until you're near the windowsill and all that's in view is her overhanging leg.  The giant foot right in front of you looks a bit rough, dirty, speckled with paint, and big enough to crush a building.  Her toes are barely touching the ground, so you start off with those.  As you're climbing on, you notice the corpse of a now-unrecognizeable insect in between her big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop freaking out, you say to yourself, just focus on the goal.  It doesn't matter how easily she could end your life beneath her unkempt sole or wedged into toe jam with the thong of her sandal.  You're not a bug, you're not going to be killed, you're going to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you grasp at the cuff of her pants, you briefly consider going inside, but decide against it.  You don't want her to feel you down there, you don't know how hard it is to climb vertical flesh, and you especially don't want to risk getting stuck further up.  You play the safe, non-perverted route for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the treacherously steep climb, you do find it to be easy work.  The fibers of the cloth act much like the rungs of a ladder.  You're able to fully climb the length of her leg in a few minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you're hoping to get a better view, but you can in fact see less here.  Looking up, you take in nothing more than the massive mounds of her breasts and her jaw moving as she continues with her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting a bit, you consider where to go from here.  You can easily make it over to the countertop, possibly getting Rin's attention near her meal.  Your other option is to keep climbing and get somewhere near her face, probably her ear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been a few days since you were transferred to Yamaku High. You've adjusted to the classes well enough, and are starting to think about making friends. None of your friends from your old school had followed you here. For good reason, you supposed. They didn't have any disabilities. Unlike you. You, had a very strange one. A medical marvel. Your body would simply shrink, from time to time. How much you shrank varied. You could lose a centimeter, or shrink to a centimeter, with no apparent rhyme or reason. Your clothes would always shrink with you as well, when it happened, but it was disconcerting, dangerous, and peculiar. Doctors couldn't explain it, and tests had been run. So far nothing about it could be explained, but they had devised a way of preventing it from happening. Your medication. Filled with growth hormones, they could trick your body into returning to normal size, or prevent it shrinking whenever you had a spell. Until this had been discovered-- when you were about seven years old, there had been no way to reverse the shrinking. Thankfully, it seemed that you were incapable of shrinking smaller than about half a centimeter, and most of the instances, you rarely dropped under an inch in height. Though that was still awfully small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempts to attend normal schools had failed miserably. Your grades had suffered severely for the constant absences, so the decision was made to send you somewhere more understanding-- Yamaku. Where everyone had a story, and everyone had something keeping them out of a normal school. Well. Almost everyone at least. A place where someone like you could fit in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been here for a few days, of course, and were getting anxious that you hadn't really talked to anyone yet. The opportunity never came up. You were starting to wonder about ways to meet with people, and the obvious answer was through clubs. You heard the school council was recruiting, and the art club was always open. You considered both those options, and then thought of another one. Due to your disability, you had been forced to develop a hell of an athletic body, just to stay alive. Sprinting, running, leaping, tumbling, lifting. You could handle pain like nobody else. You figured that sports wouldn't be a problem to someone like you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here you were. At the track, at 7am in the morning. Running had become second nature to you, and on a few experimental laps around the track, you ran like the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" A girls voice sounded from your left, as you finished the lap. You turned your head to see a young girl jogging towards you. She had blonde hair, tied in pigtails, and vibrant green eyes. The thing that immediately drew your attention to her were her legs. They were disturbingly artificial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really fast! I was timing you! You ran that lap of the track in only 52 seconds! You've run before, huh?\" She asked, practically bouncing in place.You see that she's extremely energetic, and nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. I've had lots of practice.\" You explain to her, smiling. Maybe you've already made a new friend! \"I was thinking of maybe joining one of the athletic clubs and figured I'd start with the track team.\" You say, holding out a hand in greeting. She takes your hand and shakes it emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We could use someone as fast as you! My name's Emi by the way!\" She expresses cheerfully. \"While we're both here, do you want to run a few more laps! I always run a few before school!\" She informs you, jogging to the start line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. In your hurry this morning you forgot to take your medication. It wasn't far, you knew. Just in your backpack on the other side of the track. Still, probably wasn't best to wait too long. You might have been able to sprint the length of this track in less than a minute, but from the moment you felt one of your spells coming on, and you actually shrinking it usually took less than ten seconds. Having your medication on hand was generally a good idea. If you'd only recently taken it it wouldn't be a problem, but you knew you hadn't taken any since yesterday evening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that smile was infectious and you couldn't help yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Emi!\" You declare, and take your place on the start line as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you jog around the track for a few minutes, making idle banter as you go. You realize that Emi is actually remarkably quick as well. But after a few minutes, you begin to feel a familiar tingle. Oh no... not now... anytime but now! You begin to pick up your pace. You're coming around the lap and can see your bag, by the track. Only a single stretch of track to go before you get there. You begin to go into a full out sprint. Emi, notices this, and grins, and begins to speed up as well. She hardly realizes the urgency of your situation! Shrinking out here, next to your new friend? To say nothing of the perils of shrinking in the middle of a track!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you make it in time?</span></div></div>",

After all, you're still human sized.  Sensing the danger has passed, you slow down to a brisk jog as you head back to your bag to get your medicine.  However, Emi notices you've slowed down and looks behind her, obviously wondering why her new running partner eased up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she says, teasingly, \"you're not letting me win 'cause I'm a girl, are you?  Because I'll... whoa, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you shrank a little more than you thought.  While you were initially a head taller than Emi, your eyes now barely meet her chest- an occasional upside to your condition, but one you're too embarrassed to really enjoy for the moment.  You sigh.  While you weren't ashamed of your condition per se, bad memories of your time before Yamaku kept you from wanting to discuss it unless necessary.  Still, no sense hiding it at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to take my medicine today, so I shrank.  It's... kinda why I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Emi said, obviously dumbstruck.  \"That... I've never seen that before.  Wow, Rin will really want to add you to her 'collection'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing not to ask who Rin is or what she meant by that, you walk over to your bag, when you encounter a problem.  It's on a shelf high above the benches where the track team sits during meets.  You wanted it somewhere out of the way, memories of bullies stealing your medicine at your previous school still fresh in your mind.  Unfortunately, this paranoia came back to bite you, as your medicine is now out of reach.  You jump up to try to reach it, but it's obviously a lost cause.  You turn to Emi, who is obviously holding back a laugh, if not at your situation, then at least your childish jumping display just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little help?\" you deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi smiles and balances on the tips of her prosthetics, managing to get your bag.  She opens the pocket and pulls out a pill bottle, presenting it to you with a triumphant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you answer, holding your hand out expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I could get used to someone actually being shorter than me,\" she says looking at the medicine.  Her smile turns to a smirk and holds the pill bottle over you.  \"I'm not sure I want to give this to you now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's kidding... right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yeah, you're not going through this again.  Not after you transferred to a special school for the disabled just to avoid it.  Acting on instinct, you shove Emi and knock the bottle out of her hand.  Grabbing it with your quick reflexes honed from years of living with your condition, you pop the bottle open and swallow a pill in one practiced, fluid motion.  You sigh with relief, knowing you'll be back to normal size within the hour.  You look at your would-be tormentor, prepared to run at a moment's notice if she looks like she'll hurt you in retaliation, though given how fast she is, that might be a futile effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she's not angry.  Just upset, looking at you with an expression like a hurt puppy that has just kicked an even smaller puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... I was just kidding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and remember you're not in a normal high school anymore.  You won't have to deal with bullying here.  Everyone has a story, something keeping them out of normal school.  Emi was no more likely to judge you for your reduction in size than you were for her legs.  She just took her joke too far and hit a sore spot with you, that's all.  You owe her an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you say.  \"It's just... this condition brought me a lot of grief when I attended normal school.  And not just from missing classes because of shrinking either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Emi asks, hurt giving way to curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it didn't take long for word to get out that I shrink.  This isn't exactly normal, after all,\" you say with a grimace.  \"And high school students can be pretty terrible to people that are different.  Especially when you're small enough to throw around like a basketball.  Or stuff in a shoe locker.  Or tape to the chair of a girl you like when she's not looking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trail off when you see the look of growing horror on Emi's face.  You didn't mean to vent at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just... they'd steal my pills so they could do this stuff to me, so it's kind of scary when I think it's happening, even as a joke.  I shouldn't have shoved you, and for that I apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to leave, only for her to run to catch up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too,\" she says.  \"I won't ever joke about that again.\"  She holds out her hand.  \"Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and place your hand in hers, it easily enveloping yours because of your difference in size.  \"Friends,\" you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as she looks at your hand in hers briefly before letting go.  Well meaning or not, you're still a novelty to her, so you don't let it bother you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth,\" she says, looking serious.  \"If I went to school with you, I'd have kicked those students' asses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile.  \"Good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she looks at her sports watch.  \"Oh no, is it that late already?  Shit, I gotta go.  I always check with the nurse after I run, and if I don't leave now, I'll be late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh.  This reminds you.  Technically, you're supposed to see the nurse any time you have a shrinking episode.  This inevitably means a lecture about taking your medicine that you don't really want to sit through right now.  You should be back to normal before class, so you don't think anyone would be the wiser.  But then, you'd get to walk there with the first new friend you've made in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it worth it?</span></div></div>",

After all, if you both decide to run in the mornings, you'll definitely see her again.  You wave goodbye to her and head to the dorms to shower and relax before class starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out you're more right than you know.  You realize today for the first time that she's in your class.  You were so focused on getting used to your surroundings that you never really paid attention to your classmates.  Obviously Emi is the same way, as she seems to just notice you for the first time when your eyes meet.  She smiles and winks, then turns back to the board to pay attention to the teacher's lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she invites you to lunch, when you're introduced to her friend Rin, who is also in your class.  It's here that you learn what Emi meant by Rin's \"collection,\" as the first thing she does when you introduce yourself is ask what your disability is.  Feeling better about it after your long conversation with Emi, you tell her.  She's incredulous to say the least, but luckily Emi's vouching for you keeps you from having to provide a \"demonstration.\"  In short order, you seem to have made yet another new friend, though you're not sure how long you could be in her company alone without going insane and trying to eat your own necktie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days pass uneventfully as you run with Emi in the mornings, eat lunch with her and Rin, and dutifully remember to take your medication.  Until one night, you have a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back at your old school, the size of a bug and taped to a chair.  Once again, you're having a nightmare about the incident that caused you to be withdrawn from normal high school.  You struggle, as you always do, to get free of the tape, when a shadow looms over you.  You glance up to see the enormous rear end of Yuriko, your crush, as it lowers to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YURIKO!\" you yell.  \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt stops.  Years of having to get the attention of normal sized people gave you a hell of a lung capacity, and she hears you with no problem.  Unfortunately, your troubles have just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You!\" She says, eyes narrowed.  \"Are you lying there to get a peek up my skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  No!\" you yell desperately.  \"Those assholes did this to me!  You gotta get this tape off me and help me find my meds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, you did, didn't you.  Pervert!\" She smirks.  She heard you just fine, she just doesn't care.  You realize with dread that the girl of your dreams is just like all the others.  And now you're going to pay for your naivete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perverts need to be punished.  Don't they, everyone?\"  She yells this out to the class.  They know voices are amplified to you when you're shrunken, so they always make sure to speak as loudly as possible when they're tormenting you.  The class responds with hoots and hollers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yuriko!  Smash his guts out!  You show that freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuriko grins evilly and pulls out a mechanical pencil, preparing to jab you in the stomach with it.  You were laid up in the hospital for a long time afterward when this happened in real life.  You still have the scar to this day.  And Yuriko, whose father was your father's boss, never even got in trouble for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone, you bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see Emi, clad in the girl's uniform from your old school, punch Yuriko in the face.  After a moment's hesitation, the rest of the class gangs up on her, and she takes out every single one of them.  It's like watching an action movie on the biggest screen you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tormentors beaten and unconscious on the ground, Emi turns to you and smiles, her school uniform gradually transforming into the Yamaku gym attire she wore when you first got to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  I'm here this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently pulls the tape off of you, picks you up, and cradles you in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll protect you,\" she says softly.  She leans in to kiss you, her lips about to envelope your whole face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the ceiling.  It's still dark outside, well before your alarm goes off for your usual morning run.  You've just realized two very important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, you've fallen in love with with Emi Ibarasaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo, you want to be tiny around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you think.  No.  This is a dumb idea, and you're dumb for even thinking about it...</span></div></div>",

What bad luck you have. We should get your meds now\" Emi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. If I'm not mistaken, there's a bottle of pills containing my medicine in my backpack just nearby the side of the track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, she carries you on her palm and walks right towards your backpack.

Obviously is was Emi's eardrum, and if you hadn't grabbed onto the little hairs, you would've smacked right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat.... could've been bad.  Eardrums were supposedly very sensitive organs, and there's no doubt getting thrown up against it would hurt you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright in there?\" Emi asked from outside, her own voice vibrating her eardrum as the cave shook again.  It had a slight echoic quality to it, no doubt because of the locale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you called, not to outside but toward the drum, to which it vibrated again.  You were amazed by how sensitive Emi's hearing was.

You've been attending this place for just under a week now and you had to admit; despite the obvious, Yamaku is just like any other school you've been to. And you've been to a lot! Your 'disability' is an anxiety-triggered tendency to reduce dramatically in size. Basically, being uncomfortable makes you shrink. You've been known to shrink for seemingly no reason before but you can count on one hand the amount of times that has happened. Anyway, for various reasons, you've been shifted from school to school. Bullies, general environmental hazards and, above all, people just plain didn't know what to do with you. But this place will be different! After all, it's a school that prides itself on handling the individual needs of each and every student whilst ensuring academic success across the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been sticking to the library during your free sessions and break periods. You've never been one for crowded areas and there's always a lady at the desk if you need help with your medicine or whatever. The medicine you take basically brings you back to normal size. Your doctor explained how it works to you when he prescribed them but that was such a long time ago you've not remembered for a while now. But, when you have one of your shrinking episodes, it's hard to get in your bag and open the bottle by yourself so it's nice having someone nearby to help if it comes down to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, science with Mutou just finished so you're headed into the library to get your head down and start studying for the thirty minutes or so. Hanako, a girl in your class is sat on a bean bag at her usual spot. She looks up and you smile at her. That's about the extent of your interaction. Has been since the day you started here. Oh well. You are still new. You're sure she'll come around eventually and, at the very least, say hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden away between two bookshelves is Yuuko, the aforementioned lady who is always at the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and greet her with a chipper \"Morning, Yuuko!\", slightly startling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Oh,\" she smiles softly at you, \"good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't mean to scare you. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's okay, really! I was just deep in thought is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bothering you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't really had a conversation this long with Yuuko, or anyone here, before. It feels nice. You felt like you were starting to bother her, but, this is nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, really. Someone put these books back in alphabetical order according to <i>title</i> instead of <i>author</i> so I'm just re-doing it while I have a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" you still feel like you're bothering her, so you decide to cut the conversation off now. \"Well, I've got stuff to do, too, so, I'll let you carry on. Talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go around the corner to scan the titles of a few books. Nothing catches your eye so you decide to venture over to the graphic novels section. As you get closer, you notice a familiar sensation in your stomach. Oh, great. Looking around, you see the room getting bigger and the ceiling getting further away. You instinctively reach for your bag on your shoulder but stop when you realize it's not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuck.\" you whisper, remembering you left your bag in the classroom. By now, you're barely able to reach the bottom shelf of the bookcase beside you. Looking to your left, you see Yuuko's shoes in the adjacent row to yours. You run under the bookcase and cautiously approach her feet. As you assess her enormous body to figure out the best way to get her attention, a solution hands itself to you in the most dangerous possible way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" you look up at Yuuko to see a giant book coming straight for you. You dive and find yourself cheating death by a split second. Yuuko bends down to pick up the book she clumsily dropped, damn near killing you and you take the opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUUKO!! DOWN HERE!!\" you run around jumping and waving your arms. She seems to be paying you no heed so you scream louder and hop onto the book. \"YUUKO, PLEASE!\" the book shifts underneath you as she grabs it. You see no alternative but to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to Yamaku Academy! The prestigious school for disabled children! You've been attending this place for just under a week now and you had to admit; despite the obvious, Yamaku is just like any other school you've been to.  Your particular disability was a unique one.  At random times, often with little warning or provocation, you would shrink.  Sometimes you just lost and inch, sometimes you'd shrink to less than an inch.  As baffling as it was to anyone who's seen the results, a cure was developed for you.  While not preventative, it would reverse the shrinking process and return you to your normal height.  The campus was specially tailored to assist teenagers with severe ailments and everyone you've met has seemed nice, but you still didn't feel comfortable sharing your condition with others.  Anytime you had shared this information before they either didn't believe you or insist that you let them watch it happen.  Fortunately, you haven't had any episodes yet and to celebrate making it to the weekend, you decided to check out the convenience store down the road from the school.  You picked out some snacks and looked at what else the place had to offer, making mental notes of things you might pick up in the future.  You paid for your items, stowed them in your bag, hit the bathroom, and started to head back to your dorm.  Looking around you saw the entrance to a park not to far away.  On a whim you decided to take a walk through, it wasn't like you had anything pressing to do.  The setting sun peeking through the trees was really quite beautiful.  Your pleasant mood didn't last though, as you felt a familiar tingle throughout your body.  You clutched your head and nearly lost your balance as you stumbled onto a nearby bench as you felt the onset of a shrinking episode.  You drew some deep breaths as you waited for the effects to pass.  You opened your eyes and were revealed to find that you seemed to still be at an acceptable size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK there kid?\" An concerned voice asks from immediately next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to your right to see a blonde woman in a pinstripe suit.  She had a black bag at her side, a can in her hand, and a worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I'm fine, really.  Thanks,\" You try to assure, doing your best to wipe any look of fear from your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to try to act tough for me kid.  You go to Yamaku right?\" She asks, seeming to take you at your word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" You answer.  \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did stagger around like you were having some kind of attack before flopping down next to a stranger despite the fact that there is an empty spot 10 feet away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch, does this school have a bad reputation that nobody told you about?  It is a school for cripples, maybe the nearby town has had some issues in the past.  You were pulled out of your thoughts by the sound of snickering.  Looking back over you could see that this sharp-dressed woman was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kidding kid, I recognize the uniform,\" She confesses, still chuckling visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Oh good.  Here I was thinking I made a fool of myself in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, maybe that was a little too mean to say to a stranger,\" She relents, taking a sip from her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  I'm sorry I bothered you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" She replies, her voice oddly soothing, \"I don't mind spending a little time with someone new.  Akira Satou.\"  She extends her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you Ms, Satou,\" You say as you shake her hand.  Her name sounds familiar but you can't place it.  \"Do you live in the area?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm just visiting my sister, you might know her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, I just transferred here.  In fact this is my first time off campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"  She takes another swig from her drink and looks off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the conversation drying up, you looked over this interesting new acquaintance of yours.  She looked like a foreigner judging from her height and hair, reminding you of someone you meet at school.  You had met several unusual characters in your short time at Yamaku, but you hadn't really connected with anyone yet so you couldn't really remember who she reminded you of.  She certainly looked like a professional with her business suit.  From a distance you might have mistaken her for a man, though she was a little slender.  Close up though it was easy to see that she had plenty of feminine features though.  Glancing at the can she was holding, you identified it as beer but didn't recognize the brand.  Before you could think of something else to talk about, the tingle came back.  It was rare for you to have two episodes in a row, but you usually took your medicine right after the first.  You reach for your bag before you realize that you didn't have it.  Crap, you must have left it back in the bathroom at the convenience store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're alright kid?  You seem worried about something,\" Akira asks, concern returning to her face and voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just realized that need to go take my medicine,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a ride back to campus?  I can drive you there quick if you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it in my bag a the store just down the street but thank you very much for the offer.\"  She still looks concerned and you can't help but feel a little touched by her kindness.  \" I'm at no risk of keeling over if that's what you're thinking.  It was very nice meeting you Ms. Satou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akira is fine kid,\" She says as she leans back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.  Goodbye Akira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see ya if I see ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up to leave as she takes another sip of beer.  The second you turn you back on her, you feel bolt shoot through your body.  You close your eyes and try to call out, but you find yourself unable to speak.  You feel strange, like you were falling a great distance.  When it was over, you found that you were flat on your back, lying on the hard ground.  You pick yourself up and rub your head before allowing your eyes to open.  To your horror, you found that you had shrunk and landed on a bench.  Judging from the size of the bench, you were and inch tall at most.  The sound of something shifting behind you caused you to turn around.  Your jaw dropped at the sight of the now giant Akira.  It's a good thing that you made friends with her because you were now in desperate need of her help.  Did she notice what happened to you?</span></div></div>",

It seemed to do the trick as after a few surprised blinks, she leaned in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... are you a person?\" She asks, almost doubting her own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess.  \"Akria!  It's me!  Please pick me up!\" You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down but instead of letting you climb onto her palm like you had hoped, she plucked you up, pinching your torso between her thumb and finger, and quickly brought you up to her face.  You didn't like to be held this way.  It always felt like there was a reasonable chance of getting crushed or dropped.  Though your instincts told you to struggle, you stayed still so not to exacerbate things.  Akira's giant pupils scanned your tiny form.  You were so close and small that you could see the bits of dust in her eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid?  What happened to you?\"  She asked astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God she recognized you, that made things a lot easier.  \"Well... this is the reason I go to Yamaku.  At random times I just... shrink.  Sometimes it's only and inch or two.  Sometimes it's... this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how long does it last?\" She asks.  Her voice was concerned, but it was clear she was still wrapping her mind around the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't wear off.  I mean my medicine reverses the effect, but without it I'm stuck at this size,\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you left it back at the mini-mart right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a sigh before tilling her head back and draining her can of its remaining contents. Her gulping throat pulses in front of you and it's a little intimidating.  You can even here the liquid flowing down to her depths.  You are broken out of your trance by a refreshed \"Ahh\", accompanied by a moist, spicy wind.  Akira had unintentionally blasted you with a lukewarm, wheaty breath in appreciation of her drink.  It was a bit odd smelling, but at least it wasn't a burp.  With her beverage empty, she tossed it into a nearby garbage can and carefully dropped you into her suit's breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang tight in there kid.  I'll get you back to normal in normal in no time.\"  Her voice was a little muffled by the fabric, but she sounded confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see anything in the dark pocket, but you could certainly feel that she was walking.  The walls were tight, but not crushing.  The soft material was fairly comfortable, not to mention slick enough so that the movement of the jacket didn't rub you raw.  You could smell a hint of perfume seeping through her clothing and you couldn't help but think about how only a few thin layers were separating you from her boob.  She looked somewhat flat-chested before, but each of her girls were still the size of a building to you at the moment.  Combined with the warmth and her soothing heartbeat, you felt yourself starting to slip away from consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour daydreaming was interrupted a few minutes later by Akira's voice. \"Kid, you still with me in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm doing fine,\" You shout.  \"Did you find my bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replies...</span></div></div>",

You hadn't been gone that long but apparently it was long enough for some degenerate to make off with your recently purchased snacks, not to mention your medicine.  Anti-shrink serum was not something you could just get at a pharmacy.  It was specially made just for you by its creators in small batches.  You didn't know if it was expensive or time consuming to make, but they had made it clear to you that you needed to give them 6 weeks notice before you ran out.  The one bottle was supposed to last you months and now it was lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid.\"  You were brought back to reality by Akira's voice.  \"Do you have some more back home?  I can give you a ride when I'm done with my plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer Akira, but that stuff is specially made and takes weeks to order.  I... I think I'm going to be stuck like this for a while.\"  You didn't mean to sound so down, but you couldn't help it.  You realized that you were going to have more than a little trouble doing schoolwork now that all of your supplies were 100x bigger than they were suppose to be.  Reading and homework would be impossible, and while you could attend lectures, note taking would be beyond your reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn kid, that's rough,\" Akira said with some dejection.  She used her free hand to scratch the back of her head and her face told you that she was thinking about something.  \"Who makes the stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pharmaceutical company called Macro Pharma,\" You reply.  \"They're not well known since I'm the only person they've ever directly helped.  I'll have to call them as soon as possible so they can get started my new meds.  I've got the number back at my place so... if that ride is still available...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a toothy grin, \"Sure kid.  Like I said I can take you after I...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried calling out to her but at this size, it was impossible for her to hear you this far away.  If she was listening for you or you were right next to her ear you'd probably be OK, but it was going to take some effort on your end to satisfy either of those conditions.  As dangerous as it was to come into contact with a giant, unaware woman, you had to get her attention before she left.  If you were left on this bench while the size of an ant, you'd likely be sat on by the next person to rest or eaten by some wild animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stated by scaling her bag as it was leaning up against her arm.  With the small groves in the dark leather and the angled assent, it was actually a pretty easy climb.  You made it to the top in about a minute, less than a stones throw away from her suit sleeve.  The problem now was that you'd have to jump over the narrow opening that was the top of the bag.  It wasn't a large jump as it was only cracked open, but you'd have to grab onto the smooth fabric to avoid tumbling into the darkness below.  You leaned back as far as you could and leaped towards the nearest pinstripe.  </span></div></div>",

Now you just had to make your way straight up an arm the size of a tall building before you lost your grip or fell off.  Realizing you had no time to waste, you began climbing.  The task was actually less difficult than you had expected.  There were more than enough fine threads that you could grab onto and they weren't too rough on your skin either.  Must be a very high quality suit.  What exactly did Akira do for a living?  The climb itself was fortunately uneventful.  Akira seemed content to just sit quietly and enjoy the sounds of the park.  Occasionally she would take a swig of beer, but she was holding it in her other hand so the movement didn't bother you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, you reached her shoulder and thankfully hoisted yourself onto the soft pad sewn  into the suit.  As tired as your arms were you couldn't rest yet.  Akira's ear was in sight, partially obscured by her short, blonde hair.  A small red stud stood out, giving you a spot to focus on for the next part of your plan, shouting as loud as you could.  Now that you were this close, She should be able to hear you... hopefully.  You filled up your lungs and called out, \"AKIRA!  LOOK ON YOUR SHOULDER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, you could really feel her body moving beneath you.  Her head was moving, she heard you!

Her massive, red eyes were looking down near you,  If only they had been looking at you instead.  Akira only gave her shoulder a quick glance before she started to turn away.  Whether she didn't look down far enough or her nose was in the way, she failed to spot you and was turning to check her other shoulder.  You were so distraught that she failed to see you, you failed to she the back of her hair swinging towards you.  The gentle sway of her golden locks had enough force to knock you clean off her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira, turned her attention away from the fauna to see if that kid was having anymore trouble on his way back to the convenience store.  Surprisingly he was completely out of sight already.  Guess he was alright after all.  She took another sip of her drink and continued to enjoy her quiet time.  This was easily her favorite park in the area as it was far enough from the city to feel like she had actually escaped the hustle and bustle.  She just took in the sounds and smells of the area while she slowly enjoyed her beverage.  The peace was broken by a faint noise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Akira... shoulder\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that a voice?  Curious, she glanced at her left shoulder, the direction she thought she heard the noise come from.  Nothing obvious over there.  She checked her other side to be thorough, not a soul in sight.  Shrugging, she moved to finish her drink and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so surprised by the soft impact of Akira's hair, you didn't shout until you were flying through the air.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your terrifying descent completely erased any progress you made in getting Akira's attention. You'd be frustrated if you weren't so paralysed with fear. You always had a feeling your condition would be what killed you one day. You just didn't think your life would be this anti-climatic. Is this really how it's going to end? A whole childhood, a life that had barely begun, snuffed out by a simple head turn of a titaness businesswoman. These thoughts and a thousand more crossed your mind in a matter of milliseconds before everything went dark. <i>'Am I dead?</i>, you wondered, <i>'I always thought death would be a lot more painf--'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPLASH</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly found yourself in some cold liquid. You thrashed around in a state of panic before managing to gain some form of composure and resurface. You gasped for sweet air and began to take note of your surroundings. The air had a boozy mugginess to it. The liquid around you had foamed from your recent impact. The only source of light came from a small hole on the ceiling through which you could see the outside world. You knew exactly where you were but your brain hadn't quite accepted it yet. Through some bizarre version of a miracle, your life had been saved by a can of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at your miraculous survival. You didn't have the mathematical know-how to calculate the odds but you'd beaten them! However, your celebrations were cut short by the realisation that a whole new problem had presented itself. A problem even more dangerous than the last; <i>'How do I get out of here?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AKIRA!! AKIRA! I'M STUCK IN HERE! HELP!!\" your voice echoed through the tin prison but not enough to gain the attention of your unbeknownst captor. You swam to the wall and began hitting it as hard as you could, but just staying afloat had worn you out so much already. You couldn't make as much noise as you'd hoped and saw no sense in exerting yourself anymore than you had. You considered drinking the rest of the beer so you wouldn't drown but at your size, you'd be passed out drunk, floating around in the beer like a dead insect before you even got a quarter of the way done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AKIRAAA!!!\" you tried again, fresh out of ideas. Maybe you are going to die today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the beer started moving. The current sent you toward the other side of the can. Had she heard you? Did that really just work? You looked up at the ceiling hoping to see a giant eyeball peering down at you, or a tiny piece of string for you to hold on to. Instead, you were greeted with a sight you never realised could be so horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira's mouth was wide open, ready to accept the glorious bounty of booze that lay deep within the can. The entire prison tipped and the alcohol carried you along to your fate. You swam desperately against the herculean current but you didn't stand a chance. It wasn't long before the can was completely upside down and you were once again submerged under the surface. You swallowed what felt like pint after pint of beer as you struggled for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried and tried to swim to whatever source of air you could find, something big and warm prodded you. You had no idea what was going on but you clinged to it, praying it would be some sort of salvation. The Fleshy Prodder pushed you against an squishy, equally warm, wall and the beer was suddenly drained all around you. You took a huge swig of the air once again only to find it didn't seem as fresh this time. The Fleshy Prodder let you go and you managed to get a brief look at your new surroundings. It was dark again but much hotter. It still had that beer smell but had remnants of other things. Food and the like perhaps. Putting two and two together, you realised you were in Akira's mouth! And The Fleshy Prodder that saved you was her toungue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you got a chance to panic, a flood of light entered and you found yourself yet again being emptied out of your prison. You landed with a wet slap against Akira's hand and made no attempt to stand. You were too tired to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this?\" Akira says, holding you up to her face. \"Is that a person?!\" she held you between her thumb and finger and dangled you in front of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akira, please don't freak out! I can explain.\" You say as quickly as you can. You feel a slight fuzziness in your head, no doubt due to the beer you'd consumed a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my god. It's you! What is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go to Yamaku. This is my condition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>shrink?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyup.\" you surprise yourself with how well you're taking this. Maybe that beer is having a bigger effect on you than you'd anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well what am I supposed to do?! Take you back to the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, no way!! I ain't in no mood for school today, not now, let's go do summin'!\" you have definitely become inebriated. Part of you knows you're acting like a tool but your brain is saying <i>'who cares?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in my beer?\" Akira asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fell. You knocked me off your shoulder and I fell right in there. It was all like 'swish!!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, and did you, um... drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit. Which I guess to me is a lot'a bit! Geddit? 'Cuz I'm so little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Akira dialled a number on her phone. \"Hey, it's me. Yeah, I'm going to need the rest of the day off. It's a um, family issue. I'll explain to you tomorrow. Okay. Great. Thanks, bye.\" she hangs up and stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, lets go do something.\" She grabs her bag and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, where we going?\" you ask, surprised she's actually agreed to your absurd idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking you back to Yamaku until you sober up. So you're stuck with me until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" you repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
