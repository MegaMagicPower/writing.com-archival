Resisting the urge to call out for help she tried to look around herself. All she could really make out was that she appeared to be in a cage. She also noticed that her legs were pushed apart by a diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A diaper?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took pause at that for a moment, yet was not as worried about it as she could've been. In fact, she very quickly stopped paying attention to it as though it was something she was used to wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment  a door opened and in walked Princess Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?! What's going on?\" Twilight asked, certain that Celestia would get her out of this strange situation. As Celestia walked inside the room, Twilight noticed she was in a giant nursery sized for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning my little pony.\" Celestia said sweetly, \"As to what's going on is simple, you are my foal.\"  Twilight was confused. \"I've noticed how stressed you've been as a princess lately and I've missed taking care of you when you were young. So I decided to turn you into a little foal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was worried now. She didn't want to be a foal. \"Princess Celestia, this is a good practical joke and all, but I think it's time to let me go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia merely laughed, \"Joke? this isn't a joke. You are now my foal. Unfortunately the spells needed to make you a foal completely take time. Though the first ones have already been placed. First, I had to take this.\" Twilight froze in horror as Celestia held up a jar containing her cutie mark. \"Starlight Glimmer made for such a great trial run after I managed to get her to teach me this spell. Luna got her own foal out of it too! Second was a targeted memory spell. Everything else takes time to activate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was more than just worried now, her mentor had gone insane. Twilight was tense all over, yet for some reason the tenseness around her stomach began to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In fact that second spell erased every memory you've ever had about potty training. You can't even remember what it feels like to need use a toilet do you?\" Twilight froze at her former mentors words as she looked down and noticed what she had just done.</span></div></div>",

From there, she calmly trotted her way to her closet, using her Unicorn magic to open the closet doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this revealed several large plastic packages, which contained some rather ridiculously large diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight couldn't help but bear a giddy grin upon her equine snout, as she levitated an opened package towards her and pulled out a bombastically bulky diaper, which inflated to it's full size with an audible *FWOOMPH!!* in response to being freed from captivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the diaper was far too bulky and padded to be the complete opposite of discreet, as it was colored a rich light violet hue and possessed six diaper tapes instead of the usual four. Overall, the diaper held in Twilight's possession was downright massive, as she easily felt the childish excitement and anticipation swell within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* Well, I know a certain somepony who would love to wear you today.\" Twilight said, speaking to the bulky undergarment like it was sentient. From there, she cleaned herself off, then powdered her privates, and finally put on the diaper, strapping the six diaper tapes upon her diapered crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she stood back up on all four hooves, Twilight soon felt the diaper's bulk in all it's entirety, where it forcibly pushed her hindlegs a decent bit sideways, thus giving herself a waddling gait. In all honesty, this was how Twilight preferred her diapers to be; Thick, Bulky, and Downright Plushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at her reflection, she slowly turned herself around to put her diaper on full display, wiggling her diapered buttocks to and fro in an experimental and cutesy shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but giggle with glee at how it felt, as the diaper crinkle loudly while it shook some. However, whilst she was enjoying herself, Twilight soon felt the pangs of hunger, with her stomach growling in protest, where she looked down at her stomach and said, \"I guess I better get some breakfast before Moondancer comes to visit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she trotted, or rather \"waddled\", her way down the stairs, as Twilight heard the comically large diaper crinkle audibly with each waddling step she took on the staircase, with the equally bulky front of the diaper briefly bumping into the staircase with each passing step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a brief delay, Twilight finally made it downstairs, where...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight made some toast, almost giddy at the thought of completely filling the massive diaper covering her backside all at once. Was she going crazy? Was this too much? She couldn't think of anything that would make this <i>dangerous,</i> so she decided she would follow through on this idea she had. This respected student of magic was going to magically speed up - <i>and increase the volume of</i> - her waste, to fill a diaper that was so thick she couldn't walk right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight felt very full, and took to waddling over to her books to find the ones she'd need for this endeavor. After a few minutes of looking through her books, she found one for metabolizing food incredibly quickly, and she already had known of the one to multiply the amount of something, but needed a refresher on it. While, looking through the books, she thought that maybe she could slightly adjust them to be gradual, and to begin shortly after the spell is cast, so she could focus all her attention on the feeling of wetting and messing the diaper that she highly anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight decided she would grab some cleaning supplies in case she'd need it, like any responsible student would prepare for a mess while conducting an experiment, and would do it in the bathroom, since it's even more private and easy to clean by design. Then she was off - waddling to the place she stored cleaning supplies, then to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door, and stood in the middle of the room. It was time for the metabolization spell. <br>\r\nThe highly skilled magical pony's horn began to radiate a purple glow, as she started casting the spell. Upon finishing the spell, her horn let out a flash of purple light, as if to vent out whatever kind of energy it needed to when a unicorn needed to cast most spells, or just part of their design so it could show off their abilities.<br>\r\nTwilight stood in the bathroom, waiting for it to take effect, when she could feel a slight tightening in her abdomen. Her belly began to make low growling noises, and slightly ached. She waited eagerly for the moment she could fill this mass of padding secured to her backside, and started to feel her bladder slowly filling, then her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight then started to cast the multiplication spell, as she could feel herself filling up bit by bit, then let go. She felt the urine flow out of her, first a trickle, then quickly sped up, and poop was pushed out rather quickly, startling Twilight a bit. Then the multiplication began to make its work. Pee was rushing out of her almost faster than the diaper could soak up, gently lapping at her, and her mess was already starting to push up against her, if only stopped by the continuing log of waste coming out of Twilight's ass. She could even feel the diaper getting heavier. The flow was unrelenting, and could not be stopped for as long as the multiplication spell was in effect. The diaper may have been big and bulky before, but all this waste was going to make it even bigger by the time it was done. Mess was starting to collect more and more, spreading from the base of her tail to making its way to her front, and piss was flowing strong as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell began to slow down, and so did the flow. Then the diaper seemed to be approaching its limit. Twilight, coming back into reality, started to take a look at the diaper to see the last few moments of the filling process, and was surprised to see how much the diaper had swelled up from its original size. It was just a few inches off the floor, and looked like it was about to leak. Twilight tried to hold the rest of it, but it was hard. She could only slow it, but could not stop peeing and pooping entirely. It slowed, then got faster, then slowed, Twilight tried, then it was too late. As the last of the urine was expelled, she continues to poop. The leg holes started to leak, dripping down the sides of the diaper, and down her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was finally empty, and her diaper dripped a last few drops into the small puddles under her. Twilight marveled at the absolute size of the diaper. It was so close to the ground. Poop was covering nearly her entire buttocks and crotch, pressing up against them. Urine was making the diaper impossibly large and squishy. Twilight...</span></div></div>",

Very discreetly Celly's horn flashed and branched out to everypony's stomach without their notice though it looked like nothing had happened at all. But within a minute, the task of keeping their bowels in check became more strenuous than they could hold. Applebloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle took off running for the only three bathrooms that occupied the Apple house, having known where they lied through multiple sleepovers there, and relieved themselves quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Foals\" in the room got the more powerful side of the spell. Applejack tried her best to hold it but, it was apparent it was a losing fight and let her diaper filled up completely and turn brown. Lulu and Celly didn't even try to combat the feeling as they let nature take it's course and filled their diapers to the same extent, and started suckling on their front hooves for more enjoyment. Fluttershy was so startled by her own stomach that she finished her diaper and didn't even know it till she laid down and covered her face with her trembling hooves, shyly smiling as the feeling underneath her gave her a sense of bliss unknown before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity was the only one who audibly fought to hold it in. She tossed and turned trying to stop from doing what she knew would inevitably happen. \" I'm a big pony\", she repeatedly said, hoping her words would give her the strength needed to hold it in. She was so determined not to get messy that she almost made remained clean, had the three fillies not come back at that certain time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViewing everyone else in dirty diapers, they watched as Rarity kept struggling to stay pristinely lady like in her babied condition. \" Hey\", said a giggling Sweetie Belle to the others,\"looks like one of our foals is having trouble. Let's go and help her out.\" The three Cutie Mark Crusaders smiled devillishly together and rapidly launched themselves at Rarity, who was too busy still holding, as she didn't notice till it was too late when the CMC started...       </span></div></div>",

Scootaloo was using her wing tips to wiggle all around the mares larger, manicured hooves. She tried to fight them off but just couldn't form enough strength to push them off. She could feel her control starting to fail from the first fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity. You should let go. Then we'll make you more comfortable.\" Sweetie Belle said to the \"big baby\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the tiny tickle tirade from the first two, Rarity was able to breathe out a \"no\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that was said, Sweetie brought in the big guns. As she was already on her back, Sweetie causually cantered over and started blowing rasberries into her stomach. She started laughing so hard she lost all control. Her diaper started sag and smell, but she didn't notice as Sweetie nuzzled the physicaly tired unicorn and and placed her in a onesie that had no back leg sleeves so it forced her diaper to be pushed up against her butt and spread her mess around.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other foals looked on in horrified enjoyment.

Celly, Woona, and Fluttershy on the other hoof were nothing but smiles, as they were enjoying their treatment. Applebloom, Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle began to feed Celestia, Luna and Fluttershy, while Rarity and Applejack waited their turn. As soon as the bowl was placed in front of Rarity, she instinctively tried to raise the spoon with her magic, causing her diaper to inflate further, pushing her crotch against the front of her highchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cewestia Dwamit!\" Rarity yelled in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if ah cwould\" Celly giggled, as she accepted another spoonful of pureed carrot from Sweetie Belle. The three mares being fed accepted each spoonful into their mouths, enjoying every second of their time as foals. It was a shame it had to eventually end, since they couldn't possibly keep them as foals forever, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Woona, Celly, and Fluttershy's bowls were all empty, Sweetie Belle and Applebloom moved over to Rarity and Applejack, respectively, while Scootaloo took a wet cloth and began to clean up the other foals. Sweetie Belle levitated the spoon into the puree mush, grabbed a large spoonful, and floated it up just in front of Rarity's face. Rarity turned her head away and shut her mouth with a \"hmmph\". Sweetie Belle was expecting this, and began to try and coax Rarity into accepting the baby food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide Rarity, here comes the Friendship Express!\" Sweetie Belle said, as she moved the spoon around in mid-air. Rarity didn't budge. \"Aww come on Rarity, you wouldn't want to make your big sister sad, would you?\" Sweetie pouted, creating a face that would melt the hearts of many ponies. Rarity, however, remained firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Sweetie Belle started to get annoyed. \"Look Rarity, you're eating this baby food. Now, would you like to do it the easy way, or the hard way?\" Rarity simply sat there, refusing to let her sister win. Sweetie Belle\u2019s smile turned into a frown. \"Fine then. Looks like it's going to have to be the hard way\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle gently put the full spoon down on the high chair. With a quick flick of her horn, she grabbed Rarity's head firmly with her magic and forced her to look straight at Sweetie Belle. Four magical tendrils then crawled over Rarity's cheeks towards her mouth. One by one, they crawled in between her lips, slowly forcing her mouth wide open. Rarity tried to muffle an outcry, but only \"Hhwuaa!\" made it past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rarity, but you refused to cooperate.\" Sweetie Belle said sternly. With Rarity's head held in place, and her mouth wide open, Sweetie once again picked up the full spoon and levitated into Rarity's mouth. Once the puree was deposited on to Rarity\u2019s tongue, the tendrils shut her mouth tightly. \"Good. Now swallow my little foal\", Sweetie Belle said, quite menacingly. Rarity had no choice but to swallow the disgusting mush that was in her mouth. She felt it sloppily slide down her throat, and began to quietly cry to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't cry Rarity... There's only about ten spoonfuls left\u2026\", Sweetie cooed, opening Rarity's mouth again for another helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the room, Applebloom was getting ready to feed her own \"little\" sister. \"Now, are ya gonna be ah good foal and eat ya mush, 'er am ah gonna have 'ta force it down like Sweetie Belle?\", Applebloom inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll eat ya fwood sis, but cwan ah twalk to ya fer a swecond?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little foals aren't supposed 'ta talk, but ah guess ah can let it slide just this once\", Applebloom teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's jwust that, dis was s'pposed to be mah spwecial time. Mah one chance of enwoying diapahs tha way ah wike 'em. Then all of a swudden you and yer fwiends show up, awong with fwour other ponies, and now your fworcing us to do tings we dun wanna do!\". Applejack said, hoping her sister would understand her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Applejack, ah know ya wanted this to be yah special time, but this a'int just about you. We 'ave a chance of getting our babysitt'in cutie marks here, ahnd ah'm not going tah let something like that jus' slip by!\" Applebloom declared. \"Besides, we're not gonna keep ya like this forever, jus' til the end of the day, alright? Now, stop yapping and start eating!\" Applebloom finished, as she shoved the spoon into Applejack's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack reluctantly swallowed the mush. \"Alwight, but can I at weast 'ave mah diapah chwanged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya might wanna keep em on fer jus' a bit longer,\" Applebloom smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack raised her eyebrow at this, just before she felt an overwhelming pressure in her bowels. \"Aw no! Not again! Pwease!\" Applejack doubled over in her highchair before releasing yet another wet load into her already overflowing diaper. If it wasn't full to the brim yet, it was now. Applejack could feel the manure in her diaper pushing against her from all angles, squeezing her tender areas. It pushed itself into every crack below her waist. Applejack was sure that she had a rash now, and was now begging to her sister to be changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I jus' saw about speakin'?\" Applebloom said angrily, pushing the pacifier with a strap back into Applejack's mouth. Applejack's groans and pleas were silenced instantly, replaced with quiet suckling sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dun worry, though. I also think its high time for a change. I'll do it once we're back upstairs\", Applebloom whispered to her sister. Applejack was slightly relieved, knowing that her extreme discomfort would soon be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time, each of the other foals began groaning in their highchairs as well, before promptly letting out a series of wet farts, followed by large lumps of manure accumulating inside their diapers. \"Well Sweetie Belle, looks like those laxatives worked almost too well!\" Scootaloo mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everypony just relax\", Sweetie said to the foals, \"your mommies are here to take care of you all\". Sweetie Belle levitated the pacifier gags back into the squirming foal's mouths, and began to free them from their high chairs. Fluttershy was again the only foal to receive a pacifier that could be removed, not that she had any intention of doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foals were taken back upstairs to the nursery, and were laid down on the soft carpet floor. As Applejack was put down, she looked towards her sister and pleaded through her pacifier for the change she was promised. Applebloom noticed this, and while her friends were setting every other foal down in the nursery, Applebloom decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Applebloom prepared herself for the mess she was about to face, and undid the tapes on the overflowing diaper. A terrible smell instantly filled the air, causing Applebloom to wince. A thick layer of manure caked to her sister's lower body was also revealed, leading Applebloom to reconsider leaving her sister in a diaper again for so long. Piece by piece, wipe by wipe, Applejack was finally sparkling clean again. Although, to her dismay, she did have one heck of a diaper rash. Applejack flinched as a healthy dollop of rash cream was applied to the affected area. Applebloom spread it around evenly with her hoof until she was satisfied with the results. Next, she took the bottle of foal powder and shook a generous amount of it onto Applejack's lower body. A new diaper was then placed under her, and quickly taped tightly around her waist. It was once again fused with magic, making Applejack unable to take it off on her own. She was, however, relieved that she didn't have to drag around a diaper-load of manure anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack smiled behind her pacifier, as Applebloom gave her diaper a quick set of pats before setting her back down on the carpeted floor. Just then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was about to open the diaper, when Sweetie Belle noticed what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applebloom, what are you doing?\" Sweetie Belle said. Scootaloo, also hearing this, also turned around and glanced at Applebloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was just thinkin'... Applejack's had a pretty rough day, perhaps we ought'a give 'er a diaper change?\" Applebloom said with a worried smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\". Sweetie Belle replied. \"Applejack is our foal, and she's not getting changed until she's ready\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just look at her diaper!\" Applebloom exclaimed. \"It's practically overflowing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you're right. We should fix that.\" Sweetie Belle grinned, as she lit up her horn with magic. Suddenly, Applejack was lifted up into the air. Magic curled around her diaper, slowly massaging the mess inside. Suddenly, the sides of the diaper began to grow. The lining of the diaper expanded outwards. More frills grew along the length of the diaper. The elastic holes pressed against Applejack's legs and waist tightened, preventing any chance for the waste inside to escape. Applebloom watched with a distressed expression as her sister's diaper grew nearly twice it's size. Applejack simply moaned into her pacifier, waiting for the whole ordeal to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sweetie Belle was finished with her spell, she slowly levitated the orange pony down on the floor. \"There. Now there's room for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack looked down at the enormous diaper between her legs and whimpered. Sweetie Belle then pulled Applebloom over to the other side of the room to talk. She looked Applebloom in the eye. \"Now that that's over with, I never want to see you try and defy me again.\" Sweeite Belle said sternly. \"What are we doing this for again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get our cutiemarks...\" Applebloom glumly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Now I don't see a cutiemark on either of our flanks, which means we have to keep trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when if baby sitting ain't our thing?\" Applebloom inquired, trying to reason with the other filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Applebloom, we've only been at this for a couple hours, you need to give it more time. How does until the end of the day sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ah guess that makes sense\", Applebloom said, breaking a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" Sweetie Belle giggled. \"Now that everypony's back in order, what should we do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Scootaloo began, \"The babies are looking kind of ...\"</span></div></div>",

Applebloom pounced on her front hooves and held them down as Sweetie held the fashionista's mouth open with her magic and Scootaloo pushing the bottle into her lips. Rarity saw what they had and refused to start suckling on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Come on Rar-Rar, you need to drink. \" Applebloom said as she kept her hooves from removing the bottle from her lips.

She pushed a mouthful of the tainted sweet liquid into her mouth and and held the bottle to keep her from pushing it out. She then covered her nose and waited.

The girls repeated the process until Rarity had ingested all of the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laxitives had started as soon as the Crusaders stepped off and patted her diapered bottom.

Her day had started off with a hectic schedule, giving her no leeway as she had been assigned to make sure that a large downpour of rain happened three days from now. It was going to be a severe storm, but the town had handled far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash flew around, pushing clouds together and apart, making sure they would go in the proper direction or release the proper amount of rain. It was tedious, but nothing she couldn't handle. After all, she had saved Equestria more times than she could count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash wiped some sweat off her brow, pushing her rainbow mane out of her purple eyes. She looked around to see the others hard at work, doing the same thing as her. All but one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy moved a rather black cloud out into the open sky, away from the rest of the clouds. Sometimes she could be such a klutz. Dash groaned in annoyance as she flew from her original spot in the sky to Derpy's location in less than three seconds, putting herself in front of the cross eyed mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy, what do you think you're doing?!\" Dash chastised, \"The storm clouds are suppose to be that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy's ears drooped as she looked apologetically at the brash mare in front of her. \"I'm sorry. I just thought that the east side of Ponyville would need more rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Derpy was sincere, Dash was already too far into her rant. Dash continued with her rant saying, \"I don't know what you were thinking, but you need to stop thinking like that! Follow the plan! Now give me the cloud, I'll fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy was having trouble figuring out her emotions as she just lamely put her head down before saying, \"You don't need to do that. I can put it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't. Now give it here before you really mess something up,\" Dash said. Though she was generally a lax mare, she was also a winner, sometimes letting her desire to get things done overwhelm her emotions. However, Derpy did not care. She had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy jumped on top of the cloud, staring at Dash with anger. \"I don't know why you're being so mean!\" Derpy stepped foward, causing the cloud to start making noticeable rumbling, \"I am trying, but I just can't do anything right. huh?\" Derpy took another step, causing even more rumbling to come from the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash noticed the rumbling. \"Derpy, I-\" She was stopped mid-sentence by Derpy as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't think I can do anything right, then fine!\" Derpy jumped off the cloud, sparking coming from the inside of the black form. Derpy then raised her hind legs before saying, \"Take your stupid cloud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy kicked the cloud and that was all that was needed as the cloud spewed lightning and hit Dash. Dash screamed in pain as she fell to the ground. Derpy and the rest of the crew that had been watching flew down as fast as they could to see if their captain was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy was the first to reach the ground  and saw Dash...</span></div></div>",

She glanced over at Derpy, before she sighed. \"Derpy, I'm sorry. I'm just stressed is all. This is a really tight deadline and I need this done as fast as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gave a smile as she responded happily, \"Apology accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gave each other a quick hug before Dash separated quickly from the embrace with a grin on her face. The team, including Derpy, flew off, but before Dash could get off the ground, she felt her tail hike involuntarily as she slightly squatted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash began to mess herself in the open fields of Ponyville. She hadn't even felt it! Her bowels strained as they pushed out her mess, it fell to the ground in soft lumps, hitting the grass with a squelching sound. Dash blushed furiously at what was happening. Luckily, no one was around to see this, but she swerved her eyes in all directions just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her bowels relaxed as she gave a content sigh, before her blush and reason returned.

Either way, she knew she needed to find a way to fix this quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash thought about her options. There weren't many good ones that came to mid.

She had wanted a better solution, but she didn't want to tarnish her reputation because she told somepony about her problems. She just couldn't live it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash flew down to the town square of Ponyville. She never came down here that often unless it was to restock her pantry or to go to Twilight's castle, but today was a special occasion. She flew down to the streets before she folded her wings in and began walking towards on of the town stores that was near the outskirts of the market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather shabby old cottage like the rest in Ponyville, but a rustic sign was hung above the door that read <i>Sunny's general goods</i>. The people there were nice enough, they were always happy to have her as a customer in her store, but Dash wasn't concerned about the people, she was concerned about the products. The store had several goods including a section for people with incontinence. It was the only store with that section. Sadly, the section was hardly used, considering that there were very few ponies with incontinence in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash walked into the store to see the smiling face of the cashier, Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good afternoon, miss. Can I help you with anything?\" Sunny asked. Dash blushed slightly, but responded with a quick no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash walked to the incontinence aisle, before turning into it and walking down the aisle. There were so many brands of diapers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe section was littered with diapers of all sizes and colors. Some even had different features like wetness indicators. Dash continued her walk until she reached the diapers that would fit her. They were all of the same basic medical design. All of them seemed generally the same with no difference but the packages. It was hard to tell which one was the better pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you found our incontinence section.\" Dash recoiled away from the voice with a slight yelp. Apparently Sunny had decided to check on her customer and found her staring at all the diaper brands. Sunny smiled as she watched Dash calm herself with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" Dash said nervously, \"I was just a bit curious is all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny looked curiously at Dash. \"What about?\" she inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash, with a blush, decided to answer. Maybe this mare could help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was curious about what diaper would be best for a pony with- uh... bowel problems...\" Dash said, the last part being barely above a whisper. Dash looked across the aisle, before eyeing a random package and picking it up, \"But I think I found what I was looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash put on a fake smile as she held the package with her fore-hoof. Sunny frowned as she looked at the package of diapers in Dash's hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you want that brand for bowel problems,\" Sunny said calmly, \"<i>Inconti-mare</i> doesn't really deter odor well, so ponies would really notice the stigma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny then went to pull out another package of diapers at the bottom of the shelf. \"<i>Silly Filly</i> however does a much better job,\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash looked at the package in her hoof, before she looked at the package in Sunny's.Dash said, \"Those diapers seem a lot thicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny gave a sheepish smile, before shrugging her shoulders. \"It's either the thicker ones or the thinner ones. Your choice.\"</span></div></div>",

Finally, she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash blushed a bit as she felt the mess in her diaper sag. It was firm, forming a lumpy bulge in her diaper. She decided that it was best not to pay attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash continued to walk down the cobblestone path, seeing no ponies walking by until she turned into an alleyway.

I was wondering, since you're kinda wearing diapers, if you could be the foal?\" Scootaloo said.

A dull white blanket covered her and a gown was put on her. It didn't take her long to deduce where she was, because in her line of work she had plenty of visits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. she was in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash didn't mind much. It wasn't the first time a crash had sent her to the Ponyville General hospital, however, she didn't know what she was here for now. She felt fine. Dash laid herself up on the bed which is when she felt something wrapped around her waist and heard crinkling coming from said object. In her curiosity, she uncovered herself only to find something she didn't expect to be there. A massive white diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wasn't as big as Dash thought it was, but in her state she didn't care. Dash's eyes widened as her breaths became more erratic. Panic set into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the doors lock brought her back to reality as she heard the sound of hooves clopping into the room. Coming through the door was Dr. Horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the name was a rather unoriginal one, he was one of the best doctors in the hospital. He had helped several patients during his time as a doctor and had found himself being an important part of anyone's visit. It was why Dash remembered him so clearly. Brown mane parted to each side for his horn, blue eyes, and a light amber coat along with a cutie mark of a heart monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake, Ms. Dash, and I see you found the diaper around your waist,\" Dr. Horse said with a lighthearted chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash was in no mood for his lighthearted banter. \"Yeah I found it! Why is it on me!?\" Dash demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Horse sighed. The smile on his muzzle disappeared as he gave a quick but sorrowful answer.\"I'm sorry to tell you, Ms. Dash, but when Derpy struck you with lightning, she caused  the nerves in your bowels to fry and become useless. I'm sorry, but your incontinent,\" Dr. Horse said. He saw Dash realize what those words meant. Her magenta eyes were unbelieving. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash couldn't comprehend it.

She grunted in strain as she pushed in pile after pile of manure. Doctor Horse decided to avert his gaze as she finished pushing her mess into her diaper. He was notified that she was done when she panted in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Dash, do you require any assistance?\" Doctor Horse asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash did not reply. She was too deep in thought. She had a hard time believing her situation, but now that she had messed herself, she couldn't deny it. She was stuck in diapers. Like a foal. Forever. Those thoughts scared her, but one thought pushed through them all. What will everyone think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer her worst nightmare, the door opened once again and in came all of her friends. First Twilight, then Fluttershy, after her Rarity, followed by Applejack, and finally Pinkie Pie. All of her friends had brought gifts and laid them beside the bed. They quickly noticed the mess in her diaper and the expression of terror on her face and decided to back away. Doctor Horse saw the tension in the room and decided to leave without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I.\" Dash couldn't form any words. She began to tremble as she looked away. \"D-Don't look at m-me. You probably think I'm pathetic now don't you?\" Dash asked. She didn't know what they would say. The most horrible thought came to mind that she dared not to dwell on. However, something unexpected happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her friends gathered around her and brought her into a tight embrace. \"Oh, Dash,\" Twilight spoke, \"Why would you think so little of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dashie! We're your friends,\" Pinkie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no matter what, darling...\" Rarity began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're always here for you,\" Fluttershy finished. All of her friends nodded in agreement as Dash looked on in amazement. She was happy to have friends like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, sugarcube, since yer' eh-... predicament is rather difficult, we all agreed that we would be more than willing to allow ya ta' spend yer' days out of the hospital with us,\" Applejack said. Rainbow was a bit confused by the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie jumped into the conversation. \"Do you wanna go to our houses so we can help you with your diaper problem or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash awed in understanding. Pinkie always made things easy to understand. It was a nice gesture to give their time to help take care of her, but she might just want to stay in the hospital. After all, maybe the hospital could fix this. It was a tough choice, however...</span></div></div>",

Turning around, she noticed Rainbow's pacifier sitting on the floor by the side of the bed, and a rather upset-looking Rainbow Dash looking down at it from the bed. Fluttershy walked back over to Rainbow, picked up the pacifier, and plopped it back in her mouth, before it promptly fell out onto the floor again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Fluttershy was confused why Rainbow was so rejective of her pacifier, until she realized that after a few more cycles of it slipping out of her mouth, Rainbow was physically unable to keep the pacifier in. \"Oh dear, it seems that crash did more than just make you incontinent, it's dislocated your jaw as well!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow tried to speak, but only gibberish came out. She attempted to reach down for her pacifier. Fluttershy understood that Rainbow wanted her pacifier for the night, but could not hold it in her mouth on her own. Suddenly, Fluttershy had an idea. \"Wait right here, Dashie!\", Fluttershy said, before rushing out of the room and down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Fluttershy returned with some stretchy plastic bracelets and some scissors. She set the items down on a nearby table and got to work. Rainbow eyed her Mommy carefully, before losing interest and struggling with her pacifier again. After a few moments, Fluttershy walked over to the bed with something in her hoof. \"Here Rainbow, I managed to cut the bracelets to form a plastic coil of sorts. Hand me your paci\". Rainbow did as she was told and handed Fluttershy her pacifier. After a moment of knot tying, Fluttershy's work was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go! Now it'll stay nice and snug in your little mouth!\" Fluttershy said, before taking the now coil-strung pacifier and putting it over Rainbow's head. She looped the back of the coil behind Rainbow's ears, and pulled the pacifier forward, stretching it to as far as it would reach. She then plopped the pacifier back in Rainbow's open mouth, and adjusted the coil so that it strapped the pacifier on Rainbow's face nice and snug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thnnsfks mmffmmnn!\" Rainbow exclaimed, happy to have her pacifier back. Flutter tucked Rainbow inside the bed sheets once more. Afterwards, she gave Rainbow another kiss on the forhead, before whispering \"Mommy loves you\" into her baby's ear. Fluttershy gathered up the scissors and left over coil, turned off the lights, and left the room, making sure to close the door ever so carefully behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her motherly performance, Fluttershy walked downstairs, placing the leftover materials back in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours had passed since Fluttershy decided to put Rainbow to bed, and it was now mid-afternoon.

It's a beautiful day and I just thought it would be the most <i>amazing-riffic</i> idea to have a picnic! Everypony else agrees! Well, everypony but Dashie at least. She wasn't home or even taking her afternoon nap! Can you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely couldn't see that happening\" Fluttershy giggled, thinking of her little Dashie bundled up on the bed with her paci and diaper. \"I'll be out in a few minutes. I just need to use the filly's room first\" she said to a grinning Pinkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to the bathroom, Fluttershy ran through some ideas that would keep Rainbow occupied while she was gone. <i>Maybe she could play with my foal toys... Oh that would make her so excited!</i> she thought as she could feel Dashie's joy after seeing the blocks and rattles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie, meanwhile, was so excited for the picnic that every minute Fluttershy took felt like an hour. After a few anxious minutes, she decided to check on her. As she neared the bathroom, she heard a muffled yawn coming from the bedroom. <i>Wait... that wasn't one of Fluttershy's animals...</i> she thought. Though she was nervous, her curiosity got the best of her and she went to find the source of the noise. She stopped at the bedroom when she heard a hissing noise. Cautiously, she opened the door to find... Rainbow Dash? She looked over her friend, shocked to see her in such foalish attire. A strong smell suddenly hit her nose as she noticed several large bulges in the back of Rainbow's diapers and dampness as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow yawned once again, slowly waking up. She barely even noticed Pinkie staring at her as she smiled and raised her rump in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie just stared on, confused as to what Dash was doing. Her thinking was interrupted as she heard a few muffled farts. Rainbow grunted, pushing a huge mess into her already loaded double-diaper. As she finished up, she giggled at the smell and feeling of the squishy mess. The moment she had pooped in her diaper for the first time made her so happy. This just felt right, and she had let herself think like a foal, happily giving in to her mommy's caretaking without even a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie snapped out of her blank stare. <i>Why is Dashie acting like a foal?</i> she wondered before her eyes wandered over to a stack of diapers. It was her size, the same ones Rainbow was wearing. She pondered, just for a second, about trying one on. <i>C'mon Pinkie! Those are meant for the Cake twins, not adults! But... Dashie does look more comfortable than I've ever seen... Maybe I should give them a shot...</i></span></div></div>",

Rainbow glided down  to Fluttershy\u2019s cottage just as she headed into inside putting her hoof in the door way preventing it closing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlut-\u201c She huffed out of breath she tongue hanging out like a dog on a boiling hot day, sweating dripped off her fur Fluttershy open the door completely then headed in the other room coming back with a fresh glass of water, Rainbow snatch the glass and swiftly drank it down in one gulped. <br>\r\n\u201cThanks shy\u2026\u201d Rainbow thanked as she let herself inside Fluttershy closing the door behind her as Rainbow Dash made herself comfy on her friend\u2019s sofa, Fluttershy took a seat next to her. The sound of ponies trotting down the stair caught the two attention look at two moving ponies heading down the stair case <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere miss, all move in.\u201d One mover said before leaving, Rainbow looked to Fluttershy \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d She ask, Fluttershy replied \u201cOh my father, he just cleaned his house and found a bunch of child stuff and, and he didn\u2019t want to throw them out so he gave them to me.\u201d All that was said for a few moments were \u201cOh, I see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these moment it was dead silent not an awkward silent more like a relax silent as Rainbow just sunk into her seat. Fluttershy looked over at Dash \u201cHey Dash\u201d Fluttershy was shaking like she was in pool of cold water in the middle of winter, Rainbow looked back at her  as Fluttershy tried to spark a conversation \u201cYou ev-ever thought about children, I mean like having one\u2026\u201d  Rainbow snorted slapping herself hardly able to talk now <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe!? Kids? Me of all ponies, no, no not at all.\u201d She wipe a tear away no longer laughing \u201cwhat about you?\u201d Fluttershy looked down feeling discouraged now; she took a breath in and said <br>\r\n\u201cWell sometimes, I mean when I am older maybe but closest right now is babysitting. I do have an urge\u2026\u201d Fluttershy felt like an idiot now for bringing it up. \u201cWell I think you would make an awesome mother.\u201d Fluttershy tilled her head \u201cI mean like you kind, nice and caring all them motherly things. What kid wouldn\u2019t want a mother like you.\u201d Fluttershy smile at her friend feeling all warm inside \u201cSorry about cracking up before, it just the thought of me having a child, it just horrible and just funny at the same time is all.\u201d Rainbow apologised, Fluttershy smirk thinking about a motherly Rainbow Dash <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really the mother kind.\u201d Fluttershy sighed looking away from Rainbow Dash \u201cI lied, I have babies on the mind and babysitting isn\u2019t a enough now, but a child that little bit too much\u2026.I wish I could just get it out of my system is all.\u201d Rainbow put hoof to her chin \u201cToo bad there isn\u2019t a way to like have a fake child for one weekend.\u201d Rainbow said thinking out loud, Fluttershy head lifted she pick herself up off the sofa trotting in front of Rainbow Dash and looking her right in the eyes, staring into them as she spoke <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainbow Dash, I am going upstairs there something I need to get, and when you see this something just stray, don\u2019t leave, I mean if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d Rainbow just laid back lazing about responded \u201cSure.\u201d Fluttershy trotted up Stair while Rainbow just flicked on the tv watching a children cartoon to passed the time away. It wasn\u2019t too long before Fluttershy descended down holding a paper bag looking about ready to burst, Rainbow turned her head follow Fluttershy with her eyes as the pony wandered down and headed to the coffee table placing the bag down Rainbow stared at it  fascinated by it. Fluttershy pulled a box that was clearly already open with a picture of diaper <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you ask, I got these when I mix up buy the babies one while I took care of the cake\u2019s twins.\u201d Rainbow didn\u2019t replied she just looked at the pack not really sure what was happen.  \u201cRainbow, this is a hard thing to ask, I, I want you to be my baby, just for today is all\u2026.\u201d Rainbow was at a lost for words she looked at pack of adult mare diaper then to Fluttershy who was shaking and trying to maintain a smile, she thought trying to figure out what to do before deciding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it if it will help you get over your whole baby crazy thing.\u201d She announced Fluttershy clapped and cheer softly \u201cBut first!\u201d Rainbow put a hoof up \u201cLets get the ground rule laid out, 1st I am not messing myself at all, no going number 2 in my diaper nothing like that but how ever I may wet it\u2026depending if I drank, and what a drank and how much of it I drank okay. 2nd It just for to day only, as soon as night comes it over.\u201d Rainbow was still far too happy about this and said \u201cOkay no messing and just for today, now lets get you change, come with me\u201d Rainbow grumbled  as she was taking up stair. Fluttershy came to the spare room opening it to show a room different from the rest of the cottage a room where the hard wood floor was covered in soft carpet, the walls were decorated with teddy bear wall paper, a toy chest was next to a crib and next to the door was a change table with packs of diapers under it and near that a cabinet filled with baby clothes. Rainbow stood in aw like she fell into a different world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy patted the change table Rainbow got on lying down with her legs stretch out, Rainbow lifted up her flank slipping the puffy diaper under her bottom then doing up the strips as tight as they would go, despite the tightness Rainbow didn\u2019t feeling it being tight to her it felt more fuffy like it was a thick pillow around her flank, she couldn\u2019t even feel the hard wooden table now, now it was this nice soft paddedness of the diaper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy help herself and ask \u201cWhat does my baby want to do first?\u201d Rainbow just shout one word \u201cplay\u201d Fluttershy smiled and ask \u201cOkay I got some blocks, some dolls some legos \u201c \u201cLegos, me wanna play with lego\u201d Rainbow was already play her role rather well, Fluttershy pulled out a container of lego bricks from the toy box sitting down next to Rainbow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay why don\u2019t we we try making a lego house\u201d Rainbow looked to Fluttershy and told her \u201cOkay mommy.\u201d Rainbow dash started pulling out random bricks and placing them together, Fluttershy petted her head and said \u201cNow Rainbow Dash, maybe we should make sure the colours match.\u201d She started putted together some red bricks for a wall \u201cLike this.\u201d Rainbow nodded  and started to rebuilding it with matching colours now, Rainbow smile wider. \u201cNow mommy will be right now.\u201d She petted Rainbow\u2019s head and head out, Rainbow just sat there building her lego house now acting like a small child find herself enjoying this, finding it a wonderful break from the adult world even if it just for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy came back with a pacifier, she sipped it around Rainbow Dash\u2019s neck Rainbow took notice and put the pacifier into her mouth suckling at feeling relax. \u201cAwww, dose my wittle baby enjoy her pacifier?\u201d Rainbow just nodded. After about an hour of play Fluttershy took Rainbow down stairs, Rainbow sat on the sofa, fluttershy tied a bib around her friend neck.

As she sucked and sucked, she knew that whatever need or want that cd across her, herMommy would be able to fulfill. It was at that point that Rarity began to feel rumbling in her stomach. The laxative began to take effect, and Rarity slowly began to feel a warm liquid spreading across the front of her diaper. Moments later, Rarity's bowels began to shift, and Rarity felt her diaper quickly fill up with the warm, gooey substance. Rarity couldn't remember the last time she had defiled her diaper this much.

Slowing down she reached her hoofs over and slid out a backpack from behind her open and revealing various items they planned to use. \"Well, we'll eat first...\" said Sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pick a outcome for this next bit</span></div></div>",

She quickly snapped out of it though getting back to the breakfast on the table in front of her. And still she wondered where Applebloom was currently or if she might have heard Sweetie's cries muffling from upstairs just now. Either way this sandwich sure is good she smiled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Rarity's bedroom, Rarity busied herself with getting Sweetie changed on a changing table to one side of the room asking \"Sweetie Belle, dear, why won't you simply just come and tell me whenever you have these accidents of yours?\" she inquired while pulling the wet diaper from underneath Sweetie, wrapping it, applying wipes to a wet spot on Sweetie's fur, and holding the baby powder all at once in attempt to get Sweetie back to her friend as soon as possible. \"Ugh, I didn't even know that I had a wet spot, honest!\" squeaked Sweetie Belle scrunching her muzzle.</span></div></div>",

Suckling on the pacifier, AB rose her padded flank up in the air, as her tail flagged up, hugging the old toy hard she grunted loudly as she pushed her bowels. For a second nothing happened, as the young fillies mind told her that this was not an ok thing to do since she was a big filly! After a few seconds she groaned as she pushed again, Her bowels giving way as she pushed the mess into the seat of her foalish diaper. she suckled pathetically as she grunted and groaned to push the mess out. With a shuddering sigh she pushed the last of the mess out of her bowels. A loud hissing sound started as she began to wet the diaper unconsciously, as the diaper weighed down heavily on her flank. with a few suckles of her pacifier, AB started crying loudly just like a foal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash, lifting up Scoots, carried them both over to the blocks where they\u2019d stay a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat together on the carpet feeling content. After a moment of playing with Scootaloo, Rainbow, in the comfort of her own diaper, decided to read a book she'd brought along, occasionally helping the filly find something to add to the tower. Scootaloo having a blast all the way, would thank her with baby talk often in the form of muffled sounds coming through her pacifier. And while Rainbow couldn\u2019t understand a word said to her, she\u2019d improvise as best she could for the sake of Scoot\u2019s enjoyment and yet a little for her own desires. However, soon the filly felt her stomach rumbling followed by a familiar growling to disrupt the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like some little pony's gettin\u2019 hungry.\" inquired Dash. Scoots felt herself blushed at this \"y-yeah.\" She admitted in a shy tone, holding the pacifier to her muzzle before instinctively sucking on it again. Dash chuckled \"ok squirt, c'mon I'll fix you up something to eat.\" said the mare as she flew over and scooped up the filly, carrying her out the door and over into the kitchen where she spotted a high chair fit for Scootaloo, gently setting her in it. The filly became secured as the diaper gave her less potential for movement, when suddenly she caught herself drooling slightly over her paci, making her peculiarly pull it out from her mouth and wipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow took a peek into the fridge and surprisingly there were a variety of foal foods from assorted vegetable mush in small jars to small leaves and formula. She takes one of the jars of mush to give to waiting Scootaloo. Like an impatient foal, Scoots removed the lid and decided on holding the jar with both hooves and unsteadily pouring it at her mouth, messing her fur a little in the process. \u201cHey, what do you think you\u2019re...\u201d scolded the cyan pegasus while lowering the jar from the confused filly\u2019s coy face. *quick hard sigh* She got a rag and dampened it at the sink. \u201cHere\u201d she wiped down the orange filly\u2019s reddened face as she flinched at the cold of the rag, yet still, inside her heart melted with the care of her idol. Rainbow taking out a spoon next asked \u201cDo you want me to feed you instead Scoots?\u201d In that instance, Scootaloo overwhelmed with glee shouted \u201cYES!\u201d almost jumping out of her seat before catching herself and slowly nodding into a \u201cI mean, yes please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, Scootaloo is found indulging herself in each spoon-full of mashed fruits and veggies served by the mare. Amazing it was how every bit seemed only tastier than the last she thought. Rainbow Dash fed her jar after jar as she\u2019d ask for more to Rainbow\u2019s surprise, as if the filly could never get enough. Sure the cute chanting of \u201cmore, more!\u201d and occasional drops of food would mean extra work and caring towards the filly, but finding multiple opportunity for \u201cHere comes the train\u201d followed by airplane noises and the anticipation and excitable look on the filly\u2019s face made it totally worth it to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the padded pony stood in discontent as she slowly, unknowingly began trickling urine inside her diaper.

I wanted to ask how you're doing.\" The mare consolingly claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm, fine...\" Sweetie meekly replied with voice trembling at the concerned turquoise in those eyes of a shy pegasus towering over her.

'Looks like Fluttershy does an even better job than I would' Rarity thought to herself, 'umm...' at least until she saw what her sister was doing.<br>\r\nNearly falling asleep in the yellow mare's hold, Sweetie was flown over to the changing table when Fluttershy felt the enlarging wet spot reminding her what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Sweetie Belle, just let Fluttershy take care of your icky little trouble.\" Carfully she lie the small unicorn down over the mat when</span></div></div>",

She popped the nip into her mouth and in front of her friends began to suckle as she lay herself back against Babs's bed. \"Hey! That was my bottle Sweetie.\" she playfully argued. Applebloom just stood there most confused, and wishing for an explanation as why she thought she saw her sister wearing a diaper in the hall and why Babs has one on now.<br>\r\nScootaloo then seized the moment as well and almost immediately pounced the pondering Applebloom onto the floor. Standing over her she announced \"Applebloom, I've never found a better time to say this but I've always sorta had feeling for you too!\" The confused pony of the group could only squeak \"Wha'? What's even going on here Scoots??\" before blushing a bit at her friends sudden confession.<br>\r\nSweetie Belle finished her suckling at that moment to ask Babs still waiting for her \"Do you want some? You have to let me feed you then.\" She offered an irresistible choice to the poor diapered Seed, and as much as she flustered in embarrassment, \u201c\u2026ah alright, only for you though.\u201d she bluffs. Inside Babs ever so yearned for something like this, just not along the lines of this sort of setting  - her other friends still in perfect view as she climbs into whatever Sweetie Belle could muster of a hold on her friend; still Babs felt quite safe and secure in her grasp. Sweetie then proceeds to sloppily feeding Babs the bottle, she wasn\u2019t the best at foal handling. Despite Sweetie\u2019s minor complication, Babs was enjoying herself all the way sucking down a soft stream of milky pleasure, fed by her lovable caretaker while in her cozy diaper, she didn\u2019t wish to end this moment.<br>\r\nBy that time Scootaloo had just finished up a big kiss to Applebloom\u2019s lips. Both blushing furiously at one another, Applebloom couldn\u2019t help but wonder where all this was coming from, and that feeling was only heightened after seeing Babs, her close cousin, being lovingly babied by her close friend. Starring back into Scootaloo's sheepishly glistening eyes, she noticed her friend seemed worried over something.</span></div></div>",

The red on the filly's face remained \"aum... sure I guess Scoots.\" The purple-maned filly hurried over to diapers so as to not lose any of the moment. \"Ah-\" before the filly still lying on the floor could comment a pacifier was placed in her mouth and a thick and puffy padding carefully being slid under her tail. Her face flushed yet she wasn't ready to resist things soon either. Initially she couldn't help but wince at the thought of being diapered by her fellow crusader \"Hold still AB, I'll wear one too if you want after this.\" reasoned Scoots, although she knew already she wanted to be in a diaper too. She then taped the ends together and Applebloom tried to sit up to inspect herself but her diaper made it difficult. Scootaloo had helped her up seating the filly on her diaper with a small grunt and then got to putting another diaper on herself. Applebloom was preoccupied on thoughts of how strangely comfortable she now was as she sat sucking away on her pacifier. Diapers felt a lot like sitting in one of those piles of hay in the barn, about as noisy as hay too, only softer and more plastic. Meanwhile, poor Scootaloo couldn\u2019t seem to get the white disposable on by herself. Applebloom taking notice moved in dropping her paci on accident \u201cOops, I'll help ya Scoots.\u201d she insisted. It was secretly just as the filly hoped. Blushing even harder now, Scootaloo lay helplessly under her diapered crush's care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoots was so inwardly excited over this she nearly peed herself. However, on the bed, Babs, so sleepy and relaxed as she was, took to doing so first in her diaper. Not enough for Sweetie to notice at first, she was focused instead on carefully getting Babs out of her lap and onto the bed without waking the filly too much. Unfortunately when she notice the dampness she flinched anyway \"Aww Babsy, you wet yourself.\" \"Huh...\" Babs slowly felt nervousness creeping up as she regained consciousness and control of her bladder. Cheeks lit by a warm feeling moving upward along her lower torso, Babs was shocked silent to realize her situation but it only quickly caused tears to form in her eyes. \"B-but ah- ah didn't know what ah was doing...\" she said over sobs. \"I-it's okay Babs, I know you didn't mean to do it.\" Despite this she continued weeping to herself. Sweetie inched closer to comfort her whimpering friend with a tight hug and kiss over her now wet face that lasted longer than Babs thought it would. She began to calm down but Sweetie hadn't let go of her yet; tastes funny thought Sweetie as she finished the kiss. \"Don't cry, I'm not mad or anything Babsy. I could change you right away if you want\" but the moment Sweetie budged she was stopped by Babs sudden motioning \"pl-please, w-wait...\" she didn't want her to let go yet \"okay.\"</span></div></div>",

Me no baby!\" Luna shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUNA, I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR WHINING!\" Celestia said, levitating a baby pacifier from the nursery across the hall, and before shoving it into Luna's mouth.

Luna tried to scream, but only a muffled \"Mmffpphh!\" came out. Satisfied with the new Luna, Celestia levitated her new baby sister into Cadance and Shining's nursery, and placed her inside. The relatively high walls would keep Luna from jumping out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prevent Luna from causing any more harm, Celestia took a last few strands of duct tape and wrapped them around Luna's wings to keep her from flying. She then went back to her room and pulled out a small ring from her bedside drawer, and came back into the nursery. Celestia secured the ring over baby Luna's horn, cutting off any magic that she tried to conjure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia took a step back and admired her new baby sister. \"See? This is what happens to whiney foals. You will spend a few weeks here until you have learned your lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna tried to protest, but her bindings only let out a muffled whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm off to go fulfill my royal duties. Don't worry? I'll do your part of raising and lowering the moon, while I tell every pony else that you are on holiday. I will be back later to check on you dear sister, and don't even think about misbehaving.\" Celestia stated firmly as she trotted out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was upset. She tried bashing against the walls of the nursery, but they didn't budge. She tried levitating herself out, or smashing the gate with her magic, but as a foal's age, Luna was unable to concentrate, and the ring secured around her horn diminished even the slightest attempt of magic.

Her mother then looked her firmly in the eye. \u201cYou abandoned court because they laughed at you?\u201d Luna looked up shocked.<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mommy!-\u201d Luna tried to protest but shut up almost immediately as she felt her mother\u2019s hard gaze on her.<br>\r\nSolaria then held up her hoof firmly. \u201cLuna you are a princess\u201d<br>\r\nLuna felt her heart ache and sniffed \u201cBut- mommy\u201d coming out as a barely audible whimper.<br>\r\n\u201cLuna, you have a responsibility as princess to hold court no matter how hard it is\u201d Solaria let up on her icy glare but Luna could still feel her displeasure.<br>\r\nShe had displeased her mommy and the very idea filled her with dread. \u201cI- I understand\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now I want you to go back to the throne room and apologize to those ponies you abandoned\u201d She puts her hoof underneath Luna\u2019s chin to look her directly in the eye. \u201cUnderstood?\u201d She asked with a clear and firm tone that made Luna pay the upmost attention.<br>\r\nSeeing her mother look at her so disappointed filled Luna with regret. Those ponies depended on her as their princess and she had just ran off.</span></div></div>",

It won\u2019t do for you to walk around all messy and stinky like that and less so for me to let you do it.\u201d <br>\r\nThat made Luna smile a little bit, and her mother rewarded her with a kiss on her snout. \u201cNow come on up on the changing table sweetie. We can\u2019t let the nobles wait too long.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd so Luna nodded and walked to the changing table in the nursery, her quite full pair of foal knickers squishing as she moved, constantly reminding her of it\u2019s presence, and that she had made it. Something every noble now knew as well. She got up onto the table with a small leap aided by her wings, and laid on her back. Her mother quickly went on to change her, and rather fast at that, especially considering the mess she was dealing with, but she had wiped, powdered and re-diapered Luna\u2019s behind with an ocean blue diaper within two minutes.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel ready now, my little princess?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The mane was similar to her daughters\u2019, but a deep crimson and magenta rather than a rainbow or night sky.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, let\u2019s seee-\u201d Luna kept watching as the giant alicorn went through the wardrobe. As much as she and her sister looked powerful, she had always felt scared of her mother. She had so much power and more than that she was always right. She could never think of her mother being wrong.<br>\r\n\u201cAh! These will do\u201d Luna is snapped out of her thoughts as Solaria turns around and presents her with 3 dresses. None of which were anywhere close to her favorites.<br>\r\n\u201cMommy can\u2019t I have some others?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThese are the only ones of your size here and we can\u2019t have those nobles waiting just so you can go and get dressed.

I\u2019ll wear yellow!\u201d <br>\r\nSolaria simply nodded and wasted no time guiding her daughter\u2019s legs and wings through the dress to make it sit tight on her. Within yet again two minutes, Luna was wearing a dress which stood out in a decent way to her coat. The yellow contrasted against her dark blue and unfortunately the skirt seemed to highlight her diapered bottom more so than hiding it.<br>\r\nLuna looked back at herself in the mirror, regretting her decision immensely. She wasn\u2019t given a lot of time to regret it however, before her mother gave her a push on her flank towards the door.<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up sweetie, you have a night court to be present at.\u201d Luna looked back at Solaria, with the hint of a prayer in her eyes. She was about to open her mouth again when she saw Solaria\u2019s horn light up and to her horror a paddle appeared. \u201cIf you return here again before night court has concluded, you\u2019ll be subjected to 100 spanks with a paddle. Is that clear, Luna?\u201d Luna quickly nodded as she knew her mother was serious.<br>\r\nShe tried to think of alternative choices but with the ulimatum her mother had set there were none. So, defeated, the obviously padded princess started trotting out of the nursery and through the hallways of Canterlot castle, her thickly diapered rear crinkling with every movement her hind legs made. With her blue diaper peeking out from behind her yellow foalish dress it seemed to be even more obvious than before. \u2018At least it was dry crinkles\u2019, she thought to herself. <br>\r\nWhen Luna returns to her night court she will be met with...</span></div></div>",

She had promised not to resort to the royal canterlot voice anymore. She just hoped Mommy didn\u2019t know about this as she might get that 100 paddle punishment after all.<br>\r\nNevertheless it was effective as all the ponies looked back at her with a serious expression. \u201cSilverblade\u2019s request has been denied.

He walked down the streets of a unusually quiet Ponyville carrying part of a giant saddlebag with him, edited by Rarity so that it would be fitted for someone as small as Spike. He looked from left to right with an uncertain frown of displeasure as he constantly checked the streets to make sure that no single pony even saw him with what he had in his saddle, not even Rarity or Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had the free few seconds to look inside of his saddlebag to check the contents he had bought with Twilight's own hard-worked bits, feeling ultimately terrible that he had stolen bits in the first place and bought the last thing that Twilight would expect stolen bits to go into. He moved the top-lid of his saddlebag and looked inside to see what he had bought from the Medical store, a large pack of \"Silly Filly Diapers\" a plastic container holding just about sixteen diapers made for ponies that were over the age of five. And luckily, Spike was just about around that age to fit into garments he had once dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He closed the lip of his saddlebag and looked around to find that he walked up to the front of the Ponyville library, he had a plan, an agenda to make sure that he wasn't caught, he took note of all of Twilight's schedules and meetings around and make use of the time so that he could buy his fresh pack of diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike gulped for a moment and slowly pushed the front door of the library, hearing the creaking coming out from the door made his stomach feel cramped within, he firstly poked his head into the library to try and get a good look of everything. All the light were turned off, this was part of Spikes plan. If he knew that someone was home, the lights would obviously turned on, but they weren't which was perfect for the little dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without thinking, the little green dragon rushed into the library with the front door closed behind him, he made a quick jolt up the stairs and into Twilight's bedroom. The only source of lighting that wasn't turned off by the young dragon since it is where he would stash his newly bought diapers, he rushed over to one of the wardrobes that Twilight had in the corner of her bedroom and he opened it. And with no surprise at all, there was no clothes stored into the wardrobe because Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right...\" The young dragon mumbled, he opened the lid of the saddlebag once again and pulled out the packet of diapers and flashed them in his own face. The logo \"Silly Filly Diapers\" were bolded in bright pink and blue text, some of the words were blue, which stood for the little colts and some of the words were pink, for the little fillies. There was an image over the package showing a mare looking after a colt as if he was about to cry, the little colt on the image was wearing one of the diapers and looked like he was having some trouble walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His heart felt like a black hole, it just felt like it was going to implode on himself, his urges, mind and even dreams told him to rip open the packet of diapers and wear them. Complete his fantasies and dreams, he would feel so happy for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I g-guess one wouldn't h-hurt...\" Spike gulped, beads of sweat began to make their way down and through his scales, feeling the ever-so disastrous feeling that someone would catch him trying a diaper on would be just around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before making his choice, he stashes the pack of diapers in the wardrobe and moves around a few of the boxes inside of it to hide the diapers from Twilight or anyone else that would go snooping around in wardrobes.</span></div></div>",

He leaned forward and reached out for the pack of diapers, he extended one of his claws out and flawlessly ripped open the packaging without damaging the diapers and pulled one of the undergarments out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feeling the soft plastic-y smell of the diaper made his heart and stomach tinge with confusion, happiness, fear and even joy, he stood up and with his spare hand, he closed the wardrobe. Forever hiding the rest of the diapers until they were needed again, Spike had been waiting for this moment for a long time, he had always wanted to wear diapers even since he was such a little dragon, even littler than he was now. But it wasn't his choice that Twilight and Princess Celestia wanted him to be toilet trained as quickly as possible for the future lessons and assistant-hood, but now it was time to indulge himself and begin to work on what he always wanted: his lost childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragon messed around with the diaper until he opened it all the way up, he let the undergarment fall open as he walked over to Twilight's bed and climbed up to the top of it, he placed the diaper down on the bedsheets and then proceeded to lie down on top of it. He felt his scales rub against the soft absorbent material that was on the inside of the diaper, he was in bliss, he had never felt something so soft and comfortable before in his entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he went through this simple process, he couldn't help but blush. There was a part of him that told him wearing diapers was bad, that he was a big-dragon and he didn't need them, but there was another side to him that wanted to wear them. He couldn't help himself but lean up and grab the front of the diaper and pull it over him, now with the front and back of the diaper in place, all he had to do is tape himself together and the diaper would be complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The reached over to the left side of the diaper tape and grabbed them, he streteched them over to the front of the diaper and they perferctly managed to stick to the front of the diaper itself. Spike smiled amiss under all of this quick-fire stress and mix of emotion, he then did the same with the other side of tapes and found himself completely diapered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He stood up for a moment to embrace himself as he felt the diaper hug his scaly back-side, feeling like the true infant he never was. He tried to walk over to the edge of the bed, but it seemed that the diapers that Spike had bought were much thicker than he originally realised. The dragon began to waddle like a true infant struggling to walk as he jumped down from Twilight's bed and walked over to the mirror, his stomach felt like he was going to throw up. Something inside of him didn't like being in diapers, but the other side was in pure bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He stood infront of Twilight's mirror to get a good look at himself, he saw a young baby dragon wearing an incredibly thick diaper. He couldn't help but childishly giggle at this situation, he raised his claw up into the air and shoved it in his mouth just like a pacifier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around he saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was wearing a diaper, his dream had come true, he wanted to try out so many things, drinking from bottles, playing with toys, sleeping in a comfy bed like a crib and even being cared for by a pony that would baby him no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But all of this imminent pride was to change as he walked a few paces with his eyes down to the ground looking at his perfect diaper when he bumped into something, he fell back onto his bottom and rubbed his eyes with his drool covered claw. He looked up to see Twilight standing right in front of him, she had seen it all. The purple unicorn stood there was her mouth agape and her pupils the size of peas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-Spike? What are you doing?\" Twilight was the first one to speak, she trotted over to the dragon feeling unbelievably uncomfortable with what the dragon was wearing around his lower area. Spike looked up, it all immediately sinked in. He was such a stupid dragon, he had to try a diaper on just when Twilight just got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... er...\" Spike began to panic, his blush disappeared and now tears were starting to fall from his face. The little dragon quickly got up on his feet and quickly started to run from the unicorn, but alas, it was no use. Twilight used her magical horn to teleport the dragon on her bed, Spike knew that he wasn't going to get out of this mess and so he just began to bawl out like an infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight walked over to the sobbing dragon and climbed up on her bed and wrapped her hooves around him, embracing the baby dragon into a nice big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spike, it's okay... just tell me what's wrong?\" Twilight whispered to the dragon, trying her best not to raise her voice. The purple mare was calm, she wasn't angry, neither scared at what Spike was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I c-can't t-tell you!\" Spike whimpered, he had wrapped himself up like a ball-like state, but he couldn't wrap himself properly due to the diaper he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why not?\" Twilight softly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's s-stupid!\" Spike bawled out to the unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm your best friend Spike, you can tell me.\"</span></div></div>",

He watched as Twilight walked over to the kitchen table and opened up her saddlebags with her magic and pulled out the items she had bought just for Spike, a set of pacifiers flew out of one saddlebag and landed on the table, two milk bottles designed for actual foals were magically pulled out and finally some clothing that Spike had never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight turned her head and faced the baby dragon with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How's my little Spikey-Wikey doing?\" Twilight trotted over to Spike in the high-chair and nuzzled him affectionately, the little dragon just giggled and reached out for Twilight's mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm doing fine!\" Spike tried his best to create a childish tone of voice, even more so, an infantile one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you want your bottle of milk now?

He saw Princess Celestia standing in the living room waiting for Twilight and Spike to come downstairs, the dragon grabbed Twilight's mane and shuffled himself into her purple mane hairs to try and hide himself from the princess. Yet it was no use, Twilight shook her head which stopped the baby dragon from hiding away from the princess of the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aww, he is so cute!\" The Princess squealed in absolute joy, she slowly trotted over to Twilight and craned her head down to get closer to the baby dragon as he tried to cower himself away from the large white alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike didn't say anything, his time of wanting to be a baby again had ceased, the princess knew, and it was one of the least few ponies that Spike wished that they knew about his deep-dark secret.

I now realize that I forced to much onto you at too young of an age. Fortunately for you, you may get your chance to relive your infancy.\" Celestia stated.<br>\r\nSpike and Twilight were both confused at this statement. \"What do you mean Princess?\" Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike's form is extremely malleable Twilight.\" Celestia began to explain. \"I'm sure you've noticed his actions becoming foal-like already. Dragon's naturally appear how they see themselves. Normally this results in them losing themselves in their greed. However, Spike is a bit of an unusual case due to how he was hatched. Spike will metally and physically adjust himself to match how he seems himself. It's also probably why he's stayed the same size he is now despite his current age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike sat down and contemplated Celestia's words. \"So does this mean if I start to see my self as a foal I will become one for real?\"  Celestia nodded. The baby dragon was stunned. He could have a real foal hood! <i>But what a what about Rarity and my other friends? Would they understand? And would Twilight still take care off me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike,\" said dragon looked towards Twilight as she spoke gently, \"If this is what you really want, I'll support you. Our friends will understand if being a foal makes you happy. Whether you want to be a dragon or if you want to be a foal, I'm here for you.\" Spike could tell from Twilight's loving gaze that she truly would accept him regardless of his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike thought over his time acting like Twilight's foal since she discovered his secret. <i>Do I want that all the time?</i> Spike knew that his life would change depending on his next choice. <i>Right now I'm just a baby dragon. Do I want to be a Baby though? Or do I want do be a Dragon.</i></span></div></div>",

While he could just say what he wanted, Spike knew he was a baby now. He also knew he had to mess. <i>I can't wait until I'm really a baby</i> Spike thought as he pushed into his diaper. He felt himself wet at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and Twilight smiled. \"Looks like someone wants to be foal.\" Twilight said to her new baby. Spike, remembering old picture of him, pull his tail into his mouth like a pacifier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked over the two. \"Please note I have no idea how fast he will regress nor how it will begin to take effect. I do hope you are happy with your new life Spike.\" Spike merely smiled around his tail <i>This is actually pretty fun, I don't know why I ever stopped</i> Spike thought. With that smile, Celestia knew it was time to let the new mother and foal pair enjoy each others company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike regression progressed quite smoothly after that. Within a day he was speaking like a toddler, and either he stopped trying to read or he just couldn't. His potty training may have well disappeared the moment he decided he was a baby for all the good it did. By the end of the week, he had even shunken a bit to a real foal's size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was truly a Baby once again.</span></div></div>",

I can learn from this experience for when I have an actual foal for myself.\" Twilight smiled and talked to the Princess on the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Celestia lightly chuckled. \"Auntie Celestia, that does ring a nice bell.\" Celestia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Cadance will be happy to hear that she can baby-sit Spike again, that's if, she still does baby-sitting.\" Twilight chuckled at what Celestia had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama!

He began laughing and wiggling on the changing table until Twilight stopped and unstrapped him, lifting him up into her hooves. \"Now let's get you fed, my little baby boy.\" She carried him downstairs where she had a baby bottle of milk waiting for him.

After hungrily drinking up the milk and emptying the bottle, Spike smiled up at her. \"All done, baby?\" She said as she put the bottle down and lifted him over her shoulder, patting his back with her hoof. \"Come on, sweetie, burp for mommy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike moaned a little bit before letting out a short burp. \"Oh come on, baby, you've gotta have more gas than that...\" She continues patting away, causing Spike to let out a larger, but still fairly short belch. \"Good boy!

Mental regression it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor, as ponies call him, walks down the town in a daydream of thoughts, he failed to notice the sky getting dark and rain beginning to fall. What a perfect mood for such a day. His thoughts were broken as he sneezed after unknowingly walking into the Everfree Forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" He muttered, turning around. His heart (well, one of them if ya know what I mean) sank as he realised he'd walked too far to get back to Ponyville any time soon. He knew of a zebra called Zecora around these parts, well who didn't, and decided he would ask for shelter. His sneezes got worse as the rain thudded down. His legs grew numb and he fell onto the mud with an almost pained cry. Dark coloured mud smothered his stomach, hooves, neck and chin as he struggled to get up. Giving up with a cry of pain, he collapsed again into the mud, the brown substance stinging his eyes as it splashed in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this I see, lying in the mud in front of me?\" Comes a familiar voice, one the Doctor Whooves was glad to hear. Craning his neck to look up, he was happy to see Zecora standing over him. He groaned weakly but happily before trying to stand slowly. But he was forced down to the ground by weakness, and Zecora frowned. She said nothing, deciding to help him stand and leant him against her as she supported him. Within minutes, they were back at the cottage of the zebra, and she lay Doctor Whooves on a bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A delicious food I shall make, for that illness has your life at stake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Whooves could do nothing but whimper in response as he watched her. When she was finished, she fed him the food, which, true to her word, was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor now you must rest, for that is how it works best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Whooves then...</span></div></div>",

I don't want cake, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie shrugged, then dug into the cake shamelessly, launching icing everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony else used manners when greeting the rock-studier, which she appreciated in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaud let a small smile release when Pinkie's friends approached, only for Pinkie's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow spoke first, boasting how much farther she could throw rocks now before actually saying anything worth caring about, \"So, I'm pretty sure I can beat ya! Rocks end up halfway across the world when I'm done with 'em! Safe bet to say I'll win any future matches we have, Maud! Hopefully, we can have a nice competition a little while after you get moved into Twi's library!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaud was taken aback, which only meant a literal step back, by this sudden knowledge, \"I thought I was to stay with Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie clarified quickly, \"Oh, well...my home's kinda...sorta...perhaappss...been in need of repair after I cooked too much rock candy. Heh-heh...oopsie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaud needed more info than that, \"What? I...saw you cook rock candy to the ceiling last time. How is this worse than the previous time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie explained on the way to Twilight's home, where Pinkie also stayed at the moment, that the rock candy from her newest recipe clumped together, creating a blockade of sugary goodness throughout the house incapable of being broken excepted by pickaxe. The firefighters were taking their sweet time in helping free the party pony's house of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, both Pie sisters were allowed residence in Twilight's library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce unpacked, Maud sat down with Pinkie to hear about all the amazing events that happened since last Maud visited Ponyville. Twilight decided to let them have some bonding time, so went to the basement to work again on a bucking hard spell that had been a thorn in her side for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour though, Pinkie was out of stories, so tried to find a new activity for them. Pinkie hadn't come up with a fun idea until listening to Twilight's scream of outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext second, Maud was being led down the stairs with Pinkie saying, \"Come on, sis'! Let's see what a certain magical somepony's been up to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Maud wasn't too sure this would end well.</span></div></div>",

His room had been filled with everything a foal might need. A new dresser replaced to old one that he previously had. The new one was much lower and appeared to also be a changing station; the change mat and pail beside the dresser were evidence of that. Big Mac continued to looks around as he noticed his new sleeping arrangements in the corner of his room. A crib fit for a foal but big enough for a full grown stallion was ready to replace his bed. The curtains that hung from his window where now of a more foalish variety along with the wallpaper that now adorned his walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Macintosh silently wondered to himself how his sister could have done all of this while he slept, and why she would even want to do this. The crimson stallion lets out another sigh as he plopped his hindquarters onto the floor in the middle of the room. He blushed to himself as he came to grips with his situation. \"One of the few times I open mah mouth and this happens...\" Big Mac says to himself as his thoughts find there way out of his mouth. He thinks about his current situation for a few moments and his muzzle breaks into a grin as he begins to imagine what it would be like to be a foal again. Catching himself daydreaming about being a foal, Big Macintosh's face turns a deeper shade of red as his blush is renewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling very silly and embarrassed about the situation, Big Macintosh tries to be optimistic as thinks to himself \"Maybe this wont so bad after all.\"</span></div></div>",

Do ya wanna a diapey change?\" He turned his head away, blushing, his face lighter than the shade of red on his coat. Applejack frowned slightly, and put a hoof on his soaked padding, squishing it slightly. \"Look at yer Mama when she ask ya a question.\" He instantly turned his head back to look at her, cringing from her squishing. She stopped the squishing asked him again. \"Does Lil' Mackie want a diapey change?\" He looked down, trying to think, but Applejack began to squish his diaper again. \"Ya want a spankin'? Look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was humiliated now, the thought of being spanked by his younger sister, even if she was acting as his mommy, making him even more so. He looked back at her and nodded, frowning. Applejack stepped back, moving her hoof away from his diaper. \"Say what ya want, Lil' Mackie!\" She giggled now, loving the teasing. He was defiantly skeptical of being babied, even if it was his own wish, but in time she would get him to mentally regress to a foal, even if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face got even redder, and he opened his mouth to speak, but stopped, shaking his head. \"Ah don't wanna a change, Applejack...\" She came closer to him, putting her hoof near his diaper again. \"Ya have to call me Mama fer as long as yer a foal. Call me that, and say what ya want.\" He looked about ready to cry, no longer looking like the strong stallion he once was. \"Ah don't wanna a change, Mama...\" Applejack nodded, and stood back again. \"Lil' Mackie is smart. Now when ya make a stinky later, ya won't be using a fresh diaper, and we'll have an extra one to spare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac looked down again, sighing. He tried his best to ignore her, but the thought of messing a diaper still bothered him. He looked back up at her when he heard her move. She picked up his pacifier in put it in his mouth, himself having let it fall out of his mouth when she entered. He was about to spit it out, but Applejack held her hoof in front of his mouth. \"Don't spit that out unless ah say ya can. Now, Mama is going to tell ya the rules, and ya only need to nod to say ya understand them. Now, nod so ah know ya heard everything ah just said.\"</span></div></div>",

She moved her hoof away from in front of his mouth, and he didn't spit the pacifier out for the same reason. She began to speak, and he listened, sucking on the pacifier without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya are to only speak when ya have some to tell me or are respondin' to a question ah ask. If ya plan on makin' a protest against an order ah give ya, don't bother sayin' it. Just say \"Yes Mama, or nod.\" She finished talking and nodded at him. \"Like that. Now, does Lil' Mackie understand? Ya better not talk back to me.\" He nodded in response, and Applejack smile at him. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued now. \"Don't take off yer diapey or clothing ah put on ya. Ya can say if ya want somethin' off, though, obviously not yer diapey, but that don't mean ah have to. If ah give ya a toy, play with it unless there's another around. If a give ya a bottle, drink it.\" He was shocked that she had toys and bottles for him as well, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya don't listen to the rules ya will be punished. If ya do, ya may get rewards.\" He nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and stated the last rule. \"Ya will not ever leave this house when yer my foal. Ya may not go into any other room unless ah say ya can. This includes the bathroom. The only time ya can go in there is if ah give ya a bath.\" His eyes widened at the knowledge of being trapped in here unless given permission to leave, and also due to the last thing she mentioned. \"That's right, Lil' Mac. Ya won't be usin' the potty for a really long time. You'll rely on yer diapers, and rely on me to change them. Now, does mah little foal understand?\" </span></div></div>",

Applejack was quicker, and quickly grabbed his hooves, holding them in place. \"What do ya think yer doin'?\" She asked in an angry and annoyed tone. \"Lil' Mac isn't allowed to take his diapeys off. Is he trying to do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mac looked up at, speaking now. \"Ah don't want to do this anymore, Applejack! Ah... Ah thought ya would just change mah diapers and all, but now yer just...\" He was about to finish speaking, but Applejack quickly smacked him in the face. Though it wasn't too hard, it was enough to shock him. \"Arguin', trying to take yer diapey off, and not callin' me mama... Ya deserve a spanking, young man!\" She sat on the ground, and quickly pulled him into her lap, so his stomach was right on it. He was stronger than her, yes, but her grip on him stopped him from being able to push himself up. She held his forelegs down with one arm, and used the other to raise her free hoof in the air. He began to cry now, afraid of her. It happened too fast, and she was truly going to make his experience bad if he didn't act the correct way. Though he would be a foal, he would be an obedient one, and always listen to his mommy, but he didn't know that until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hoof down, quickly, giving him a powerful slap on his backside. He yelped, now completely in tears. He tried to plead with her, begging her to stop, but she ignored him, and continued spanking him. After about ten times, she stopped, and spoke. \"Ah'm sorry ah had to do that, Lil' Mackie. Ah didn't want to, but ya need to learn. Ya really do. Now, tell mama yer sorry, and that you'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in tears, and afraid, he nodded. He knew he should trust his mommy now, and was now willing to do whatever she wanted him to do. He spoke, in between sobs. \"Mama, ah'm sorry... Ah should have listened to ya. Ah'll be good, and leave mah diapey alone! Ah'll wet it and mess it and ask ya for changes!\" He continued crying after this, but Applejack put a hoof in his mane, stroking it to calm him down. \"Shhhh, there there... It's okay, Lil' Mackie... Ah still love ya, and ah'm glad ya promise ya'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck his pacifier in his mouth, and continued to brush his mane. His mother's touch and the pacifier made him calm down, and he happily sucked on it. After awhile, Applejack spoke. \"Does mah little foal want a bottle?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe we should learn the potty dance first so you'll be able to hold it long enough to make it to the potty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Twilight Sparkle.\" said Rarity.</span></div></div>",

Her blue-purple eyes lighting up at the sight of all this. It was almost too much to take in. The hot sun beating down upon the very green grass - which seemed to have gotten used to all the heat from the gigantic ball of pure flame sitting in the sky far away, the occasional patches of flowers ranging from a light magenta to a deep blue. It was almost too much to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquamarine sees a village nearby. Let's go!</span></div></div>",

Aquamarine is immediately hit by the business of the residents of this humble-sized town. She studied the behaviour of the ponies around her to get a rough shape of how to act. As Aquamarine saw a minty-light green pony exchange a shining coin for a muffin in a bakery that looks like something they'd sell there, she noticed just how hungry she felt. A hint of disappointment sat itself on her face as she knew she had no currency to exchange to these ponies for something to eat. The light blue-ish pony walked away and looked around a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aquamarine walked more, she saw a bright pink pony approaching her at a faster pace apparently called a 'trot'. A simple glimpse at Aquamarine and this pink pony gasped very loudly and runs away so fast, it left Aquamarine in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Aquamarine got pretty bored and even hungrier then before.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shook stars and feathers out of her eyes, yawned, and stretched her limbs to their limits before relaxing and getting up on four paws. She then noticed something amiss. Sitting down to think, she soon found what had happened. She looked down and saw, between her back legs, a diaper with baby items all around the waistband. While she blushed the shade of a ripe tomato, she also noticed that it was wet and messy and nearly screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono!!!\", she exclaimed in a hushed tone as she tried to take the diaper off her backside, and quite soon found out it was impossible due to the thick flannel mittens tied around her hands and wrists. \"What the hell happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nforcing her mind away from the garment taped onto her she finally took in her surroundings. She was sleeping in a crib large enough to accomodate herself and another pony or griffon. The walls were a light shade of blue and pink with cute pictures painted everywhere. Along one wall there stood an enlarged changing table filled with diapers, wipes, and baby powder. There were two other cribs tucked neatly away in the corner, though these looked significantly smaller, like meant for an actual foal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed the door and windows. The windows looked normal with the exception of what looked like a few layers of reinforced chicken wire. The door had a key lock and a handle. She got up and tried to climb over the crib but the crib was too high for her to reach. Then she tried flying and instantly fell back onto her backside, reminding her of her figurative and literal mess. She looked and saw her wings bound by a silver clasp ran over her wings and made a tight circle around them and her chest.

Dash, before she went lame, called the pony Pinkie Pie. She looked the same as she did a few months ago, all except for the gold bracelet around her left forehoof. Then she tilted her head in confusion at the blue pony with white frazzling hair and a sharp loooking horn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you looks so cute right there Gilda!\", said pinkie with a smile that reminded the bound griffon of an over excited parent. The pair of ponys walked forward and stopped at the end of the crib that slid down and smiled to her sweetly. \"I'm sure you have a lot of questions as to who I am and where you are, but...\" the unicorn was cut off right there by Gilda's interjection of,\" Where the buck am I?!?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie sighed and looked at the unicorn and then to Gilda. She walked up and said,\" Baby, Behave and listen\" and then bopped her on the top of her beak. Gilda sat crosseyed for a second and opened her mouth to speak when nothing came out.

Cadence was currently wearing a bright pink long-sleeve onesie that displayed an enlarged version of her cutie mark printed on the seat of the comfy fleece onesie. However, underneath Cadence's onesie, was a very thick diaper. Judging from it's bulk, the diaper that Cadence was wearing around her waist was a few inches thicker than the brand of diapers Chrysalis was wearing, giving Cadence a profound waddle due to her diaper's thick bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her personal onesie and bulkier diaper, Cadence was also wearing a pair of pink thigh-high babyish socks on her hind legs, making her even more adorable, as Cadence was finally finished with putting her long hair into a ponytail, the same kind of ponytail hairstyle the pink Alicorn used to sport when she was younger, back when she used to babysit Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, like Chrysalis, Cadence also happened to be an Adult Foal for a good several years, which made the Changeling Queen like the pink Alicorn more, despite that Chrysalis tried to pose as Cadence just to attempt to take over Equestria, which failed miserably in the end. As for how Cadence's husband, Shining Armor, was handling the fact that his lover was an Adult Foal, the white unicorn stallion actually didn't mind much about his Alicorn wife's fetish fortunately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Twilight's older brother wasn't going to go all hardcore and get himself padded, but Shining didn't mind caring for the Adult Foal Cadence and being her \"Daddy\". After all, when he saw Cadence in her onesie and bulky diapers for the first time, he thought she looked \"pretty cute\", especially when he saw Cadence displaying a pair of fiercely blushing cheeks out of slight embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this wasn't the first time that Chrysalis has seen Cadence indulging into her \"special hobby\", it never got old seeing the Alicorn Princess in a big bulky diaper with a set of babyish clothing, as the diapered Changeling put a left hollow forehoof to her snout, letting out a short giggling fit in the process and said, \"You sure look super cute in that big diapee, 'Mommy'. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she let out a smile in response to Chrysalis's compliment, Cadence still let out a fierce blush across her facial cheeks, causing them to turn a rosy red. Despite she knew that Chrysalis was only giving her a compliment, Cadence couldn't help but blush due to how bulky and comfy her diaper was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
