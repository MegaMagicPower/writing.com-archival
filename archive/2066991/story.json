That really does mean a lot that you'd say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this company is already pretty much as forward it could go right now, I mean, have you seen how much money we make? Spoiler: it's a lot!\" he continued, apparently having not heard your humble response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, um, well, I'm sure I have what it takes to make even more of that money, sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what we need, Anon. Hyperion is just a giant money printer these days! We don't need men who can boost income; we just need men who can prove they want to be here more than anyone else. Can you do that?\" he continued to drape his arm over your shoulder, leading you into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Because I'm sending you away.\" he sat at his desk and motioned for you to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Away, sir? Where?\" you ask, sitting down as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pandora.\" he waved his hands in a jazzy manner as to spruce up the name of the dive he was sending you to. \"Shit hole of a planet, but, we got some guys down there running some experiments on a substance the locals have taken to calling 'slag.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to go down there and oversee their work? Make sure everything is running effiently and everyone is working hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never assume, Anon. Never assume. They need a new guy to replace a failed test from last week and I told them to get the hell outta my office. But then I remembered you and figured 'hey, if the kid wants work.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um-- look, with all due respect, sir, I was kind of hoping for a job that was more on the management side of things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anon. You've got to prove you want to be a manager before you can start becoming a manager. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now get the hell outta my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back on that conversation, you wish you'd just told him you were happy with your current job. Maybe then you wouldn't currently be sat in a giant test tube, with a bunch of giant people walking around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it so happened, the slag experiment you were the subject for involved testing the size changing capabilities of slag. The scientists had heard of beasts growing in size after exposure to slag and they were curious as to what would happen if a human were to be injected with the same type of slag. Severe shrinkage was the result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been kept at your current size, two and a half inches, for about 3 days now. There was talk of maybe making you smaller but they concluded that they'd gathered all the information they could from your shrinking. Maybe you'll be getting that promotion sooner that you'd expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the scientists was making his way over to you when an engineer came rushing in covered in blood. Everyone stopped what they were doing immediately, shifting their attention to the blood soaked man catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's--\" the engineer was cut off by a large purple orb that lifted him a few feet off the ground and set him ablaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIREN!!\" one man shouted as everyone made their retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait! Don't leave me!!\" you screamed after them, banging on the glass of your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunshots echoed from the hallway, growing louder by the second. Bullets flew through the doorway, incapacitating the fleeing scientists. You curled into a ball, preying a stray bullet wouldn't find you and tear you to absolute shreds. You'd been warned about the abundance of firearms on Pandora but you never assumed you'd come anywhere near any kind of combat. If you'd known you'd be under the threat of sirens and bullets the size of you, you'd have told your manager to fuck off since day one. Is this really how your life is going to end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of gunfire and screams and murder, everything went quiet. You summoned the courage to stand up and see the damage that had been done. You wished you hadn't once you saw all the bodies lying around. Almost everyone in the facility had been killed. You felt bad for the poor men who clocked in this morning with no intention of being gunned down in the middle of their shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked stunned at the aftermath of the chaos that had ensued, you noticed a blue haired woman walk through the door that was recently spitting out bullets. She wandered around, putting bullets in the heads of some scientists who hadn't quite succumbed to their injuries yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why waste the bullets?\" a voice coming from the door said. As you looked over, a younger woman walked in, possibly in her late teens. You noticed she had a robot arm but not much else grabbed your attention about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What separates us from the rest of the scum on Pandora, Gaige?\" The blue haired girl asked, continuing to finish the barely living survivors. The girl, now confirmed to be Gaige, thought for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... have bigger guns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're proffesionals. We don't just unload our weapons into a crowd and leave. We make sure every kill is clean. No unnecessary suffering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're Hyperion. I say let them bleed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as Gaige revealed her hatred for the company you represent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me why you came with me.\" the siren said, visibly annoyed at Gaige's running commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'unno. Bored. Everybody was off doing stuff and then you went off to go do stuff and I figured 'Hey! Stuff!' so I came along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, look at all this stuff!\" Gaige added as she tinkered with a generator. \"Say what you want about Hyperion, love 'em or hate 'em, but, they have some cool tech! Wonder if any of it can be salvaged... Maya! Help me with this!\" Gaige struggled to rip out some sort of battery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Waste of time. Tannis said she wanted whatever they were working on here and that's it.\" Maya instructed. That didn't sound good. You weren't the only thing they were working on here but you were probably the most interesting. This did not bode well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiine.\" Gaige sighed, retiring her efforts. She started sifting through paper and checking desks for the fabled experiment. You looked around desperately for a way to escape your glass prison but saw nothing. All you could do was sit and wait as the two giant women grew closer to your position with each terrifying step. What would they do to you? Who is this 'Tannis' person and what do they want you for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered how you would play it when they eventually found you. Would you be cool and collected? \"Hi, I'm the experiment. What is it you need?\" Or maybe suave and charismatic? \"Ladies, search no more for your answer finds you in one neatly wrapped, handsome package. Anon's the name, pleasing ladies is the game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fantasised the many ways in which you could introduce yourself, a giant face came into your view, scaring you witless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Help!!\" ...or you could play it scared and pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this it?\" the giant face of Gaige called over to the other titan. Maya came over and you found yourself looking up at two gigantic, albeit pretty, faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so??\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It asked for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya tapped the glass, shaking your entire world. \"Hey, you. Tiny person. Are you the slag experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou considered saying no but chances are that would lead to these two either leaving you here to rot or simply killing you. You opted for the long term decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. They were experimenting on me to see the size changing capabili--\" your tube was lifted with immense speed and carried away with you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard yes.\" Maya said as she attached you to her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your journey to this town called 'Sanctuary' was a bumpy ride. You were still attached to Maya's belt as she drove you and Gaige across the desert in some sort of dune-buggy. You were unclipped from the belt once you entered the border of Santuary and Maya tossed you to Gaige who almost didn't catch you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken into a small building where a lady with short hair and goggles sat waiting at her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vault Hunters, you return! Did you get me something nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did!\" Gaige's chirped as she handed you over to the lady who must be Tannis. She held your glass cage close up to her face to examine you, making her eyes look huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a slag experiment Hyperion were working on. I assume they want to use slag to shrink people for whatever reason.\" Maya elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he know anything?\" Tannis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask him yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTannis opened the top of your test tube and slowly tip it over. You slid down and landed on the table with a dull thud. Unsure of what to do with your new found 'freedom', you decided to stay put and look up at Tannis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..?\" she started, \"What are they trying to learn from you?\" she leaned in closer with curiosity lighting a fire in her eyes. You were torn between melting at how cute that would be at normal size, or screaming at how scary it is at your current size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I really have no idea. I was just told I'd get a promotion if I went through with it...\" you waited to see if your answer was good enough for her and she picked you up and started twiddling you around in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why would Hyperion need to shrink people? Weaponising slag has already been established so they don't stand much profit from adding a shrinking element, though that would be fascinating, so maybe they aren't looking to shrink enemies but perhaps... allies? Smaller employees means they can fit more workers in their space stations, this allows for more work to be done and thus higher efficiency...\" her ramblings continued as you were flung about and fiddled with between the giant dork's long fingers. You tried to wriggle free but you were already starting to get a feel for just how weak you are at your new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, you were released and you let yourself drop to your hands and knees. Tannis had stopped speaking which allowed Maya to finally get a word in. She plucked you off the table and dangled you infront of her face. You looked down at the ground miles beneath you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down!! What's wrong with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say a promotion?\" Maya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Y-yeah, my boss said I had to volunteer for--\" Maya interrupted you abruptly yet again, dropping you back on the table and pinning you down with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He works for Hyperion. He can't stay here. He'll tell Hyperion about everything he hears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't!\" you tried to shout up to them from under Maya's palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But that doesn't mean he can't stay.\" Tannis started, \"It just means he can't leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still much to learn from our new found tiny friend here. It would be a waste to end his life here and now, especially after the trouble the two of you went through to get him, so someone needs to watch him to ensure he doesn't escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not it.\" Maya and Gaige say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking for volunteers. And I already had someone in mind...\" Tannis said, taking you from under Maya's hand. You gasped for some much needed fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Maya asked.</span></div></div>",

The single most dangerous woman in the Dust?\" Maya questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she was the only woman in the Dust.\" Gaige deadpanned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie's psyche profile doesn't match that of a capable caregiver, this is true, but her garage is secluded. Far away from Sanctuary. So, if Mr. Hyperion here should find some way to contact his employer, he won't have any info on us to dish out if he returns. Plus, I checked and there is not a single soul on Pandora with an ounce of motherly instinct so Ellie will simply put the most fear into him. Now go away, I'll pay you when you return, you know the drill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surprised yourself with how much you actually paid attention to there. Normally, you zone out when people talk more than three sentences to you but it's probably a bit different when the topic is literally who might kill you by the end of today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you wish this could be over today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya put you back in the tube and clipped you to her belt. She made off alone this time in the dune-buggy-like contraption and began to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive lasted hours. Tannis wasn't kidding when she said it was far away. The scorching sun turned your tube into an oven and passed out a couple of times on the way here. The engines rumbling came to a halt along with the car. Maya hopped out and drew her pistol. This worried you. Why would she need to be armed and ready if this Ellie was an ally. Your question was quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Git on the ground now before I fill your head with buckshot.\" a voice ordered from behind. Maya turned around slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heeeey, girly! What brings you all the way out here? Sorry about the whole shotgun thing. I mean, you look like a Siren from behind and all but that's how they get you, man - overconfidence - one minute I'm looking at a beautiful Siren, she turns around and BOOM! Bandit. Or family come down to stay for the week. Either way I gotta have my finger on that trigger. I'm working on it, promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I actually came to ask you a favour. We need you to keep an eye on a Hyperion prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may just be my new favourite sentence! Where is the bastard? Tied to the front of the car? Niiiice. You want me to rough 'em up a bit? Maybe pull a couple teeth? Or maybe I could--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS. Is him...\" Maya held up the tube containing you. Ellie quickly swiped it to check you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was part of a test. It's a long story. All I'm asking you to do is make sure he stays here. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that Tannis lady shrink 'em? 'Cause I wouldn't put it past her, that bitch is craaay-zee. You know this one time she shot--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can, girl, don't you worry your pretty little head you just go right on back and tell Tannis I've got it covered. Go on, git!\" Ellie shooed Maya over to her car. \"And drive careful.\" She called as Maya sped off. She sighed as the dust cleared. \"I do worry about those kids... NOW!!\" She tossed you up in the air and caught you, \"let's begin, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were carried into the garage. The mattress on the floor in the corner suggested that Ellie might sleep here too. You wondered how one would even sleep in a place like this. The all too apparent lack of doors and windows means that anyone could sneak in and put a bullet in your head while you slept. You shivered at the thought of sleeping tonight. Would you be forced to share a bed with this gigantic tank of a woman? Would you even last until the evening in her clutches?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you open this thing?\" Ellie wondered out a loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's a--\" your attempt at helpfulness was cut off by a sudden increase of speed. Time seemed to slow down enough to realise what was happening. Ellie was just going to smash it! You braced for impact in whatever fraction of a second you had left before you were laid out on the table surrounded by shards of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! You're insane! I could've died!\" you turned around to face the enormous woman. God she was big. Even if you were normal size she'd probably terrify you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie flicked you across the table. \"Don't you talk to me unless I speak first. Got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent as you stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question. Got. That?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent. Mostly because the impact of her plump fingers had winded you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna answer me. Now.\" she primed her fingers to flick you again and you hit the deck cowering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please!!\" She put her face close up to you. You could feel her breath hot on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got. That?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Fuck, just don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Otherwise I'd have to just kill you now and all my fun would be wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Does she mean she's going to kill you anyway? And what fun does she plan on having with you? For the fourth time in one day, you feared for your life. You had to get away from this woman. Right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as your shaky legs would carry you but you only made it a few steps before a gigantic fist came crashing down infront of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\" Ellie picked you up and squeezed you tight in her first. \"I've crushed men who were five hundred times the size you are. You don't want to piss me off. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of her fist made it hard to breathe, but you managed to answer her.</span></div></div>",

Despite being, slender and tone, her legs were like giant logs compared to your new size.<br>\r\nLess than two minutes later, after dodging boulder-sized landmines, and ripping bandits and skags with Gaige behind the Rocket-launcher, and Maya on the front turret, you came to the opening of a cave with a garage door.  Too scared to look ahead, you curled up in your glass prison of a test tube, once again, clipped to the Siren's hip.<br>\r\nCuriosity gets the better of you ask you turn to see your new Warren. A little girl? She can't be older than 12.<br>\r\n\"Tiny Tina's a twelve year old? You said aloud. <br>\r\n\"Wo wo wo, who in the hyperion hell said that? If I find the butt wipe that said that, I'll sent them on a rocket so strong, It'll snap Helios in two, and have them land on Elpis while they beg for their mama's titties for safety.\" The eccentric girl said, going to a cave covered by a blood and soot stained sheet. Pulling it down to reveal a stockpile of explosives large enough to not only complete the feat she mentioned, but enough to turn the entire solar system into space dust. <br>\r\n\"Oh hai Maya and Gaige! Come for the tea party? I'm sure I can make room for you two.\" Tina replied. <br>\r\n\"Pst...she's 13, not 12.\" Gaige whispered. <br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh okay,\" you say <br>\r\nTina, we're here to hand over this hyperion bug to you so you can...\" Maya started to say. <br>\r\n\"Hyperion! Where? I'll make him talk! What the bandit fuck? That's the Hyperion bug? I guess I see now why you said  \"bug\", HEHEHE!\" She laughed right in front of you. <br>\r\n\"Well, our work hear is done. C'mon Gaige. Time to go.\" Maya said after handing you to the 13 year old. <br>\r\n\"Bye Tina! See you next week for tea and crumpets!\" Gaige waved goodbye. <br>\r\n\"Bye Gaige! Bye Maya! Don't forget to bring me some of Moxie's pizza, or I'll make spaghetti with your intestines! Tina waved back with the same hand she held you in, causing you to be shooken around. After the Vault hunters left, you stood face to face with the most dangerous 13 year old.<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

Sir Anon, says Anon on your test tube, of Heathen-Hall, you're from Hyperion, so you worked with a bunch of safe space wimps...<br>\r\nAnon: Hey!<br>\r\nT. Tina: Sorry, not sorry. <br>\r\nAnon:*mutters*<br>\r\nT. Tina: So! Time for the Tea party!<br>\r\n[Tina takes you out of your prison, holding you in her hand that smelled like acid, gun powder, and sweaty socks, she then plops you on her table]<br>\r\nT. Tina: Okay, move, and your dead! <br>\r\nAnon:*gulp*<br>\r\n[Tina leaves briefly, coming back with a tray of piping hot tea kettle, three intact, normal-sized teacups, one broken teacup, a stack of hot crucrumpets, an old sweaty sock, and a ceramic thimble,placing the three teacups at her seat, and in front of two things that are dressed like posh pluses, she then takes the broken cup and old, red, fuzzy sock, putting the sock in the cup and placing it behind me, then grabbing me and placing me on the sock in the cup as a smelly makeshift chair, then placing the thimble right in front of me, and setting up the rest of the table]<br>\r\nT. Tina:(sitting down) Would you like some tea Sir Reginald? Very well. What about you Princess Fuffybutt? You too?certainly! And how about you Sir Heathen-Hall? <br>\r\nAnon: Uhhh, sure? <br>\r\nT. Tina: Excellent! [Tina pours tea into the thimble right in front of you] And I'll have some as well.[pouring herself a cup]<br>\r\nSo...Anon...what's your history in Hyperion? <br>\r\nAnon: well...I was orphaned at age six, struggled to survive on Pandora for two years, Recruited to work with Hyperion with my childhood friend Jack <br>\r\nT. Tina:*spitting tea at you* Hold on there amigo...Jack? Handsome Jack?<br>\r\nAnon: Oh believe me. There wasn't anything \"Handsome\" about him. I'm the one who came up with the nickname, it's completely satirical. <br>\r\nT: You Knew Handsome Jack, and came up with his nickname? <br>\r\nA: Yep <br>\r\nT: Oh, silly me, dropped my spoon. Hold on...Hey! Barron Von Boomstick? Is that you? [She comes back up with a Hyperion Shotgun, aimed right at you]<br>\r\nT: Okay buddy, any friend of Handsome Jack is an enemy of me, so if you want to live, TALK!<br>\r\nBB:No talking! More Shooting! <br>\r\nA: Did your shotgun just talk? Why does it sound like a Loader Bot?<br>\r\nBB: One of the Vault Hunters had me turned into a shotgun, I've been happy ever since. Especially when they gave me to Tiny Tina, she then renamed me from Inspiring Shotgun 1340, to my new, more badass name, Barron Von Boomstick! <br>\r\nT: Ahhhhhh...good times...NOW YOU TALK OR ME AND BB PLAY GOOD COP,/BAD COP, AND WE BOTH SUCK AS GOOD COP!<br>\r\nA: OKAY, I KNEW HIM SINCE WE WERE KIDS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? <br>\r\nT: Were you still friends? <br>\r\nA: Do \"friends\" pissed and take dumps on each other's tombstones? <br>\r\nT: Damn HH. What did the Jack-off do to you? <br>\r\nA: Framed me for having drugs on Helios, nearly getting me fired...in a rocket...to the sun...<br>\r\nT: Damn...I knew Jack really was a dickhead, but that! That is terrible. Not attempted genocide for shits and giggles, but still...a really Dick move!<br>\r\nA: Yep! Hope those Vault hunters gave him hell.<br>\r\nBB: Awkward.<br>\r\nT: Jack...Jack had me and my parents taken to...to be experimented on.*sobs...in a choked up voice* I-I was so young and *sobbing* I didn't even get a chance to free them or ...say goodbye...<br>\r\n[Tina broke out into tears, knowing her same orphaned feeling, you peel yourself off your sweaty sock seat, you made your way to the crying teen, hugging her nose until she noticed you]<br>\r\nA: I know what it's like to lose parents, ironically it's how John and I became friends, plus some stealing, but that's not important. We all lost our parents...Jack's to a bandit raid, mines to a Vault Guardian, yours to...<br>\r\nT: Hyperion experiments with Slag.<br>\r\nA: Slag? Like me? <br>\r\nT: Yeah! Like you! <br>\r\nA: But, Tina...They don't ever let their test subjects die when experimenting with Slag, same with POWs.<br>\r\nT: What you talking about Anon? <br>\r\nA:They Put Brain Wave implants in their heads, so small, no microscope can see them, and if a subject dies, they reanimate them back to health. <br>\r\nT: Woah! Hyperion is playing God? <br>\r\nA: No it's more like a big middle finger to mortality. Matter of fact. I was in charge of keeping the New-U accounts your Vault hunter friends still have. All of them. Even that one black guy. As well as a bloodwing for some reason. <br>\r\nT: Whaaaaaaaaaat? My parents, Roland and bloodwing can be brought back from the dead? Why didn't you say so earlier? I never thought I'd be thanking Hyperion! How do we bring them back? <br>\r\n[Tina ask all this while crushing you against her chest in a big hug]<br>\r\nA:[In pain] We...have to...ouch...unfreeze their accounts. ..agh...and resurrect them manually...ahhhhhh your crushing me!...<br>\r\nT: Sorry [she puts you back on the table] So? What are we waiting for? Let's get all of the Fallen people That dead bastard Jack took from us!<br>\r\nA: Hold on! Shouldn't we get your Vault hunter friends help?
