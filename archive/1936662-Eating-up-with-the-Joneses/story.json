It was 10:30 at night, and his mom and dad had gone to bed early in preparation for their big trip tomorrow, but they were notoriously light sleepers. They had a bad habit of waking up and moving around the house when he was up to things he knew they didn\u2019t approve of, and he\u2019d been caught sneaking in and sneaking out many times. This time he wasn\u2019t really doing either, but he still didn\u2019t want them to know what he was doing.<br>\r\n\tThere! Outside the window he saw the lights of a car slowing down to turn onto his driveway. On the roof of the car was the telltale illuminated Pizza Hut logo of a delivery car. Quickly, yet as silently as he could move, Evan hopped off the couch, padded off to the front door, and slipped out into the cold night air to meet the delivery car, leaving a wadded-up sock in the doorway to keep the screen door from slamming loudly shut behind him.<br>\r\n\tThe door for the car opened, and out stepped an attractive redhead in a well-fitting Pizza Hut delivery girl\u2019s uniform. She looked over at Evan as he approached the car and smiled, shaking her head.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re something else, you know that, Evan?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m something else? My parents are something else,\u201d Evan whispered. \u201cYou know how they are about me eating junk food. I have to be sneaky if I\u2019m going to get any at all.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know how they are, but I know how you are too. You keep sneaking this much junk food and soon you\u2019ll be too fat to be any good at sneaking.\u201d She gave his hard-to-ignore potbelly a playful jab with her finger.<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a price I\u2019m glad to pay, Katie. \u201c<br>\r\n\tKatie was a senior at Evan\u2019s high school, and, as with most other people he knew who worked in the local fast food industry, he\u2019d endeavored to get closer to her, and, by association, closer to the food she served. It hadn\u2019t taken more than a few of these conspiratorial late-night deliveries for Katie to figure out Evan\u2019s situation: he was a foodaholic who had unaccommodating parents. Unlike some of the other people who had figured this out, however, Katie didn\u2019t really seem to care, and since he tipped her well, she had come to appreciate the chubby boy\u2019s quirks, and gladly played along with them. Plus, even though he was two years younger than her and noticeably obese, there was something about him that she had to admit was kind of cute.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpeaking of prices, that\u2019ll be $32.50,\u201d she said, hefting four large pizza boxes out of the car and gingerly setting them on the steps to Evan\u2019s house. Evan handed her the money in exact change, plus a hefty tip.<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re really going to eat all these on your own?\u201d She remarked. \u201cYou\u2019re not having a slumber party or anything?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYup. These are all mine.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.impressive, I suppose.\u201d Her tone suggested that she wasn\u2019t entirely sure if she was genuinely impressed or disgusted. \u201cThis is a lot even for you, don\u2019t you think? Are we celebrating something?\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou could say that\u2026\u201d Evan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Evan Celebrating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: The Joneses invited Evan to join them for a two week trip at a beach resort, complete with full access to a luxury spa and unlimited endless buffets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: The Joneses have won a year's supply of free dessert foods, and have offered to share the wealth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: The Joneses plan to go on a well-stocked camping trip, and Evan is invited<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4: Evan's parents are leaving the country for a year, and Evan is temporarily moving in with the Joneses, and will simply be living their normal lifestyle with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5: More options...</span></div></div>",

I think I can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell more power to you. Take care.\u201d Katie hopped into her car and drove off into the night.<br>\r\nEvan awkwardly hefted the four large pizza boxes and cautiously reopened the door. He eased the door shut behind him as cautiously as possible, ever concerned about waking his strict parents. Carrying the heavy load of boxes through the house in the dark was even more challenging, and he had to move very cautiously to avoid crashing into anything.<br>\r\nThe scent arising from the warm boxes he held was intoxicating. It took every ounce of willpower he had to keep from tearing into the boxes right on the living room floor, but he knew if he lingered, that same smell might reach his parents, and that was the last thing he wanted. No, he had to reach the sanctity of his room.<br>\r\nFinally, after scaling a treacherous staircase and easing the door to his room shut, he could relax. Only, he wasn\u2019t interested in relaxing. He was interested in pizza.<br>\r\nHe sat on his bed and opened two of the boxes. They were both 14 inch meatlovers and, per his special arrangements with Katie, they had double the already excessive amount of toppings. He grabbed a slice in each hand, and immediately began to feast.<br>\r\nWhat Evan said was true: he had never eaten a meal that had actually filled him up, and despite the fact that this little \u201cmidnight snack\u201d of his contained more than 16,000 calories, it was not going to be the exception to the rule. It took him about twenty minutes to down the first pizza, twenty more to get through the second. He had eaten almost seven pounds of food, but he wasn\u2019t even coming close to capacity.<br>\r\nHis shirt was, though. With each inch-thick slice of pizza he crammed into his mouth, his stomach bulged more assertively outwards, turning from a floppy paunch that typically hung about an inch and a half over his pants into a swollen half-globe that was cautiously peering out into the world beyond the hem of his shirt and weighing the options of exploring it further. By the time he was about halfway done with his third pizza, his gut had expanded to roughly the size of a volleyball, and was hanging out of his increasingly inadequate shirt a good two inches.<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t care less. He paid no attention to the creaking seams of his t-shirt as he barreled on through his meal. He ate another slice, and another, and by the time he had finished the third pizza, his shirt had become stretched so tight it was almost transparent, and its seams were perilously near their breaking point.<br>\r\nAs he finished his fourth and final slice of pizza, his shirt began to die. A tear appeared along his right side, and another appeared over his belly button. Well, that is, it appeared over the part of his shirt that had been covering his belly button before he started eating.  His belly button had worked its way out of his shirt\u2019s custody by the end of the third pizza, and was now hanging out of the bottom of his shirt along with a good six inches of extra flesh. His astonishing belly was now the size of a mid-sized beach ball, and it imposed onto his lap up until about mid-thigh.<br>\r\nHe stood up to brush the crumbs off his bed and set the boxes aside. As he did, his belly sloshed and churned with him. His shirt rode up even higher as he stood, settling about two inches above his impressive lovehandles, in much the same way that a person might cautiously back up a hill away from dangerous rising floodwaters. It was in vain, though. Evan was a nice guy, but he was murder on shirts.<br>\r\nEvan sat back down and rubbed his swollen belly in satisfaction. In spite of its alarming increase in size, he was pretty sure he could fit four more pizzas in there, if he had any more. There was probably quite a bit of food lying around the house that he could get at if he was quiet, and the thought of putting even more food, even if it was his parents\u2019 irritatingly healthy crap, into his gut was enticing. However, there was a risk of being caught, and given his current state, he wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as stealthy as he was earlier. Plus, it was going to be hard enough hiding the effects of this binge in the morning as it was.  Did he dare risk foraging for more food? Or should he wait until his visit to the Jones\u2019s in the morning?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If his mom or dad caught him in his current state, with a food-filled, globe-sized gut drooping out of his shirt, they would undoubtedly freak out, and might even cancel their trip to stay home and deal with their insane glutton of a son. Naturally, that would entirely defy the purpose of Evan\u2019s celebratory meal. One night of restraint, Evan decided, was more than a fair exchange for one week of excess.<br>\r\nEvan removed his ruined shirt and tossed it in the wastebasket instead of his laundry hamper, and he stripped down to his briefs. He turned off the light and went to bed, praying he could fall asleep before too long so the next day would come all the quicker.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Evan awoke the next morning to the sound of his growling stomach, as always. As he pried himself out of bed, he noticed that his belly had fortunately shrunken to a somewhat more socially acceptable size, even though he did feel a bit softer overall. He padded over to his bathroom to brush his teeth and do his business, and then he pulled out his scale to weigh himself. He did this every day, not because he personally cared how high the numbers went, but because his parents did. He knew if his weight went over a certain point, they would put him on a crash diet again. He was sure that pounds would be gained over the course of the next week\u2026probably a great many of them in fact\u2026and he would likely be made to regret it when Mom and Dad came home. All the more reason to make the most of this week, as far as he was concerned.<br>\r\nThe number on the scale was not particularly surprising to him: he\u2019d gained four more pounds since he weighed himself yesterday. It wasn\u2019t a shabby gain by any means, although it was nowhere close to his 15th birthday record of twelve pounds. Boy was that a memorable birthday! And that had been in spite of his parents\u2019 supervision.<br>\r\nEvan thought back to that day with fondness. He\u2019d gone to a buffet with a bunch of his friends for a party, including the Joneses. Given the size of the party (he\u2019d had almost 30 other kids there), his parents were having a hard time keeping everyone organized. He\u2019d used that distraction to his advantage, and managed to devour 35 heaping plates of food in addition to four helpings of cake and ice cream. His gut had been the size of an exercise ball by the end of the day. Yet even then, he\u2019d felt like he could have gone further.<br>\r\nEvan put the pleasant memory to rest and began to get dressed. His jeans still fit okay, although they were beginning to get a bit tight in the butt area, as well as the waistband. His shirts were somewhat more problematic. He tried on several that simply would not cover him, finally discovering that an old T-shirt of his dad\u2019s which had ended up in his laundry somehow did manage to cover his stomach completely, but it was a very close call. He\u2019d have to watch his movements while around his parents; any significant bending over or raising of his arms would instantly reveal several inches of chub. Evan made a mental note to swing by Wal-Mart on his way to the Joneses to pick up some new shirts in the next size up. Or maybe two sizes up, just to be safe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Evan left his room, he noticed a stillness in the house around him. A thrill went through him at the thought that his parents might have left already, thereby giving him the chance to gorge on whatever goodies he could find before heading to the Joneses\u2019 house, but he was cautious. He crept through the house, checking from room to room. Finally, he ended up in the kitchen, and noticed a note on the fridge:<br>\r\nDear Evan,<br>\r\nWe hope you have fun with the Joneses while we\u2019re away. Please remember to take your vitamins, and stay away from carbs. We love you!<br>\r\nMom and Dad.<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too,\u201d Evan grumbled, as he ripped the paper off the fridge, pulled the door open, grabbed a full carton of 1% milk, and began to chug the entire thing.<br>\r\nHis bulging belly undulated with each swallow, and a small trickle of spillage ran down his chin. He wasted very little, however, and within two minutes, he\u2019d emptied the entire jug. He patted his swollen gut, and proceeded to raid the fridge, the pantries, and everything else of any food that looked remotely tasty to him.<br>\r\nThere wasn't much. His mom, perhaps anticipating a binge session like this, had allowed their food stores to run depressingly low. As always, there were very few foods in the house that would be appetizing to anyone but an absolute health nut, but Evan hoarded everything good he could find. And devoured it.<br>\r\nHe found a package of low-fat cookies, two packages of saltine crackers, a carton of sugar-free ice cream, and a box of whole-grain cereal. He also found a package of low-fat sausages, which he fried up for himself, and a few boxes of TV-dinners his mom had bought his dad to take with him to work. All in all, he was able to assemble a pretty decent spread of halfway acceptable food, and he chowed down like a starving man.<br>\r\nIt took him about an hour, but eventually he finished everything he\u2019d acquired for himself. It amounted to about fifteen pounds of food, and hie looked very nearly pregnant. His belly had swollen once again to match its size from last night, and was again unwilling to be restrained by his shirt. It hung over the edge of his pants, leaving two full inches of skin clearly visible.<br>\r\nAlthough he still felt a desire for more food, there was nothing left in the house he considered \u201cfood.\u201d He then resolved to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had $312.00 in it, which he\u2019d been saving to buy an X-Box One and some new games for it, but deep down, he always knew what he was really saving that money for. He was saving it for a day like this; a day when he could blow a huge amount of money on the biggest, fattiest meal his body could handle.<br>\r\nThe Joneses only lived a mile away, but since Evan didn\u2019t have his license yet, that meant he\u2019d have to walk there. This would have been torture on the poor fat boy, and he\u2019d originally been planning to call Mrs. Jones to come pick him up. However, he decided walking would be worth it this time: there were no fewer than five restaurants between his house and theirs, and he was determined to gorge himself at at least one of them.<br>\r\nHe took his money and began walking down the suburban road, his heavy belly sagging out of his shirt and bobbing and jostling with every step. He noticed disapproving stares from several of his neighbors, but he paid them no mind. He\u2019d worked hard for this belly, and he\u2019d be damned if anyone was going to stop him from filling it further this time.<br>\r\nOriginally, he\u2019d planned on stopping at Hong-Chow Chinese Buffet, since it was his favorite of the five restaurants on his route and would have the biggest selection. However, by the time he reached the Burger King, his stomach was growling so loudly, he wasn\u2019t sure he could help himself from stopping in there first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slipped into the Burger King, waited patiently in line, and stepped up to the register to order his meal.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you, sir?\u201d said the girl at the register. Evan thought it was funny that she called him sir, since she looked like she was probably his exact same age. She was pretty, with brown hair pulled into a ponytail and dark brown eyes. Those eyes kept flickering back and forth from making contact with his eyes and his protruding gut, though she looked like she was trying to be polite and not embarrass anybody. Her nametag read \u201cCandy.\u201d<br>\r\nEvan smiled. \u201cHi, Candy.

He had no idea if he could handle this much food all in one sitting, but he was determined to give it his best try, and that meant cutting down every barrier that might impede him. Once he got started eating, he didn't want to have to spend a spare second unwrapping anything, or fumbling with packaging to get at his meal. He planned to do nothing but scarf until he either finished it or reached his limit.<br>\r\nThe burgers were incredible. He couldn't recall the last time he'd had one, and each miraculous bite made him more excited for the next. He only seemed to gain momentum as he went, downing one burger after another, shoving fistfuls of fries down his gullet with almost orgasmic delight. Each new sandwich he devoured was like an awakening for him; a torrent of flavors he'd been denied for so long now filled his life with flavors he'd never known before he couldn't live without.<br>\r\nThe fries dwindled before him, the emptied cups stacking high beside him. He was almost in a trance as he gradually consumed every last piece of food at the table. He barely noticed as his food-stuffed belly swelled to the size of a soccer ball, separating his now unbuttonable pants as the zipper crept downward of its own accord. The stares of both patrons and employees were lost on him. He experienced only the nirvana of pure gluttony, and he knew there was no going back to his old life now.<br>\r\nHe pushed himself away from the table, gathered the foot-high pile of crumpled food wrappers onto one of his trays, and slowly carried it to the garbage can, his hugely distended belly bouncing above his crotch with each step.<br>\r\nAs he dumped the debris from his conquest into the can, he was astonished to realize that he could probably still eat more. He still had to get to the Jones's house, and he knew there would still definitely be food waiting for him there. He was definitely full enough to make it the rest of the way there without being uncomfortably hungry, for sure. But his newfound hedonistic side was telling him he really shouldn't stop eating if he felt like he still could...</span></div></div>",

As much as he enjoyed the feeling of stuffing himself crazy with delicious food, and as much as he felt like he could probably handle another full round from the entire menu, he figured it was time to get on his way.<br>\r\nWell...another few bites for the road wouldn't hurt...<br>\r\nHe walked up to the counter, bulging gut resting heavily against it. He ordered five more Whoppers, each with a large order of fries, and their largest sized drink. A few minutes later, Candy awkwardly handed him the heavy take-out bag and oversized cup, and he gladly accepted them.<br>\r\nEvan left the Burger King, munching on his food, moaning in pleasure at every bite. He didn't care that his swollen belly was swinging with every step, every huge bite making his shirt ride up its growing expanse a little more. Honestly, the breeze felt nice against his stomach, and was a cool relief from the hot summer day. He was moving a bit slower than he had on his way in, sweating a little more and breathing a little more heavily. He still barely noticed. While he was eating, he may as well have been in another world.<br>\r\nBy the time he reached the Joness' house, he had finished his second meal completely. He looked at least 35 pounds heavier than he'd been when he woke up in the morning..His belly hung a good ten inches out of his shirt, which had also ridden up over his growing lovehandles and newly forming side-rolls. His pants were getting noticeably tighter all the way around as well.<br>\r\nHe was panting pretty hard by the time he reached the Joneses' house. He wasn't used to carrying around so much added weight...plus he'd been eating so aggressively he'd almost gotten out of breath from that alone. Worse than that, though...he realized he was hungry again....<br>\r\nHe approached the door, stopped for a few minutes to catch his breath, his heavy belly rising and falling with each breath.

Evan blushed a little as he felt his friend\u2019s mom\u2019s body press into his plumpened frame: her generous breasts squashing against his developing moobs and her slightly plump potbelly pressing into his overfull sloshing gut.<br>\r\nAs she pulled away, she cast her eyes up and down his newly enhanced proportions.<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness, you\u2019re looking so healthy today!\u201d she said, with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you\u2019re finally eating properly.\u201d<br>\r\nShe gave his bloated belly a playful slosh with both hands. \u201cYou look more and more like Graham every day. Come on inside.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mrs. Jones,\u201d Evan replied, as he waddled slowly into the house.<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t help but notice that Karen seemed to have put on a bit of extra weight herself recently. Her generous hips seemed to sway a bit more assertively than usual, her plump backside pulling her pants intriguingly tight. A pronounced muffin top was peeking its way around the circumference of her blouse as well. She looked to have gained about ten to fifteen pounds since Evan had seen her last, and she\u2019d stored it beautifully.<br>\r\nAs he thumped down the hallway and entered the dining room, where the rest of the family was, he discovered that Karen\u2019s gain was not unique.<br>\r\nGiven the Jones\u2019s universal propensity for gluttony, it was far from unheard of for one of them to gain as much as ten pounds over a particularly hungry week. However, it looked as if all of them had piled on an unusually large amount of weight since the last time he\u2019d seen them. <br>\r\nErin sat at the table in an ill-fitting tank top that more closely resembled a flimsy sports bra. Her G-cup boobs were barely restrained by it, and her swollen belly took up most of her lap. She looked like she\u2019d fattened her way up to about 195-200 lbs.<br>\r\nGraham sat at the head of the table, shirtless as usual. His many rolls had completely consumed his own lap, and his belly was threatening to push him away from the table, while his tremendous ass was beginning to droop over the sides of his chair. He looked like he could have easily been up to 330 lbs now, maybe more.<br>\r\nBut \u201clittle\u201d Natalie was perhaps the most impressive. Her tremendous belly was now hanging confidently over her knees and pressing her cartoonishly small shirt to just under her flabby chest. Roll upon roll adorned her young frame, a trio of chins jiggling ferociously as she shoveled food into her mouth with both hands. Her meager clothes looked like they could burst off her at any second, and from the stack of not-yet eaten burgers in front of her, Evan suspected that very thing could happen soon. She must have easily passed her mother\u2019s weight by now, possibly even Erin\u2019s, which was utterly gargantuan on her young frame.<br>\r\nAll three Jones children continued ravenously shoveling food into their mouths, as if they hadn\u2019t eaten in days.<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be famished, Evan. Please, help yourself,\u201d Karen said warmly. She pulled out a chair and placed an entire pizza in front of Evan as he sat down heavily.<br>\r\n<i>This is better than I could have ever hoped for</i>, thought Evan as he eagerly tore into the food.<br>\r\nBetween stuffed mouthfuls, Evan attempted to make some conversation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking back and fourth between the three Jones siblings as they relentlessly shoveled slice after slice into their own mouths, he wondered how much they had already eaten today. They didn't seem to be slowing down at all, and from the stack of unopened pizza boxes sitting in the middle of the table, it didn't look like they planned to slow down any time soon either. The Joneses had always been big eaters as long as he'd known them, but from the looks of things, they had really taken it to a new level recently.<br>\r\nEvan swallowed the unnecessarily large bite he'd just taken of his sixth slice of pizza, and turned to Karen. \"What's the occasion, Mrs. Jones? Are we celebrating something today?\"<br>\r\nKaren finished her own slice of pizza in three large bites, then paused to swallow before answering. \"Not that I'm aware of. Although, come to think of it, we should have prepared a special dinner to celebrate your first night with us! Why do you ask?\" She barely allowed her last word to be spoken before taking a generous bite of her next slice.<br>\r\n<i>No special occasion? They can't possibly eat like this every day... </i>The thought was too good to possibly be true. \"I just meant, why all the pizza? Is this a normal meal?\"<br>\r\n\"Just on Mondays and Fridays\" Erin mumbled around a mouthful of pizza. \"Tomorrow it's burgers and hot dogs. Wednesday it's pasta.\"<br>\r\nEvan chewed in silent thought for a moment. It sounded like this meal, or at least the size of it, was indeed normal for the Joneses now. He wasn't sure if he wanted to question it, not wanting to seem rude to his hosts, but at the same time, he had to know. \"I meant...I've never seen so much food in one meal before. I know my parents are a bit diet crazy, but...when did you guys\" -- He paused for a moment as Karen placed another entire pizza in front of him, even though he still had two slices left of his first -- \"When did you guys start eating like this?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see what you mean,\" Karen said warmly. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Waeton Foods was the parent company of practically every local fast food chain. They owned everything from the local pizzerias to the burger joints to the Chinese buffet he hadn't had the chance to eat at today. Just thinking of all the restaurants they owned made him hungrier. He nodded in response to her question, too engrossed with finishing his first pizza and starting on the second to waste precious mouth movements talking.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Karen continued between bites, \"They have an experimental promotion going on right now. Every time you order food from one of their restaurants, you can earn loyalty points. As you gain more loyalty points, you get discounts from their stores. The more loyalty points you get, the bigger the discount. The more food you get from their restaurants, the cheaper it gets.\"<br>\r\nFinally coming up for air from his own gorging, Graham chimed in. \"Don't forget the contest, Mom.\"<br>\r\nKaren finished her own pizza, then moved onto a new one. Evan wondered how many she'd had already. It looked like her shirt was stretched even tighter than when he'd come in. He could see a hint of skin between the buttons that wasn't there before. \"I couldn't possibly forget, dear. Evan, in addition to the discounts themselves, Waeton Foods is offering a special prize to the family that buys the most food from their restaurants. At the end of the month, that family is given a month of free food from each location.\"<br>\r\n\"We're going to win it,\" Erin said, winking. \"And then we'll win it again the next month. And the one after that. Free food for eating more than everyone else.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the idea, anyway,\" Karen said. \"This is only the first month of the promotion. We're spending a lot on their food right now, but the way our family eats I'm confident we'll win, and it'll be a sound investment in the long run.\" As if to punctuate her sentence, one of Natalie's buttons flew across the table, followed by a second. Nobody seemed to pay it any mind, least of all Natalie, who hadn't looked up from stuffing her tubby cheeks since Evan had sat down.<br>\r\n\"And now that you're hear to visit us, Evan, I'm even more confident we'll be able to win it. Please, have more. Eat as much as you can hold.\"<br>\r\nAs the meal went on...</span></div></div>",

He'd eat anything put in front of him.  Maybe Evan would be different.  \"I like to cook and I'm a sucker for compliments.

She learned it from her Mom and had practiced it with each of the men in her life.  Graham's Dad was a a skinny scarecrow when Karen hooked up with him in high school and left for college three years later a 250 pound porker.  Karen was pregnant with Graham but at nearly 200 pounds she didn't notice until Graham arrived.  As a single mom she took a job with a Realtor answering phones and  filing for Rob Green who'd been the star quarterback for the high school ten years back.  He was still movie star handsome, happily married to his high school sweetheart with two young kids.  Rob's wife never thought that Karen was any kind of threat to her marriage but innocently Karen began to bring Rob treats from her kitchen.  Over one year, Rob had become addicted to Karen's cooking, and started to get fat.  His marriage cooled as his weight increased and bigger Rob began to appreciate the delights of a bigger woman like Karen.  He gave her more responsibility and paid for her Real Estate Licence.  Then the shit hit the fan and Rob's wife finally couldn't take any more.  Her handsome successful husband had turned into a tub of lard.  She got the kids, the house and left Rob a fat, broke loser.  Rob disappeared leaving Karen pregnant again with Erin.<br>\r\nKaren moved across town and sold real estate in a new neighborhood making a good enough living  until she met Hogart at an open house.  Hogart was 60 and a retired body builder.  He had grown from the 225 pound champion to a 300 pounder when they met and Hogart loved Karen's soft curves.  He also had become a big chow hound since retiring and Karen's cooking added another 25 pounds after she moved into his big house.  They lived happily for nine years until 500 pound Hogart died of a massive heart attach leaving Karen his assets even though they had never bothered to get married.  Again she was without a man and pregnant but she didn't have to work anymore unless she chose.<br>\r\nSince that time, Karen had focused on her kids until now.  16 year old Evan had reawakened her emotions.  The poor kid was skin and bones.  His parents hadn't taken good care of him and Karen felt compelled to give him the Mother he needed and fatten him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for desert?\"  Karen called after knocking at the boy's bedroom.  \"That homework better be done by now.\"  Karen was hoping that the two boys would help each other out.  Graham needed to get disciplined about his homework and she hoped that Evan would set a good example.  She also hoped that Evan would watch and learn from Graham who was a champion chow hound. <br>\r\n\"Hi, Mrs Jones.  I'm still pretty full.  You are such a good cook that I really stuffed myself.\"  <br>\r\nKaren smiled at Evan.  He was a cute boy but too skinny.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Evan.  I don't get many complements around here.  Graham is too busy eating everything in sight.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom,\"  Graham whined. \"Give me a break. If it wasn't good, I wouldn't be eating it.\"<br>\r\nKaren put down two big wedges of apple pie.<br>\r\n\"Here's desert.  There's more in the kitchen if you want it.  Then I want you in bed by 10.  School tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nGraham shovels the pie down and watches Evan pick at his pie.<br>\r\n\"Don't you like my Mom's pie?\"  he asked. \"It's the best in town.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's great but I;m still stuffed. why don't you eat it for me.

Mrs. Jones never cared for the way my parents are always on my back about overeating. In fact, she told me the other day she thinks I should really gain some weight. I\u2019m not entirely sure what that\u2019s about, but she said any time I want to come over, she\u2019s not going to let me leave until I\u2019ve eaten all I can hold, and that sounds just fine to me. I\u2019m going to spend as much time over there as I can.\u201d<br>\r\nKatie shook her head, flabbergasted. \u201cGood God, Evan. I know the Joneses. They order about twenty pizzas from us a week.

That\u2019s five whole pizzas for each of them. Maybe even more for the kids, since Karen didn\u2019t seem to be quite as gluttonous. And that\u2019s just how much pizza they ate! Who knows how many burgers, hot dogs and other delicious junk foods they went through in a week? Katie was right; Evan would almost certainly blow up like a balloon eating like that, but the pure bliss of gorging on an endless buffet was well worth that particular cost.<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be happy, then. Come next week, you\u2019re going to be sending 30 pizzas to their house every week. \u201c<br>\r\nKatie blinked at him, bewildered. \u201cYou are one weird kid, you know that? If my boyfriend loved me half as much as you love food, we\u2019d be on our honeymoon by now.\u201d<br>\r\nEvan winked, taking the heavy armload of pizza boxes from her. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m loyal to my first love, and I always try to make as much room in my life for it.\u201d<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes, tucked the money into her pouch, and walked back to her car. \u201cGoodnight, Evan. Enjoy your weird binging session.\u201d<br>\r\nEvan carefully shut the door, sneaking as quietly as he could back to his room with about twelve pounds of pizza in his arms. Finally reaching the safety of his room, he pried open the first box with about as much eager anticipation as a pirate opening a treasure chest.<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a binging session,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cThis is the smallest meal I\u2019ll eat for a very long time.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
