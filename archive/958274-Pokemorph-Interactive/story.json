After his folks died he was left in the custody of his grandpa, but he didn't give a damn about Tyler's existence. After about a year of country living (he originally hated it) he gotten used to it. However, all his life he never had someone to call a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is June 7th, the first day of summer vacation and his sixteenth birthday. Tyler knew his kin didn't get him anything but he didn't care. So the least Tyler could do is try to find a job somewhere. Here his life turns upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyler walked down the wooded driveway of his grandpa's property, a hooded figure jumped out of woods and knocked him to the ground. The figure then grabbed Tyler's bag and ran off into the woods. Acting on instinct, Tyler got to his feet and pursued the thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chased the thief deep into the woods. Then somewhere in the heart of it, the bandit jumped into a tree big enough for two people to fit inside. Tyler followed. But then something happened, he was falling into a deep hole, not just that but it was just like Alice in Wonderland. Instead of a tall room like in the story, there were strange lights all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally he softly landed on some kind of plant. Around him he was in some kind of cave, but ahead of him was daylight. Tyler then approched the light thus leaving the cave. Upon exiting, he sarcastically said to himself, \"Looks like we're not in Kansas anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out into a clearing in an unfamillar wooded area. There are mountains in the backround as well, but there are no mountains in Jersey. And there is a clear water river in his sights. Thats strange because he lived nowhere near a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the river Tyler noticed that there are fresh footprints on the ground, possibly the thief. They appear to be heading downstream so Tyler followed them. Eventually he spots a village that suggests that he is in a different part of the world at a different era. How the buildings were built suggests he is in...</span></div></div>",

He then caught sight of something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Tyler saw right before his eyes looked like... a pokemon? It's an eevee, well almost, a human like eevee it is standing upright. It is dresseed in a kimono just like the people in old Japan, except that it has a small hole in the back to allow the tail to stick out. And it appears to be humming a song while playing with a ball. Appently a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler then approched the eevee kid. Just maybee, since it's humming, could it talk? Tyler had to reason with himself on one thought. Since he's in fuedal Japan, there could be a language barrier between him and the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ball the child was playing with landed next to Tyler's feet. The kid was laughing when it chased it's ball but came to a dead stop and gasped when it saw Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler tried to think of something to say to the kid.

The dragon breathed fire in the direction of Tyler, but Tyler hid behind a large bolder that was next to him. the fire struck the bolder and then bounced back toward the dragon. At that, Tyler took the second rock and threw it at the dragon with all his might. Again the dragon screamed out in pain, and ran away from the area. Tyler then came from behind the bolder and started walking down the way in search of the robber.  He heard a whimper from a house that was condemned and falling down.

The car made a rumble as the key was put into the ignition, turned to the start position, and the engine started. Gene looked over at Sam, who had been looking out the window in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I end up in this time? How am I an Eevee? Why is everyone a Pokemorph? What is going on anymore?' Is what had been running through his mind as he looked out the window to see the car finally start moving as Gene drove. What was also the top thing running on? How was going to return to his time, the last thing he remembers is being mowed down by some car and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at his hands again, so foreign to adorn such paws for hands. His thoughts were soon popped like a bubble as Gene tapped him on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this going to be an awkward car ride or are you actually going to talk to me?\" He says as he continued, driving after a red light turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um- Sorry I am just thinking about a lot of stuff right now.\" Sam replies, and Gene chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, classic newbie. Come on everything will be fine Sam, you don't have to worry about anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hope.\" Still worried obviously, what if he was stuck here! Stuck as an Eevee police officer! Well there was nothing wrong with that considering no one treated him as if he was different, though this was no normal everyday thing. It's either that or he's dreaming. Though he could feel his fur and it didn't seem like it could be faked and Gorton was still a place in Manchester so he never really left Manchester but streets he passed by seemed different. There were Pokemon Gyms where Pokemorphs could battle it out to either resolve anger, enter into championships or even just practice to raise experience and evolve. Street violence was probably not allowed but it seems those were the places to take a fight if you wanted one. Another weird thing he saw a was PokeCenter. Just a hospital but for PokeMorphs is what it seemed like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam had been observing the places he saw a car speed down the road going about 60 on a normal road.<br>\r\nGene blinked as he looked at Sam and asked, \"Shall we?\"</span></div></div>",

This won't be such an awkward car ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car chase then started. The other car, as a response of noticing the police car approaching, picked up even more speed. The road was empty, fortunately, so there wasn't much risk of accident. Better yet was that the engine of the chased car actually overheated and broke, forcing the car to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky?\" Sam asks as Gene stops right behind the broken car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Much easier than I thought.\" The larger policeman says and leave the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam soon follows and tries to grab his gun, just to find out he was not carrying a gun at all.

This was always his favorite part of the job considering he gets to chase and catch someone trying to resist arrest. Though reality and differences crashed down on him as he was struck and splattered with some kind of.. icky purple sludge? Ew! What the hell was this and gah! He now knew what he could call pain! Ergh! He gets up after tumbling down from the sudden attack.How would he retaliate like they did? Hm... Oh if he can't think of any moves he could always do something.... regretful. Well it was a ghost maybe not. He sped up and was soon right behind him before pouncing onto him and biting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Haunter started to yell with pain from the Super Effective move and stopped struggling. Sam reached for the cuffs he had on his side and handcuffed the Haunter. He the stood back up and revolted at that bite, weirdest thing he's ever done for sure. He then took the Haunter by forcefully pulling him up by the arm and taking him to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you're better than I thought Sam. It's like you've done this kind of work before hahaha!\" Gene says with a heart laugh and smile as Sam pushed the Haunter into the back seat of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was about to retort with yes he had but maybe he shouldn't. \"Ah nothing to it, just beginner's luck for me. Haha.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, sure enough. Let's take him down the precinct come back and do our normal stroll around town. Sounds good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, sounds good to me.\" They get into the car and drive down to the precinct again before dropping off the Haunter there and more miscellaneous stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they get on with their job back at Gorton and now Sam had some free time to walk around and see all the new places and observe stuff while still on patrol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall Sam do?</span></div></div>",

In the middle of that heart pounding moment, he actually came to bite the drugged man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place... Not only did it affect his body, but his mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" He asks himself while looking up at the buildings nearby. All of the where so... antique. Leaving a true feeling of the 70'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt really out of place in there and it distracted him from looking forward and notice a woman waiting for a taxi right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you see where you are walking to?\" An angry voice could be heard right after Sam bumped onto her side. He looks up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was some kind of blue... Whatever the people here are, with some kind of bunny ears on her head and had scales instead of  skin... or fur, or feather, or gas based on his previous experiences in the last couple of hours. She was rather voluptuous, that is for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon, Miss. I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So you are a cop!\" She interrupts him. \"Quite a little too small and young to be one. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Have we come to this point of despair for the police to recruit anyone?</font>\" She murmured the last part to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Excuse me?\" Sam asks. Sure, he has notice that he lost some inches, yet the rest of what happened was what really caught most of his attention and worries. But... young? Sam actually is on his early 40, with over 18 years of serving the police... Or was he? Now Sam know how it feels to discover his body for the second time. <i>'I think Gene said I was the new guy. How old am I?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Even worst is that you are an Eevee.

Just be happy that you haven't accidentally got poisoned bumping on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poisoned?\" Sam asks as the woman went inside the car. He watches the car until it turned to the right and got off his view. \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two things were sure to Sam now.

Nothing but peace.............. and as long as nothing gets in your way, you can feel just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the darkness of the alley seems to sink into your soul. But you let it do so.

Your eyes fly open in suprise, and you stumble backwards and fall on your butt.<br>\r\nUgh, light! Just the thought of light makes you want to spit in disguist. Not only had this 'light' disturbed your perfect darkness, but it had also caused you land on your tail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute.........tail!?<br>\r\nQucikly you look down at yourself, and gasp in horrow when you see you've transformed into.................</span></div></div>",

That would just be stupid! And besides, maybe the person to the left will help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to make your way down the hallway, the floor makes a giant creak. Your eyes fly wide open and you step back in fear- did the person in the other room hear you? You focus on the other room, and see a shadow moving against the wall in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" you think to yourself. The other person must've heard you! Quickly you turn around to run, only to realize something else- you have nowhere else to run.<br>\r\nAll you can do is stand there and wait for the person for discover you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several tense moments, you look at the room and realize that the person left, but not into the hallway.<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, and continue on to the room. Luckily, there are no more squeaky boards along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the room, you intake as much info as you can about it.<br>\r\nIt's old and falling apart, but somewhat creepy, just like the hallway. There is a single TV in the middle just like you suspected, and it has black and white fuzz on the the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you call nervously. No answer.<br>\r\nYou figure the person in here must've left the room until you realize a disturbing fact that sends chills down your spine- the only exit ou of the room is the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to inspect the room a little more- it's not like you can leave whenever you want to.<br>\r\nYou see a plush looking chair in the positioned to face the TV, and it looks brand new and out of place with the rest of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the chair is polished wooden table, which also looks out of place. On top of the table is a purple bottle with a note attatched to it.<br>\r\nSo naturally, you pick up and read the note. The note says \"Inside this purple bottle is a remote to the tv.

He looked up as the read the most recent addition to his list to see the hand of a young buizel sticking up in the air. He adjusted his glasses and continued down the paper while the orange-furred appendage disappeared behind the rest of the students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt lowered his hand and returned to playing with his necklace, a mystic water that his dad had given him before he had died. Matt's father had been a member of the Coast Guard, but a terrible boat accident cost him his life. Within a year, his mother moved them to the other side of the country to escape the memories of their old home. She took up a job that paid well but took up most of her time. Now Matt was lost and alone, forced to try and start again by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of class was as uneventful as the role call. It was the first day, so all the teachers would be going over rules and telling the students what they needed for the class. When the bell rang, Matt gathered his stuff and shuffled off to his next class. He had Battle Training in the gym and went to change clothes in the locker room. As he traded his jeans and t-shirt for mesh shorts and a tank, he removed his necklace and debated what to do with it. He didn't want it to get damaged during a battle, but he didn't want to leave it out in the open with his clothes (he didn't have a locker assigned yet). He decided to ask the coach, but suddenly a hand grabbed the precious stone from his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice rock!\" sneered a gengar. \"Bet you could get a lot of money for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt wanted to beat the crap out of the ghost, but he was flanked by a machoke and a golem and Matt knew he couldn't take them all. Instead, he calmed down and tried to reason with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please give it back, my dad gave that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three just laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, daddy gave him a pwesent!\" the gengar mocked him. \"Look, kid, I'll forgive you for being new here and not knowing the rules. We run this school, so we take what we want. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, Eugene?\" came a voice behind the gang. \"If I recall correctly, I run this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a meowth, leaning against the wall in a leather jacket and jeans flipping a coin in the air. He caught the coin and shoved it in his pocket before pointing to the blushing gengar, obviously Eugene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wannabes think you're tough by picking on the new kid? Well why don't you take on a bigger challenge? I told you before that if I caught you trying to act tough again, I'd put you in your place. Care to fight me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three immediately clammed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi, Ace...wh-why would you think we're picking on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him the necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure thing, Ace. See? No problem here! C'mon guys,\" Eugene said and the trio left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt held the necklace close and put it back around his neck. He then turned to face his savior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot. This necklace is all I have left of my dad. Who were those jerks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Ace told him. \"They call themselves the 'Rough and Tough' gang, but they're just a bunch of posers. I can bench more than that machoke and the golem has a soft-shell condition. The only one who's actually strong is the gengar. He calls himself 'Shade', but he clams up the second you say his real name. Don't worry about them too much, you probably could have taken them on your own. By the way, my name's Aiden King, but everyone calls me Ace. My dad's the superintendent, which is why they won't fight me; not that I couldnt take them all at once. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat introduced himself while Ace took off his jacket to reveal a white muscle shirt and changed out of his jeans into breather shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Matt. Now let's get out there before the coach comes to get us.\"</span></div></div>",

He wants to ask you if you have a place to keep his necklace safe. It's very important to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then, I guess I can excuse the two of you. I suppose you're Matthew Schatz? Go ahead and set your necklace on my desk in the office and I'll lock the door. Just don't forget it after class.\" Matt quickly thanked the Coach and carefully put it on the desk. Once the door was locked, he followed Coach to the center of the gym. \"Alright, kids, I assume that by now you all know what to do in a battle. This year we'll be working on strategy and etiquette. First, I want to see what Mr. Schatz brings to the table. Go ahead and take the blue side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stepped to his side of the marked field. Ace gave him a thumbs up and Matt nodded back. He looked around at the rest of the class: it appeared to be purposely varied so that no one student could have the upper-hand against the whole class. He saw all the types represented and pokemon of every shape and size. He wondered who his opponent would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now to find you someone to battle. How about you, Mr. Geist? I guess you already know everything I have to say, considering you're talking over me? Take the red side. I want to work on your etiquette this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Matt's disgust, Geist happened to be Shade's last name. The gengar stepped forward with an arrogant grin on his face. But before Matt could dwell on his hatred of the ghost any further, Coach blew his whistle and the battle began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll play by free rules,\" Coach said, \"So do your best. But DO NOT knock your opponent out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took advantage of the momentary lull to charge up a water gun while coach was talking. The whistle blew again and Shade did exactly what Matt wanted him to do: he came in for a close attack. As soon as Shade was close enough, Matt unleashed his water gun, throwing the ghost back to his own side. He followed up with an aqua jet, surrounding himself with water and shooting towards his foe. He was too quick for Shade who was knocked of his feet. Matt jumped back to his own side and confidently motioned for Shade to come to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough to infuriate the gengar. He disappeared with a faint attack to appear behind Matt. He punched the sea weasel before he could react, but instead of falling, he turned the force into a somersault and landed facing Shade. Matt then used agility to speed back to Shade. The ghost tried to use a lick attack, but the water pokemon grabbed his tongue and flipped him over, outside of the battlefield. The coach's whistle blew and the match was over. Matt was the winner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outstanding work, Mr. Schatz!\" the Coach roared. \"That was some of the slickest battling I've ever seen! A+!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Matt was carried back to the locker room by the admiring class, Shade got up and brushed himself off. Eric (the machoke) and Rocko (the golem) walked up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta take that kid out,\" Shade told his goons. \"And I know just how to do it.\"</span></div></div>",

But here on the slopes of Mt. Chimney, the volcanic springs combined with the volcanic ash in the air just makes you feel so at home. It's no wonder it's a fire pokemorph hotspot. Fortunately, being a close friend of the Lavaridge gym leader, you have no problem getting one of the 'reserved' hot springs all to yourself. You don't even have to bother with a swimsuit or anything, which is good, because you swear that you can't truly relax unless you're completely natural. It might actually be that a recent growth spurt has made you outgrow most of your tops, but you're not going to admit that to anyone. It's a little embarrassing. Here you are, only 19, and you've got a chest like some kind of porn star. Your mother nearly flipped out when she saw the \"DD\" tags on your bras with your latest load of laundry. You've never been one for attention either, either from lecherous guys or jealous girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a sigh, and partially submerge your head in the water, childishly blowing some bubbles. You came here to relax, and here you are getting all wound up again. This is why Flannery probably wanted you to relax. Relax, relax, how can you relax? School's over. She's already all set up in her granddad's gym. What are you supposed to do? Lavaridge is a nice town, but there's a reason it's almost all retirees. The only thing it's got going for it is the springs, so you can either work as a tour guide or such, or in one of the many retirement homes that hog the springs for their elderly residents. Not exactly an exciting future....maybe you'll do what your older brother did. Go backpacking, go see Hoenn. Your parents aren't for it, as their drifter child never calls or even writes, but what else are you gonna do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeal with whoever that is coming up the trail, you decide. Probably another guy thinking he'll be clever and sneak a peek at you. They do it to Flannery all the time, you know. It never works, either. Neither of you are dumb enough to submerge your ears, and you particularly can hear anything within a mile thanks to your wide canine ears. You get out of the pool preemptively. It's sleeked down your orange-red fur, even your chest ruffle. Another girl might enjoy the curvaceous body you've been blessed with, but you've always been a bit of a tomboy, a bit of a scrapper - or at least you were back before guys either refused to wrestle with you or were all too eager. That's why you keep your hair (head-fur) trimmed short, with boyish bangs. You wrap a towel around you, though it clings to you so much it's hardly modest. You go to confront whoever's coming to bother you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were mildly surprised to see Flannery running towards the hot springs at full tilt, and her face lit up when she saw you, as if she were searching for you. \"There you are! I was hoping you'd be here! You'll never guess what I found!\" Flannery said as she slowed to a walk before stopping completely in front of you. Your thoughts went back to the first time you had met the young Arcanine morph. Even though most people would assume this at first glance, she was still damn strong, and probably the only other one besides your family that knew you best. If she was excited about something, there was usually a good reason for that. \"Well, don't keep me in suspense Flannery, what is it?\" You asked her patiently, knowing how she could get. \"When I was out walking near the volcano, I came across a human! A regular human! Do you know how rare they are now?\" Flannery said, and you could see why she would get excited. Humans either willingly went under a process that changed them into some sort of process that turned them into a pokemorph of some kind, or, rarely, they would opt to stay human. These humans were usually either very influential, or very powerful when it came to politics. But why would a human be near Lavaridge? \"Where's the human now Flannery?\" You asked her, curiosity abundant in your tone. \"At my house, come on, hurry up and get dressed!\" Flannery said, and she didn't need to urge you. A few moments later, and you were wearing a shirt and some jeans, following Flannery back to her house. When you and her entered her house, she directed you back towards her room, where the human was supposed to be resting at. And there it was. Pardon, there HE was. He looked kinda young though, at best maybe fifteen. There was something unique about him though, his hair was white, and at the moment it was covering one of his eyes, even though they were closed at the moment. \"See, what did I tell you? A real human.\" Flannery said with a grin on her face. \"Yeah, but who is he? He doesn't look anything like any of the other humans that we see on TV.\" You said, raising an eyebrow. He was actually...kinda cute. For a human. Not that you cared really, it was just an observation. A sudden movement drew both your own and Flannery's gaze towards the human, interrupting your conversation as he let out a little groan, before his hand reached up and grabbed his head. \"Awake are you?\" Flannery said, and the human let out a neutral sound. \"Where am I?\" He asked, his voice sounding more mature than a fifteen year old should be. \"You're at my house in Lavaridge. Where are you from?\" Flannery said as she knelt down next to him, you having decided to stay at the foot of the bed, away from the human for the moment. \"Lave...ridge?...Where was I from...?...I don't know...I...can't remember...\" The human said, his eye squinting as he tried to think, but nothing was coming to mind apparently. \"Amnesia? That's not good...let me see your head.\" Flannery said, and before the human cold so much as open his eyes, she had already moved him so that way she could check his head. \"Let me know if it hurts.\" Flannery said as she started to push lightly on his head. Finally, when she reached the back of his head, he cringed. \"There?\" Flannery asked him. \"Yeah...kinda like a dull ache.\" He said, and he still hadn't of opened his eyes. \"You must have hit your hit pretty hard. Maybe you fell from somewhere, I did find you near the volcano after all.\" Flannery said, and the human made another neutral noise. Flannery let him go, but didn't move from where she was at. The human opened his eyes then, and looked around. His first sight was you, and to your surprise, his gaze WASN'T drawn to your chest, but rather your eyes. Your own amber eyes met his steel gray eyes for a few moments before he looked around a bit more. When he saw Flannery as close as she was, he gave out a little cry of surprise before he shot backwards, unfortunately falling off of the bed and onto the ground, landing with a thud and a delayed ow, before he picked himself up, looking at Flannery as she tried not to laugh at what happened. She was slowly failing though. Before she could outright bust out laughing however, you decided now would be a good time to speak up. \"Can you at least remember your name?\" You asked him, hands on your hips as you shifted your weight onto one leg. \"...I think...it's Zero...yeah, that sounds about right.\" The human, who was apparently named Zero, said before he looked at you and Flannery. \"Oh, right, I'm Flannery. I'm the Gym leader here.\" Flannery said, puffing out her chest as she said so, giving her a proud look. Zero turned his head to look at you then. \"I'm Akane.\" You said, introducing yourself to him. \"Nice to meet you two.\" Zero said as he pulled himself up all the way. He was on the short side, if you and Flannery were to stand next to him, you were certain he'd only be able to reach chest level with you and her. \"I don't want to intrude though, so maybe I should leave...\" Zero said as he rubbed his head, and was about to do so until Flannery stood in front of him. \"Uh-uh. You're not well enough to even make it to the road, let alone to another town. Until you're better, you're staying here.\" Flannery said with a hint of finality in her voice. Zero tried to argue, but you put a hand on his shoulder. \"Trust me when I say this, you won't win this argument.\" You said, having known Flannery for quite a while now, you knew from experience. You had yet to win an argument with her, and the only way you could solve things was by out smarting her. Sometimes that didn't even work. \"Flare, mind helping me take care of amnesia boy here? I have to run the gym and everything, so I won't be able to keep an eye on him to make sure he stays out of trouble.\" Flannery asked you, surprising you by the sudden request. \"I would have to see with my parents first if I can come over for a while first, but I'm sure they won't have a problem.\" You said as you waved it off. \"Don't I get a say in this?\" Zero asked rhetorically. \"No.\" Both you and Flannery said at the same time, deciding to answer his question even though you both knew it was rhetorical. Zero started to frown then, and sighed. \"Cheer up, if you behave, I'll let you use my private hot springs. Of course, you would have to make sure that we know you're there. Don't want to just show up and strip in front of you.\" Flannery said with a grin on her face as Zero's face lit red at her words. You just rolled your eyes, but inwardly you were glad that this amnesiac had appeared. Now maybe your life won't be so dull, who knows, if he does remember where he's from, you could help him get back. A perfectly reasonable excuse to go journey through Hoenn. You were also secretly glad that he wasn't a lech like all the other teenage boys. Not once did he just stare at your rack, or Flannery's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, and you were busy setting a few things up in the guest room that you were going to be using while you kept an eye on Zero. He seemed like a good kid, having offered to help you with a few things. Perhaps he just wanted to do something other than just sit around. You briefly wondered if Flannery would object if you used her TV and game system to pass the time. She had left for the Gym to get everything situated for her career as the Gym leader.</span></div></div>",

His pudgy brown-furred paw scratched at his white, soft, flabby belly.  Smiling, making his cheeks puff even more and his double chin almost become a triple, he threw his tree-trunk like legs over the edge of the bed and sat up, delighting in the feeling of heaviness \u2013 his belly took up most of his lap and his bloated pecs rested on top of that.  With a grunt, he pushed himself up off of the bed, standing up on his thickened brown furred feet and setting his belly jiggling.  Tugging at the waistband of his boxers, he waddled over in front of his full-length mirror and admired his profile.  There was no doubting it, he was fat, and loved it.  Ray pinched a fat roll on his side, loving how the pair of stripes on his back matched up so well with the curves of flab.  His black rope-like tail looked comical placed above his large rump, like a pair of basketballs.  Ray was easily one of the largest Raichu morphs around, standing at 6 feet and 420 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRay hadn\u2019t been like that for most of his life, though.  One day during freshman year, he was pushed around a lot by members of the football team.  Wanting to get back at them, he searched for quick ways to bulk up.  However, instead of muscle, he found sites dedicated to gaining weight.  Intrigued, Ray decided to give it a shot.  He looked up some of the tips and recipes and dedicated himself to his task.  It was slow going at first.  Ray wasn\u2019t used to eating so much, and his metabolism didn\u2019t really lend itself to making fat.  He kept at it, though, and delighted in the first weeks that the pounds stayed on.  It was all a piece of cake, or two or three, from there.  Not wanting to become immobile, Ray still worked out, riding an exercise bike and lifting weights enough to keep him in shape to move his big self around.  Most doctors were surprised that a kid his size was as healthy as he was.  His size didn\u2019t go to his head, however.  Ray stayed just as friendly and jovial as he ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMoving on, today was a week into summer vacation, Ray\u2019s last summer vacation before moving out to college.  Considering this fact, Ray wanted to do something special and had made some arrangements.  Now was the time: his parents were out for a week on business, and he had the home all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell\u2026 almost all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRay waddled over to his door, opening it as his Pikachu-morph sister, Julie walked by.

She was a mousy little girl, and never really \u201cblossomed\u201d into womanhood, so to speak.  There had been a few times where she had been mistaken for a boy even, and it had burned her up.  She dived at him, knocking him over as she hugged herself against his soft tummy.  Julie tickled at Ray\u2019s love handles and back rolls.  She nuzzled his chest, loving his smell.  It always reminded her of honey-baked ham for some reason.  Yeah, she was weird like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRay chuckled, sending his belly and sister jiggling.  \u201cHeya sis!

Ray did a double take at the sight before him: a breakfast buffet nearly filling the entire table. Pancakes, syrup, sausages, hash browns, waffles, more syrup, french toast, even more syrup, and a great many other foods were just waiting for the Raichu morph to dig in. It was as much a feast for the eyes as it would be a feast for his gut. The only question was, how much would he be able to eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of someone clearing their throat snapped Ray out of his stupor.

They were all taller than her, but not by much. Even the tallest one, the Meditite, was just half a head taller than the Pikachu morph. Their curves weren't very pronounced, either, though they were easier to notice than Julie's. The Eevee morph rocked back and forth on her feet, her hands clasped behind her back. The Meditite morph had a more relaxed posture, with one hand on her hip. The Meowstic morph just stood still, a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ray, this is Stacie...\" Julie motioned to the Eevee. \"... she's Tanya...\" She gestured toward the Meditite. \"... and I think you've met Sylvia before,\" she finished, pointing at the Meowstic. All three of them waved, and Ray waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh...\" The large Raichu scratched his double chin. \"Didn't she come over to study with you that one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mm-hmm.\" Julie nodded. With a grin, she said, \"Anyway, we should really probably get to stuffing you before the food gets cold! Ladies, let's give our big man a hand!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pikachu snapped her fingers, and the four of them grabbed Ray and led him over to a chair. Julie and Tanya pulled him by the arms, while Stacie and Sylvia pushed him by his butt. Ray blushed at the contact from the latter two, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry,\" said Stacie, pushing Ray by his right butt cheek, \"we made sure everything's extra yummy for you, big guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tanya, who had taken his left arm, added, \"And by 'we', she means 'our parents'. Nice boxers, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu's face turned an even brighter shade of red. <i>I wasn't aware I had such an enthusiastic fan club. Heck, it's crazy I even have one at all! Wait, do they actually count as one? I know Julie said they knew about me and even wanted to help out, but--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hellooooo! Earth to big bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray snapped out of his thoughts. He was already sitting down at the table, and placed in front of him was a plate completely covered in hash browns. The plump pokemorph reached for a fork, but his hand met with nothing but the tablecloth. Before he could ask the others where one was, one of the girls--Sylvia, judging from the hand's white fur--quickly picked up a bite and shoved it in the Raichu's partially open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To be totally honest with you,\" Julie started, coming up behind the Meowstic, \"I wanted first dibs, but Sylvia's got a crush on you, so... y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmph?\" He swallowed. \"Crush?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvia gave her what Ray assumed to be a pointed stare (he could never tell with stoics). \"I would have preferred to disclose that information myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Julie shrugged. \"Sorry, but you probably woulda beat around the bush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Besides,\" Stacie chimed in, \"doesn't it feel better to have it out in the open? I'd totally feel better about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I bet Ray likes having a fangirl, anyway.\" Tanya snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sighing, Sylvia returned her attention to Ray. \"Don't worry, they're merely exaggerating. I would hardly consider myself 'in love' with someone I don't know on any personal level. My attraction to you is purely physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu morph nodded. \"I see.\" He went silent for a few seconds. \"So you're, uh... into bigger guys, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvia blinked a few times in rapid succession. Hurriedly, she asked, \"Would care for more hash browns? You seem a bit famished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Ray could respond, The Meowstic shoved another forkful of hash browns into his mouth. He hesitated for a moment, then slowly chewed his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Might as well roll with it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu morph grinned widely, turning his double chin into a triple. \"Alright, bring on the food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oooohh, yeah.\" Ray rubbed his engorged belly. \"That sure hit the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Glad you liked it, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray couldn't remember the last time he had ever been so stuffed. It had been quite awhile since he was full to the point where he wouldn't need to tide himself over with a snack or five before lunch. It showed, too, as his belly had become a tad more spherical, and had gone from filling most of his lap to practically all of it. The feeling was slightly uncomfortable, but it still brought a smile to his face. He remembered back when he first started upping his food intake. Back then, it only took an extra burger to reach this state. Nowadays...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He surveyed the results of his breakfast. Most of the plates were cleaned off, and those that weren't were having their leftovers devoured by Julie and her friends. The sight made Ray smile. As impressed as he was by his own gluttony, he felt relieved that he left behind enough for the girls to have some breakfast as well. In fact, they seemed nearly starved, given the way they all dug in to their food. Feeding Ray personally must have made them insanely hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of the kitchen phone ringing drew him from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, sis, I'll get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Julie stopped in the middle of spearing a whole sausage and looked up at her brother. \"Are you sure, bro? I mean, you just ate, so-- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, it's fine. You just worry about enjoying your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Kay, Ray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a grunt, Ray forced himself up and out of his seat. Cradling his belly, he slowly waddled his way over to the kitchen and the incessantly ringing phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah, hold your horses,\" he grumbled. The Raichu morph turned a bit to his side and picked the phone up. \"Hello?\"</span></div></div>",

How'd they manage to convince their folks to make that much food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Ray scratched the back of his head. \"Not to brag, but I'm pretty big around my neighborhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pun intended?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course.

Julie said she and her friends were planning on spending the day out and about.\" The Raichu morph couldn't help but lick his lips. Whether it was a meal or just the two of them alone, their time together would always be fun of some form or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perfect! I'll stop by around eleven.\" There was a brief pause. \"Say, what are you wearing right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, just a pair of boxers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My my, and with company over too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray's blush returned. \"Yeah, heh heh...

He spent a few minutes patting and stroking his belly, lightly moaning at its tautness. No matter how fat he got, stuffing himself silly was always the best feeling in the world, and the fact that it took more and more effort as he got bigger only made it all the better when he succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, the hefty 'morph waddled back into the dining room and sat back down.

Ray waved back, though he was more focused on digesting his meal. He lost all track of time as his stomach gradually softened up, pleasurable sighs and murmurs escaping from his lips all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before he knew it, the doorbell ring and snapped him back to reality. He got up from his seat only to immediately realize he never bothered getting dressed. Blushing furiously, the Raichu morph rushed up to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be right with you!\" he shouted. \"Just give me a minute to put on some clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An unmistakable chuckle came from the other side. \"Oh, you don't need to worry about that.

The Raichu morph's eyes were immediately drawn to the dragon's magnificently huge gut, which was only half covered by a white tank top. It jiggled and bounced freely, unafraid to come up and slap the world in its face. Each bounce gave allowed a quick little peak at the meaty thighs beneath. To compare them to regular old tree trunks would have been far too mild. To compare his thighs to the largest, most splendid tree trunks was far more fitting. And no other parts of the dragon's body were spared, either. His cheeks were round, his double chin was working its way to triple chin status, his neck had any and all of its definition buried in a coating of fat, and his arms and shoulders were as soft and squishy as dough. Truly, this was a body built for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A low, throaty chuckle from the 25-year-old dragon made Ray snap his focus up to his visitor's face. Knowing grins were exchanged before the Salamence morph turned around and closed the door behind him. This gave Ray an excellent view of a plump posterior and a thick tail guaranteed to fill up at least half of the average three-seat couch. The black spandex shorts left nothing to the imagination, clinging to whatever they could as if their life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Likin' what you see, Sweet Cheeks?\" The Salamence morph chuckled again. \"Don't leave much to the imagination, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray let out a chuckle of his own. \"Always the tease, aren't you Big Sully?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, you're used to it.\" Grin widening, Sullivan \"Big Sully\" the Salamence opened his arms wide. \"Now c'mere and greet me properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing no need to be told twice, Ray waddled over, hugged Sullivan tightly, and locked lips. Sully moaned in approval and kissed back with no small amount of fervor. Ray's heart fluttered. The dragon's lips were firm as always, unyielding and constantly pushing the Raichu morph to keep up. A sudden squeeze of both butt cheeks caused him to let out a surprised squeak. His cheeks burned brighter than before. The temptation to melt into Sully's embrace and let him handle everything was quite staggering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then again, what fun would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sullivan purred as Ray began to run his hands up and down the dragon's back, pausing to grab at a love handle here and there. The two pressed together even more tightly and pushed at each other's lips till they finally became short of breath and had to separate. They panted in unison, their hot breath mixing, and stared deeply into each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Much better,\" Sully said with a slight growl. \"Think you can keep this up all week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray grinned. \"Just watch me. C'mon, let's go get comfortable.\" He began to head for the living room, but stopped when he realized Sullivan wasn't following. The Raichu morph was about to ask if he was coming, but couldn't quite get the words out upon seeing him taking off his tank top. It, along with the spandex, were casually tossed aside, leaving the hefty dragon clad in nothing but a pair of boxers that failed to reach past his buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Figured it'd be more comfy if we're both stripped down.\" Sully's grin was so sly it could be mistaken as predatory. \"Wanna ditch the undies, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray could have sworn his cheeks were on the verge of bursting into flames. \"Dah- bah- I-I-I think we'll just- we'll just save that for showering, if-if you don't mind!\" It was only a second after the words left his mouth that he realized the implications of what he said. He squeaked and clamped a hand over his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hardy laugh from Sully made his body quake and jiggle. \"Showering, eh? Dunno if the two of us'll fit, but okay! Just scrub me extra good and I'll do the same!\" He laughed again. \"I swear, Sweet Cheeks, you've got a real feisty side to ya. Can't get enough of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah,\" Ray muttered. Despite the embarrassment, he couldn't help but smile when he looked back up into Sully's eyes. Oh, how the Raichu morph loved that stare. So lively and mischievous one second, and then so calm and enticing the next. \"Anyway, shall we go get settled on the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sully scratched his gut. \"Sure. Hope you don't mind a tight fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With you, a tight fit is a blessing.\"</span></div></div>",

In his hand was a bottle of appetite stimulants. They most likely weren't as potent as a prescription brand would be, but it would be a helpful starting tool all the same. Potency wasn't really what concerned him at the moment. To the lanky Raichu morph, buying the pills would be committing himself to bulking up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either he'd go all out and gain as much weight as his body could carry, or he'd give up and let his metabolism eat up any fat he might have had otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Being honest with himself, Ray didn't really have a long-term plan beyond gaining to whatever point he felt most comfortable with. But how big would that be? After adding 100 pounds? 200? And if he changed his mind, would he ever be able to lose the weight? Granted, he was planning on working out so he could carry that weight, but\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You alright there, buddy?\" Ray nearly jumped out of his fur. \"Whoa, sorry! Didn't mean to scare ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now preoccupied with something other than his lifestyle choices, Ray turned around to face a Salamence morph grinning at him. He was taller than Ray, as most Salamences would be, and had an overall pudgy look that was just shy of being chubby. The dragon's gut still had a ways to go before it could poke out of his shirt and over his waistline. Small layers of padding were apparent on his arms, legs, and even his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So,\" he said, \"you got a name? Mine's Sullivan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ray.\" The Raichu morph couldn't help but smile. It wasn't every day you met a friendly stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sullivan nodded. \"Cool, cool. So, Ray, why're you shopping for appetite stimulants? Feeling too skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray blushed and looked away. \"You could say that...\" He shut his eyes, bracing himself for any mockery to come his way. It wouldn't make sense for it come from someone who's already overweight, but there was always the chance of a complete lack of self-awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luckily, Sullivan was nothing of the sort. In fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You too, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" Ray opened his eyes and turned back to Sullivan so fast it almost hurt his neck. \"What do you me-- Wait, you're gaining weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup!\" Sullivan smacked his gut for emphasis. \"Broke 200 just a couple weeks ago! How big're you thinking of going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...\" Ray looked down at the bottle in his hand. \"I don't really know. Whatever size I like, I guess. But that's not what I'm worried about. What I <i>am</i> worried about is actually going through with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Worried about what your friends and family'd think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I already told them all about it. They're cool with it, as long as I don't go overboard. And Mom and Dad told me to exercise. It's more stuff like buying plus-size clothes and taking up extra space and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He sighed. \"I know I'm over-thinking it and dwelling on dumb junk, but you gotta understand I've never done anything like this. And the only reason I got this whole idea was some weight gain sites I found when I was looking for tips on getting muscle. Weird, right? But I guess that's what happens you look up 'tips for bulking up' instead of 'tips for gaining muscle'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment, Sullivan said nothing. He just stared at Ray, looking pensive. Then he smiled, and walked over to pat the Raichu morph's shoulder. \"I get ya,\" the dragon said. \"Ya wanna try out this crazy lifestyle you never even thought of takin' up, and you're worried if it's worth the effort or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, that too.\" Sullivan patted Ray's shoulder again. \"Well buddy, I'll be frank with ya: it's gonna take some doing before you actually get anywhere. Hell, I started two months ago and this is all I've got so far. But y'know what? I don't care it's been slow goin', 'cause stuffin' myself silly is the best feeling ever! You'd probably love it too. You like eating, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I guess I do...\" Ray hummed in thought. After a moment, he asked, \"You said your name was Sullivan, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup!\" The grin the dragon gave him was enough to make him grin as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well Sullivan, I know this is a bit sudden, since we just met and all, but would be willing to... I don't know, coach me on this or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sullivan scratched his chin. \"Dunno about that. I've been pretty busy workin' to get my bachelor's the last couple years. But look, I can't tell you if it's worth it for ya or not. All you can really do is take a shot and see what happens. But y'know, I got a feeling you're gonna enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray didn't respond at first. It wasn't exactly the help he was looking for, and the encouragement felt a bit on the mild side. Still, Sullivan was a gainer, and he seemed happy. Infectiously happy, even. It was one thing to read about guys fattening up on purpose online, but to meet such a guy in real life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Ray said, \"I'll give it a shot. Thanks for stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sullivan chuckled. It was a low rumble, but it held the same jovial note. \"No problem, buddy. You seem like a pretty cool guy. Hey, wanna exchange numbers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0True to Sullivan's word, the couch proved to be a tight fit for the two. They weren't cramped, per se, but they didn't have much in the way of elbow room. Not that it mattered to either of them; it just made cuddling that much easier. Sully's tail was wrapped around Ray, and would occasionally tickle his belly with its tip. Ray didn't really mind. He was content to just lean on his big, fat dragon and trail a finger over his rolls of fat. With a happy hum, the Raichu morph opened his eyes and smiled at his boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whatcha thinkin' about?\" Sully asked, smiling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just remembering the day we met.\" Ray sighed. \"It feels like so long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Tell me about it. Hard to believe how small we used to be, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray snorted. \"Small by our current standards, maybe. But yeah, it's weird looking at old photos.\" He turned himself over and lay his head on Sully's gut. \"Anyway, what do you wanna do later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Salamence morph grinned. \"Actually...\" </span></div></div>",

It's not our anniversary, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, I just thought we'd kick this week off with a little something special. Plus, I felt like thanking you for bein' such a good boyfriend. I'd give it to ya now, but I left it in my pocket and it's kinda hard for me to go get it when you're usin' me as your pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray flashed the Salamence morph a cheeky grin. \"Not my fault you're so soft and comfy. Alright, let me just...\" With a grunt, he pulled himself up off the dragon's gut and shifted around to an upright position. \"There. Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sully got up, stretching and shaking his butt in Ray's face. \"Thanks, now just hold tight for a second. If you think you like me now, you're gonna <i>love</i> me when you see what I've got.\" And with that, he waddled out of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray shook his head. Did that flirt really think bribes were needed to win his affections? There was already so much of him to love, both literally and figuratively. Still, presents were nice, and if Big Sully's was as great as he made it out to be, this week was going to be the best one ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of heavy footfalls alerted Ray to his boyfriend's return. He turned to see Big Sully still in his boxers, but found his attention stolen by the vial full of an orange liquid in the portly dragon's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's that for?\" he asked, a bit of trepidation slipping into his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sully just kept grinning. \"This, my not-so-little dough ball, is your gift. And also...\" He came in closer, his lips less than an inch away from Ray's ear, and whispered, \"This is how you're gonna catch up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray gulped. His mouth opened and closed a few times. His heart started beating faster. After a moment, he found his voice. \"'Catch up'? Y-You mean that stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh. You drink this stuff, and you'll be huge.\" Sully's free hand ran down Ray's torso and gripped his belly. \"This'll be fillin' your whole lap up, maybe even more. Can ya picture it, Sweet Cheeks? Your belly spillin' over your legs? Just think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A furious blush ignited on Ray's cheeks. \"H-How? Where did you even get anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I've got a connection or two. One of 'em's a Chem major with a thing for brewing up some <i>interesting</i> concoctions, just like this one here.\" He shook the vial. \"She says this stuff'll give you a real leg up. Supposed to make you taller, too, and even give ya some muscle underneath to help lug yourself around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu morph's throat suddenly felt very dry. His hands joined Sully's on his belly. \"For real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sully grinned even wider. \"Yyyyup. She tested it on herself, and let me tell you this: She. Was. <i>Huge.</i>\" Ray gulped again. \"So whaddya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a flash, Ray snatched the vial out of Sully's hand, yanked out the cork, and downed it. Tangy, but with a bit of sweetness. The concoction ran down his throat like syrup. He looked to his boyfriend, who had a shocked expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... A-Alright then. Guess I got my answer. But, um, y'see, she said the stuff was gonna knock you out for a couple hours, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of his sentence faded away to nothing as Ray's world turned to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Three years ago...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Subject: Ray the Raichu<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\nClassification: filling out (164 lbs.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was hard to keep his hands off his new belly. Mother had scolded him a few times for messing with it at the dinner table. Even just the idea of having a little fat to play with was an alien one to young Ray. And not just his stomach, but also his pecs, and his butt, and his legs. Who could blame for wanting to test out his new padding?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu morph had his shirt off since it was harder to see the changes otherwise. Without it in the way, it was plain to see everything was bigger and softer than it had been a year before. Things were similar below the waist, though it was easier to tell his pudgier physique filled out his shorts instead of letting them hang loose. True, he'd hoped he would've filled out more in a year's time, but fighting his metabolism while learning how to scarf down larger meals was a challenge he still somewhat grappled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you're finally gettin' noticeable results, huh?\" Sullivan asked over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah!\" Ray replied. \"It's been slow, but I'm finally getting somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You been snacking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, regularly.\" He lightly smacked his gut and grinned at the faint jiggling it caused. \"I've been eating more in general, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, good! Keep it up, and you'll be piling 'em on before ya know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You got it.\" Ray smiled at his reflection. He could picture it now; he'd be at least two times, no, three times his normal size. \"Oh, I've been meaning to ask: How's progress going on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty kick-ass, I gotta say!\" It wasn't hard to picture Sullivan saying that with a toothy grin. \"My gut's finally big enough to hang over my waistline! And y'know, I might wanna look into gettin' some bras soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Raichu morph's brow furrowed. \"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Cause I'm growin' man-boobs!\" The Salamence erupted with laughter, driving Ray to pull the phone away. Thankfully, it died down shortly. \"Ah, sorry 'bout that. Didn't kill your ear, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kind of,\" Ray grumbled. \"But wow, that's pretty big. I wish I could see for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't see why you can't. How 'bout we meet up at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray smiled. \"Sure! We haven't seen each other since...since we first met, actually. So, food court at lunchtime on Saturday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sullivan chuckled. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\"Mrr...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Awareness floated back to Ray's senses. His eyelids felt heavy. Regardless, he slowly forced them open, flinching a bit from the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>What happened? I was with Sully when... Oh yeah, that's right. I drank that stuff he gave me. Man, that stuff's got a punch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a gurgling grunt, Ray forced himself to a seated position, which was a bit difficult. His weight felt totally off. He felt...</span></div></div>",

She gasped and panted as she continued to grow in both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams on her pants split and her shirt rode up overtop of her belly, which now acted as a psuedo-bra that barely continued her now very large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was speechless as he took in his new sister, she was a lot bigger, growing from 90 to 350 pounds, but still slightly shorter than him at 5'10\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over yet?\" She said to herself as she opened one of one of her eyes.

He handed Ray two large pill bottle sized containers with powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this stuff and how's it supposed to help me?\" Ray questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that potion is an amplifier, the reason you're not supposed to use it in an unevolved morph is because it will amplify their growth patters beyond normal,\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked at the potion again, now understanding how Julie got so large. \"So how is this stuff going to help me, I've already evolved,\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank pointed to the first and then the second bottle, \"These are my most powerful weight gain and growth hormone powders, combine them with an amplifier in a drink, and anything is possible,\" He said with a bit of a smirk. \"After all,\" He continued, \"How do you think I got so large.\" He smiled patting his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, thanks Hank!\" Ray said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned and began to leave Hank reached over the counter and grabbed him on his pudgy shoulder, \"Just be careful kid, try not to take too much at once and try not to let your sister have any if you are trying to compete with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the advice,\" Ray said as he hurried out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay returns home to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt an odd sensation come over him and could feel his clothes getting tighter. <i>\"Wow, no wonder she loves this stuff, I should have used it instead of eating,\" He thought as a feeling of comfortable warmth passed over his body.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about a quarter of the way into his growth when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a Vaporeon morph, and practically your sister's best friend. She was also quite small for her species, standing only 4'10\" and weighing around 95 lbs. In comparison to Julie and Ray she looked almost like a midget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering...\" She said sheepishly, \"If you could help me get a bit bigger too.\" She dipped her head down in a motion as if to plead with Ray to let her have some of the potion Ray made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay looked at his sister, who still bore and somewhat angry face and then to Krystal, who seemed to be trying the pleading puppy dog eyes tactic.

Despite it being a fairly quiet suburb town, she still got plenty of looks. On a good day, she could cause a cyclist to crash into something while trying to watch her sway her way down the sidewalk. Today, however, like many days before, she wished everyone would just leave her alone. Shame burned inside her skinny little frame, and she was sure everyone knew. Even her brother. Especially her brother! That lard-filled, smug bastard! He had to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia rounded the corner and hurried up to a house. She stood close as she could to the door. She had to make sure no one saw. She'd be in the house before anyone could see who it was she was meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, li'l lady.\" Julia found herself swept into the house and into a powerful hug. A strange mix of emotions swept over her. Shame burned through her cheeks, but so did relief and comfort. She was being pressed into a smooth and soft, pillowy world. She looked up, craning her neck and putting on her best smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wendell.\" she said. A behemoth of a scaly man grinned back at her. Wendell was young for a dragonite, very young. Almost a prodigy by this fact alone. He was also a mountain of man. Dragonites were by nature not very shapely (by most people's standards) but Wendell took it to an extreme. He had a rotund, wobbly gut that reached over his waistline, spreading out sideways into his thick rolls. He almost needed a bra he had such a fatty chest, and his arms were thicker than Julia's thighs. He stood a good 6'4'' inches, towering over her. Julia had hugged him back, but her arms could only make it about two-thirds of the way around his gut. She was pressed against his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doing, tubbs?\" Julia said, trying to make the moniker sound cutesy and not reviled like when she said it to her brother. She hated Wendell. She absolutely loved him. He was a shapeless blob, wasting his life. That's what her instincts screamed. That's what was ingrained into her mind. Yet ever since, one month ago, he had fended off a drunk who wouldn't say 'no' one night, ever since he had fought that man to the ground and then turned around, cut by a broken bottle but only caring that <i>she</i> was alright, Julia couldn't stay away from him. Wendell was powerful, yet so gentle, fun-loving and down to earth. They hadn't done anything intimate from then, but Julia could only just hold herself back. She <i>hated</i> him....and she couldn't get enough of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, li'l lady...\" Wendell said. Julia giggled - the way he said 'little' was so cute.

Julie's ears drooped a little with confusion. What was there to talk about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendell's place was a bit of a bachelor's pad. He kept it presentable, but the living room was an old couch with a deep sag, a second hand television, and a stack of dvds \"tidied\" along the wall and by the TV set. He had a kitchen island separating the living room and kitchen area, which held what was really more of a card table than a dining table. Wendell situated himself on the couch, his great big posterior fitting snugly into the sag of the seat. Actually, his thickness spread slightly beyond the divot, implying that he was a bit heavier than usual these recent days. There was enough room for Julie's skinny butt, even though she did have to sit up against Wendell's bulk (though she wouldn't admit it, Julie definitely didn't mind). Wendell sighed and rested chubby hands on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Wendell?\" Julie asked, her voice becoming that of a child, full of confusion and begging not to be hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no great matter.\" the dragon said. \"But I think you and I need to talk about our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our....relationship?\" Julie echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the thing, li'l one.\" Wendell said. \"I've met a nice young lady. Very nice. And very interested.\" Wendell glanced over to see how Julie reacted to this news. Unfortunately, Julie herself didn't know how to react, and conflicting emotions broiled over. Wendell went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told her to hold up for now. Because I need to know. You're very affectionate, Julie, but I'm not a man to make assumptions. You've been following me like Ponyta foal at her mother's tail. Did you want a relationship, li'l lady? I'm happy either way. I think you're sweet and all...but I need to know before I pass up this other darlin' . Oh, and so you know....\" he reached into his pocket and pulled out a picture. Stunned, Julie nonetheless took it from him. It was a photograph of a dragonair woman. And there was a whole lot of woman in that photo! Great big fatty breasts made teardrop shapes over her stuffed, pregnant-like belly, only just covered in a blue-and-white dress that made the smooth-skinned woman look almost nude. She had plump lips and fat arms, as well as wide flaring hips that framed the lower half of her belly, which rested over her lap. She easily weighed three times what Julie did. There was a full-lipped lipstick mark in the corner, as cliche as can be. Julie's mouth hung open. This was what Wendell was so eager for?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a looker, isn't she. Now, don't be jealous li'l lady, you're beautiful in your own way....\" Wendell said, cementing all of Julie's fears at once and sending a torrent of confusion over her. She didn't know how to react! But she had to say something. </span></div></div>",

Together.\u201d He plodded over to the pre-dented couch carrying a tray filled with sandwiches and big bags of snacks. He sunk and set into the couches confines, and padded the concave cushion right beside him, which Julie eagerly occupied.  Again she was in her own personal heaven as she attempted to lock his bulk between her own lithe arms for a hug; she rested her head against him using his cushion like flab for a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as the opening credits rolled, Julie scrutinizing side took over, watching as  Wendell began immediately helping himself to a family sized bag of \u201cHippopota\u2019s Chipopota\u2019s\u201d shoveling the snacks down at rapid pace. Her mind reeled against the gluttonous act, a perfect mirror of something she\u2019d often seen her own brother do many a time. Somehow watching Wendell make a spoink of himself wasn\u2019t as bad as when she\u2019d watched her brother, but was this what she\u2019d have to do to compete with that house sized dragonair woman?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed an arm from around her tubby hubby and traced along her own stomach's six-pack, now no longer caring for the movie, too busy worrying silently in her head. Julie knew she would do anything to make her big galoot happy even if that meant putting on a few pounds for him. Well, judging from how he liked his women, more than a few, a lot! But all that meant was losing her strict diet which she hated anyways right? But on the other hand, it\u2019d mean she\u2019d loose her proud six-pack too, she remorseful realized.  The conflicting thoughts continued as she thought of outdoing the dragonair. UGH! That dragonair woman who was leagues ahead of her already too, Julie knew she had killer curves as things were, but how can you compare to a girl who was as \u201c<i>well-built</i>\u201d as that! The dragonair had to be three times Julie\u2019s weight, but her breasts had to be the size of Julie\u2019s own head. Who\u2019s to say she the dragonair might not just happen to pay a visit to Wendell\u2019s place, and then he might just be so wowed by her that he\u2019d\u2026 <b>No</b>! She shook the thoughts from her mind; Wendell was much too nice for cheating, even if the other girl was inside his species and someone more his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was resolved now she wouldn\u2019t be waiting for the weight to come, she\u2019d start gaining immediately. She knew she couldn\u2019t do it alone, she would definitely need help if she seriously wanted to gain. There would be no way she could tell Wendell what she had planned to please him either, it would make her look kind of desperate wouldn\u2019t it?  She wanted to show him how she really cared about him, but not just try and gain for his devotion. <i>Hmm</i>\u2026maybe she would tell him she was thinking of gaining, he definitely seemed to have a knack for it she noted, as she watched his stomach slowly raise filing with more and more snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, who else could help her? One person did immediately come to her mind, and as of right now she was definitely not on good terms with him. It was her big brother Ray. <b>Ugh!</b> She realized Ray too seemed to have the gift for gaining, remembering how he seemingly exploding with weight over the course of a single year! Her cheeks visibly began burning red at the thought of the embarrassment and teasing she\u2019d probably get from him if she\u2019d ask for help gaining. But still she would go through that and more if it meant she\u2019d get to be together with Wendell and make him happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the movie would be over, and she\u2019d have to decide...well\u2026it wasn\u2019t an easy choice, but she would<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Well, he'll be reasonable with my decision,' she thought to herself as she looked at Wendell. \"Umm lil' lady...is there anything that you need?\" he asked as she immediately junped and blushed deeply. \"Wendell...I want to gain for you!

Wendell understood that she was new to gaining a lot of weight, so he got up from his seat, looked at her with a comforting smile on his face &amp; replied, \"Alright. I'll be in the kitchen making your big midnight snack. I will let you know when the food's done. OK?\" Julie nodded yes, with a squeamish look on her face, as she saw Wendell waddle into the kitchen to make Julie's snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 Hours Later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time had passed since Wendell started making Julie's food and Julie began to grow uneasy. But then, Julie began to feel Wendell's almost thundering footsteps approaching her. Wendell then lifted Julie into his arms, as the fat Dragonite carried the Pikachu girl into the kitchen. It was there that she saw what Wendell made for her as a midnight snack. Wendell made some of the most fattening sweets he could make in only 2 hours. They ranged from large cakes to giant jelly-filled rolls, all sweet pastries but fattening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendell then lowered Julie into one of the large chairs that was made for someone his size, Julie could see that she'll someday be big enough to fit in one of those chairs. Then, Julie began eating the pile of sweets, hoping her stomach can handle all that food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 hours of eating fattening sweets, Julie finally finished all of the sweets Wendell made for her. However, it didn't come without a price. Due to eating what appeared to be around 250 pounds of pastries, Julie's stomach became gigantic, easily about the size of a monster truck tire. Julie felt really sick from eating all of that food, as Wendell felt extremely worried about Julie , as he went over to her &amp; asked, \"Julie, are you alright?! I'm so sorry on making you eat too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie tried her best to tell Wendell that she was fine, as she replied, \"It's...OK, Wendell. I'm fine...you made....me....the ha-appiest...a girl...could...ever ask for.\" Then, she kissed Wendell on the cheek, due to her huge belly was weighing her to the ground. Wendell understood that she made Julie happy, so he began to roll Julie into his bedroom for her to sleep in.</span></div></div>",

It would be a nice surprise for him anyways and she felt he\u2019d appreciate the act more if she did it on her own, or at least without his help. That meant she\u2019d have to ask her big big brother Ray. The thought made her shiver in disgust, but she also knew if she wanted to get fat as she could, as fast as she could, he\u2019d be the perfect model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon = the film ended with Julie only half paying attention. Wendell however had been completely wrapped in the thriller unconsciously working his way through  both of the  large bags of chips, as well as the stack of sandwiches he\u2019d set out. He looked positively overstuffed and fully content with himself he loved nothing better than the feeling of a full belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d he sighed in ecstasy as he eased further into the couch, his sinking bulky bottom bringing Julie even closer. \u201cSo, did you like it?\u201d he asked staring lovingly down at her as she half laid in his lap.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, uh it was OK...\u201d Julie glanced at a Mike the Meowth clock Wendell had hung on one of his less crowded walls.  \u201cYou know what? I forgot I have to help Ray with something today!\u201d she started, faking a sense of urgency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to help your brother right now?\u201d Wendell asked puzzled by this sudden turn of events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry\u201d she lied. \u201cBut hey I had a great time\u201d she added truthfully. She moved in to seal the deal and make sure that he knew that she was serious. \u201cBut hey there\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d  And she leaned up from her knees, having to reach a little, but was still able to plant a long soft kiss on his round chubby cheek.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Craig was basically your average teenage Charizard.  He got good grades in high school, had a bunch of friends, and was going off to college soon.  However, there was one aspect to Craig's being that set him apart from most of his species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig was quite large for a Charizard.  Quite large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, he had always been tall for his species.  While most of his breed was around  5'9\" to 6', Craig measured in at an astounding 6'7\".  His height itself had always been enough to make him stand out, but his weight helped greatly in making people notice him.  The average Charizard is said to weigh about 200 lbs.  Well, at the time of his graduation, Craig was tipping the scales at an impressive 486 lbs.  He was quite flabby.  His gut arced out from underneath his nicely-endowed chest and cascaded down his midsection, which would wobble from side to side with each step he took.  His arms and legs were proportionally padded, and even his long charizardian neck had been swallowed up by the flab he's put on over the years.  Even through his clothes, his flabbiness was noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cause of this was simple enough: Craig loved to eat.  Whenever he had the opportunity to eat, he would exploit it to the fullest he could.  It wasn't like he was greedy or selfish in character--one would actually say that Craig's personality was more fitting for a smaller body type.  But even though his personality was as so, he could never leave even the smallest scrap of food on his plate.  Eating was one of the few things that Craig simply found aesthetically pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, his parents always tried to keep his eating under control.  They always made eating a dinner time activity only, and made sure they didn't eat at buffets very often.  Buffet trips tended to be long and tedious--for Craig could eat long after his family was finished.  When Craig ate out with his friends, they made sure to give him a specific amount of money that he could spend--and being the good kid he was, he always obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Craig was all done with High School.  He was moving on in his life--going off to College.  He had gotten into a very prestigious school--which happened to be quite a ways away.  Craig would be starting life without his parents around--he would have to fend for himself, make new friends, and make his own decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled in as Craig's family arrived at Nationwide University.  It had taken a good two days to get there, and everyone was quite exhausted.  Craig's mother told him that she and his father and brother would probably stick around and check out the town before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't mean we're going to stick around, however,\" Craig's mother firmly stated.  \"You're off on your own now.  You understand that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig grinned.  \"Yes, mom, I understand.\"  In reality, Craig was itching to get out of the grasp his parents had kept on him.  They weren't  tyrannical or anything, of course.  He was just eager to be on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then... lets get your stuff out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Craig and his family unloaded all of their luggage and unloaded in Craig's new dorm room.  He was in the Rocky Tower, room 416.  They finished unloading, and Craig gave his emotionally declining mother a flabby good-bye hug.  He walked with them out to the car, and they left.  For good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig let go a sigh of relief.  He was on his own now!  He could basically do whatever he wanted.  He held his chubby head high, and strutted off to orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the way to orientation, he happened to catch a whiff of something... well, edible.  He turned his head in the direction the scent was coming from, and found himself staring into the doors to the school cafeteria.  His stomach  immediately began rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;i&gt;Erk...&lt;/i&gt; he thought to himself.  &lt;i&gt;I'm so hungry... but I need to go to orientation...  but I'm so hungry!&lt;/i&gt;  Turns out that Craig would be facing a decision in which he would soon find very frequent.  What does he do?</span></div></div>",

For the first time, Craig had met someone larger than himself!  She must have easily weight 500 lbs-- her expansively wide gut gently enveloped her lap and came down to her knees, with two consequently voluptuous breasts atop it.  Her walking was impaired by her size-- she had to waddle to and fro because her thighs where so inhibited by their size.  With each step she took, her whole body jiggled under the belly exposing top she wore, and her padded tail lazily swayed from side to side.  Craig got a little jittery as he realized that she was heading his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you an incoming freshman?\"<br>\r\nCraig looked up at her. \"Er, yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and extended a chubby paw.  \"Well, let me be the first to welcome you to the school.  My name's Eileen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig put down his sandwich and stood up to accept the handshake.  In doing so, however, he found his own belly gently sink into hers, before quickly shifting to the side to avoid making that moment even more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hi,\" Craig stammered. \"My name's Craig.  Nice to meet you!\" He flashed a bit of a shy grin.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too.  I see you're having a bit of a pre-orientation snack,\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah...\" Craig stammered as he looked down at the pile of empty plates on the table in front of him. \"I was hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen laughed.  \"Hah, can't tell you how many times I've done the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig's face brightened. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh sure.\" replied Eileen.  \"In fact, this was the first place I headed my freshman year as well.  I've always appreciated a good meal.\" She grinned, and patted her gut.  It rippled in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Craig chuckled, \"it's nice to meet someone else who appreciates food like I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileens demeanor instantly changed from cheerful to shocked. \"Are you calling me fat?\" she said, completely aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three or four seconds passed which, to Craig, felt like a year each.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Eileen exploded in laughter.  \"Just kidding!  Oh sorry, I do that to everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig just kind of stared shocked, for a second, then joined in with the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, sorry about that.  I guess you'll soon find that I'm a bit of a jokester.\" Eileen chuckled.  \"I'm one of the few girls you'll ever meet who is proud to be large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig grinned. \"That's awesome,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen grinned back.  \"So what's your major?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not sure yet.  I'm thinking something in computer sciences... what about you?\"<br>\r\n\"Me?  Culinary Arts.  As if you couldn't tell.\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweet.  I was thinking about doing that as a minor myself.  What year are you?\" Craig asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm a Sophomore.\" she replied.  \"Actually, you should head over to orientation so you can sign up for your classes before it's too late.  It's really hard to get things straightened out here if you miss that.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, right.\" Craig replies. \"Er... can you tell me how to get there?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, just follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head off, Eileen leading the way.  Anyone watching would probably grin at the sight of two very large people walking down the sidewalk, both jiggling profusely.   The two of you arrive in the building and she says goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, actually,\" Eileen says before she leaves, \"You want to hang out after you get all of this done?  I could show you around and stuff.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, that'd be great!\" Craig replies.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's no problem at all! Meet me...\"</span></div></div>",

Still unsure of his way around campus he took a little longer to trace his steps back to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived slightly late and saw an anxious looking Eileen standing outside the door. She was looking every which way trying to spot Craig, it wasn't long before she did, as a nearly 500lb charizard morph is pretty hard to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped (as much as a 500lb Nidoqueen can) and waved a pudgy paw as he approached, \"There you are Craig!\" She shouted, he belly still jiggling from the impact of landing after the jump, \"I thought you might have gotten lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just took me a bit longer to get back, did you want to eat something before we took a tour of the campus?\" Craig asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else would I ask to meet in a cafeteria if I didn't expect dinner silly?\" She said with a giggle. Her stomach growled audibly, \"See, it wants food! Come, on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Craig's hand with both of hers and started to pull the charizard along with amazing force and speed for someone her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor them the all you can eat buffet style was heaven, they each made several trips back, each time filling a tray to capacity. As time dragged on a stack of dirty dishes had piled up next to both of them. They made a little small talk, but both of them concentrated on the food they were eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooo.....boy I'm stuffed,\" Craig said as he ate one last bite of pie he had gotten as the last part of his dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna eat all that skinny pants?\" Eileen said as she pointed to the remaining pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, you can have it, Its been a long while since I was able to eat like that, and the first time Ive ever seen anyone keep up with me, let alone beat me,\" Craig said.

It was hard to tell what she looked like, but then again still easy, because she laying on her obviously large stomach and breasts, reading some type of book.

That meant food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Craig wasted no time in reaching the said food.

But in terms of weight, the Dragonite was just about as overweight as Craig.  Dragonites had always run a little heavy, but this fellow certainly abused the  privilege!  His belly distended a good ways from his abdomen, resting idly mid-way down his thighs.  His chest was also well proportioned to his belly, and his arms and legs were also well padded.  He had a very round, jovial face and his tail was thick enough to balance his hefty gut.  If anything, he was a little bigger than Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Lucian\".  The Dragonite extended a pudgy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Craig,\" replied Craig.  \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shook hands and exchanged nods of friendship.  They talked for a bit, and found that they had a good few common interests and hobbies.  When it came to the dorms, the school was pretty good about pairing students up based on common interests and had pretty good results when it came to roommates sticking together.  They two of them were quite pleased to find that they had so much in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I feel like the school was able to find me a roommate my size as well!\" Craig blurted out.  After realizing what he said, he brought his hand to his mouth.  \"Oh I'm sorry!\" he exclaimed.  \"Shoot, I hope I didn't offend you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucian let out a jovial laugh \"Ooh, not at all!\" he replied reassuringly.  \"I've never had any bad qualms about my weight.  I guess you could say I'm happy being fat!\" Lucian slapped his gut, and it wobbled aesthetically in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that's good.\" Craig let out a sigh of relief.  \"I guess you could say I'm the same way.  I've always loved eating... guess all of this is just happy memories of the good times!\" Craig grinned, and grabbed a roll of his own soft midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too eh?  Eating's always been a love of mine as well,\" replied the Dragonite.  \"Once I get going, I can't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?!\" exclaimed Craig.  Things were going well enough already, and now his first friend in college was one of the only people he's ever met who's shared his eating habits. \"Man, finally, somebody who's on my wavelength.  Maybe they do factor in size when picking roommates!\" Craig laughed, and Lucian joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Lucian chimed in, \"do you want to go get dinner after this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig grinned even wider. \"Definately!

A buffet?  He rarely got to go to those!  And there's one nearby?  Oh my.  <i>It's good to be in college...</i> Craig thought to himself.  Needless to say, he agreed to go there instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the day's events were over, Craig and Lucian walked over to the restaurant.  It was a very nice restaurant.  The seating area was very nicely done-- not too ritzy, but still very clean and well-managed.  The buffet itself coasted about fifteen dollars-- a completely normal price for any respectable buffet.  Yet, Craig and Lucian would be saving a lot of money by eating here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time Craig walked to the buffet section of the restaurant, he almost fainted.  He had never seen that much food in a contained area before in his life.  Bins upon bins upon bins, piled high with the savory goodness of mashed potatoes and barbecued ribs and macaroni and cheese.  Craig kept his gawking time to a minimum, however, and made sure he hurried up and began eating.  He and Lucian both piled their plates high with food, and did not waste any time to get eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had to be eating for at least and hour straight.  They must have gone through at least ten plates each in that time.  They both ate until they literally could not eat any more.  Craig completely lost himself in the meal-- everything he ate just tasted so delicious.  It was all so rich-- the cooks were certainly very generous with the amount of butter they used in their dishes.  As Craig rubbed his taught and visibly distended gut, he sighed a sigh of jubilation.  He hadn't eaten like that in <i>years</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it was a difficult walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I really stuffed myself today...\" stated Lucian, having difficulty dragging himself down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n\"Erf- no kidding,\" replied Craig, who was in the same predicament. \"So did I.  I haven't eaten that much in ages!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I wish I ate like that more often...\" thought Lucian out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a light went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just.. had an idea..!\" Stammered Lucian in between gasps.<br>\r\n\"Wuzzat?\"<br>\r\n\"We should.. have a contest!\"<br>\r\nCraig was confused.  \"A contest?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Exclaimed Lucian.  \"We should have...\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't even have a real preference when it came to gender. He did, however, have a preferred body type. The hefty bulk that came with the Charizard's eating habits was one of the best things he could ever ask for. The softness, the various folds of flab he just loved to play with, the way it all weighed him down and gave him a wonderful feeling he could never describe... It was no wonder he felt attraction to other fat 'morphs. The deliciously plump Dragonite in front of him was no exception. Though his huge gut wasn't quite large enough to be seen from behind, Craig could still picture it in all its rotundness.

If I could just be open with him...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The city around Craig was nothing more than a blurry backdrop at that point. All of his attention was on Lucian, and not even the strain of his taut gut could distract him. It was obvious from the way the Dragonite moved that he was used to stuffing himself silly. The untrained eye might have missed it, but Craig was no uncultured buffoon. He had no trouble seeing the subtle grace with which Lucian carried his bulk. Craig could just imagine his new friend unclothed, his flab on display for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The world around them all but vanished as they continued along. It wasn't all that important. Of course, how could anything be more important than the suddenly naked Lucian before him? Every last curve was on full display, jiggling and bouncing with every step he took. Craig could feel that fat calling out to him, begging to be rubbed and played with. A tempting offer, but Craig was no slave to his desires. He could make do with admiring from afar and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No need to be so shy, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig's heart skipped a beat. Did Lucian really just... No, there's no way. Surely he wouldn't be openly flirting with a guy he just met. His sudden and inexplicable nudity couldn't be anything more than Craig's imagination getting the best of him. And so was that saucy over-the-shoulder look Lucian was giving. A bit tame as far as sexy daydreams went, but it was enough for the walk back. Now if only that tail would stop getting in the way of that luscious ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dream Lucian smirked. \"Tsk tsk, Craig. So shameless. But if that's what you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took some self restraint on the Charizard's part to not lick his lips as Lucian raised his tail so very, very slowly. Craig's heart hammered away in his chest. For a moment, he pondered if the real Lucian was this sadistic. Said moment was short-lived thanks to the dreamed-up Dragonite finally exposing his butt in its entirety. The sight of those twin orbs unobstructed made Craig's mouth water. Swallowing back the saliva, he marveled at their roundness, at their size, at the way they jiggled with each step. Yes, they would make for excellent pillows. Just fluff them up a little (or a lot, if he so desired) and everything would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dream Lucian chuckled. \"And these 'pillows' could be all yours if you'd just open up. C'mon, big boy, don't be shy. I won't bite <i>too</i> hard. You can trust a fellow fatty, right Craig? Craig? You with me, dude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh...?\" Craig blinked. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said we made it to Rocky Tower.\" Lucian gestured with his thumb at the building behind him. Craig looked up and, sure enough, the words \"ROCKY TOWER\" were written above the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh.\" Craig forced a chuckle. \"So we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just like before, Lucian raised an eyebrow and smirked at him. \"Zoned out a bit, I take it?\" Craig's only response was to blush. \"Ah, don't worry about it. I kinda get lost in thought sometimes, too. Keeps my mind off how overstuffed I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Speaking of stuffing, did you remember that other term you thought of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It felt like a rock landed in Craig's stomach. He gulped. \"Um... Y-yeah. Yeah, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Dragonite nodded. \"Cool. So, what'd you think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Biting his lip, Craig mustered every once of willpower he could and looked his roommate in the eyes. \"My idea was, um... I was thinking that whoever loses should give the winner a... a kiss. On the lips. For a full three seconds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian's expression was completely unreadable. No smirk, no scowl, not even a raised eyebrow. The rock in Craig's stomach was starting to feel more like a boulder. A sudden panic gripped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"B-but we don't need to use that term if you don't want to!\" Craig blurted out. \"I mean, this contest was your idea in the first place, so you get the final say on everything!\" His courage spent, the Charizard averted his gaze to his gut, rubbing it nervously. Silence hung in the air for what Craig could swear was half an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I totally blew it, didn't I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig looked back up at Lucian. The Dragonite gave him what he assumed was a reassuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Loser has to kiss the winner on the lips for three seconds. Just no tongue, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig tried to respond, but no words came out of his mouth. He settled for a smile of his own--which was no doubt exceedingly grateful--and a nod. Without another word, the two entered Rocky Tower and made their way up to their room. There was no doubt Lucian had some questions, but he seemed willing to save them until the next day, which Craig was grateful for. After all, what better way to handle a stuffed gut than to sleep it off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>The following day, back at the buffet...</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two sat opposite each other, their plates stacked with whatever they could fit on them. Lucian was giving Craig a cool stare, though the Dragonite couldn't help but grin. Craig gave a grin of his own and drummed his fingers on the table. He could only assume it was a mix of nervousness and excitement. Competing with a fellow glutton in an eating contest was a new experience, and Lucian was sure to give him a run for his money if yesterday was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian cleared his throat. \"Alright, let's go over things one more time. We'll fill our plates up with as much food as we can and then eat them clean. No going for more until we've eaten our entire helping. There's no time limit, so we don't need to rush each other, but neither of us can stop until we feel like eating anymore. Obviously, whoever eats the most helpings is the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now for the actual bet: first, the loser has to pay for the winner's meals for a week. Second, the loser must also act as the winner's slave for the semester, assuming the demands are reasonable and won't cause trouble. Third, for as long as we're roomies, the winner will have the loser stuff them as much as possible for each meal. Fourth, the winner may command the loser to rub his fat as he pleases. Fifth, the loser can't gain any further weight without the winner's permission. Sixth, the loser has to help the winner gain at least one pound per day. Seventh, only the winner can decide when to relieve the loser of all these conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And finally...\" Lucian paused for a split second. \"Finally, the loser will have to kiss the winner on the lips for three seconds. Did you get all that?\" Craig nodded. \"Good. Now that we got all the formalities outta the way, let's get to eating!\"</span></div></div>",

No way that doughy Dragonite could've outdone the ten plates' worth they each had yesterday without some sort of secret trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Ooooogh...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite his best efforts, Craig only managed to just barely match the ten plates he ate yesterday. If there was anything to take away from this contest, it's that one binge the day before wasn't enough to up his max capacity. His nearly distended, drum-tight stomach made sure he understood that. Maybe this was why his parents never let him go overboard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig groaned again as he tried to push himself up from his reclining position. The walk back was going to be even worse this time, no doubt. Maybe they'd be able to stick around the buffet for a while and nurse their guts for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nah, probably not. They'd get kicked out for loitering. Having given up on moving for the moment, the Charizard peered over his belly at Lucian. He looked to be in the same state, though maybe not quite as out of it. A little preoccupied with rubbing his gut, but he didn't have a glassy look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Ngh...</i> Lucian?\" No response. \"Lucian? Hey, Lucian. You still with me?\" This time, he managed to get a grunt out of the Dragonite. \"I think we should get goin'. Management probably won't let us hang around here. C'mon, I'll give you a belly rub, if you want. Should help with digesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian looked up at Craig, but said nothing. He just nodded after a moment, and slowly pulled himself out of the booth. Craig tried to do the same, but winced when he pressed against the table. Thankfully, Lucian offered a hand in slipping him out. Craig leaned against his roommate, putting an arm over his shoulder. To Lucian's credit, he managed to haul the two of them out the door with something resembling grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" the tubby dragon finally said, \"let's get back to our room so you can give me that rub. I'll give ya one back when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You don't have to. You won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I know.\" He grunted as he pulled Craig up from his growing slouch. \"But I wanna. It's the least I could do for you, Loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig snorted. \"Whatever you say, Winner.\" He smirked. \"Nice to know you won't be a <i>total</i> ass to your slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian smirked back. \"I think you'll find I'm pretty reasonable master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A brief lull in the conversation passed. Then, Craig asked, \"So how'd you manage to put down twelve plates today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thirteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, no kidding? Now I really wanna know how you did it. You only got through ten yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian pulled up the slouching Charizard again, then chuckled. \"Well, if you want the truth, I actually wanted to have an eating contest with you the moment we met. I wasn't sure how good you are, so I decided to take you to the buffet and match your eating so you wouldn't be too scared to take me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig playfully swatted him with his tail. \"Oh, you sneaky bastard!\" Despite his words, he couldn't help but grin. \"You wanted a personal slave that badly, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was your idea, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-? Oh, yeah, that's right... W-well, it doesn't really matter who came up with what, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian chuckled again. \"Sure, Craig. Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apparently, Lucian was already comfortable enough with Craig that he had no issue with burping around him, judging by the three successive belches he just let out. The Dragonite was leaning back on his bed, his shirt pulled up so as to leave his gut unobstructed. Craig was kneeling down in front of him, massaging away at the turgid orb while ignoring the strain of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ahh, that's the stuff,\" Lucian remarked before letting loose another belch. \"You sure know your way around a belly. You practice on yourself a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe,\" Craig muttered, blushing. He considered himself more of a belly kneader than masseuse. Given his lack of chances to pig out back home, his own soft belly was far more familiar than someone else's rock hard one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, now you're gonna put all that practice to good use, 'cause you're gonna give me a belly rub after every meal. And don't even think of weaseling your way outta this, not that--ooh, that's nice, keep doing that--not that you actually would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig just blushed harder as he mixed more scratching in with his rubbing. Maybe it would've been better to never suggest that kiss in the first place if Lucian was just going to tease him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Come to think of it, when did Lucian plan on having Craig kiss him anyway? He had no problem with ribbing the poor Charizard about his attraction, obviously, but what was on his mind? He could just be putting it off to make fun of Craig as long as he could. They never said anything about having a time frame for it, so it could end up being anytime between today and the time they moved out of the dorm. Hell, given Lucian had full control of their little arrangement and could call things off whenever he wanted, he could just skip out on the kiss entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A pat on the head made Craig freeze. \"Okay, buddy,\" said Lucian, \"I think that's enough. You did a good job. Great, even. Now how 'bout you get up here and sit next to me? You look like you're about to bury your face in my gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig jerked away instantly, wincing at the pain in his stomach from the sudden shift. Blushing harder still, he stood up and sat down next to his laughing roommate. The laughter died down, though Lucian looked everywhere but at Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm?\" Craig's head tilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think, uh...\" The Dragonite drummed his fingers on his belly. \"I think it, um, might be better to, uh...y'know, to get that kiss over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig gulped. \"Are you sure? 'Cause you can, well, you can call it off if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian shook his head. He finally turned to look Craig in the eyes. \"You already gave me a chance to say no, and I didn't take it, so go ahead and kiss me. Three seconds on the lips, just like you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig's heart hammered away in his chest. <i>This is it,</i> he thought. He leaned forward slowly, less than an inch at a time. His eyes never left Lucian's face for a second. The Dragonite had no discernible emotion on his face. Craig couldn't help but envy his poker face, as he could feel the nervousness showing on his. Lips quivered as they parted, eyes slowly closing. Almost there, just a little closer and they'd make contact. Eyes shut completely, lip puckered, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contact was established. No reaction from Lucian. Was his face still just as stoic as it was a second ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>One...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Neither dared to move nor breathe. It was as though time itself froze on the spot, or the world faded away and they were all that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Two...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His fingers yearned to reach out and run themselves over the Dragonite's gloriously globular body, but he abstained. His lips desired to remain where they were for as long as he could, only willing to move when he needed air, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>And three.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The connection was severed almost immediately, though Craig was slow to properly pull away. His breathing slowly returned, and his eyes warily opened, the first thing he saw Lucian's still stoic face.</span></div></div>",

Craig barely had enough time to register what was happening when their lips mashed together. The shock left him motionless, but Lucian held him so firmly that he couldn't have moved anyway. This wasn't the plain kiss they shared seconds ago, either. This one was intense, hungry for passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once it finally registered in Craig's mind, his wide eyes slowly shut, and he began to push back. Lucian moaned with approval and removed his hands to wrap his arms around Craig, who responded in kind. Craig winced at his stuffed belly getting squished between them, but he didn't care. He was finally kissing a fellow fatty, and it was better than anything he'd ever dreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Holy shit, holy shit, holy <b>shit!</b> I'm, I'm kissing him!

Should I even be thinking about tongue right now? Maybe I should ask him; he seems like an expert on this stuff. Aw man, this is way better than three seconds. This is the kind of kiss I'd keep up fore-- Oh crap, need air...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They finally broke apart. How long did it last? Ten, twenty, thirty seconds? A full minute? All Craig knew, as he panted and tried to relax his rapidly beating heart, was that he wanted more of it. His cheeks burned fiercely, the bright red blush no doubt showing even through his scales. He opened his eyes to see Lucian smiling at him. Was he blushing too, or was it just Craig's imagination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian chuckled. \"I had a feeling I'd like you.

'Til then, how 'bout that belly rub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His brain still feeling like mush, Craig could only bring himself to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With both the pressure in his stomach and the shock of their second kiss gone, Craig found it much easier to pay attention to Lucian's questions. Which were coming out of his mouth. Through his lips. Which kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Okay, maybe the focus wasn't <i>entirely</i> there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian snapped his fingers in Craig's face a few times. \"C'mon, big guy, stay with me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wha-?\" Craig shook his head. \"S-sorry, what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I asked if you've never kissed a guy before today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-oh, uh...\" Craig glanced around the room. \"Well, to be honest, I've never...actually kissed...anyone before. Like, at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian raised an eyebrow and grinned. \"So I'm your first, huh?\" Craig blushed and nodded slowly. Lucian's grin widened. \"Alright then, how's it feel having a guy like me kiss you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Licking his lips, Craig stared down at his belly. When he was sure his heartbeat wouldn't be settling down anytime soon, he took a deep breath and looked back to Lucian. \"You're, well, you're everything I ever wanted in a first kiss. You're fat, you love being fat, and you... I don't know, you just feel 'right'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, huh?\" Lucian leaned back a bit and stared up at the ceiling. \"We only just met the other day, y'know. It's a little too soon to decide if we're soulmates or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I know that! Just...\" Craig squeezed his belly. \"I just think you're a good first time. Even if we never kiss again-- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Never kiss again'?!\" Lucian laughed, causing his body to jiggle, and slipped an arm around Craig's back. \"Buddy, we can kiss as much as you want! I didn't challenge you to an eating contest just to kiss your ass, y'know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Then why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He scratched his gut. \"Well, when you told me how much you loved to eat, I might've thought I could seduce you with my awesome stuffing skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, wait, back up a bit. I think I'm missing something here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw, c'mon, it's not that hard to figure out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig gave him a pointed look. \"Humor me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian rolled his eyes. \"You're not the only one who gets the hots for fatties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realization struck Craig. \"So, you're saying... Holy shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucian's grin turned almost predatory. \"Yup. Big boys like you drive me wild, Craiggie, and I've got you all to myself.\" He leaned in until his snout was less than an inch away from Craig and whispered, \"What about you? Do I drive you wild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig shivered. \"Y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How wild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I-I, I imagined you naked last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you imagine me doing anything interesting? I bet you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig gulped. \"I imagined you showing off your big, fat ass.\" Feeling a strange sense of bravery, he continued, \"I wanted to touch it so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Reeeeaaaally.\" Lucian pressed his body against Craig's side, earning another shiver. \"In that case, maybe we should get a little more hands-on tonight. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Craig let out a shuddering breath. His whole body was shaking. Then, to both his relief and disappointment, Lucian eased off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then again, maybe I'm pushing things a bit. You don't seem all that ready for this. We can slow things down if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rather than the mischievous glint he expected, Craig turned to find genuine concern in Lucian's eyes. He smiled.</span></div></div>",

Craig weighs himself first, and finds himself a little more than the last time he weighed himself--491 lbs.  Of course, much more was to be expected of the Dragonite--his breed weighed on average almost as much as Craig did now, so needless to say Lucian's weight was already way ahead of Craig's.  Lucian clocked in at 667 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" stated Lucian.  \"May the hungriest win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them do what they're best at voraciously for one month.  Each meal they shared becomes an eating contest, they both find themselves having meals both on and off campus--for each meal of the day, and both of them are snacking every chance that they get.  The growth is definitely noticable--Craig continues to notice his clothing getting tighter on him, while Lucian notices his bed protest more and more each night.  Luckily, this fierce competition hasn't been impeding school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the end of the month comes around, and it's time to weigh in.  Who's winning so far?</span></div></div>",

As they went to go pay for their meal Craig was ready to eat and let Lucian pay. When Lucian was finishing paying he saw Craig eating like crazy. Lucian responded, \"Holy shit man how much have you eaten already!\" Craig answered while food is in his mouth, \"I re ...ally don't...know.\" Lucian started to eat with Craig. Craig was just shoving everything down. After thirty minuets of gorging they left with full bellies. As they returned to their dorm Craig felt hungry again but there wasn't any food so Craig just dealt with the hunger pains. As time passed and Lucian fell asleep Craig snuck out to go feast. Craig knew Lucian was a heavy sleeper. To make sure of this Craig put his fat on Lucian and started trying to wake up Lucian but it didn't work even when he did it during the whole night. Craig was a person who only needs like five minuets of sleep. Craig used this to his advantage. Craig head straight for an all meat restaurant. Craig headed for Meats where you eat as much as you want. Craig had never been there before and this would be his first time. When Craig got there his stomach was ready to eat everything. Craig took his seat and was deciding what to get. When Craig's waiter came and he was ready to order. The waiter said,\"Sir,I think you should come with me. Craig followed in curiosity. The waiter led Craig to another area. The waiter said,\"This is were are bigger guest go to eat.\" Craig was alone in a room with a metal chair and table. Craig looked around to find nothing until he saw something come down. What came down was tube that dropped meat. A voice said,\"Eat as much you like its all on the house.\" Craig's jaw dropped and he knew what he was going to do. Craig started eating all that he could. When Craig had to make room he unbuttoned his pants to reveal his briefs and flab. After finishing the all you can eat buffet Craig was rubbing his belly pondering what to do next. </span></div></div>",

I don't remember...\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n\"Hey Craig, whatcha got there?\" Lucian said, as he swiped the ball from the ridiculously obese Charizard's paws. \"You probably don't need this, seeing how fast you've grown this month. Besides, I need to step up my game,\" he said, as he ate the ball in one bite.<br>\r\n\"Hey, why'd you do that?\" Craig asked angrily. \"I don't even know what that was.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you were holding it, so it had to be edible. Doesn't taste very good, though,\" the Dragonite replied. \"It's like a pastry without any sugar in it.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, an audible groan emitted from Lucian's stomach. He looked straight down to see his huge gut, or at least how much of it he could see with his chins in the way. \"That's odd. I haven't felt this hungry since I started gorging myself for our contest,\" he thought to himself. His stomach continued growling. \"Say, Craig, wanna head over to the buffet?\"<br>\r\n\"Right now? It's a bit early, don't ya think?\" Craig looked at the clock. It was 3:30. Normally they didn't go down to the buffet until 5.<br>\r\nLucian tried to play off his unusually large hunger. \"Nah, it's a perfect time to go! We'll get there before most of the others start to arrive. Want me to call Conner so he can drive us over?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Craig thought about it for a moment. It didn't take long for him to realize that it was a dumb thing to think about, since they normally snacked on whatever they could find until a few minutes before they went to the buffet. Besides, it's not like they were really hungry when they did go. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lard-asses hauled themselves downstairs (very carefully, so they didn't get themselves or anyone else stuck) to the parking lot, where they found Conner waiting for them. Conner was a Houndoom who, much like Craig and Lucian, loved to eat, and could even keep up with Craig and Lucian at the buffet before their gains really picked up. Strangely, however, his metabolism literally burned up anything he ate, leaving him fairly thin. Ever since the contest began, Conner had to drive Craig and Lucian to and from the buffet in his enormous yet surprisingly fuel-efficient van since they would regularly gorge themselves to the point where they'd be barely able to walk out of the restaurant. \"Could you believe that the buffet <i>actually</i> started giving us discounts? You'd think that with us nearly closing them every day, they'd start charging us more!\" the Houndoom joked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever,\" Lucian mumbled, as his stomach started growling even more.<br>\r\n\"Come on, can't you at least laugh a little? It's not often you hear a Dark type joking about something,\" Conner said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just that I'm a bit anxious to get there, that's all.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a couple minutes, they were at the buffet. A Rhydon working there quickly noticed them, and hurried over to the main desk to flip over a sign saying \"Shortage imminent.\"<br>\r\nLucian waddled into the restaurant as fast as he could, trying to keep the smells of the buffet from driving him over the edge for now and nearly crashing into the desk. Craig and Conner followed.<br>\r\nThe Bayleef at the desk was obviously a new worker, as she was very intimidated by the titanic dragon Pokemon looming over her. A Pelipper walking behind the desk whispered to her \"They get a discount.\" \"Seriously?\" the Bayleef asked, turning around in an attempt to see who told her that. She sighed, and turned to the enormous Dragonite in front of her. \"P-party of three?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lucian replied, panting heavily from that short 'run'. The Bayleef fumbled at the cash register to find how much of a discount they would be getting, when she noticed that there was simply one button for discounts. \"Th-that'll be thirty six d-dollars,\" she said.<br>\r\nAs the three payed for their meals, she couldn't help but think to herself \"How can we afford to feed them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, that ball of dough had some weird properties to it. It sped up Lucian's already black hole-like digestion process even more than the constant gorging did, leaving him hungrier than ever by the time he started filling his first plates with as much food as possible. However, just how much faster did it get? Will it just be enough to let him keep up with Craig, or will his new hunger take him to a new level of feasting?</span></div></div>",

Let's go!\"<br>\r\nAs they walked to the gym, Brian talked to Craig about himself. At his high school, he had outclassed everyone in his school, except for one or two guys. He was pretty dedicated to weight lifting, and said that's he's worked out about twice a month since he was 8. He managed to bench press 3000 pounds one time, which astounded Craig. The thought of being able to move 3000 pounds made the obese Charizard twitch.<br>\r\nWhen they got to the gym, it was almost completely empty except for a Nidoking doing leg presses with over 1000 pounds. He didn't even bother to pay attention to the two giants who had just entered the gym. Brian walked towards a collection of dumbbells, where he grabbed two 300 pound ones and started doing curls. Meanwhile, Craig walked around to see all of the different machines.<br>\r\nOne specific one caught his attention. It was the leg press machine that the Nidoking was using before. Interested in trying it, the obese Charizard sat in the seat, just barely fitting in it. In front of him, he could see a large steel plate. \"I guess I'm supposed to put my feet on it,\" he thought to himself. After a little difficulty trying to bring his feet up due to the saddlebags of fat on his legs, he managed to get his feet on the plate, but his knees were bent almost uncomfortably. \"What am I supposed to do now?\" he thought. That's when he noticed that to the right of the plate, a few pictures showing how to use the machine were conveniently placed on a bar that was part of the machine. The pictures were of a stick figure that had gotten into the same position as Craig was in, and then started to push against the plate with its feet, moving a weight attached to the front of the machine. The figure would then bring its feet back to the point where the weight was almost at its starting position, but then would push it back out again. The instructions said to repeat the motion until the figure decided to stop, in which case it brought the plate back to its original position. Emulating what the stick figure had done, Craig started to push against the plate as hard as he could with his feet. His face started to turn red, and he started to sweat. Suddenly, he felt the weight move, which surprised him so much that he almost immediately dropped his feet. The weight slammed back into the machine with a loud clang. Craig brought his feet up again, and repeated the process, only this time, it was much easier. He brought his feet back to him, but not completely, then pushed out again. After three more reps, his legs felt too tired to move again, so he brought the weight back gently.<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"<br>\r\nCraig looked to his left. Brain was standing there, looking at him with complete shock. \"Do you realize how much weight was on that thing?!\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"No,\" the Charizard responded. \"I guess I didn't bother to check.\" At that, he got out of the seat, the machine creaking from the sudden removal of weight. He walked over to the front of the machine, but his legs wobbled as he walked. When he saw the front of the machine, he was amazed by the amount of weight on it. Each plate weighed 100 pounds, and there were 14 of them. He had just leg pressed 1400 pounds for 5 reps, and on his first time too!<br>\r\n\"I expected that you'd have some decent leg strength from hauling yourself around all the time, but I never would have expected something like this,\" the giant Machoke said. \"You should try the squat machine. You'll probably do pretty decently on that.\" However, Craig didn't really want stay. On the other hand, it would be interesting to see just how strong he really is. What did Craig decide to do?</span></div></div>",

He had all this food to himself and he quickly got two cheeseburgers, two sides of fries, a large cup of coke, and for dessert, a slice of chocolate cake. He eat it all up in 25 minutes, and it clearly showed on his frame. His belly was very big and round, it made his shirt roll up to his large moobs but Craig didn't care too much. To him, the feeling of being full was the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on one of tables for a bit to let his body digest his humongous meal and when he didn't feel full anymore, he left the cafeteria, waddling to his room. It was beginning to get dark outside and some of the other students were returning from their classes. That was unfortunate for Craig, since he was the biggest pokemorph in the halls. Luckily, his room wasn't far from the cafeteria, so he didn't have to waddle into other pokemorphs for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and he saw that Brian had not returned from the gym yet.<br>\r\n\"Geez, I guess he loves the gym as much as I love the cafeteria.\" Craig said as he rubbed his belly lovingly.<br>\r\nUsually, when Craig was alone in the house, he would remove all his clothes and watch the tv while eating snacks but since Brian could come back at any time, he decided not to do that.

He answered the phone and instead of hearing a voice, he just heard the dial tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange, did someone call me just to hang up on me?\" He murmured to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at his phone's clock. Surprisingly, it was 3 in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up for that? I've got classes at 8!

Craig didn't want to answer this time, so he let it rang and hoped that the mysterious person would leave a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finished, he noticed that there wasn't any message or even a text from the unknown caller. Craig was beginning to freak out. He didn't like random callers, and when they kept calling him, he would get nervous and jittery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Craig stopped receiving these mysterious calls and calmed down. Swiping the sweat off his muzzle, he went back to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on as usual, with Craig saying goodbye to his roommate, he went to his classes, and got a huge lunch. He was still worried about the caller though. He would start to shake his claws involuntarily when he worried too much. Craig did have a couple tricks up his sleeve when he dealt with situations like this, food always helped him calm down. When he didn't have any food available, he would play with his belly or jump up and down to see how long his body jiggled. He would always laugh and he would feel better afterwards with a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month passed by, and Craig was beginning to feel comfortable at his new home. He still didn't talk to Brian because he was afraid that he might make fun of him. But he did have new friends. Well actually, he only had 2 friends, and one was always busy so, he basically had only one friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig woke up and slowly got up out of bed. For a second, he noticed that it was getting difficult to get up from bed but he shook that thought away quickly. He instead thought that his bed wasn't very good, and he had no support to hold on to when getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the early morning, and Brian was still sound asleep. Since Craig knew that Brian didn't really care that he was naked, Craig had begun to sleep in the nude more often. It felt natural for Craig and besides, his underwear was always drenched in sweat, and Craig didn't feel like cleaning his clothes every day. He still cleaned up after Brian and himself, Brian's messes would annoy Craig to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig recently bought a mirror to see how he looked like from all angles, so he waddled quietly towards the mirror and looked at it, he couldn't believe what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks were so puffed up, he looked like a squirrel preparing to store his nuts for winter, his face even felt fat. His double chin and turned into a triple chin, and his moobs filled out considerably, and looked even more droopy. His belly hung down to his knees, wobbling for a few seconds after he had stopped moving, his thighs looked like stuffed sausages ready to burst and his tail end looked like two watermelons glued together, with a out of place stubby tail between them. He used to be 486, but now, he was at least 650.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig felt...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A huge wobbling gut arced out from her, like a bir fleshy balloon, sticking out inches from her frame before finally curving down, at its lowest reaching well down her crotch and brushing her thighs. God her thighs....she'd never get her legs fully apart again, not with so much cellulite packed into them that they touched most of the way to her knees. Her pajamas were tattered, her bottoms pushed down to reveal an indecent amount of a bulbous, wobbling ass. She had no chance of ever fitting comfortably into a desk chair again. Her top had fared little better, now more of a glorified bra for the two volleyball boobs she had gained. Jenny huffed and turned this way and that, studying herself in shock and confusion. Not used to her weight by a long shot, she nearly fell over as her blubber bounced about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen? Why me?\" she looked ready to cry. Trying to stay strong, she waddled slowly to the kitchen. Her pace was partially due to her newfound weight, partially because she couldn't see her feet anymore (she could barely see anything below her tits) and felt like she might teeter over any second. She really was a butterball at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Jenny managed to find a carton of one of the 'diet' shakes she had chugged. She had checked before, of course, but now was looking for any sort of warning label. There was nothing, but on the bottom of the carton, which she hadn't noticed before, was the small stamp of what was obviously a store. Jenny scratched her chin - or, at least, she tried. She had more chins to choose from then she was expecting. Jenny nearly cried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jenny, come on, you're a cop. You can figure this out. We'll try that store. Get some answers. Maybe some help. Gotta get clothes first of course....I can't go out like this.\" Jenny doubted even her largest pair of sweatpants would help her now, and a bra was out of the question. As she was contemplating all of this, a roar literally shook her body. She jumped in fright, as much as she could, which was all of an inch and a half. The ground shook as she landed. Jenny looked around, and then grabbed two handfuls of her doughy belly in her pudgy hands. She was voracious. She felt like she could eat the fridge empty. She probably would if she let herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stay focused Jenny. Clothes. I can't go out, Who can I call. Not....not him....I know. Joy.\" Jenny remembered her old childhood friend. They had drifted apart a little when Jenny went into police work and Joy into nursing, but the girl was a true friend and would come if Jenny needed. Her belly gurgled again.  </span></div></div>",

She sat down on her couch while Paul looked around the room.<br>\r\n\"So, Jenny, did you have any sort of plan in mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Plan?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know. An exercise routine, fitness plan, workout schedule?\"<br>\r\nJenny realized she hadn't made any preparations for this at all. \"Er... No, I hadn't. I've never really tried this before. I was sort of hoping you could help me get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul walked over and sat down next to Jenny on the couch.<br>\r\n\"Hm. Well, how serious about this are you?\"<br>\r\n\"What's that suppossed to mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, let me rephrase that!\" Paul quickly cried, \"What I mean is, how hard do you want to go at this? We can go at any pace you want, of course. And if things start getting too hard, we can always tone the activities down a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny bit her lip. \"Hm... That's good to know. But still, the fitness test is in less than two months. And I've got a lot of catching up to do if I want to look as good as you.\" After a very brief pause, she added, \"I mean, as fit and in shape, of course!\"<br>\r\nPaul's eyes rose in slight surprise. \"Huh? As fit as me? You don't just want to lose what you need to to pass the test?\"</span></div></div>",

It had taken quite some doing - cooking had never come naturally to her - but Jenny had laid out quite a decent feast for herself. Her doughnut binges had given herself something of a sweet tooth recently, but she decided to start off with her other favorite food group - meat. Roasted ham (or whatever the pokemorph equivalent would be, sorry) and some dumplings, plenty of rich gravy...and that was just the beginning. She had plenty of warm bread, and had broken out some combusken cutlets, and so on. Jenny didn't wear her cop outfit around the house, naturally, but had changed into clothes much more casual than standard for her, all for the sake of this meal. Sweatpants would give her soft gut plenty of room to swell, as would the old blue T-shirt she had on. Jenny settled down in her chair, licked her lips, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny ate like she was processing a crime scene - methodically, taking each food item in turn carefully like a piece of evidence she studied with her tongue. She quickly realized that that would get her nowhere fast, however. She picked up the pace, her powerful canine jaw making short work of the tender, succulent meat. She worked her way through a plateful, through two and then three. It wasn't just about the food anymore. She could feel her stomach swelling, packing more food in. And soon enough, that food would be transformed into more rolls, more cushioning for her ample rear end...to her surprise, Jenny began to feel almost excited. Of course, Paul had been so kind recently...she was just excited about how he would react to this. Maybe there was something more to it, but Jenny at least didn't realize that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA truly astounding amount of food made its way into the growlithe's stomach. All that sitting around on the job had given her a slightly different skill set - she was patient enough to let her food go down a little, force a little more in, and so on. Tricking her stomach as such, Jenny got much more in than had she rushed it. The end result was a very bloated pokemorph. Her pudgy belly had a new firmness to it, she found when she stroked it, so stretched out it had become like a drum. Jenny wasn't sure what to do now....could she even manage dessert?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ellen tried to put a halt to her snacking, but half the time wasn't even aware of the food her hands were guiding into her mouth. There was no way Pauline would buy this little 'compulsion' of hers. She had to do something to break it. But what? Ellen was pondering this as she overheard the customers at a particularly nearby table, one ear perking up and homing in like a radar dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on honey, don't you want dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, no thanks, I couldn't eat another bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they have your favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun, they could serve it on a gold platter for all I care. If I'm stuffed, I'm stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis little conversation caused an epiphany in Ellen. She nearly squealed in excitement. Of course! The problem was that her constant grazing kept her at a comfortable level of fullness, but never full enough that she felt the need to stop. What she needed was to simply make more food seem so unappetizing to her that she'd soon break her little habit. Ellen kept her plan in mind right until her own lunch break, which naturally came sometime later than usual to account for the restaurant's lunchtime rush. The mere thought of how much she'd eat kept Ellen occupied enough that she stopped her constant munching. For the first time in what felt like weeks, she was actually decently hungry when she sat down for her meal. She had cooked herself a meal right off the restaurant's menu, which was what she was quite used to. A meatball sandwich, an entire plate of fries, of course one of their stew-of-the-day stews, and a lunch omelet to err on the side of caution. Such a mini-feast didn't even garner her any looks from the rest of the kitchen staff - really, Ellen wasn't alone in her eating habits, simply the worst offender. She dug in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ellen's surprise, she didn't have nearly the appetite she expected. Oh, sure, over the course of the average work day she might put away a few thousand calories' worth of food, but never much at once. She had never pushed her stomach's capacity. Still, she was determined. Eating a regular sized meal would just make her get back to snacking thirty minutes later. So she forced it all down. First the sandwich, which she truly enjoyed. She alternated with the stew and fries, and that she began to struggle with. She figured the stew would go down easy, giving her a more complete fullness, but it sat so heavy in her stomach. By the time she finished, she was eying the omelet with trepidation. Still, that was the point. To, for once in her life, not want to eat. So she began to cut up the omelet and cram it down, bite after bite. It nearly brought tears to her eyes. A couple of disturbed (and barely hidden) burps made things easier, but not for long. Ellen was getting some looks from the staff now, some put-off, others curious or even interested. Finally, with a clatter of knife and fork, Ellen finished the last of her meal. She sat back with a groan. It looked like half her fellow cooks were about to applaud her. Ellen just sat there and tried to comfort her bloated stomach, which was trying its best to churn with so much in it. She glanced at her watch. Only a few minutes before their lunch break was over. Ellen was not looking forward to getting up. But at least she could already see herself refusing her usual snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two weeks, Ellen soon learned that a big lunch wasn't enough. She started getting up earlier to give her time to eat a positively huge breakfast to tie her over to lunch. Her dinners started getting a lot bigger too, although that was less about work and more about her quickly-changing eating habits. By the end of two weeks, she's....</span></div></div>",

Her snacking habit had all but disappeared under the crushing amount of food she consumed at mealtimes... but in place of her snacking had come a few extra pounds. All of Ellen's pants were now poorly fitting, as her previous bubble butt had slowly swollen into a badonkadonk, eating up her panties and thongs and making pants extremely tight on her. Her small potbelly had grown a little bit more, and was a little wobbly whenever he moved around. Her breasts, decent to begin with, hadn't changed much, but had grown slightly- not quite a whole cupsize yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, are you, uh, Erin? No, that's not right, let me try again... Elena? Ellen! That's it, you're Ellen, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen turned slowly, and was shocked to see a towering Machamp morph towering over her, almost a whole foot taller then her! His sculpted muscles and chiseled abs were visible through his form-fitting muscle shirt, though not much could be said about his legs- they were long, and hidden behind a pair of sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm Ellen. Why? And who are you, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machamp morph grinned. \"My name is Edward. Edward Stone. Do you remember you're boss Paulina? She was transferred to the Stew Pot branch in Celadon. I'm her replacement. Anyways, a few employees have informed me that you have been prevented from snacking on the job, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... why...?\" asked Ellen, rather confused at where the conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can snack all you want now, as long as you aren't eating a customer's meals or snacking without working. That was all I wanted to say. If you need anything, come see me!\" said Edward as he turned on his heel and left Ellen alone.</span></div></div>",

The hand that grabbed them was rather portly-looking, with even the fingers thicker than they had been. Ellen smiled as she chewed, her double chin jostling with the motion. She still wasn't fully aware of all the snacks she took. Oh, she was typically better, but only at hiding it from her boss. Despite now packing away enough for a three-person family at each meal, Ellen had definitely not stopped her nearly constant intake of food. And it showed. She had graduated to the largest size uniform the Stew Pot had in stock, and even that was tight against her big, round belly. It was almost always too full to have a proper fold in it, more like a heavy balloon hanging from her. It was framed by now visible love handles situated atop a pair of hips that made Ellen fond of double doors and curse the narrower doorways of her home. Her bubble butt had become a full on badonkadonk, a booty she could've rested a pair of dinner plates on. Even her breasts got in on the action, full and jiggling D-cups that framed the top shelf of her belly nicely. Ellen was a bubbly person in body and personality now, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up people!\" Pauline called, entering the kitchen brusquely. She made Ellen jump, and wipe the grease from her chin as best she could with the back of her hand. That just made the fur on the back of her hand even greasier. She began to lick it surreptitiously as Pauline spoke to the hastily assembled staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard Cambela is on vacation, and guess which 'local flavor' he decided to check out?\" she asked. Several of the chefs groaned. Ellen looked around in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'm going to need a volunteer. Come on, let's be adults about this, before I make you draw straws.\" Pauline told them, hands on her hips. Ellen tentatively raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Ellen, it's settled then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I just wanted to know who's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter.\" Pauline said, walking over to her. \"You're it. And if I see so much as a stale fry in your mouth while working, we'll be serving him stuffed eevee instead.\" she ended with a sharp poke in Ellen's gut. It was probably meant to hurt, but Ellen had so much padding that it just made her jiggle. Ellen barely suppressed a giggle. Pauline turned away in disgust. Ellen looked around, finding looks of sorrow and condolences all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Leonard ca-whatever?\" she asked allowed. An older chef, a Zangoose whose fur was more gray than white, put an arm around her and patted her sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king of food critics, like Satan's the king of devils. Most critics want an authentic experience, but not him. He makes himself known, since no matter what you do, chances are he'll tear you apart. Restaurants live or die...mostly die...by his word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time, Ellen had shrunk herself down as much as she could. She let out a whimper, ears flat against her head and her tail plastered between her massive cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...he's on vacation, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.\" the zangoose let her go. \"So we'll - and I mean you - will be chewed out on his blog, facebook, and twitter instead of professionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He packs so much venom into 250 characters, it's an art form.\" the zangoose wandered off. Ellen gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order up!\" A waitress called. \"....from Cambela.\" Ellen took the order. She took a deep breath and got to work. Her binges had done more than just work on her figure. She had, for variety's sake, gotten to cooking massive amounts of every type of dish she could think of. Cambela's order for honey-roasted pig and a side of minced vegetables, even if they technically didn't serve any of that, was no problem. Ellen got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, all Ellen could do was pace. She had served her food, there was nothing to do but wait. The entire staff was nervous. Ellen feared the worst. Another chef, seeing her worry, handed her a plate of hash browns. Ellen took them thankfully and began to munch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How goes the - ah ha!\" Pauline burst in. Ellen froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellen! You pig! Can you not stop eating for one minute!\" Pauline stormed up to her. She had to reach her arm out as much as she could to waggle her finger in Ellen's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I oughta, I oughta-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-here is she?\" came an accented call, \"Whhere is ze chef zat prepared my meal?!\" a small, pear shaped Empoleon barged in. Pauline stepped aside, looked at him, and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be her!\" she said. Ellen wrung her hands and whimpered. The Empoleon, who was honest-to-goodness wearing a monocle, studied her up and down. He approached her, and then suddenly grabbed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madmoiselle.\" he said, kissing her hand, \"I never expected to find, of all things, cuisine in such a, how you say, a dump? Truly, you are a chef among chefs, as a king among kings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen, Pauline, and everyone else's jaws dropped. The empoleon kissed her hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...thank you.\" Ellen said, \"I aim to please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, such sweetness, as well! An exampleh to chefs everywhere!\" he pulled out a card. \"But my words, they have a double entendre, how you say, two meanings? I am exhhhausted with the world of a critic. I want to start my own restaurant, to show these simpletons how it is done. I want, no, need a chef such as yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ellen's jaw had been hanging before, it hit the floor now. She could only imagine what kind've restaurant this guy would run. She would be moving up in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" Pauline interrupted. \"I mean, you can't take my head chef from me, now can you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head, chef?\" Ellen asked in a squeak. Pauline nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Who else would get to design my menu?\" Pauline said with a wide, unnatural grin. Ellen hesitated, glancing from the empoleon to her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well I think I'll....\"</span></div></div>",

Pauline made a noise of disgust and stormed out of the kitchen. Ellen turned to the assembled kitchen staff with a huge grin on her face. A bitter-looking Aipom chef took off his hat and handed it out to her. He had been the head chef, albeit a hands-off one. Ellen took it and placed it between her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry people. I just wanted Pauline off my case. Come on, why'd we all get into cooking? The creativity, the fun of cooking, all the flavors! Let's work on a good menu, a fun menu.

A linoone with quite a gut and a pair to match, she had to shout to make her way over the din of the diner. Pauline had claimed to always want to put in a bar and TVs, and whether that was true or not, they had finally gotten the money to renovate as the restaurant had skyrocketed in popularity. Ellen had taught people how to make food fun again, while still delicious. A plate of nachos absolutely swimming in cheese, salsa and their own blend of spices. Perhaps the elaborate displays they put on with their arrangements of wings and onion rings went over most customer's heads, but there had to be some reason people kept overpaying for them. Pauline spent her days salivating over the money they were making these days, but the rest of the staff salivated over their own cooking, mostly Ellen's. She could make a grilled cheese sandwich taste like fine dining. Quality ingredients helped, unlike the yellow plastic most places called cheese, but Ellen just brought spirit back to the place. And it showed. Everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellen, my favorite chef!\" Pauline barged in, grabbing a spicy wing off the waitress' plate going out. The short Delcatty had finally tried some of Ellen's cooking after that incident with the critic, and shortly after mysterious, and increasingly massive orders for 'quality testing' made their way into the kitchen. The kitchen staff kept their smirks to themselves, especially when they themselves had to keep going for a larger uniform. Pauline had recently found a place that made XL, XXL, and XXXL (though that last one was just in anticipation of a fast-approaching future). But Pauline had definitely packed it on, unable to hide a blubbery little belly under her business outfit, and her ass was stretching her skirt so tight that people could sometimes tell what kind of panties she was wearing. She remained absolutely oblivious to these changes, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline, what's up!\" Ellen replied jovially, handing off a spatula to a cook. Ellen had done quite a lot of her own quality testing, and with Pauline no longer monitoring her snacks, the head-chef was almost never found without a plate of food in hand. She was huge, weighing in just under 300 at 289 pounds. Her gut took up more and more of her body, its dome starting just under her breasts and widening out until her waistline, merging with her love handles and rolls, and then tapering off as it rested against her tree trunk thighs. It wobbled and jiggled and bounced constantly, gaining her the moniker of the Jello chef. The only thing that drew more attention was her rack. Ellen was stuffing her tits in an EE cup now, a pair of hooters to make a porn star blush, not that she ever put them much use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to see how you're doing, first off. Need a longer lunch? Maybe a lounge? Anything?\" Pauline asked. Sure, the basis of her kindness was sheer greed, but it was kindness nonetheless. She had learned the lesson that she could get more flies with honey than vinegar. Ellen just laughed and slapped Pauline on the back. Pauline nearly flew out of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well.\" Ellen said, rubbing the side of her expansive gut. Pauline eyed it warily, but gave it a smile. She was still uncomfortable around Ellen, whatever she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen, we're making money hand over fist here.\" she said. \"I gotta hand it to you, you know what you're doing. How you're not eating us out of business I'll never guessed.\" Ellen just laughed at her quip. Pauline looked surprised, and chuckled along awkwardly, deciding she had meant that as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But listen, that's given me an idea.

Pauline just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been putting away money for years, but never thought it'd happen. I want to make a name for this place. I've found some decent space in the downtown area for a second restaurant. I can only imagine the crowds.

I need someone who knows how to run a restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Pauline, I only run the kitchen!\" Ellen said. A couple of chefs had overheard the exchange, and a crowd was quickly gathering to watch. Pauline shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle most of the finances from home office, and I'll send over a couple of the staff from here to help you get things running. Come on, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen hesitated, and rubbed her belly, a habit she had when she was thinking. \"Will I still get free reign of the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I could keep you away. You'd also get a share in the company, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ellen mulled it over. Cooking was what she was into. Not business management. But she had heard of all the great chefs opening their own restaurants, and Pauline made it sound like she wouldn't have to do it all. She'd get to design the whole place...finally, no more way-too-small bathroom stalls or gut-scrunching booths. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll give it a try.\" she said. Pauline slapped her on the back. It sent Ellen jiggling wildly, especially her breasts. She did her best to stop it, even if that meant essentially fondling herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she muttered. Pauline wasn't concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Pick a couple of the staff, I'm thinking another chef and a waiter to train the others. I'll send over my accountant on opening day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Great.\" Ellen said, wringing her hands.

Ellen, Sherry, and Markus decided it would be best to tour the new restaurant and get used to the surroundings. \"Wow, this place looks the same, but feels so different. This is going to be hard to get used to.\" Sherry was right, it did feel different. Of course she was also right about it looking the same as well. The tables and booths were spaced to fit someone Ellen's size, and possibly a bit more. The miltank girl started looking through the different rooms, probably trying to get used to the surroundings. \"Hey Markus come look at the kitchen! It's all shiny and new looking!\" She poked her head out of the door and started motioning for the nidoking to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen followed after the two to have a look of her own. It seemed Pauline chose a different approach to the decorations, everything was more colorful than the original Stew Pot. Looking a bit mesmerized at the room, Ellen said, \"Wow it DOES look brighter! I wonder if Pauline personally chose the decorations. She definitely took our weight into consideration for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the past week Ellen had grown a bit more though only a little. The stress from having to take lessons on how to run a restaurant had made her eat more than usual. She now weighed in at 293, again, not a big change. Even so her belly still looked larger than normal, and seemed to put a bit more strain on her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of time, the two leave the kitchen to explore the rest of the place. \"This is gonna be a hard start. You'll need to employ some more people, and hopefully sooner rather than later.\" The nidoking had stated what Ellen was just thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I know, and I'll get started on an employee search soon. Nobody ever said we'd have an easy start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you probably need help?

It had been a week since Pauline's proposition, and Ellen now stood at the front of the all-new downtown Stew Pot. She had left most of the design to Pauline, who knew funny things like traffic logistics and optimal waiter pathways, but had definitely added her own touch here and there. The booths were wide enough to accommodate someone of her size or larger by way of being adjustable, slightly. The bathrooms had been expanded significantly beyond standard, which Pauline had agreed to anyway in anticipation of the restaurant being packed. The color scheme was also a little brighter, yellow wallpaper in between dark wood panels, and soft lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was actually even bigger than a week ago, if not by much. But she had somehow managed to find a way to cram even more food into her over the course of the day. Stress demanded she keep eating late at night as she took a crash course in employee management and the like. She weighed in at 296 pounds now, nearly ten more pounds. It mostly went to her heavy gut, now so taut against her uniform that her sunken bellybutton was visible. Ellen's chubby faced pouted with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her stood a surprisingly refined looking male gloom. His lips were always moist and his eyelids droopy, but he held himself erect and looked so neatly-kept one would expect to see him serving wine as violinists played in the background, not serving buffalo wings to a table of football fans watching the game. He took a deep breath that was not quite a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline has chosen the most important aspect first. Good food makes the customers forgive. The rest...I'm sure that if you cannot handle it, something else will work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to screw up, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not expect much. Life is full of surprises. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second. Let me check with Abagail.\" Ellen replied. She wobbled her way into the kitchen, opening the doors simply by walking into them with her belly. It was useful to her like that. She found a tiny poochyena girl fretting about the stoves, oval glasses nearly falling off as she constantly bent over and back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gas is fine, the vent's working, oh dear, where did the spatulas go...\" she mumbled to herself. Ellen smiled to herself. She approached Abagail as the chef bent over to check some cupboard or other. To say Abagail was tiny was not quite true. Heightwise, she was petite, only 4'11'', more typical for an unevolved morph. But Ellen had an eyeful of Abagail's broad back end as she bent over. It was too big for her uniform, showing she had recently fallen plague to that rapid gain that caught so many of the chefs off guard. Her pot belly, only just reaching over her waistband, creased when she was bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abagail, everything's fine.\" Ellen said. The poochyena jumped, banging her head against the counter. She groaned and sat on the floor. Ellen winced and bent down. She had to spread her legs to let her belly fit, and the motion made several seams creak. She put a hand over Abagail's head where the young woman had started rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Don't worry so much. We sorted it all ourselves, remember? Besides, we haven't opened yet.\" Ellen told her. Truthfully, this was part of why she chose Abagail. Despite her constant fretting, or perhaps because of it, Abagail never lost track of everything. She might complain and worry, but she always knew exactly how much of this or that they had left, and where to find it. She had quite a head for orders too, which the waiters back at the stew pot had learned to appreciate, as even if they screwed up an order somehow Abagail had a knack for seeing through it. The girl was also sweet as a peach, which helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Abagail replied, ears drooping. \"It's...I just never imagined...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I feel.\" Ellen said with a laugh. \"Here we go, up you go.\" she took Abagail by the arms and helped her up. Unfortunately, not quite used to her bulk, she drew Abagail into her soft belly by accident. Abagail's face was briefly pressed into Ellen's soft frame. Ellen just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Ellen replied. She reached over and ruffled Abagail's messy black hair. They'd put hairnets on when the cooking started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we start at noon. We'll probably be hiring more in the next couple days, but Pauline wants to review anyone who applies first. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea. I think.\" Abagail replied, looking up at Ellen with a timid smile. Ellen laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl. You'll see, it'll be fine!\"</span></div></div>",

Like Pauline had expected, a second Stew Pot right in the heart of downtown had hit it off greatly. They already had a full time bartender and another apprentice, as people were often using this place as a relaxed bar. Still, they got quite a few coming in for meals, mostly college students from a local community college in the inner city. It meant Ellen was cooking more pizza these days than everything else combined, but she got tons of compliments from college kids shocked to find that pizza crust didn't have to taste like cardboard, or that tomato sauce wasn't the same as ketchup. Still, it took a lot to keep this place going, and they had had to hire quickly, including a couple of more inexperienced chefs that drove Ellen and Abagail ragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat probably explained why the Abagail who approached Ellen now was a different Abagail from a couple days ago. She had bags under her eyes, an impressive feat given how dark furred she was. She look worn, slightly puffy arms limp at her side. A hairnet dangled in one hand, and her unruly black hair now threatened to block her eyesight. Ellen gave her a sympathetic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....Ellen, I don't think I can do it.\" Abagail sputtered out. \"I just....this isn't like the old Stew Pot. We had 8 chefs. I had to take a couple orders a hour. Now....they, they can't keep up. I have to help them. I can't keep up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pauline understaffed us, I know.\" Ellen replied. \"But it'll get better, Abagail. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but how do you even manage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...mostly with food, really.\" Ellen replied, patting her big round gut. Abagail blushed and rubbed her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really a good idea?\" she asked. Ellen shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really having any trouble. I'd say it's a small price to pay for some comfort, but hey, the 'price' is a different kind of comfort, y'know?\" she patted her side this time, referring to her bubble butt. Abagail looked like she was going to burn through the fur on her cheeks. She looked down at herself and put a hand on her pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm doing some of that myself. But...I don't know, I guess it doesn't work for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Ellen pursed her lips. \"Listen, I know just what you need. Heck, I could use it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Abagail asked. Ellen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need...\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, I'm basically the boss, remember? I say we're taking the rest of the day off. Now lets go, I called a cab. Ooh goody, it's already here.\" Ellen said as she headed outside. She had changed out of her chef's apron into a giant blue sweater to deal with the fall chill. Her backside was stuffed into the fattest pair of skinny jeans Abagail had ever seen. All around, from her muffin top to the cleavage pouring out of her sweater's neck hole, Ellen was clearly stuffed into far too small an outfit. Abagail's own was looking a bit tight as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen held the door open, and Abagail muttered her thanks and got in. She turned around right as it suddenly went darker inside the cab. Ellen's frame blocked out the doorway. Her ass came in first, and for a moment Abagail panicked, afraid she was about to be crushed as it inched in on her. Moving to the far side, however, kept her from being sat on as Ellen maneuvered the rest of her body in. Abagail was right against the door, Ellen taking up over half the backseat. She fidgeted with the seatbelt, only just getting it to reach by getting the shoulder strap in her cleavage and the waistband partially underneath her gut. She grinned over at Abagail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should've called for a tow truck. Alright mac, to 53rd and 8th.\" she called the last part to the driver. Abagail was staring in awe at the way Ellen filled so much of the cab, her bottom actually pressed up against the poochyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...doesn't bother you?\" Abagail finally asked. Ellen hesitated, then shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things are annoying. Like I'm probably going to have to find a bigger home soon. But mostly, it's just fun being so big and squishy. Besides, if it means I get to cook and eat to my heart's content, why not?\" she patted her gut. \"I feel better than ever, even with the stress.\" Abagail nodded silently, her eyes still on Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly arrived at the spa. Ellen insisted on paying the cab fair. Inside the spa they were greeted with soft music and the aroma of flowers. Ellen took a deep breathe and waddled over to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel better already.\" she told Abagail. Abagail nodded. Ellen picked up a little sign on top of the receptionist's desk and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two silver packages sounds about right. Access to the sauna, a couple massages....not sure about the mud bath, but they have a jacuzzi. Yea, we'll take those.\" she told the receptionist. After paying, Ellen turned to Abagail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not picky. Whatever sounds good to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then...let's go...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Right this way, ladies.\" A professional-looking young pontya guided them after Abagail had asked for the sauna. The place was pretty quiet, but from half open doors here and there they got to see other morphs, mostly female, receiving massages, doing yoga, or lounging in baths. They were brought firstly to a change room, handed towels, and directed what to do with their clothes. Abagail fidgeted once the girl left. Ellen chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brings back bad memories of the old high school locker room, doesn't it? Okay, you'll get your privacy.\" she teased, waddling off around a corner. Abagail didn't have time to object, even if she really was relieved by the gesture. So she undressed quickly and wrapped a towel around her portly frame, dashing next door to the sauna. It was already a bit steamy, but it was empty. Abagail took a seat on the wooden bench, looked around and found a water pail, and carefully poured it over the central hot rocks to give a bit more steam. Then she heard the door open. And her eyes nearly fell from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaking hand-towels is what these are.\" Ellen muttered. The gargantuan woman was struggling to deal with the towel, which was pitifully small around her. She just managed to get it around her breasts, having to actually knot it since there wasn't enough to tuck in. That still squeezed her breasts together a little. But the towel in no way could reach down her gut. It barely got to her hips in the back. Her privacy was kept, but not by much, by her own wobbling gut. She was a mass of soft brown fur, that huge orb easily the central point. Abagail could only stare, entranced, since free of it's confined Ellen's belly wobbled with every slight motion, bouncing along to her steps. At one point, Ellen turned around, actually testing the bench first before sitting. This let Abagail see an ass just short of divinity. Two giant, globular cheeks, easily wide enough to fill two chairs together, perky despite their size and crowding her plump tail. Ellen turned back around and sat on the bench, which groaned but held. She spread her legs to let her belly ooze into the gap. She muttered to herself, toying with the towel, and then paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just us...you don't mind, right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen hadn't waited for an answer. She undid the towel and tossed it aside. Abagail was in awe. Two of the most perfect knockers she had ever seen were staring her in the face, chocolate nipples visible past her coat. They were heavy orbs that were just a hair's breadth away from touching her belly shelf, but only due to their immense proportions, not any sort of sag. Ellen sighed and sunk down. Another chin appeared, and it overall looked a little like she was sinking into her fat. Ellen glanced over at Abagail and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loosen up, girl. Ditch the towel, it feels great.\"</span></div></div>",

Instead Ellen was fiddling with the coals. Abagail untucked her towel and spread it aside. She was a pear, that much was clear, but not too drastically. Decent breasts for a girl her size, a prominent curve of a belly, and wide hips that couldn't hide a well-padded backside. Abagail just managed to breathe a sigh of relief before Ellen spoke, surprising her into a yip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, girl. Oh, come on, relax.\" Ellen said with a laugh. \"You've got nothing to worry about, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if someone comes in?\" Abagail asked, already regretting her desicion. Ellen shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they make you uncomfortable, towel up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, they'll already know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'm fat.\" Abagail blurted. Ellen blinked at her, and then started bawling in laughter. It took her a moment to calm down before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby, if they even notice you past me, I'll be surprised. Beisdes, so what? A fat chef is a happy chef, trust me.\" she rubbed her gut and let out a happy sigh, almost a murr. She continued to stroke it long after she stopped talking. Abagail watched her, entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...really like it, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. it's not just the eating, I guess.\" Ellen said, her eyes barely open. \"It feels pretty darn good. I can barely believe how much of me there is. It's kinda exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't feel like that.\" Abagail said, prodding her belly. Ellen chuckled, and this time seeing her boobs jostle about just made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have enough. I feel like I'm sitting on a throne, right here. It's like nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then, Ellen, c-could you....\"</span></div></div>",

Ellen was taken aback, but took this calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're doing a half-decent job yourself, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but not like you. You're bigger every day! I wish I could be like that, and so happy too....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more the mindset, y'know....but, hmm, you have a point. It'd be nice to have an eating buddy, honestly. I can do that, it'd even be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much Ellen!\" Abagail said. She got up, and after a short pause, went over and hugged Ellen. Well, kind've, basically just touching Ellen's body with hers lightly, her arms not even against her. Ellen chuckled, reached around, and grabbed Abagail. She squeezed Abagail against her. Ellen couldn't reach all the way around since Abagail was kept away by their combined bulk, but she still managed to press the little woman into her belly. Abagail responded by clinging to Ellen's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soft.\" she said. Ellen murmured agreement. She tried her best to press in Abagail tighter. Abagail was lifted off the ground, and ended up sitting on Ellen's knees, pretty much the only part of Ellen's lap not covered by her belly. Abagail nuzzled against her, basically wrapped around Ellen's bellly. The two murmured and moaned for a few minutes. Then Ellen shivered. Abagail got off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, need more heat.\" Ellen said. \"You'd think it'd be more insulating, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right.\" Abagail said. Neither girl looked the other in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey. How about a meal?\" Ellen offered after a silent moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea. Might as well get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spa naturally had a small snack bar, serving prewrapped sandwiches and the like. Poor fair for a couple of top-notch chefs. It didn't stop Ellen from wolfing down a dozen at a lunch table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule number one. You're not done eating until you feel like it. If you want food, eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems kinda...hedonistic, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Eh, maybe. But it's not that bad. And it is excess, so what'd you expect? It's freeing. Try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but would you still want food if you weren't full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yea, I guess....oh, I get you. Okay.\" Abagail went back for more. Ellen grinned, watching the little poocheyna's bum wobble as she walked towards the snack bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week, the girls relationship blossomed. Ellen would put a plate in front of Abagail at work, and once Abagail got over her confusion, she figured out that it was for her to munch as she worked. When it was empty, Ellen would put another up. A few days after that began, Ellen basically started taken Abagail home with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for dessert?\" Ellen asked, waddling into her apartment's living room. Her impressive bulk hadn't changed much. On the sofa, a rounder poocheyna sat nursing a nearly spherical belly. Abagail was beginning to really plump up. Her shirt sleeves were struggling against meaty arms, and the rest of her shirt was having to contend with her breasts and her belly. It was almost always stuffed, gaining a spherical quality, and rested against her lap. She was starting to turn into a real butterball, but wasn't there yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost...\" Abagail said with a groan. \"I'm packed full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, you really out did yourself.\" Ellen said. She sat down on the rest of the sofa. Her bulk naturally made the sofa sink, forcing Abagail to lean towards her. Abagail let herself, and 'fell' against Ellen's soft side. Ellen chuckled, and put her arm around Abagail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so stressed anymore, eh?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Abagail said, eyes closed. Ellen smiled. As much as she enjoyed the eating, these moments in between the courses were getting better as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week at work...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Psst, I'm making another week or so pass between chapters for the heck of it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's up for seconds?\" A cheery skitty waitress asked before her table. She, like all the staff here in the second Stew Pot, was a plump one, with particularly well defined love handles framing her pot belly and a well developed set of breasts to crown it. Her uniform was skin-tight against her body, explaining why it took her male customers a moment to register that she had spoken. This table had four college kids, two guys and two girls, and at a glance the lightest one was a Marill girl that had to weigh at least 200 pounds. And this was the normal scene at the stew pot, as was the entire table's insistence for another full round of meals before they even started with dessert. The skitty girl walked away with her notepad filled, aware that the bubble-butt she sported in far too tight a skirt was guaranteeing her an extra $10 on their tip. She handed off her order to the kitchen and went off, spying a table needing another pitcher of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the kitchen, cooks worked at an organized but furious pace. Plate after plate literally piled high with food made it's way from the kitchen like a streamlined factory system. Critics were raving about the Stew Pot, whose proportions far outclassed any other restaurant, even considering the fact that everything was well overpriced. And the quality....by this point, Ellen had turn every chef under her into a master of casual dining. And it showed. The only thing that slowed down production once and a while was a pair of bellies bumping together as a chef turned around, not used to their girth. An even mix of male and female morphs, the kitchen looked more crowded than it really was given how much room each one took up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright people, how are we doing?\" Ellen asked, returning to the kitchen from her lunch break. She got away with a couple lunches by taking one early and one late, so she could keep the kitchen going through all other lunch shifts. People instinctively made room for her, because even with the width of space in the kitchen originally designed for her bulk, now that there were a dozen bulky frames around Ellen didn't have room to squeeze by. Ellen's body was starting to round out. Previously belly heavy to the extent that she was nearly longer than she was wide, fat had piled on to her sides, so that her belly seemed one giant glob of fat that had melted around her, surrounding her completely with the thick coating on her back as well. It was still very round, that was to be sure, wobbling and bouncing against her monstrous thighs. Ellen's arms had also puffed up considerably as weight continued to pile on top, but few people noticed her arms considering their proximity to her breasts. Ellen, not one for modesty, had by necessity stopped wearing bras half the time, as it was too expensive to keep replacing a wardrobe full of them, meaning she got by on a couple. Her few specialty G-cup bras were reserved for important occasions; otherwise, the thickness of her outfit kept anything from showing through too much. If not for how bouncy it was, Ellen could have used her ass as an end table, as it could have easily held a couple plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurveying the organized chaos, she could see things were running smoothly. Her chefs always had at least two plates in front of them - one, the meal they were preparing, the other, the meal they were eating. A young male Buizel looked ready to burst out of his uniform, with a rotund belly that hadn't been there just two weeks before. A pidgey girl tried to surreptitiously dig a wedgie out from ass cheeks like bowling balls. Ellen just grinned to herself. She was among her own people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetheart.\" Ellen said, coming up behind one short cook. The chef jumped, sending out a resounding 'thump' with her landing and wobbling. But the face turning to see her was set in a wide grin. Abagail was one of the weightier chefs around. As if knowing how short she was, i.e. how little room she had, her body had decided to store the majority of the weight out of the weigh, behind her, giving her a giant bubble but that crowded her thickened tail and actually rested against the backs of her legs. But that wasn't to say the rest of her was thin. She had a respectable apron of fat reaching down into her lap even when standing, much more sizable breasts pushed too close together by her bra, forming a delightful canyon of cleavage visible even when fully clothed. And she had a very round face, second chin and all. Ellen stroked her mane of hair lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you forget about tonight.\" she said deviously. Abagail's tail thumped against her own rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't.\" she said. There was a gleam in her eyes that hadn't been there before. It was hidden, and she still usually appeared bashful, but there was a hunger in Abagail's eyes that had nothing to do with food. No, neither of them would be forgetting tonight.</span></div></div>",

The thought of Ellen eating the whole thing clean crossed Abagail's mind, which made her smile. With how much her sort-of boss ate throughout the day, it sure seemed possible. In fact, Ellen already seemed to be making a head start as she gathered up six of the sandwiches in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Didn't you just say you'd hit it up later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen was already unwrapping one of them as she answered, \"Yeah, but I need a little snack now to tide myself over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Six sandwiches is a little snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first sandwich was already devoured. \"It is when you're my size.

Then again, it might have simply been because Ellen was packing them away like no tomorrow. It kind of made her feel a bit peckish herself, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You should get something too. Massages take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" The Poochyena blinked and looked over to the snack bar, then back to Ellen, then the snack bar again. After a moment, she nodded and strolled over. She briefly wondered if she could eat half a dozen sandwiches as well. After glancing down at her gut, noticeable through her shirt, she convinced her self she could and took her own half-dozen. She turned to see Ellen grinning at her, the last of the Eevee's sandwiches already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you they were small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, it's not really that, but I guess it's part of it.\" Ellen raised an eyebrow. Abagail shifted her weight from one leg to the other. \"What I mean is, um, since you handle stress better than me, I thought it might help to try and, u-uh, try and copy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One side of Ellen's mouth curled upwards. \"You know how fat you'll get if you do that, right? Or is that the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail blushed and stared at the ground. \"Y-y-you, uh, you did say you felt better than ever. I, I was just thinking maybe I could... Or, um, I would...possibly...maybe... U-um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She flinched when she suddenly felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up to see Ellen smiling reassuringly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you think it'll work, give it a shot. I bet if anyone besides me can make it work, you can. You can make anything work, Abby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Again with that nickname...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail smiled back. \"Thanks, Ellen.\" And with that, she set to eating her sandwiches. While she lacked the same voracity as her flabby friend, she still downed them faster than most would, though there was some obvious restraint. She blushed when she looked up to see Ellen's approving smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like you've got the snacking part down pretty good. Like the way you eat, by the way. It's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Poochyena blushed harder, and her tail began wagging of its own accord. \"T-thanks,\" she mumbled. \"So, uh, how much do you usually eat for your meals? Y-you know, for a frame of reference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen's face grew serious. \"More than you can handle. You've seen my lunches, haven't you? They're <i>huge</i> compared to what normal folks eat. A decent meal to me is a feast to them. It's like...\" She rubbed her gut, eyes drifting over to the snack bar. \"It's like if I ate everything on that bar for lunch. That would cover only about half my usual, maybe even less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail's eyes widened and her ears folded back. \"How, how do you <i>live</i> with that kind of appetite?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Eevee gestured to the vast expanse of fat her body carried. \"By indulging it, obviously. Problem is, it's a pretty pricey way to live, and it only gets worse the bigger you get. I would've had to cut back a while ago if I didn't get paid as much I do. Plus there's the space issue I told you about earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail could only nod and bite her lip. Evidently, this undertaking had much weight in more than the literal sense. Was such a spur-of-the-moment plan really going to help alleviate her stress? Maybe it was best to reconsider...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But hey, it's not like you have to get as big as me. Like I said, you can make anything work, Abby, and I do mean anything. So if you want to get fat, I know you'll do just fine. Heck, I'll even help out, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That perked her right up. \"Really?! You'd do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen nodded, and her smile returned. \"To be honest, I kind of like the idea of having a friend gain weight with me. We could binge and go on food runs together. You'll have to cover your share of the food, though. I can only pay for so much by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course!\" Abagail was positively beaming. \"If there's anyone who can help me power through all this, it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a chuckle, Ellen pat her on the back and said, \"Alright, we can work out the details when we hit up the sauna. Now come on, let's go find those massage rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two managed to find their way without trouble, and were greeted by a pair of masseuses, both of them Dragonairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah,\" said one of them, \"you two must be the Eevee and Poochyena we were informed to wait for. My name is Elaine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I am Irene,\" stated the other. \"We will be your personal masseuses for today. And before you ask: yes, we are twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen chuckled and shook Elaine's hand. Turning to Abagail, she said, \"Well, see you when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You too,\" the Poochyena responded. She turned to Irene. \"I guess we'll be getting started now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course. Please follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>One heavenly massage later...</b></i></span></div></div>",

The Dragonair twins exchanged knowing glances and smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you want,\" Elaine began, \"we can guide you to your next desired destination while you regain your mental faculties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen's only response was to moan and grin dazedly at the ceiling. Abagail's was much the same. Elaine cocked an eyebrow and turned to Irene, who shrugged in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We will assume that means 'yes',\" Irene said. \"Where would you like to head next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sssaaaaauuuunnaaaa...\" Ellen moaned, her gaze still fixed on the ceiling. Abagail hummed in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The masseuses smirked. \"Of course,\" said Elaine. \"And given your (ahem!) satisfaction with your massages, we're certain our sauna facilities will be to your liking as well. Now then, if you two would please follow us, we'll show you to the changing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully, it didn't take long for the bliss to wear off, so the Dragonairs had no trouble getting Ellen and Abagail to follow them. Once they were at the changing room, the twins informed them they would find a set of towels in the lockers they would be assigned to, then left after promising to return with locker keys. Abagail took a moment to admire the place. The lockers had a wood finish colored a light tan. They used lock-and-key instead of the digital keypads most spas used nowadays. Low-tech, but still effective. The tiled floor was more of a soft peach. Maybe not the best complement to the lockers, but it wasn't a strain on the eyes either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not the most spacious locker room, is it?\" Ellen muttered as she scanned the room. \"Oh well, it's not like I'm the standard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail just nodded, though she wasn't sure if Ellen was even looking at her. They stood around awkwardly for a couple minutes before the Dragonair twins returned with their keys. 23 for Ellen, 24 for Abagail. The twins left again, and the two found their lockers over on the right wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm guessing you'll want to change in private, right?\" Ellen asked as she opened her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail blushed and looked down at her feet, slightly obscured by the swell of her belly. \"Um, y-yeah. See you in the sauna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure thing.\" The Eevee scowled at the stack of towels inside. \"Seriously?\" she muttered. \"They expect these dinky things to cover me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before thoughts of Ellen failing to cover herself with tiny towels could invade her mind, Abagail quickly opened her own locker, snatched the towels, and bolted over to the showers. She then waited for her breathing to return to normal and her blush to die down. After that, she slowly peeled her clothes off, starting with her shirt and working her way down before removing her bra and panties last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Poochyena's body was a mid-to-bottom-heavy, more mid than bottom. Beyond her average breasts was a round belly just beginning to sag. Her butt, while a step above her breasts, was still rather average overall, as were her hips. Everything had a distinctly pudgy quality to it, but she lacked fat folds and what curves she had were meager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then again, anything looked meager next to Ellen. She was a true paragon of massiveness, and seemed to become more of one with each passing day. The Eevee's stomach dominated her body and demanded the most attention, but overlooking her bust and rear was an impossible feat. It was nothing short of a miracle she could find any clothes that fit at all. And not just the size was impressive, but the way she managed to carry it all, both literally and figuratively. Not once did Abagail ever see her falter on those massive tree trunk legs of hers or get winded by her mighty bulk. Maybe she did a little exercise on the side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But more impressively than that was how natural Ellen made it all look. Cellulite was like a foreign concept to her, with only her love handles doing anything to interrupt her body's curvature, and all those did were add to the effect rather than detract. The cute, plump Eevee of a few weeks had transformed into a magnificent goddess of corpulence who--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Wait, where am I going with this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking her head, Abagail realized she was still standing naked in the shower stall and hastily wrapped the average-sized towels around herself. She made her way back  to her locker, peeking around the corner to see if Ellen was still there. To her relief, she wasn't. The Poochyena stuffed her clothes and remaining towels in. The largest towel was a bit much for her, but it didn't seem adequate for Ellen. In that case, how much could it cover...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Barely enough, as it turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail stopped dead in her tracks the moment she laid eyes on Ellen. Her ample butt dominated most of the bench she sat on, but that detail barely registered compared to how little the Eevee's towel managed to cover. It was draped over her like a blanket, and the only modesty it granted was about half of each nipple. Ellen tried turning it around horizontally and got better results. Her breasts and part of her belly were concealed, but her lower half was still exposed. Thankfully, the gargantuan orb of flesh kept her privates hidden from sight. She shrugged and leaned back, spreading her legs to give her belly room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And this is the biggest one they've got,\" she muttered to herself before looking over to the door. \"Oh, there you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This shouldn't have shocked her so much, Abagail knew that. Even so, seeing so much exposed fur on one person was...well, it was an experience her vocabulary couldn't properly describe. She just stood in the door way, her mind desperately scrambling to comprehend the vast amount of unclothed woman sitting before her as well as her reaction to said sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey.\" Ellen cocked her head to one said. For some reason, Abagail did the same. \"Uh, you alright there, Abby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Poochyena blinked. \"Uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon, Abby, have a seat already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah...\" Abagail slowly moved to a different bench and sat down. \"Abby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen gave her a quizzical look. \"Yeah, that's what I've been calling you. Why, does it bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail blinked once. Then twice. Then several more times. Then she shook her head rapidly. \"U-um, uh, n-no, no! Not at all! Sorry! I guess I just, I just... Well...\"<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She fidgeted a little. Her eyes were glued to the floor. \"I don't know. My reaction, I guess. I know you're big, but seeing you n-n-naked is... It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Totally different from seeing me in clothes that hardly fit?\" Ellen chuckled. \"But really, does it bother you that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail shook her head again. \"It's not that. You...\" She took a deep breath and forced herself to look at the massive Eevee. \"You amaze me, Ellen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen didn't respond for a minute. She just stared back, her mouth trying to form words that wouldn't come. Finally, she asked, \"Amaze you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail nodded, a blush forming on her cheeks. It took a minute to decide where she wanted to start. \"You handle everything so well. The Stew Pot, the stress, your weight... Everything. And when Pauline made you boss of the new branch, you never stopped being nice. Sure, you've been acting a <i>little</i> different, but you're in charge now, so you're just being a nice boss instead of a nice coworker. And you always know how to calm me down. How do you do that? How do you stay so calm about everything? I'd probably be freaking out about how fat I was getting if I were in your position, but you just take it so well and make it look so good and, and comforting... And you're one of the most amazing people I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silence fell between the two, and Abagail looked back to the floor. She could hear her heart pounding away in her chest. Clenching her hands into fists, she slowed her breathing and closed her eyes. Her mind was in a tizzy thanks to her declaration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Abby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A second's delay, then she opened her eyes and met Ellen's. The Eevee smiled warmly.</span></div></div>",

She thought she saw hints of a blush on Ellen's cheeks, but wrote it off as a trick of the eye. Whatever could possibly break through Ellen's unflappable composure and make her blush? There was no way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two of them sat in silence for a while. There was no scent, but Abagail deeply inhaled the air anyway. She had almost forgotten what it felt like to truly relax. The massage left her feeling loose, if a bit disoriented from just how good it was. This felt like everything was easing back into place. Maybe now she wouldn't fret so much over every last thing at work. Well, she probably would, but at least she wouldn't be as stressed out over everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen most likely felt the same, Abagail thought. It was hard to imagine, but Ellen herself did admit she got stressed too. She just handled it so much better, and got such great results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Wait, what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail blinked. Apparently, she'd been staring at Ellen for some time. And judging by the grin, Ellen had noticed. It practically felt like Abagail's whole face had caught fire. She stammered out an apology and covered her face and despite realizing the futility of her gesture. That got a laugh out of Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, just relax already! You're hardly the first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail winced and tried to curl up into a ball. \"That doesn't make it any less rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen laughed again. \"Maybe! But at least you weren't being judgmental!\" In a calmer voice, she added, \"If anything, you seemed a little...appreciative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A confused squeak escaped Abagail's lips. She forced herself to pull her hands away. Ellen was still smiling. And blushing? No, she couldn't be. Could she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"S-So anyway,\" Abagail said, \"if you don't mind my asking, what are having for dinner tonight?\" She inwardly cringed at the obvious panic in her voice. Why, oh why can't she ever calm down around her boss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ellen stroked her belly and hummed thoughtfully. \"That's a good question. I usually just whip up whatever random stuff I find, to be honest. Why? Got anything in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no! No!

'Cause I'll make whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And once again, Abagail's cheeks were set aflame. \"It doesn't matter to me, really! I know I'll love whatever you end up making! You're the best cook I've ever met, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Why did I add that last part?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This time she was sure she didn't imagine Ellen blushing. She gave Abagail a bashful look. \"Aw, thanks Abby. And you're the sweetest girl I've ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The resulting rush of blood to Abagail's cheeks very nearly knocked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, um, how much of this am I supposed to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They went straight home after the spa. Ellen's home. It was a one-story of average size. Nothing about it really screamed extravagant; the old-looking furniture and decorations suggested most of her things were hand-me-downs courtesy of her parents. This wasn't a bad thing, as it gave the place a more homey feel that made it easier to get comfortable. At least, that's how Abagail felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only exception was the dining room which, according to Ellen, was the biggest room in the house. The dining table was considerably large, and it looked pretty new. At least, that was impression Abagail got before Ellen started setting all the food. She had started preparing everything as soon as they got back. Abagail waited as patiently as she could, but all the delicious aroma's were giving her self-restraint quite the workout. She managed to hold out, though. Barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To be fair, it was all mouth-watering. From simple foods like mac &amp; cheese and grilled sausage, to more elaborate foods like chicken salad and lasagna (store-bought in the latter's case), dinner was a real hodgepodge of a feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As much as you want,\" Ellen said as she set down a pot of chili. The apron she wore had a multitude of stains and hugged her body tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In other words, as much as I can.\" Abagail gulped. Surely she wouldn't have to wait too much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the idea.\" Ellen pulled a couple of plates out from a nearby cabinet. \"I know it seems like a lot, but don't forget most of this is for me.\" With a wink, she placed a plate down in front of Abagail and added, \"Just do your best and I'll take care of any leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail warily eyed a giant pot of pasta and its accompanying saucepans of tomato and Alfredo sauce. They alone were probably enough to stuff her till she was fit to burst. \"All this? Even with my help? I knew you were a big eater, but...\" Words failed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup.\" Ellen, having set the plates, went to get them silverware. \"A word of advice: get yourself into the habit of eating all day. Once you're used to that, go back to three meals a day. I guarantee you'll be eating feast's worth for each meal.\" She set Abagail's silverware. \"Plus, each one's gonna get bigger than the last. And if you ever hit my point, you'll go back to snacking between meals, and I'm not talking about a small order of fries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took a moment for Abagail to process what she just heard. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Mostly because she found it really hard to drag her attention away from Ellen's body.</span> \"So... Wait.\" She let out a small gasp. \"That means you're always hungry <i>and</i> always stuffed at the same time?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pretty much.\" Ellen hung her apron on a hangar next to the oven. \"I know it sounds crazy, but... Well, you'll only need to worry about that if you ever reach my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail hummed thoughtfully. It sounded like a lofty goal, but with Ellen's guidance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well?\" Ellen said. She sat right next to Abagail. \"Shall we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abagail nodded and bit her lip. So many options, and no idea where to start. Deciding it best to start small, she grabbed three thick slices of garlic bread from the basket next to the broccoli and got to work.</span></div></div>",

The third... just too self-centered.

In the midst of her eating she had to unbutton her jeans to allow for more room, her shirt, which had just barely covered her belly rose up a few inches, exposing mid-drift and was visibly tighter. \"I havn't had a chance to eat like that in a long while Danis, thank you!\" She said as she rubbed her satiated belly, purring a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if your up for it, we could hang out for a bit and watch a movie\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually\", Nerissa replied, blushing slightly, \"is there any more food left? I'm still kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanis's jaw nearly dropped. <i> \"She's already eaten that much and she's still hungry?!\"</i> he thought, then, shaking his head as if to clear his thoughts, said nervously \"I.. I'll g..go check in the kitchen, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" replied Nerissa, \"Hurry back!\" As he scurried off to the kitchen, she grinned and patted her belly ,whispering \"Ok belly, you asked for it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Danis reached the kitchen he began searching frantically for leftovers of any kind, anything quick and easy to prepare. He found a note on the fridge door that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Hey Danis, thought you might need a little something extra, so there\u2019s more in the fridge if you need it. --Vinny </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Vinny\u2019s idea of  \u201ca little extra\u201d differed from everyone else\u2019s for when Danis opened the fridge door, he found what looked to be an entire second feast, complete with desserts! But when he picked up the first platter he made an interesting discovery. <i> \u201cThis stuff is still warm\u2026\u201d he thought to himself  \u201cVinny must have just finished it all\u2026\u201d </i> Still, no use looking a gift horse in the mouth, as he found Vinny\u2019s trolley and began loading food onto it. Once it was full he wheeled the trolley to the banquet hall, where Nerissa was waiting for him, and the food. She was surprised by the amount of food as he set it down on the table in front of her, another fried chicken, roast turkey, a gigantic bowl of what looked like mashed potatoes and gravy and a basket of biscuits and rolls. Getting over the surprise, she grabbed the nearest thing at hand, the fried chicken. She ate the crispy wings first, enjoying the grease-filled crunch, then moved on to the legs and thighs, after devouring these she moved on to the breast, savoring the rich flavor of the juicy white meat. A minute later and all that was left on the plate was bones as she moved on to the next item, the roast turkey. She ripped off the legs and dunked them in the mashed potatoes and gravy before eating them, delighting in the mixture of spuds and poultry. She finished these quickly and moved on to the rest of the turkey. As she devoured the massive piece of poultry she discovered that there was stuffing in the turkey. Soon that stuffing was in her as she speedily finished off the massive bird, her belly bulging outward to accommodate it. She then proceeded to voraciously devour the biscuits and rolls, dunking each in the potatoes and gravy, her belly bulging out more and more with each and every one. Now she prepared to finish off the potato and gravy mixture, forgoing the use of utensils, she instead opted to guzzle the mixture down like a thick milkshake. Each gulp made her belly bulge further and further out . As she guzzled the starchy mixture, Danis, who had been goggling at her feat of gluttony, had started setting out the dessert, which included not one but two chocolate cakes, a tub of now melted homemade chocolate ice cream, a strawberry cheesecake, and a 2 layer cake that was Vinny\u2019s own invention, it had a chocolate cheesecake layer on the bottom and a regular cake layer on top, all covered in gobs of chocolate frosting. As she finished the last of the potatoes, her belly had bulged out so far that it was touching the table! She backed up from the table a bit, and reached for the nearest thing at hand, the tub of melted ice cream. As she guzzled down the sweet stuff her belly expanded further and further with every gulp, nearly touching the table again when she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201cWhere is she putting it all?\u201d </i> thought Danis as he watched, shocked at how she could eat so much at one time. Meanwhile, after finishing the ice cream, Nerissa looked at him and, blushing slightly as she spoke, asked, <br>\r\n\u201cDanis, could you do something for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d, asked Danis curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you\u2026 feed me?\u201d, Nerissa replied, her face turning crimson as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS..sure\u201d, Danis answered somewhat nervously, and with that he grabbed a butter knife and, slicing up one of the cakes, held a slice up to her lips. She opened her mouth to accept the morsel and Danis stuffed the slice into her mouth, watching as she chewed and swallowed the cake, licking her lips afterward. The rest of dessert was devoured in the same fashion, Nerissa\u2019s belly expanding more and more with every bite. Danis was staggered, simply shocked and amazed at the sheer amount Nerissa had eaten in one sitting. Almost without thinking, he got down on his knees and began massaging her swollen gut with his hands, lovingly caressing the drum-taught skin of her belly. She moans slightly at the soft touch of his hands on the sensitive skin of her tummy, purring all the while. Gradually the pain in her overstuffed belly begins to subside as Danis continues massaging her belly and gradually her moans changed from those of pain to moans of ecstasy. Danis\u2019s hands moved higher and higher until, as if seized by a sudden impulse, he suddenly hugged her tightly and kissed her passionately, stroking her blonde hair all the while. Nerissa\u2019s purring grew louder as he embraced her, and after what seemed an eternity to the two, Danis stopped kissing her, and as he drew his face back, Nerissa licked him on the muzzle. The magic moment seemingly over, Danis\u2019s usual bashful nature took over as he flushed a deep crimson hue and he let go of her, as if embarrassed. A long silence loomed, each one lost in their own thoughts on what had just happened between them. Finally, it was Nerissa that broke the silence, asking, \u201cDanis, would it be ok if I spent the night here? I really don\u2019t think I can get home\u201d, poking her gut and giving a slight grin with that last comment. \u201cS..sure!\u201d replied Danis eagerly, and he blushed again at just how eager he had sounded, \u201cBut don\u2019t we need to tell your parents?\u201d \u201cMmhmm\u201d Nerissa replied, \u201cJust call my dad, he\u2019s a pretty cool dad, I think he\u2019ll understand. But before you do\u2026 could you help me get to a bed? I\u2019m kinda sleepy\u201d she said, yawning slightly. \u201cOk\u201d Danis replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took many failed attempts, but finally Danis was able to help Nerissa to her feet, and he began the somewhat arduous task of escorting the overstuffed feline to the nearest bed, which happened to be his. More than once he had to slow down and help her regain her balance as she nearly toppled due to the size and mass of her overstuffed gut, as she wasn\u2019t used to hefting such a large tummy around. Once they reached his room, Nerissa immediately laid down on his bed, dozing off almost instantly. Danis called her dad and told him the gist of what had happened, and got the ok for her to spend the night. And so he returned to his bedroom, gazing lovingly upon Nerissa\u2019s sleeping form, before changing into his pajama shorts and climbing up in bed with her, snuggling up against her soft form, shortly dozing off as well, completely content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the two, the effects of Nerissa\u2019s binge made themselves known overnight, as her body slowly converted all the calories into fat, softening and expanding her form further overnight. When she woke up\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nerissa slowly stirred as the sun shone through the blinds directly on her face. \"Nnnngh, morning already?\" she mumbled, yawning widely as she got ready to get out of bed, Danis already having gotten up. For some reason she felt larger than normal, and it was a bit more difficult to get out of bed, but she wrote it off as just being tired. Getting out of bed, she began stretching a bit. It was then that she saw her reflection in the mirror on Danis's wall. She stood there stunned, taking in the sight of her newly fattened and nude (she had outgrown her clothes overnight) body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had always been one of the smaller parts of her rather ample form until now, but now it dominated her overly ample figure, jutting out in front of her and sagging almost to her knees. Her breasts, which had picked up their fair share of fat, sat atop the monument to gluttony that was her belly, having become more of an F cup than the DDs she had had earilier, still maintaining a somewhat globular shape despite their bulk. Her butt had picked up its fair share of adipose as well, resembling two overstuffed couch cushions, her love handles resembled \"love waves\" more than anything, and her thighs had bulked up to where they were in permanent contact. Her arms had picked up just a bit more flab, and her face had become slightly rounder, with the beginnings of a 3rd chin starting to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands up and down her fattened form, over every roll on her flabby sides, along the prominent curve of her gargantuan belly, around her massive behind, poking and pinching all over to make sure that this wasn't just a dream. She looked over at the bed and grinned with chagrin as she saw the remains of her clothes lying on the bed. <i> \"Well, what am I going to wear now... it's not like I can walk around naked..\" </i> Nerissa thought to herself. It was then that she saw the pile of clothes on the side of the bed Danis had slept on. She picked them up an examined them, they were a rather low cut shirt, <i>( \"All the better to show off my *ahem* \"assetts\" Nerissa thought to herself, giggling )</i>, and a pair of shiny pants that looked to be made of leather. She looked them over again, they looked large enough, but how could Danis have known...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting that thought out of her head, she tried to put the clothes on. The shirt fit ok, showing off her large breasts to great effect and riding up on her belly,  exposing a great deal of it. The pants on the other hand, weren't as cooperative. It took many minutes of straining to get the uncooperative pants over her massive bottom, and even then she had to button them under her belly, letting it hang over the front of her pants, her love handles bulging out at the sides. All in all, the clothes hugged her ample frame, highlighting just how ample her frame was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to head down to the banquet hall again to see if Danis was waiting for her, unconciously licking her chops at the thought of food, and when she got there she found....</span></div></div>",

The four are lost in the forest again. They were in a remote section of the forest too.  A section that wasn't on the map.  It reminded Ash of the Safari Zone back at the Kanto Region.  It was the middle of the afternoon. <br>\r\n      \"My feet are tired\" said May.  \"can't we stop and rest?\" <br>\r\n     \"Now that you mention it, I feel kinda tired myself\" said Ash.

If he looked more closely....<br>\r\n       \"Guys!\" yelled Max.  \"come here, quick!\"<br>\r\n       \"What is it?\" asked May, who came over along with the two others.  All four of them stared at what looked like a giant footprint.  The footprint was 20 feet across and 7 feet deep!<br>\r\n    \"What could've made THAT?\" asked Ash.<br>\r\n    \"Not what\" said Brock.  \"WHO!\" <br>\r\n    Ash looked up to see himself staring at a fleshy wall.  He continued to look up until he realized he was looking at a woman's leg!  <br>\r\n     \"Hi there\" said a booming voice.  <br>\r\n     A giant Officer Jenny smiled down at the four tiny people.  Officer Jenny was at least 400 feet tall!  <br>\r\n     \"Uh...hello\" said Max. He looked like he was going to faint. <br>\r\n     \"You must be new here\" said Officer Jenny.  \"this is the Giantess Safari Zone, where girls can become a giantess and hunt down little tiny men!\"  <br>\r\n       Officer Jenny pulls out a strange-looking gun and fires it at May.

He was a Jolteon morph, age 17. 6ft 1inHe had always been a well built guy, never that muscular, but not a stick either. He was fairly popular, with a decent sized amount of friends. He was nice and generous, doing almost any favor anyone asked him.<br>\r\n      His older Brother, Mike, a Flareon Morph was away at colledge at Veridian U.<br>\r\n     This story will cirlce around Tad's baby sister, Sprite. She was recent to the family. only 3 years old. Against what seemed like impossible odds, she evolved from an Eevee at age Two into an espeon Morph. She hadn't developed any phsycic powers yet but due to her extremely early evolution, she was large for her age, 3ft 9in, and could be mistaken for a five year old.<br>\r\n     \"Hey Sunspot\" said Mike as he came down the stairs.

He babied her more than he should and acted like the little Espeon was 1. Since she enjoyed acting like a little Eevee, Tad new what to do to have fun with her. Sometimes he even went as far as to put her back in a diaper. He didn't let his parents know of course. He wanted her to have fun in her childhood, and if acting like a newborn made Sprite happy then he let her do that. <br>\r\n     \"So do you want your sippy cup, or your old bottle?\"<br>\r\n     \"Bottle!!

That is why she loved her brother. He treated her like she wanted, like a baby. If only he could remember what it was like to be a baby. \"he he we could pway togeter all day\"<br>\r\n    Tad had Sprite's bottle with him \"Ready for your Milk sunspot?\"<br>\r\n   \"Yeah!\" she was gonna have so much fun.<br>\r\n     \"here you... woah\" he was struck by a sudden diziness.<br>\r\n    \"Big bwother?

His clothes were blocking him. \"That can't be,\" he thought to himself, \"I'm wearing a T.\" He opened his eyes and was corrected. He was wearing a onsie like his sister.

He had shrunk a bit more to look the roll. He was still a jolteon, but all of his features were infantile. His face was rounder, his legs a bit stubbier. He tried to stand up but quicly fell on his butt. \"Silly! babies can't walk\" said his sister. She had changed him into a baby with a two year old's body.

What's the rush?\" It was his father, and Umbreon, with his mother, a Vaporeon. But something was wrong. His father's head hair wasn't greying like it normally was.

You look, different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong with either of us, why do you ask?\" Responded his mother. They were younger! Tad could clearly see it! They looked like a photo of them the Jolteon remembered from a photo album. It was happening right in front of his eyes! They both regressed into college ages, then started to shrink. The eons went back through the years, and stopped when they were both about four feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, Mom?! Dad?! Are you okay!\" IT had to have been sprite.

Sprite was sure a bundle of power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's in the kitchen.\" Unlike when he had shrunk, his parents had completely new clothes befitting their age. The business casual they had been wearing not too long ago, was replaced with jeans and tee's. They both ran in, and Tad following. \"Um, Sprite, why did you turn our parents into kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was bored waiting, so, I though we could have some fun!\" She said, as if she thought she had done absolutely nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just said you wouldn't let them know!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't!\" In fact, his parents were acting like normal kids.

She could even talk to her brother seriously about how hard he worked and begged him to relax every now and again. It was all pretty weird, but acting like a baby, cooing and drinking from a bottle all day, made her happy, and it him happy to entertain the little espeon. He filled up the bottle with milk, not enough for a meal, she wasn't as little as any three year old let alone a baby. \"Alright sunspot you ready for your...Woah!\"<br>\r\n    \"What's the matter big Bwo?\" Iteresting that she couldn't talk right even though she was smart. Tad noticed that Sprite's fur was glowing. Not like an evolution glowing, more like his fur glowed when he had to much electrictiy. \"You look like you saw a ghost.\" Her usualy deep purple fur was now a lighter shade. and energy was moving between the two parts of her tail. <br>\r\n    \"Uh... little sis, do you feel okay?\"<br>\r\n   \"I feel fine. Why?\" <br>\r\n   As she finished her sentence, Tad noticed something that shocked him. Sprite was growing before his eyes. She didn't notice until her feet touched the ground from the chair she was in, \"What's goin on!\" she said.<br>\r\n   \"I wish I knew!\" Sprite stopped growing at about five feet, her fur returning to its usual deep purple. She had grown  quite bit. She now came up to his chest, Her fur was also... bushier. Though she was five feet tall her proportion were that of a three year old. She was a bushy toddler!<br>\r\n   \"Wow this is so cool!! I'm a really big baby now!\"<br>\r\n   \"How'd you that?!\" Tad excalaimed.<br>\r\n   \"I dont know. But what can you do about it! Now lets pway till mommy and daddy get home!!\" She said as she hugged you. It was more fun to be hugged by a giant push 3 year old than a small one. <br>\r\n  \"Alright heres you're bottle.\" You gave it to her and she started suckong on it. As she sat there Tad couldn't resist but start scaching her between the ears, causing her to relax in her chair. \"We'll deal with your size later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She's a Godzilla-sized anthropomorphic Eevee in the middle of a city! You haven't got any clue what's happening! You need to run away fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, naturally, you walk towards her calmly, mouth slightly agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach her, she's still trying to convince the fleeing crowds to stay and help.<br>\r\n\"Hey, seriously! This is so mean...\"<br>\r\nShe watches the last citizen in the immediate area run off into an alleyway and sighs heavily. With a pout, she leans against a nearby skyscraper, causing it to bend and creak immediately. She rapidly withdraws with a gasp of \"Oops! Sorry!\" Sighing again, she lays down and stretches her legs out down the street, resting one hand on her knee and another on a car behind her. With another apology, she shakes the flat husk of metal off and (more carefully) places her fingers on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n\"Geez... this sucks. What am I supposed to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her upper body is closer to the ground, you take a better look at it while paying no heed to the frantic urgings of your mind to make yourself scarce. She looks like she's in her late teens or early twenties, judging by her well-developed body and fresh, youthful appearance. Her hair is long and smooth, plentiful enough to splay out several dozen feet on the ground behind her as she sits. She's already almost crushed a building and actually crushed a car, but her face looks rather intelligent- maybe she's just a little careless? She's probably just not used to this sort of situation, that's all. <br>\r\nYour brain takes this opportunity to remind you that the 'situation' is that she's roughly twenty stories tall. You ignore it again and walk up to her massive sandaled foot. After a brief pause, you poke her furry ankle gently. After a slightly longer pause, you knock on it like you would a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to have gotten her attention, at least. She glanced in your general direction with a confused look, then shrugged and returned to pouting. You quickly knocked again and shouted as loud as you could.<br>\r\n\"HELLO?\"<br>\r\nThe Eevee girl jumped several feet (although that wasn't very much given her size), tossing you to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Who's there?!\"<br>\r\nYou gingerly rubbed your backside as you stood up. It was hard to stand with so much wind. Wind?<br>\r\nTurning, you saw her massive face looming feet away, gentle breath flowing over you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey. Sorry. Didn't mean to... uh... shake you. I just thought everyone had run away already.\"<br>\r\nBig! Mouth! Jaws! Claws! Danger! Run!<br>\r\n\"I think everyone else did, yeah. Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you believe it? It's obvious I'm in some kind of trouble here, but what happens? Everyone just runs off!\"<br>\r\nUpset giant Pokewoman! Escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head to silence it, you smile and hold out a hand.<br>\r\n\"On behalf of the city, I'd like to apologize for the cold reception. I think they were just a bit intimidated, but that's really no excuse.\"<br>\r\nThe Eevee girl extended a huge finger and let her clawtip rest in your palm for a rather bizarre form of handshake.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but what do you mean by intimid- ...\" The Eevee looked at you in shock for a moment. \"Oooo-h. Oh, wow.\" She lay her head sideways on the ground and gently rested a finger on your head, evaluating your height. \"... Yeeeee-ah. That explains a bit, I think. I guess I must look kinda scary like this.\" She glanced at her claws with chagrin. You simultaneously noted that each was easily large enough to shred a truck in half, and that each was painted with cute nail polish.<br>\r\n\"Er... you hadn't noticed you were so big?\"<br>\r\nShe ran a hand through her thick brown hair, knocking a few strands over her left eye. \"Are you kidding? Of course I did! I just... didn't think I'd be <i>that</i> scary. I figured my natural cuteness would balance out the size.\" The phrase 'natural cuteness' was accompanied by a kiss blown on her fingertips and a giant wink.</span></div></div>",

The Eevee-girl is now sitting up, dangerously close to you. \"What's going on?\" she says, with a certain amount of concern in her voice. Suddenly, a voice booms out of a megaphone. \"Attention 'Alien.' You have 30 seconds to prove that you're not a threat to us, or we'll open fire.\" Your eye twitches. Are those guys serious? As if doing something like that could be described as \"sane.\" \"W-what?\" says the Eevee girl, fear now in her voice. \"I-I said I'm not going to hurt you guys!\" \"15 Seconds!\" Your mind races. You're going to have to run sooner or later, lest you get riddled with bullets. \"10 Seconds, alien.\" But you can't just abandon her! She's standing up now, looking like she's about to run. She could easily crush them, but you figure she's far too timid to murder. \"5 Seconds!\" \"4, 3, 2...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, faster then you comprehend, you are grabbed by a large, fluffy hand and your entire world is spinning as she seems to sprint out of the city. The swat care give chase, but her giant feet slam down on the ground, toppling buildings with the sheer destructive weight of the impacts. They're stopped, and the Eevee girl has no difficulty dissapearing into a lush, tall forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is spinning. You feel like throwing up, passing out, and screaming all at once. But as soon as it started, it's over, and you feel the tight grip loosen. Your jaw opens wide as you that you landed next to a giant eyeball, with eyelids that could easily throw you far away. \"If I lay down on my back, then I'm not visible through the trees. So I thought it'd be a good llace to hide for now.\" You continue to stare at the eyeball, speechless. \"Sorry about treating you so badly during the getaway. You're the only one who unserstands and I...can't lose you yet.\" You merely nod in understanding. \"Why were those guy trying to kill me? I didn't do anything wrong!\" \"The government here isn't a big fan of aliens, I think. And besides, you're so big you could topple cities by tripping!\" You feel the ground under you shift as her gigantic lips curl into a frown. \"But that's not fair! I wasn't always this big! I was about as big as you, if I was back home.\" \"Back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans up slightly, sending you tumbling down her face until you hit her nose.  \"Yeah, back home. I'm not from here; I'm from a world where people like me are the norm, and humans are a mere myth.\" You listen in wonderment and curiousity as she explains the details of her world, that was essentially a version of our world dominated with pokewomen. \"So if you're a myth in my world, how do you view me? As a myth?\" You think for a moment. \"No...we have games about you, I think.\" Her eyes light up. \"Really?!\" \"Not you specifically, the...Pokepeople. And they're not human shaped, they're more like animals.\" She frowns. \"Oh, dang. So we're not depicted at all like this?\" You think about the few times that, yeah, people have drawn them like that, but figure that's worth bringing up later. \"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" you ask her out of curiosity</span></div></div>",

You now notice that she is also very beautiful wearing a simple shirt and shorts which show off her large curvy body. In any case, you know already that she is not from anywhere nearby. Could she have come from another world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eevee starts to show more signs of distress as she mutters to herself. \"This is not what I wanted to happen. What if I can never return home? What if I'll never see my family again?\" Her mind already begins to wander into a dark place and not knowing what else to do, you decided to try and console her the best you could. \"Hey!\" you shout, grabbing her attention, \"l don't know how you got here or what's going on either but um, you don't need to stress out. You are relatively safe here so there is well, nothing for you to worry about and I think you'll eventually find a way home. I'll even stay with you until you do.\" You fumbled out a string of thoughts not fully believing what you are saying. You are compelled to help this eevee in some way so you tried your best to sound confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responds with a small laugh which you hope is a good sign. \"I'm sorry, I don't mean to make you nervous but I promise I won't hurt you. You are right by the way, I just need to stay calm and everything will work out. Being alone is the last thing I want right now so thank you for offering to stay with me.\" You can't help but smile after she said that. \"I mean, I wouldn't want to be alone either if I was in the same situation.

You glance around and see that the area and buildings are still deserted. Without thinking much further, you look at her and say, \"We should probably go, follow me.\" \"Huh ... oh, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone probably called the police at some point but they played it off as a joke. Of course, when multiple calls of the same anomaly occur, they have to investigate. This would give you enough time to take her anywhere else. The police would be looking for something big as long no one else saw her shrink.  You thought it would be best to travel to the park, away from the streets. They'll be looking for something they can see miles away so they'll probably overlook some places on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop under a group of trees to catch your breath. \"It's this where you wanted to take me?\" \"No,\" you reply, \"but it's safer than being out in the open while I figure out what to do?\" There is no conceivable way for you to send her back where she came from on your own so for now, you just need a place to house her. Taking eevee to your apartment is ideal but... you look her over again and the solution was simple. \"We can just cover you up and you'll look normal, mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing around you to use, you decided that your own clothes would have to suffice. Your long pants would cover her legs that her shorts reveal, shoes for her paws, a hoodie to hide her ears and cover her arms and she can use your shirt as a scarf to hide her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do that,\" she protests. \"It would be too cold for you to walk around with so little clothing. You don't even have fur.\" You insist that you will be fine, \"It's the only thing I can think of doing unless you can shrink down small enough to carry you.\" She shakes her head no so she reluctantly agrees to the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin giving her your clothes and she puts on the clothes as you instructed. It seems to work but since she's a little bit bigger than you, the clothes are a tight fit. Her tail is stuffed inside your pants, ears are drooped down under the hood and her large paws stretch your shoes a bit but they hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing but an undershirt, boxers, and socks, you say to her, \"Looking good,\" and motion her to follow you. You shiver a little from the short breeze which prompts the eevee to ask if you would be okay again. Her voice is muffled under your shirt but you understood what she said and reply, \"I'm fine, it's not that cold and were not too far from where we are going.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's a giant monster loose in the city.\" You hear him talk in his usual sarcastic tone and he lets out a grand laugh after he finished his statement. \"A monster, what are you talking about, did you fall asleep while watching a movie or something.\" You reply jokingly to help make yourself less suspicious and feel less nervous. \"You haven't heard of the rumors going around about some 300, 400-foot dog- creature, it's all over the news.\" You then hear his wife yell from inside the apartment,  \"It's true, my friend called and told me what she saw. \" Jack looks back into the room, \"Then where did it go hun, all they found was broken concrete...\" \"in the shape of two paw prints, explain that.\" \"Only after you explain where it went.\" Jack looks back at you, \"Listen to her, if it was real, how come there's no video of it. Everyone on the news said their phones didn't work. There was also a blackout in the entire city for the past 30 minutes. That's all way too convenient.\" You nod in agreement not having anything you wish to add but you assume that what brought eevee here is the cause. Jack adds, \"This is some elaborate set-up someone came up with. I wonder how they did it, and why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to use this moment to say your goodbyes until Jack asks, \"Hello, who's your lady friend?\" He finally notices her standing behind you and walks toward her. She proceeds to pull the hood lower over her face. \"Wait, you don't want to get too close too close to her she's not feeling well.\" That quick line stopped Jack's advances. \"Oh that's too bad, must be because of the weather. Well, you better take good care of... could you tell me your name, miss?\" She seemed to be lost in thought until he asked her that. \"Eevee,\" she blurts out without giving it a second thought but only you heard what she said. Jack's responds with \"Excuse me?\" and not waiting for her to say it again, you interrupt \"Eve is her name.\" \"Oh, Okay. It's nice to meet you, Eve, take care now.\" Taking this chance you drag her away to your door. Before you make it into your apartment you hear Jack again, \"And put some clothes on or you'll be the one that's sick.\" You respond with a quick nod and rush inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh of relief escapes your lips after you close the door. \"Ah, we can relax now.\" You look at Eevee and notice she's looking down. \"Are you alright?\" She removes your shirt covering her face and her hood to look at you, \"Thank you, really, thank you for helping me out, you went through so much trouble for me so I'm happy you were there.\" She continues to shower you with gratitude but you wonder it's necessary. \"You heard what people called me right? A monster, that all I've been hearing all the way here.\" You only remember talking to Jack but realize that her ears are probably pretty sensitive. Everyone in the area is talking about her. \"Well I'm not a monster but you were the only one to see that. I was able to shrink because you calmed me down. If I had grown anymore from the stress, I would have been stuck at that size for a while.\" That must have been what she was trying to tell you earlier. While you were thinking, she comes over any gives you a pretty strong hug. You weren't prepared for the outburst of emotions but you enjoy the warmth from her after being outside in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases after a brief pause and asks you, \"What made you approach me anyway? Weren't you scared like the others?\" You reply, \"Of course I was scared but ... I don't know. A giant eevee isn't something you see every day, or ever. I guess, it was kind of awesome.\" You ended up blurting out that last part so she replies, \"Oh, so you liked that I was a giant. Well then, I guess I'll have to show you more after I have rested.\" You're baffled by what she said but she just smiles. She lets out a yawn and sits on your couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Eve is the name you gave me, right? Well, feel free to call me that, I kind of like it.\" You agree and she gives you a bright smile. \"I'll find a way to repay you for your kindness, okay.\" You reply,\"You don't have to do that but, I would like to ask you something.\" \"I'll tell you anything.\" Not wanting to waste this opportunity, you speak up, \"Well, my biggest question is, how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm neither a human or a pokemon, or it might be more accurate to say I'm a little bit of both. I'm what we call a pokemorph. We look like humanoid versions of pokemon, but can talk. Some of us can even use pokemon moves like actual pokemon. Our little region of the world has a lot of us, we've been around for as long as our written history. Exploring how pokemorphs came around is a huge part of my research, maybe some day in the future you'll be a big help to it. It's a quite interesting subject really, do pokemorphs come from altered pokemon, or altered humans, or a bit of both? Is there perhaps a point where pokemon and humans weren't so different in the past? Not to mention, there's always records of people who weren't always pokemorphs but have somehow through science or magic been transformed into one. I apologize, I get a bit distracted, that's enough about me for a bit. This is your journey, if you choose to help me on my research I'd be thrilled, but this is all about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor blinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, and I haven't even gotten a good look at you.

It wasn't just your hand that was different. The light blue fur covered both your hands and arms, as well as your chest and stomach. Looking down at yourself you saw that at your waistline the fur became a much darker navy blue. It went all the way down to your feet, which now looked like an animal's paws instead of your normal feet. Then, you had something new attached to you, a new part of you. You could control it but it took a few moments for you to realize what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a tail! It has the same dark blue fur as your lower body, though the tip of it seemed to have an almost star shaped bit that was colored in the same yellow as the stripes on your wrists.

The front of it pushed out in what you assumed was a muzzle, and reaching a hand inside your mouth you felt sharp pointy fangs inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached a hand up to the top of your head, and you felt large round ears on the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like the subject is aware of the change.\" The smug male voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinx Transformation is stable.\" The female voice spoke. \"He will survive, the process is complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.

Righteous anger filled you, then electricity started to spark around the bands on your wrist. You opened your mouth and let out a roar that was muted by the liquid as you started to generate more electricity in an attempt to blast your way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like we have a feisty one.\" The smug voice spoke. \"Apply a sedative before that thing wrecks the lab. Then apply the safeguard and drain the tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't hear anything else said after that, it as at this point that you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows how much time passed before you woke up again. This time you were no longer suspended in a tube of liquid but instead were laying on a moth eaten cot inside a small cell. You were now dressed in a pair of threadbare shorts and sleeveless shirt. They didn't do much to offer any form of protection, but now that you were covered in fur you weren't about to freeze to death. Still they were a little big on you, the shirt barely hang on to your shoulders and if you didn't have a tail poking through a hole in them the shorts likely would not have stayed on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up on your cot and threw your legs over the end. You noticed that the cot was so high up your feet didn't actually touch the ground. It was weird actually. The cell and the cot all looked kind of big, like they were made for some kind of giant three times your size. You wouldn't have thought that a prisoner (which is what you assumed you were) would warrant such spacious living arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid off the cot and landed on the floor. Standing felt a bit weird, in that you found yourself naturally standing on the tips of your toes instead of flat on your feet. You swished your new tail as you looked around. Everything about this new shinxlike body was strange, and you weren't sure what to react. Right now you were more concerned with who had kidnapped you, and why they had changed you. You walked over to the door. There was no handle or knob on your end, but you could see one on the other side of the door. The handle was well above your head though, once more as if it had been designed for someone much taller than you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examined the cot and room again, and then the door, and you had a realization. This was not a large cell. Apparently, when you had been transformed into a human shinx hybrid you had become much, much shorter than you started. You were probably only about two feet tall now if you had to guess based on how much bigger the door was than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hear started to beat faster as you thought about how much bigger any guards around this place would be. You grabbed onto the bars of your cell door to steady yourself as you felt dizzy thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the door opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door wasn't locked, it hadn't even been shut all the way. You poked your head out the open door and looked outside. It was a hallway lined with similar doors on either side. You didn't see any guards, or really any signs of life at all the place was completely abandoned. Somehow, the complete lack of any readily apparent adversary bothered you more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what was going on, but you had to get out of here. Still was it safe, you had no idea what kind of dangers were around, who had kidnapped you, and what they would do if they found you out of your cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and made a decision.</span></div></div>",

You had no idea what this place was or who the people that had brought you here and changed you were, but you weren't going to stick around here to let them do whatever they were up to. You stepped out of the cell, your tail swishing against your leg as you looked around to see where you were. You were in a long hallway filled with cell doors similar to your own. You walked down to the next cell and looked into it to see if there was anyone there. You couldn't see anyone. You were able to see claw marks all over the wall in the cell though, though there was something strange about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several sets of claw marks on the wall, and they were all at different heights. There were large claw marks about four feet off the ground in the cell. Higher up than you, then there were slightly smaller claw marks about two feet off the ground, and even smaller claw marks only a foot off the ground level with you.  Peering into the cell you could see another set of much smaller marks only a few inches off the ground. You wondered if there had been multiple people or pokemon inside the cell. You looked at the cell, there was one bed, though it had been ripped apart and thrown on its side. If there were multiple people in here at once it wasn't comfortable. Maybe the cell had just seem a lot of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved on. There were a huge number of cells in this area, and though none of them were currently occupied they all showed similar signs of wear and tear to indicate they had been in use. You wondered how many of these people had been experimented on like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reached the end of the hall. There was a large metal door that marked the exit to the hallway. It was probably some kind of security door, and you could see a card reader on the wall above you. Lucky for you the door was ajar, so someone wasn't very good at security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight the people who managed to kidnap you and who knows how many others and and with technology far beyond anything else available were probably just incompetent and left the door open. You tried to reassure yourself of this but it did no good. By this point you had figured out that something had gone down here, but you didn't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped through the open door. It took you onto a metal platform slightly raised off the ground. There was a sign posted on the wall. You couldn't see it at your height very easily. You had to jump up and down to read it. It was at this point that you learned despite your small stature you felt much stronger than you did as a human. You easily leaped straight up five feet into the air and it was as easy as a little hop. Like this you were able to read the sign on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was giving directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft: Control Room<br>\r\nRight: Training Plaza<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo bad neither of them was marked as an exit. You thought for a moment about which direction you should go.</span></div></div>",

You've caused us so much trouble in the past, we thought this would be a perfect way to silence you once and for all.\"<br>\r\nMaxie grinned madly, then turned around and told a grunt to 'bring the Pikachu.' A grunt came up behind Maxie with Ash's Pikachu, in a net. \"We've injected Pikachu's DNA into your body, causing you to morph with it, at a cost. We have to destroy Pikachu, or your Pokedex entry will conflict with Pikachu's... Your Pokemon ID, I mean. Finish the Pikachu, boys!\"<br>\r\nPikachu wailed in pain as the grunts attacked it with their Pokemon. Finally, it let out one last sigh, falling to the ground. Ash, unable to speak though the gag, cried fearfully. Maxie untied Ash, allowing him to look at his body. It was beginning to cover itself with yellow fur, and Ash could feel two red pouches on his cheeks. His clothes ripped and fell off, revealing a tail and ears. Ash could feel himself getting smaller, and watched as Maxie seemingly grew in front of him. She laughed, throwing a purple ball embossed with an M at Ash.</span></div></div>",

Unable to control his body, Ash lit up with a blue-yellow aura, then charged at the squirtle. It squeaked in pain, then shot a powerful water gun at Ash on command from it's trainer. Ash fell backwards, stunned from the blow. Without Maxie saying anything, Ash looked up and saw thunderclouds, then prepared to use thunder. Maxie saw what he was doing, and didn't say anything.

Pikachu is still atop her, spilling his fluids in her, Misty, bearing a perverted happy look that gives the hint some of the lights in her head went out from the intense mating, as though she enjoyed it <i><b>WAY</b></i> too much, laid there, tail hoisted in air, and let Pikachu continue to pump into her, her entire rear covered in sticky seed. Pikachu let out more load, when Ash snatched him up, yelling, \"Enough!!\" Brock picked up the orgasm dazed Misty and cleaned her off. \"This is weird. Why did Misty finally let him have his way with her, and then for so long? She practically passed out from the marathon mating.\" Brock wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after he finished cleaning her, Misty snapped to, and motioned for a piece of paper. He quickly obliged, and she wrote, \"I felt bad for him, saying he never has known the touch of a female pokemon because all Ash ever catches are male pokemon... And secretly, after hearing that, I wanted to know pokemon mating was like, for you know, research. <u><b>IT. WAS. AWESOME!!</b></u> Strangely, after the first time, I was going to tell him that's enough, but I suddenly felt a longing, something like a need... a need to propagate the species, and I enticed him to have at me again, and again, and again. After a while, I just laid there and let him ravage me, lost in the bliss, hoping he'd impregnate me... Am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock tells her, \"When we get back to the gym, we'll be able to use the equipment there to check you out. Right now, though, I want to know what changed you in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, they return to the gym, where Brock runs a battery of tests. \"It turns out your efforts succeeded. You're pregnant, Misty.\" Misty rubs her stomach as she wonders about the fact that she never thought her child would had been with Pikachu. A loud beeping fills the room, and the video phone rings. Ash picks up the phone, and on the screen is Nurse Joy. \"I have information on the data you sent me. It seems in the bloodwork of this Pikachu you sent me there were gene sequences and alleles that if I didn't know better looked more human than pokemon. What's going on?\" Brock and Ash explain the sordid story, with Misty interjecting with written notes. \"Well, I think, from you told me, I know what may of happened. I found traces of a thunder stone in 'Misty's' system, but in the remnants of the stone were also human blood mixed in.\" Misty slapped her forehead, and wrote down, \"I totally forgot I was doing inventory last night and found this odd red thunder stone, and I anted to have it checked, but it was late, so I left it in my pocket...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy went on, \"I believe that when this particular thunder stone formed, the blood of another human must have seeped into it, and as a result, it mutated the stone, causing it affect humans instead of pokemon, turning Misty into a pikachu. Misty, how did you come by the stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty answered on a new sheet of paper, \"I bought it from a desert bazaar in the Hoenn region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy said, \"I do remeber there was supposed to have been a legend of an ancient battle between humans and pokemon in a desert in Hoenn. Much blood was shed, and many lives lost. It could be the blood for that ancient battle fossilized in the stones in the regions and changed their properties so they turn humans into pokemon... Wait,  give a few days more to study Misty's blood. I may be able to see if there is a cure or not for her condition...\" She abruptly ends the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh says, \"There might be a cure!!

I'm sending over my Chansey through with the antidote now. Should we tell the patient?\" As the Chansey pops out of the pokeball in the machine basin, holding a dart gun, Ash piques his eyelid as he suddenly hears high-pitched Pikachu cries from the neighboring room. He runs over to see Pikachu pounding away at Mist again, and Misty seemingly goading Pikachu on. \"Really, Misty?! I come in here to tell you we have a way of turning you human again and you're letting my Pikachu mount you again?!\" Ash reaches over to seperate them, when, of all things, Misty tries to shock Ash. \"Pi- Pika...\" She growls, deep in her rut. \"She's so lost in estrus she doesn't understand me right now... Chansey, shoot her with the antidote!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChansey fires the dart, nailing Misty square in the bum, but she is so lost in bliss she doesn't mind the dart. After a minute of furious pumping, Pikachu starts to notice his mate getting bigger. Misty fails to notice as well that her fur as rapidly shedding as her human hair quickly grows back at exponential speed. Pikachu, undaunted, continues mating with her as her ass swells to a ripe feminine proportion. As her legs lengthen, she finds her original position uncomfortable and flips over, having Pikachu mate her in the missionary position, her now D-cup breasts in view. Ash blinks oddly, both with embarrassment and confusion, stating, \"That's not right. Her chest was never <b>THAT</b> big... and her hair that long... Something's off.\" As Misty's hips narrow, her hair has already grown down to her tail, which strangely shows no signs of going away. As Misty's face crunches back dwn into her old human face, her cries change from Pikachu cries of pleasure to human moans of pleasure. \"More!! <b>MORE</b>!! Must make more babies, Pikachu!! Harder!!\" Soon, they climaxed, and Ash fainted from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly thereafter, Ash awoke, water splashed on him. Standing over him was Misty, but not quite. While her face and hair color were the same, she had a tighter waist, wider hips, and much larger chest than she used to, and most noticeably, she still had long Pikachu ears on her head, and a long Pikachu tail practically dragging the floor. \"Get up, Ash...\" She brushed off some remaining shed fur from her shoulder, then reached down to help Ash up. As he was being pulled up, he couldn't help both notice she was still dripping from her loins. \"I see you cured me... kinda...\" She looks back, flicking her tail. Ash nodded, red as a beet. Misty says, \"Even though I still feel like I'm in heat, I think it's subsiding. I think it's partly due to the cure, and partly...\" She rubs her belly, \"...due to this bun in the oven... Why do you keep acting like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh screams out what he is thinking. \"Get some clothes on!! You're indecent!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, at breakfast, Misty comes down, dressed in a bikini top, a pair of her suspenders, and a green version of Dawn's pink miniskirt,, the rear hoisted up by her tail. \"I know this outfit is out of character for me,\" she said to Ash and Brock, \"but I had to have all my clothes sent to a tailor to accommodate my new physique... and my tail, and this is all that'll fit me here right now. I always told dawn 'I hate skirts,' but strangely I'm glad she gave me this one, otherwise I'd just be walking about in my underwear while I have have my clothes altered.\" Brock goes into cardiac arrest. Ash says, \"Well, while the tailor mends your clothes, we can run some more tests on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is next...?</span></div></div>",

He has no prior memories before the darkness.  He has no idea where he is or what he was doing.  His world was darkness.  A few images came to him, as if from a dream.  He saw many things, none of which made any sense to him.  The images were blurry and unfocused.  <br>\r\n      \"Wake up, Eric\"<br>\r\n     The voice was female.  It echoed through the darkness.  Eric managed to open one eye and the other quickly followed.  He was in a room of some sort.  The room looked to be a lab of some sort.  He was lying on a table with restraints off of him.  Eric quickly got up from the table and stood unsteadily on the floor.  <br>\r\n       \"Good.  Very good\"<br>\r\n       The female voice again.  The voice came from nowhere.  Eric was puzzled, until he realized that the voice had came from *inside* his head.  Was he going crazy?<br>\r\n       \"Get out of that room\"  <br>\r\n       Eric noticed the door to the room was opened.  So, he walked over to the door.  That's when Eric passed by a mirror.  He peered into the mirror and saw something that made him scream.  He was no longer human!  He was a pokemon!  A Scyther to be exact, complete with wings.  <br>\r\n        \"What the--?\" asked Eric aloud.  His voice was high-pitched like a Scyther's.  But he spoke human language.  When did this happened?  How did this happened?  A human can't become a pokemon!  What was going on?<br>\r\n          \"Eric, just relax and do as I say\" <br>\r\n          \"Where are you?!\" asked Eric, whirring around but saw nobody.  <br>\r\n           \"I'm outside.

Eric quickly got up from the floor and ran down the hallway.  <br>\r\n        \"Get him!\" yelled Dr. Veronica, and the two SWAT police began to chase Eric down the hall.

He was inside what looked to be a hospital.  He had lost the two SWAT police, and making his way down a hallway that led to a lobby.  The lobby was empty.  Eric dashed out of the doors and into the cool night.  It took a few minutes for his eyes to  adjust to the darkness.  Eric was flying away in the air.

Eric dodged the attack and continued to fly off.  <br>\r\n       \"Come back here!\" yelled the trainer.  Eric didn't listen to the trainer, as he flew off.

When he came to a river, Eric looked at his reflection.   What had caused him to look like this?   Eric never heard of a person becoming a pokemon before.   Eric followed the river for half a mile when the river went into a lake.  The lake was perhaps 2 miles long, and half a mile wide.  There, in the middle of the lake, was a Lapras. <br>\r\n       \"Hi\" said the voice in Eric's head. <br>\r\n       \"Um..\" said Eric, looking around.  <br>\r\n       The voice giggled.  \"I'm the Lapras, silly.  I told you I was like you.  I used to be a person too\"<br>\r\n         \"With Psychic powers?\" asked Eric.  People with psychic powers were rare, but Eric had heard about him.<br>\r\n         \"Actually, no\" said the Lapras in his head.  \"my psychic powers came with this new body of mine.  The name's  Sally\"<br>\r\n          \"My name is Eric\" said Eric.  \"how did this happen to me?\"<br>\r\n          \"Lost your memory I see\" said Sally.<br>\r\n        \"Some of it\" said Eric.  \"I remember my name, but not much else.   Why did you call for me here?\"<br>\r\n         \"Team Rocket has been doing experiments like this for quite a while\" said Sally.  \"turning people into pokemon.  Actually, they're making hybrids;  People with pokemon attacks.   Sometimes, it doesn't work as good as they want it to be\"<br>\r\n            \"So that's what happened to me?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n            \"Yes\" said Sally.  <br>\r\n           \"Any way to reverse it?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n          \"Professor Maple is working on a cure\" said Sally.  \"she's a hybrid.

She got away from Team Rocket and vows to find a cure for our kind\"<br>\r\n            \"How many of us are there?\" asked Eric.  <br>\r\n           \"Around 1,500\" said Sally.  <br>\r\n           \"Wow\" said Eric.<br>\r\n           \"We all live in a village not far from here\" said Sally.  \"follow me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Sally led Eric to a small village.  People came out to greet Sally and Eric.  All of the people in the village were either a pokemon or a hybrid of human and pokemon.  One kid around Eric's age was a hybrid of a snorlax.  Another was a hybrid of a Zapdos and a human.  Professor Maple was indeed a hybrid of a charizard.  Professor Maple had the head of a 30ish woman with glasses, and the body of a charziard.  Her hair was orange-red with black red at the bangs.  She had a right hand of a human and a left hand of a charizard.  <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone else were only parts of pokemon, not complete ones like him.  He felt alone.  Like an outsider.  He walked just beyond the village and into a small clearing in the surrounding forest.  There was an Alakazam morph (his head, both hands and feet were alakazam, the rest human) in a meditation position, floating 3 feet off the ground,  just floating there, wearing a blind fold and a martial arts robe.  He didn't notice Eric untill he stood on a twig and it snaped.  Suddenly, the Alakazam was alert and seemingly hostile.  \"Who's there?\" it said in a raspy tone.<br>\r\n\"Eric\"  He replied, feeling a slight itching feeling on the back of his head.  He didn't scratch it. The Alakazam growled back \"Good, now that we've been introduced, tell me how you are stopping me from reading your mind.\"  Eric scratched the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"Because, there's nothing there to read?\" Eric guessed.<br>\r\n\"New, eh?\" he replied via telekinesis.  \"Ah... better.  So, I am only able to communicate with you by telekinesis, but I can't read your mind.  Interesting...  And I'll have you know, boy, that every mind has something there, even if the mind in question has any type of memery loss.\"<br>\r\n\"Sooo, you can't help me unlock any memories?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n\"No, that is something we must all do by ourselves.  Psychics will only reveal so much, no matter what they see inside other's minds.\" it quickly replied.<br>\r\nEric gave him a wondering look, and asked, \"Arn't you going to take the blind fold off and realize that I look like a complete Scyther?\"<br>\r\n\"No.  Taking the blind fold off would only scar you for life.  My eyes were gouged out, by who, I don't know.  It was, I was told by Rocket scientists, a side effect of the morphing.  Doubtful as it is, I don't need them.  I can sense everyone from here to a nearby city where a disturbance has upset the personel at a Rocket lab.  I was originaly a psycic as a human and becoming a Alakazam morph only strengthened my psycic abilities to the point where, on human standards, I had mastered them.  I have since moved my training to martial arts and meditation.\" He said, occasionaly turning his head this way and that.  \"But enough about me.  Let's here about you.\"<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Eric asked, and indicated towards himself.  \"Well... I'm Eric, == years old, recently escaped from a Team Rocket 'hospital', escaped a trainer who wanted to catch me, was contated psycicly by Sally through the whole thing, and now I'm here, waiting for a cure.  Untill then, I look compleatly like a Syther.  There's not much more I remember, nothing of it is my past life.\"<br>\r\nHe chuckled a little \" And here is the boy Syther who was saying there was nothing to be read from his mind.\"  He shook his head in amazement.  \"The hour must be getting late, you best be off to see Professor Maple.  Unless you wish to train agianst me?\"</span></div></div>",

Professor Maple showed Eric to a medium-sized room with lights, a phone, etc.  There was even a kitchenette with a fridge.  <br>\r\n         \"Make yourself at home\" said Professor Maple.  \"forgive me, but there are things I must attend to\"  <br>\r\n         Professor Maple left the room.<br>\r\n         Eric turned on the TV.

He flipped it to the local news.<br>\r\n        \"This is Al Seymour here at the Mount Sanguine Research Center\" said a human on the news.  \"hours ago, an explosion rocked the center after someone was reported to have escaped.  This is Professor James Mackwell, head of research here at the research center--\"<br>\r\n        Professor Mackwell looked vaguely familar to Eric.  Eric was sure he hadn't seen Mackwell before in his life, but the professor did seem familiar.  Perhaps Eric had seen him on TV a long time ago.  <br>\r\n       \"We wish to ensure the people of Sanguine City that they are no danger\" said Professor Mackwell.  \"the explosion was caused by an accident within the main lab.  And as for someone escaping the center, I have no idea what was that about.

My sister, Ann, is a member of The Outcasts.

Some would recover memories, or fragments later, but never completely. The latest batch are the full anthros, half pokemon and half human through and through.

The four people that lived together usually looked similiar.  Nobody looked like Eric though.  Eric was one of a kind.<br>\r\n      The people of the town seemed to be learning thier pokemon attacks today.  Some people could produce a lightning bolt, while others did thier best to do an attack but failed.  Eric tried to do some attacks on his own.  Eric was successful in doing the scratch attack, the swords dance* , and hyper beam.  Hyper beam felt weird on the throat.  Hyper beam was a burning sensation, but it really didn't burn Eric's throat.  At least Eric could defend himself.  <br>\r\n       All of the pokemon morphs had thier own name.  For example; A kid that was a pikachu and a human called himself 'Sparky'.  A man with a snorlax torso called himself 'Fatso'.  They were names like that; names that reflected the look of the morph.  There was one other person that was crossed with a charizard called  \"Fireball\" <br>\r\n    Fireball looked like a normal charizard, but with blond hair and a human right leg and foot.  <br>\r\n      The people of the town were in the 20 - 50 age range.  There were only 4 people under the age of 20, which included Sparky and Fireball.  Eric made fast friends with Fireball, Sparky and Fatso.  The other two kids who were under 20 were named 'Kidtaur' (who was a Ponyta morph) and 'Casper' (a ghost morph)<br>\r\n          Some of the morphs had regular pokemon with them, for some of the morphs had been trainer before they were changed.  All of the morphs could understand what regular pokemon were saying.  <br>\r\n           Professor Maple spent half the day in her lab, and came out just after 12:00 noon.  <br>\r\n          \"You have some of your human DNA left\" said Maple.  \"much more human DNA than any other person in this town\"<br>\r\n           \"So I'm more human than pokemon?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n           Professor Maple shook her head.<br>\r\n           \"You're a pokemon through and through\" said Maple.  \"but with more human DNA than even myself\"<br>\r\n            \"Then, why aren't I a morph like the others?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n           \"I don't know\" said Professor Maple.  \"but I do have a theory....\"<br>\r\n            \"Humans are approaching\" came the voice of Sally in everybody's head. \"pokemon trainers, by the looks of them\"<br>\r\n             \"How many?\" asked Professor Maple.<br>\r\n             \"Four\" said Sally.  \"they're half a mile away to the South\"<br>\r\n             \"Let's go and greet them\" said Fireball.  \"few humans ever come here because they're afraid of us\"<br>\r\n             \"Yes, go and greet 'em\" said Professor Maple.  \"but don't harm them\"<br>\r\n              \"We won't\" said Fireball.  <br>\r\n             Fireball, Sparky, Kidtar, Casper and you decide to greet the four humans.

Actually, it was several people passing the alley.  Eric peeked over the Dumpster to look at the people that walked passed the alley.  At the lead was a small boy in a red-and-white hat.  A Pikachu was riding on the boy's shoulder.  The second person was a girl with brown hair.  The third person was an even smaller boy with glasses.  The fourth and last person was a teenager with his eyes closed.  <br>\r\n         \"I thought you said this was a shortcut to Fortree City\"  said Red Hat.<br>\r\n          \"It is!\" said Glasses.  \"Fortree City is close to this city!\"<br>\r\n          The rest of the converseation faded as the people walked away from the alley.

He stepped out of the alley and wondered what to do next.<br>\r\n          \"Go to Fortree City\" said the voice in his head.<br>\r\n          \"Who are you?\" asked Eric aloud quietly.<br>\r\n         \"A person like you\" replied the voice.  \"a person that has been changed...\"<br>\r\n        \"Fortree City is five miles away\" said Eric.  \"how can you talk to me all the way from there?\"<br>\r\n       \"I'm psychic\" said the voice.  \"the name is Sally.

Why not follow those kids?  <br>\r\n          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The hulking form that was Amanda Wesson was making her way down a street.  The few people that were walking at night gave Amanda a wide berth.  Amanda Wesson was dressed in a black-and-red cloak, so her face was covered.  A tail emerged from under the cloak and was trailing after Amanda. <br>\r\n        \"Hello!\" said a voice behind Amanda.  <br>\r\n        Amanda Wesson turned around and saw a small boy with glasses.  The boy was being followed by three other people.<br>\r\n        \"Can you tell us where the pokemon center is?\" asked a boy in a red hat.  <br>\r\n         \"Just follow me\" said Amanda.  Her voice was more like a growl than anything.  The four young people followed Amanda.<br>\r\n           \"Hey, why do you have a tail?\" asked Glasses.<br>\r\n          \"None of your buiness\" said Amanda.<br>\r\n         Soon enough, Amanda came to the pokemon center.  <br>\r\n       \"Thank you\" said the girl with brown hair. <br>\r\n         \"Just tell them 'Amanda sent you' \" said Amanda.  \"and you'll have the best room in the place\"  And then, Amanda walked away, leaving the four people behind her rather puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

She was a tall Dragonair morph, and a total babe to boot.  Large, full, perky breasts barely restrained by a green bikini-top that matched the light mint-green of her long hair, left free and sparkling, half from the ocean spray and half from her own luminescence.  Her eyes were a sparkling blue, matching the crystalline orb protruding from her collar bone, one of the more distinctive marks of her species.  Her narrow waist was interrupted buy a matching green bikini bottom hugging her shapely hips and luscious legs.  Her long, lithe tail poked out of her back just above the fabric, winding its way to and fro along the length of her legs, the twin crystals near the tip resting on her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that\u2019s how most people would imagine the CEO of a company that produces various body-altering chemicals to look, isn\u2019t it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadow loomed over Prism.  She blinked open her eyes and smiled, looking up at her visitor.  It was her bodyguard, a ripped Charizard morph named Pyris.  Again, he looked like what you would expect an employee of the company would look like, but Pyris didn\u2019t like using the chemicals, instead wishing to rely only on his own strength.  Despite this fact, he still remained friends with Prism, despite the output of her company, though their friendship was a strange one at times.  He slid his sunglasses down his red-orange snout, revealing his blue-green eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019ve gotten enough sun, miss?\u201d he asked, a slightly serious tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism\u2019s eyes trailed up and down her visitor\u2019s body, pausing ever so briefly at the simple black shorts he wore. (Shorts, not trunks.  Charizard + Swimming = \u201cUmm\u2026. No.\u201d)  \u201cYou look good in those.  I ought to extend Casual Friday to the whole week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyris gave her a bit of a frumpled look.  Yeah, he liked her, but he was also very protective of her, epically with some of the religious and special-interest groups that were\u2026 nonplussed by her company\u2019s product.  \u201cI think we should get going,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism pouted, her snout cutely showing a little frown.  \u201cAww\u2026 Come on.

With a little bit of a sigh, Pyris dropped to a knee and ran a thick, knobby finger along the length of her forehead horn, and then he put it under her snout and raised it so they were looking into each other\u2019s eyes.  \u201cCome on, you know I\u2019m only looking out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism sighed a little and smiled, \u201c\u2026 yeah, I know.\u201d  She took a hold of his hand and pulled herself up, picking up her bag with her tail.  Arm-in-arm, the two morphs walked back to the car and Pyris drove the two back into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the two \u2018morphs stepped into the ground floor of the company\u2019s HQ, a tall skyscraper, the outer wall made completely of glass.  Pyris excused himself and walked over to a security door, \u201cI think you can handle yourself from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism giggled and waved, \u201cOk.  Seeya later, hunky!\u201d  She hurried off, nodding to the guard on duty and flashing him her ID from her bag, not like the CEO really needed it, but given the variable nature of her, or anyone\u2019s for that matter, appearance, it was good practice.  Prism stepped into the elevator and tapped the button.  Just as the doors closed, a chubby, light blue paw snuck its way into the closing doors.  Pushing them open, a plump Vapereon \u2018morph dressed in a white lab coat stepped in, her short-cut blue hair framing her rounded face nicely.  Her name was Victoria, and contrary to popular belief, she was the true brains behind the whole company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Prism had met in high school, back when they were just an Eevee and Dratini morph respectively, and become fast friends, going to the same college, Victoria majoring in Chemistry, and Prism in marketing.  One night during the spring semester, Victoria called her friend from one of the school\u2019s chemistry labs.  It was after hours; the Vaopreon \u2018morph had been working late on a special project of hers.  Prism bundled up and hurried over and discovered the weirdest thing she had ever seen.  There was Victoria\u2026 just twice as tall as normal.  She quickly explained that she was handling a bunch of chemicals when they spilled on her and\u2026 well, the result was fairly obvious.  Suddenly, Victoria got a wicked case of hiccups and shrunk back to normal size.  She sighed, thinking the worst was over, \u201cMan, that was weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me!\u201d Prism retorted.  She took a step forward and poked her friend\u2019s shoulder, just making sure she was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait, there could be residue!\u201d Victoria shouted, but it was too late.  Prism moaned and doubled over, arms over her chest.  Victoria kneeled down by her friend and saw what was happening to her.  Prism\u2019s chest was slowly swelling until her bosom had doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Prism got to her feet and looked down at her expanded breasts.  She hefted one, moaning softly again at the sensation.  The two friends looked at each other in silence for a while.  Prism hefted her new \u201cenhancements\u201d in each hand and let them fall, smiling at the sensation of them bouncing against her torso.  \u201cYou thinking what I\u2019m thinking of, Vi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus began a beautiful partnership.  Victoria kept experimenting with the chemicals until she could make the reactions consistent.  Prism worked with other firms and the FDA to get the chemical marketed and approved.  Now, just a few years later, the two were sitting on top of the most lucrative recreational drug on the market.  True, some of the chemicals had to be \u201cwatered down\u201d, so to speak; wouldn\u2019t want cities being leveled by 100 foot tall pokemorphs, but there were plenty of precautions in place, such as police forces being given anti-drugs, and athletic groups given a very simple how-to for drug testing.  There had been some close legal calls, but they had prevailed in the end.  Couldn\u2019t blame them for other people\u2019s stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the elevator, Vi pushed the doors back open and shuffled her zaftig form inside.  She turned to Prism, adjusting her glasses, and let out a muted, \u201cSorry.\u201d  She takes another look and smiles, her thick aquatic tail lifting happily. \u201cOh. Hello, Prism,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeya Vi!\u201d Prism replied, hugging her fat friend.  \u201cHow\u2019re things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria hugged back and said\u2026</span></div></div>",

Yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism snuggled against her friend for a moment before breaking the hug.  \u201cGreat.  Just got back from a warm day at the beach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard.  You have any fun with your hunky bodyguard?\u201d  Vi gave her friend a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism\u2019s snout darkened as she felt her face heat up in a blush.  \u201cNo!  Of course not!\u201d  She shuffled nervously.  \u201cHe\u2019s a security guard, I\u2019m the CEO.  I can\u2019t be dating him, it\u2019s\u2026 weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi laughed, her belly jiggling under her lab coat.  \u201cYou know what we\u2019re producing, and you\u2019re weirded out by a little office romance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism shuffles again.  \u201c\u2026you should come to the beach with us some time.  You do so much work here, you deserve a break.\u201d  She smiles a little.  \u201cAnd I know you enjoy swimming.\u201d  Ah, the classic defense.  If all else fails, change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi shrugs.  \u201cBut I like working on this.  I\u2019ve always loved chemistry, and this is a dream come true.  I\u2019m doing all sorts of things to help people.  Our muscle mass formula is used to help people with atrophy after long recovery periods.  Plus there\u2019s all the people using out drugs to help realize their fantasies.\u201d  She looks down a bit, slightly embarrassed at this.  She\u2019s used them that way herself, but it\u2019s still a bit weird for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism sighs, but keeps smiling.  \u201cYou\u2019re right, as usual, but you should think about taking a break, too.  A little rest never hurt anyone.  Plus, you\u2019re my friend.  We should hang out more often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVi nods and smiles sheepishly, but before she can say anything, the elevator dings and the doors open.  \u201c\u2026this is my floor.\u201d  She walks out, but holds the door open with her tail.  Vi turned back to Prism and said, \u201cHow about we go out on the town later?  Girls night out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism grinned warmly, \u201cI\u2019d love that.  I\u2019ll talk to you later then, ok?  You know where to find me.\u201d  The doors started to close when she shouted out a quick, \u201cSay \u2018Hi\u2019 to the guys in the lab for me, ok?\u201d  She winked as the doors closed, cutting off any response from Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator continued upwards until it reached the top floor, Prism\u2019s personal floor, containing her living quarters, which had plenty of room for a penthouse party, as well as a small work area, though her official office was one floor beneath her.  She stepped out of the elevator into the well-furnished area.  The afternoon sun was brightly illuminating the rest of the cityscape, the sunlight reaching into the rooms through the windows which made up the outer wall of the floor.  As she walked into the center of the floor, she slipped out of her bikini, wanting to take a shower before getting to work.  The bathroom was in the middle of the floor, and had solid, opaque walls, for obvious reasons.  Before slipping into the shower, as a force of habit, she took a dose of a reverser chemical.  This chemical was designed to undo any changes done to a person by her company\u2019s product.  When the reverser was done Prism looked \u2026</span></div></div>",

In its wake, her trim body shrunk a few inches in height, but gained more than that in girth. Her already substantial bust expanded into fleshy melons, lengthened under their weight; a plush gut replaced her formerly trim and toned tummy; her curvy hips gained their share as well, taking her round butt along till it looked like she was wearing couple of pillows wrapped around her legs; even her face and neck gained some weight, softening till she had a cute double chin resting on her softer neckline. Overall, she had somewhat maintained her hourglass figure, just as a much larger hourglass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, this all happened in the few seconds between Prism drinking the reverser and stepping into the shower. Prism had gotten so used to the shifting of her body that she didn\u2019t miss a step. Turning the water on, she left it on the cooler side, enjoying the feeling of the water splashing across her body and rinsing away the residual warmth from her transformation. As she washed up, her mind drifted back to think of the preceding years that led to her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when Prism and Victoria had started their work with the transformatives, the Dragonair had been slender as typical of her species, though her breasts had been a bit larger than average. Years of late night preparations for meetings, all of the traveling, eating whatever she could whenever she could, and little to no time to go to a gym all had their impact on her weight, and before she knew it she had ballooned up to nearly twice her starting weight from just those few years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have certainly done something about her weight now, but she had to admit that she kind of enjoyed it. She had come to savor the weight of her bloated breasts to the feeling of her soft thighs rubbing together as she walked, but she had to maintain an image of \u201cbeauty\u201d as the head of the head of the company, so she dutifully took a regular dosage of the chemical cocktails in order to hide away her true form within the svelte body expected of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick twist, she shut off the water, shaking her head to get rid of some of the water still clinging to her hair. Stepping out and grabbing a towel near at hand, she quickly dried off and got ready for the rest of her day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Prism stumbled forward slightly as the transformation by the reverser caused her center of gravity to shift forwards. The reversion, as the process was called, didn't take long- three seconds at the most. Once that was done, Prism looked at herself in the full body mirror, to make sure everything had fully reverted. Victoria had said that a partial reversion was impossible, but it never hurt to be careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Prism truly looked like was very different than the form she took to go out in the world. She was a good foot shorter, her throat gem was gone, her wings were actually feelers, her tail became shorter, two wings sprouted from her back, and her entire body became tan. In actuality, Prism wasn't a Dragon<i>air</i>, but a Dragon<i>ite</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer height and species wasn't the only thing that had changed, however. Prism shifted her feet to a wider stance as her breasts, which now hung down to her knees, forced her to do in order to remain standing. Prism had once had her breast size measured while like this. She knew that she was far beyond conventional measurements, but seeing the number 35 followed by a whopping <i>fifteen</i> Ds really drove it home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for how this happened, well, that deserves another flashback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because of the chemicals, as you'd expect. Prism and Victoria had agreed to wait until after college to start their business. Between the night of their discovery and graduation, both girls had evolved. They'd graduated together, and bought a house, onto which they'd built a lab. It was in this lab that Prism had became what she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relatively peaceful summer day. Victoria had finalized the formula for a breast expansion chemical. However, at that point it was unknown to the duo what would happen if they took multiple chemicals at the same time, and Victoria was still under the effects of a muscle enhancement chemical, so Prism tested it. The finalized formula worked perfectly, putting Prism at her current breast size. They did some basic tests to ensure that the growth was close enough to natural (it was), and it was time to take the reverser. Just as Prism's hand brushed the beaker the reverser was in, she was suffused by a white glow. Prism was too started by her sudden evolution to stop it. Once Prism realized what was happening, her evolution was too late to stop. Once she'd finished evolving, Prism took the reverser. Nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism was shook out of her memory by the sound of knocking at her door. She yelled out \"Just a minute!\" and put on the bathrobe she kept for situations like this. Only a small number of people were allowed to even be on this level, and an even smaller number allowed to knock on Prism's door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrism finished tying her bathrobe and walked ponderously to the door- any faster and her oversized breasts would flop around and break something- most likely Prism herself. She opened the door (which swung outwards) and greeted her guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer guest was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her fingers played along the edge of it, following the curve of one puffy cheek.  She sighed again.  She was definitely on the heavier side of the scale, weighing 193 pounds.  True, part of the additional weight was due to her long, thick tail, but she definitely had a bit of a belly.  Its white scales pudged out a bit over the waistband of her pants, a \u201cloose\u201d pair of jeans that hugged her equally ample rear and hips.  She was just thankful that she was sensible enough to wear clothes that actually fit her, as opposed to some \u2018morphs, who were in constant denial.  Her green t-shirt was just the right size for her, highlighting where is should, and hiding her belly and love handles fairly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe mulled back to high school.  She wasn\u2019t nearly as heavy back then; in fact, she was one of the prettier girls in school, with long blue hair and stunning green eyes.  Unlike the other good-looking girls, though, she didn\u2019t really try to take advantage of her looks.  Instead, she put her snout to the grindstone and studied hard.  She graduated with honors and had pretty much a free ride through college.  However, all the late night cram sessions with pizza and energy bars and time sitting at her desk doing homework took their toll on her as she without a doubt made the freshman 15.  The rest of her college career found her on a yo-yo weight scale, continually losing and gaining back pounds as she tried various different diets.  Now, being 23 and employed behind another desk at a programming firm, she was now at her latest high point in her weight.  This put her at a little bit of unease, considering this being an island resort, but there were more than a few women even heavier than her, so she shouldn\u2019t worry, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDratina sighed again as the bus pulled up to the main entrance of the resort complex.  It was a beautiful white structure with red brick shingles.  A large circular fountain adorned the center of the circular driveway, surrounded with luscious tropical flowers.  Similar flowers sat in front of the building.  The whole place had a very Mediterranean feel to it, perfect for a coastal resort.  The guests, both male and female were led inside into an opulently decorated lobby.  There stood a smarmy Alakazam \u2018morph in a white suit, practically oozing suave charm.  \u201cHello, everyone, and welcome to Morphia!\u201d he said in warm greeting.  \u201cAs your host, allow me to welcome you to the most exclusive Pokemorph resort on the planet.\u201d  Be bowed, and put on a look of mock horror, \u201cBut our guests must be tired!  Please, if you wish, you may head directly to your rooms.  Your bags will already be waiting.  For those of you who feel up to it, I will be leading a tour personally of the buildings and sights on the island for our guests.  Never fear, though, as there will be more tours later for those of you who wish to retire for the moment.\u201d  He waves harms to the side, pointing at some doors, \u201cThose of you who wish to go on the tour can follow me out the side doors.  Those of you who wish to go to your rooms will follow some of our staff to the residence areas to get you all set and settled in.\u201d  On cue, a pair of twin-looking morphs, a male Minun and female Plusle, step down the large center staircase and into the room, cheerfully walking over to the doors opposite the ones the Alakazam was standing by and bowing to the guests.  Looking around at the other guests, Dratina decides to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that she wasn\u2019t feeling quite up to a tour of the resort, Dratina moved with the majority of the group towards the Minun and Plusle. As the rest of the new guests followed the Alakazam through one of the side doors, the Dratini felt like she was being watched. Glancing over, she saw two \u2018morphs looking her way; one was a tall and rather well muscled male Arcanine, while the other was an even taller and exceptionally fat female Lugia. Both were quickly out of sight though as they followed with the tour group. After nearly bumping into the rear end of a Nidoqueen because of the distraction, Dratina shook her head and kept her mind on where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the group was led down a number of halls by the twins, each checking names off of clipboards and directing people to their rooms. Any attempts of Dratina to start small talk with another guest ended up as  only a slight mutter under her breath, her shyness winning out every time, so she merely kept her head down and followed along. The number of people dwindled as more guests were directed to their rooms, till Dratina was one of the last remaining. Finally, her name was called and her room pointed out. Breaking off, she took the offered key from the Plusle before opening the door and slipping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the door behind her, she let out a small gloomy sigh, cursing her timidity. When she finally looked up, she let out another gasp, this time in surprise. She had been expecting a well decorated room judging from what she had seen of the resort, but this was quite a bit beyond her expectations. A lavish queen size bed was against one wall, set so that the foot was towards French doors that opened out onto a small exterior balcony. This in turn overlooked the beach a short distance away, a few guests enjoying the bright sunlight and the crystal clear waters lapping at the white sands. Tearing her gaze away, she continued her examination of her room. On several of the walls she found large and fantastic paintings, seemingly of views from around the resort and the island. The bathroom was similarly decorated and included a whirlpool bath and shower combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDratina hadn\u2019t quite been expecting the resort to be so luxurious, especially with them giving away free invitations to it. The thought of how much the upkeep at the resort must cost and entail left the woman\u2019s head spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that thought aside and heading back into the main room, she found that her bags had indeed already been brought up; a large suitcase with a few smaller travel bags neatly placed against the wall. A quick inspection there showed no signs of abuse done to her luggage or rough handling; toiletries were all in place and not leaking, clothes were still nicely folded, and so on. She went ahead and finished unpacking, putting her clothes in the closet and dresser. That done, the Dratini decided to follow through on her initial plan, i.e. resting up after the trip out to the island. Climbing onto the bed, she found it to be just as comfortable as she had thought: soft yet supporting in just the right spots. Propped up at the head of the bed, she was able to look down over her body at the view of the beach outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have dozed off shortly thereafter because the next thing she knew she was jolted awake by a loud noise. She figured that she must have been asleep for a while considering the sun was now dipping below the horizon, making the sea blaze as if afire. As she tried to get her head back in order, the noise came again, and this time she recognized it as a knock on the door. Scooting off the bed, she groggily made her way to the door and took a peek through the peephole.</span></div></div>",

The dinner will be held in about half-an-hour on the main patio out of the main rear doors of this building. It is not a requirement for you to come if you wish not to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbing her head again, she scurried off to the next door without waiting for any response from Dratina. She watched the staff person repeat the process with the next guest for a moment before slipping back inside her room. She was feeling a bit peckish \u2013 a fact that her stomach decided to remind her with a hungry grumble \u2013 so after a brief stop in the bathroom, she exited her room and headed towards the rear patio. Along the way, she was joined by some of the other guests heading the same way, but again kept to herself with her head slightly down. Outside, the mood was festive; light music was playing, torches were lit and assisted with other soft lighting to dispel the onset of night as the sun dipped ever lower, the sky was clear and the air was balmy, and most people were chatting happily amongst themselves. A majority of the tables were already filled up, so Dratina was forced to take a seat at an empty table near the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, she looked around at the other guests enjoying themselves. Just like on the bus ride, there was quite a mix of people, and this was even evident in the clothing; some that were recent arrivals\u2013 like Dratina \u2013 wore what was likely the clothes they wore on the trip here, while others were in various forms of beachwear, ranging from the sensible to the nearly scandalous. She also noted that there was no sign of either of the two that she thought were looking her way earlier, maybe they had decided not to come to the event. She caught herself and wondered why she was even looking for those two now. Her examination was cut short when their debonair host stepped up on a small podium and motioned for quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, one and all, and again welcome to our latest arrivals. Thank you all for coming to this little event. Those of you who have been here for a while may know that this is a regular occurrence to let everyone meet and greet as many of you are already doing and give our newest guests a further taste of what they can expect at our fine location. Now I won\u2019t keep you any longer, I know some of you are likely getting a might hungry, so without further ado\u2026\u201d he waved his hands towards some of the resort staff standing nearby, who proceeded to move amongst the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the staff darted to and fro, they collected orders before returning shorting with plates of food for each person. From what Dratina could see, the food looked exquisite as she had been expecting, as was the smells that wafted her way from all directions as more and more people got their food. Her stomach made its displeasure known again, irritated by the wonderful smells but not being filled yet. The conversations dwindled but didn\u2019t completely cease. The Dratini had the rather unfortunate luck of being on the opposite side from where the staff had started out, so it was taking a while before she could get some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore this could happen though, a shadow fell over Dratina from behind, and a voice asked her, \u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the person addressing her, she found\u2026</span></div></div>",

Past a hefty-looking belly and sizable pair of breasts, Dratina was met with the gentle smile of a Lugia. The same one from earlier, in fact. Dratina turned away. \"No, go ahead,\" she sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lugia giggled. \"Thank you, dear.\" She then circled around the table till she was directly across from Dratina and sat down. Dratina, fighting down her bashfulness, forced herself to look the Lugia in the eye. They were a dark blue, and conveyed the same vague sense of gentleness her smile had. Her short, straight blonde hair hung down to her jawline and framed her chubby face rather nicely. She probably took good care of her appearance. So did her sense of fashion, it seemed. Her violet blouse looked comfortable, if a bit form-fitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing she should probably say something, Dratina nodded softly. \"Sure,\" she mumbled, \"no problem.\" She glanced over to the staff. They were only just getting to the center of the patio. How much longer before they got to her table?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dratina turned back to the Lugia. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"Just needed some time away from everything, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lugia nodded, her smile now even softer. \"Then it's a good thing you got an invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dratina snorted. \"No kidding.\" She gestured to the general area around them. \"You know anything about this place? I've never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lugia shook her head. \"Neither have I. Maybe it's new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe. We'll have to ask.\" Dratina checked the staff again. Getting closer, but still a ways off from them. A moment of silence passed between them. She readjusted herself a little. More silence. \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She fidgeted again. \"When we got off the bus earlier, you, um...\" Instead of picking up on her intent, like she hoped, the Lugia just waited silently. With a sigh, she continued, \"Well, maybe I was mistaken, but... Look, what I'm trying to ask is: Were you looking at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lugia's answer came almost instantly: \"I was.\" Her smile faltered. \"Why? Does that bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The answer was \"yes\", but simply saying so struck Dratina as rude. \"I was just wondering why, is all,\" she said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah.\" The Lugia looked away. Probably hungry, or even starving. A large woman like her no doubt had quite the appetite. Or maybe her size was a genetic quirk. Dratina wanted to ask, but this also struck her as rude. Then again, so was this woman not answering her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like, was it just an accident?\" Dratina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sort of,\" the Lugia replied, turning back to her. \"It's funny, really. I saw all sorts of women on the bus, but I was still surprised to see someone who reminded me of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean me?\" Surely Dratina wasn't <i>that</i> fat, was she? Yeah, the difference in height had to be taken into account, but her muffintop couldn't have been as bad as the Lugia's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er, I meant a younger me.\" The Lugia giggled nervously. There must have been a slight edge in Dratina's voice. Whoops \"Sorry, I should have clarified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh.\" She shrugged. \"Well, I really shouldn't be offended. I mean--\" Dratina hefted up her belly \"--I'm not exactly svelte here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lugia's smile returned. \"I wasn't criticizing you. Honestly, I was about the same size when I was younger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Younger?\" Dratina's head tilted a bit to the side. How old was this lady?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, younger,\" the Lugia said, her smile turning coy. \"But don't expect me to tell you my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean it. Not even a teeny little hint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dratina laughed. \"Oh well.\" She leaned back. \"So, back to me reminding me of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, yes!

Not Sissy's uncle. He had the gall to leave a business to his favorite little niece. A business he had run almostsinglehandedly. Which was also a dairy farm. In the ass-end of nowhere. Actually, Sissy had passed the ass-end of nowhere a while back, she was in some ultra-nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSissy was literally the uncle's littlest niece. She was everyone's littlest everything. A sandshrew morph, she barely stood 4'4'', and looked almost like a child. Not that she'd ever admit it, but she actually wore a training bra because the extra padding helped prove she had a bust. Size 0 skinny jeans clung to a diminutive bottom. Despite her tiny stature, she had no problem picking up two giant suitcases and walking towards the ranch. The wind toyed with her many brown braids. She reached the steps to what was clearly the main building. She put down the bags and began to fumble around, looking for a key. Then, the door opened of it's own accord. Sissy's world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy! Huh? I thought I heard someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph, murf mph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh!\" A milktank morph stepped back from the doorway, releasing Sissy's head from her cleavage. The woman wore naught but a giant T-shirt left open then tied together to act as a giant bra. She had a pair of udders (not literal udders, you putzes) reaching halfway down her torso. Sissy was cussing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell-ass was that? Who the f--k are you? Holy s--t.\" the size of the woman's tits dawned on Sissy. The girl was also pretty tall, about 6 foot, but to Sissy that made her a giant. The woman just giggled, pigtails bouncing (her tits weren't bouncing. They were quaking like jello on a stormy sea). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! That happens a lot. I'm still new here. Well, not too knew obviously.\" she said, patting her breasts. Sissy's eyes went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at her, surprised</span></div></div>",

She tried again, this time bending down and tilting, so that Sissy could reach, between her height and the other girl's bust. Sissy shook her hand, and then wiped it off as soon as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you work here? You worked for my uncle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Gerald's niece! D'awwwwww!\" the girl grabbed for Sissy. Before she knew it, Sissy was swept off her feet in a bear hug, squeezed in between two pink tankards.

Or, more accurately, dropped. She sighed. At least she liked the ground. Finally, she got up and turned around. Behind her, Maura stepped forward, the underside of her tits resting against Sissy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy f--king hell.\" Sissy said. In front of her were green pastures, a barn,even a stream winding its way through. The pastures were fenced off, and in them grazed dozens of regular Milktank. Well, regular as in non-anthro. They were the fattest pokemon Sissy had ever seen. They could barely reach the grass to eat it. They looked content as all get out. But the people drew Sissy's eyes. The heat made their minimal clothing kind of understandable. Their bodies....well, to be fair, some of them looked normal. Kind've normal. Most of the men, at least, though a couple were truly ripped. But there were a few girls there as well. One of them tits bigger than Maura's by a long shot. One's were only kinda big, but man did she have an ass. There were seven employees, and Maura made eight. Three guys, five girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what in the nine cream-filled layers of hell is going on here.\" Sissy asked.</span></div></div>",

Other sisters might jockey for position or at least be bothered by the tight fit, but not Penny and Jenny. Penny, a plusle (the alliteration being the only way anyone remembered) and Jenny, a minun, could only just be told apart by the tips of their ears or their flushed/pale cheek spots. The two girls gave their mother two identical smiles. Their mother smiled back weakly. The girls weirded even her out. They were inseparable, and seemed to be exactly the same girl in most regards. They had hit puberty at the same time, and now at 16 both wore healthy C-cup bras, 30'' waist jeans, and stood exactly 5'6''. But more than that, they had the same taste in food, movies, pastimes....there were small things, like how Penny preferred caramel with her ice cream while Jenny liked butterscotch, but it was still uncanny.

Oh, and one more thing. I want you two to try to get out more okay? It's great that you get along so well, but if it was up to you you'd never see anyone else. You should find yourself - yourselves - a couple of boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to start dating while you're gone?\" Penny asked with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying you two could do with a little more socialization. Don't stay cooped up in your room together all summer, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\" the girls said in unison.

You would think after recently evolving into a Machoke morph, the 16 year old would have ended up bigger; especially in the family she was in. Jasper was a very rare case. Normally all Pok\u00e9mon born from eggs take after the female. However, Jasper took after her father. Her mother was a Infernape, while her father was a Machoke; meaning she was born a Machop. Machops are generally small, but not as small as she was. She stood about a foot smaller than those of her kind. What was worse was that she never even had the strength to make up for it; her smaller size made her have weaker muscles. This made her miserable, it was like she never got anything from her parents. Her Infernape mother was not just strong, but beautiful. Her beautiful crafted amazon body was only coupled by her beautiful curves. She was a world renowned fighter, had championship titles in over three countries, and had been on the cover for over several magazines involving both muscle/fitness and modelling. Her father was a bodybuilding Machamp, whose height and muscles mass surpassed most of his species by over two feet. He was also well known, but more for his performance on his competitions. So how was it that being born from these two titans meant she was both flat as a board and weaker than her own kind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, her siblings did not make it any better. Truthfully, she only had one real sibling. But her mother adopted a young child while in one of her country tournaments. She was the second youngest of the three. Her two year older sister, Ina, was a Monferno who was not only taller than her but looked like her mother; beautiful. While she never spoke or said anything to make Jasper feel bad, just having her mother's beautiful body was enough. Then it was her adopted brother, Jang. He was a Makuhita about two years younger than her. Sure he was round, but he was bigger and more muscular than she was! And he never even evolved yet! To make matters worse, he was the bragger. He made her life a living hell. He even had his own entourage at the school, making her life even more miserable. All she ever wanted was to get bigger and stronger. Little did she know that...</span></div></div>",

Ina looked up from her book, seeing Jang walk in after her. \"Hey come one! I was only joking! There's no way you can even beat up a Magikarp!\" He laughed at his own joke as another door slam was heard upstairs; Jasper's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna made a small sigh, \"Jang, couldn't you tone down your ruffian behavior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry four eyes, try asking me when Weachoke gains muscle mass for once!\" The Makuhita laughed as he exited the house while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIna could not take this anymore. She wasn't one to get into a fight, but watching her little sister being harassed so much is her end point. She took her glasses off, put her book down, then went upstairs. She gently knocked on her sister's bedroom door, \"Sis? You alright?\" The only response she got was crying. Ina took it upon herself to enter. There was Jasper, crying her eyes out on her bed. Ina sat down on beside her, \"Jasper, you cannot let Jang get to you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say!\" Jasper spoke, looking at her sister with those blue eyes turned red. \"You have mom's beauty! I have nothing! No beauty, no muscle, no nothing!\" She cried more, \"I just want to be bigger...at least bigger than Jang!\" Jasper wasn't ugly per say, she just lacked any curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister sighed once more, \"Jasper...I think I know something that can help you.\" Her younger sister looked up.</span></div></div>",

And since I haven\u2019t seen any other stories with Pokemorphs, I figure I\u2019ll try to cater this one to some of the various groups we have here on writing.com, more info in chapter 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMain rules:<br>\r\n-No death/gore, violence is ok in the scope of a pokemon/morph battle<br>\r\n-No rape, with minors or otherwise<br>\r\n-No story poaching/killing.  I will prune if I have to.<br>\r\n-Keep it sensible.  No \"OMG GAIN 5000 POUNDS/3000 FEET/etc...\" kinds of chapters.  They're ok in some cases if they're well written, but this is a /story/, try to draw it out a bit more, mmm'kay?<br>\r\n-When adding chapters, make sure that the two choices are actually different.  Making the choices \"Burger King\" and \"Taco Bell\" are not different!  They are both resturants, and it doesn't really matter, save for some instances.  If you can't really think of something else, just leave it as \"Something Else\" and let the next person figure it out.<br>\r\n-Have fun and contribute. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: November 2010<br>\r\nI LIIIIIIIIVE!  Also, I did a little pruning.  Thanks to those who have been making additions...  Haven't had to prune too much, which is a good thing.  Thinking about rewarding people for additions... If you've made a number of additions lately, feel free to message me an I can toss some GP your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, pimping for a friend - If you like this, you'll also enjoy the following: \"<a href=\"\" title=\"\" target=\"_top\">Invalid Item</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></td>",
