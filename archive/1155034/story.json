He thought it would be even better to be so large that all other animals were the size of ants to him.  He kept on growing until until even the elephants and giraffes in the zoo were barely distinguishable from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to teach the humans a lesson for keeping him captive.  They had called him the king of the jungle.  Now he would show them what it was like to have a lion as the king of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to a city he saw in the distance.  There were many fleeing people in his path on the way there.  The lion thought they should be honored to be crushed beneath his regal paws as he created his own red carpet.  When he arrived at the city the people were already fleeing.  It would have been hard to miss a 11000 foot tall lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion decided to take his fill of his subjects.  He began licking the humans up.  At his size it was not that difficult, his rough tongue combined with the saliva on it was able to easily pick up close to a hundred people with each lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed some of the humans were running into their buildings.  He thought they had been scared stupid if they think they can hide or seek shelter in those tiny things.  It was easy enough to bite through most buildings and swallow them and the building.  Some of the larger buildings required a different strategy.  They would have been easy enough to knock over, the largest one was less than a tenth his height, but then getting to the pulverized humans in the rubble would have been more trouble than it was worth.  He found that if he gave the buildings a few gentle wallops the humans would come flooding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one of the buildings, after hitting it he placed his tongue  at one of the entrances.  It was actually a surprise to feel humans on it.  He could not see whether it was because they were to scared to notice or if it was due to them being pushed by others who could not see where they were going.  When he felt the direction of the crowd begin to reverse he drew his tongue back into his mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the lion had finished there were only a few human survivors.  They had either managed to flee or were good at finding places to hide.  The lion wondered what he should do now that he is full.</span></div></div>",

It was time to find some prey of his own.  Humans had always smelled tasty to him.  Thus he went in search of some of the humans that had fled his initial escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large group was easy enough to find in a large stone structure in the zoo.  Getting in was proving to another matter.  Even at his size breaking into a thick walled stone structure was not an easy task.  Now that the panther can change his own size that problem is easily solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther begins to increase his size until he is about 100 feet tall.  It then easily tears the roof off of the building.  Some of the people try to flee the building, but they had blocked most of the entrances with things in the building to keep the panther from getting in.  The panther just straddles the building and blocks the front and back entrances with his paws encase they can get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the objects against the doors it is easy enough to begin lapping up the humans.  The panther savors the taste of the first group of humans, rolling them on his tongue and and licking them against the roof of his mouth.  They taste even better than he could have imagined.  He then begins to devour every human within easy reach and soon the only ones left are those that had been moving the stuff away from the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther thinks that it would be fun to play with his food a little first.  He lifts up his left paw just enough to let some people think they can escape.  When they try to flee he lowers his paw onto them and enjoys them struggling to remove the weight of his paw.  He angles his paw so they can flee back into the building.  The panther then does the same trick with his right paw except he lowers the paw completely to the ground crushing most of that group of people beneath his paw.  What was left of that group fled toward the center of the building.  The panther licked the remains off his paw and turned his attention to the remaining humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught all of them in his mouth.  Then he just sat there and let them try to escape their pink prison.  He left his teeth parted enough for some of the people to try to push their way out through his lips, but the weight of his lips was to much for the tiny humans and he eventually lowered your teeth onto them.  Apparently the sound of bones being crushed (it would have been to dark to see inside his mouth) caused some of the humans to stumble to far back in his mouth and right down his throat.  This caused him to gag and swallow the rest of the humans to.</span></div></div>",

That probably would have killed me the panther thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to make himself big enough to counter this new threat.  The tank crew was amazed to see the already titanic panther soar to at least 800 feet in height.  The tank fired one more shot at the panther before it was crushed by a single toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shot did not do any real damage to the panther as the shot impacted the sensitive pad on his foot.  It still stung though.  So the panther grew himself an additional 200 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal in his stomach did not get any larger and this left him starving.  He looked around and saw that he had demolished most of the cages in the zoo and many of the animals were free.  There were no humans left in the zoo though.  But, at 1000 feet in height it is not that difficult to spot thousands of humans fleeing in the distance.  There is not much he cannot see over now.</span></div></div>",

The panther grows the female panther to 800 feet in height and the cub to 600 feet in height.  He did not want them so big they would eat all of his humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out he was worried for nothing.  They each spotted different groups of humans to pursue.  The panthers each wandered off after their own meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male panther easily caught up to his humans.  He never even had to run.  He always new humans were slow creatures, but at his size they may as well have been standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther traps the humans between buildings that he knocks over in the paths they are fleeing on.  This done, he can lay down and savor his meal.  He places both of his front paws on a part, applying just enough pressure not to crush them. He then laps up the portion of the crowd that is within reach of his tongue, taking hundreds of people into his maw with each lick and swallowing them.  He also licks up any of the humans that had been trying to crawl over his legs.  He needed to clean his legs anyways the panther thought to himself.  As he stood up to move forward he crushed those beneath his paws.  Then he repeated the process with the next segment of terrified humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gets to the last segment of humans he once again decides to enjoy himself.  He laps them up like before, but leaves his lips parted enough to give them some light.  This turns out to be a mistake as he notices a few of the people take the leap from his lips to the ground a couple hundred feet below.  The panther instantly clenches his teeth, putting an end to anyone who happened to be in that location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did like the feeling on his tongue as the people crowded against his teeth and tried to squirm in between them.  The panther decided to test their grip on his teeth.  The people in the panthers maw began to claw franticly at the teeth as the panther started to slowly tilt his head back.  Despite their efforts, they began to lose their grips and fell into the cavernous gullet of the monstrous black beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther was surprised he still felt a few people hanging on to his teeth when his head was tilted straight up into the air.  He was starting to feel full.  So he decided to make reward them for their efforts.  He let them out of his mouth.  The humans, no more than a dozen, were still scared and covered in panther saliva but actually were not in that bad a shape.  They watch the panther depart and pass out once they can no longer feel the tremors from the panthers paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther finds what he is looking for.  A nice sunny area were he can sleep of his meal.  With a full belly he quickly dozes of to sleep.  He does not wake for a good 12 hours.  He stretches and yawns as he wakes, showing the world his building sized fangs.  He then notices what must be a human army preparing to greet him.</span></div></div>",

This only served to further enrage the panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers had heard of the panthers size changing ability, some had even seen it on the news as the panther had devoured the cities population, including the cameramen.  But seeing it in person was a completely different thing.  Nothing could have mentally prepared them for the shock of seeing the panther more than quintuple in size.  They were barely prepared for the 1000 foot tall panther, and now a one mile tall panther stood before them.  The idea of fighting this monster seemed as ludicrous as ants fighting an elephant.  The panthers enormous paw hovered over the soldiers and began to descend.  The soldiers new there was no escape as they watched the paw come down on them and they began to make out that even the hairs on the paw were thicker than trees and more than enough to crush a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther was slow to lower his paw.  He wanted to make them regret opposing him.  Prey should flee from the predator, not come right up to him.

He hears many large groups of humans headed away from him.  This is much more like proper prey.  He begins to head for what sounds like the largest group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the panther approaches the group he notices they are starting to move slower and slower.  He wonders why this should happen until he gets within visual range of them.  He notices that as his paws hit the ground he is causing what must be small earthquakes to the humans.  Many of the humans structures begin to crumble at his approach and the humans are having trouble standing, running is just not possible for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther notices that he cannot make out individual humans at his size.  They would probably be safer if they disperse, he would not even notice a single human.  But the humans seem to have a herding instinct, it is like they think numbers will give them a degree of safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to take the humans into his maw.

Some of the humans gave up hope of escaping, after all it would only take the panther a couple of seconds to walk the same distance in a couple of seconds as Olympic runner could run in an hour.  But even more people were driven on by blind panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther decided to make a game out of it.  He tried to see how many humans he could fit in his mouth at the same time.  A quarter of the crowd was in his mouth before they started spilling out.  Some of the people in his mouth had held out hope that the panther would not swallow them, but with his curiosity satisfied those people found themselves descending the panther's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not take long to finish off the crowd and he is still hungry.  They were only about four mouth fulls after all.  He takes a moment to lay down, inadvertently crushing a couple of survivors beneath his mountain like body, and clean himself off.

On his way there the panther crushed small groups of people, no more than a dozen in size.  The panther did not notice or did not care about what happened to those people.

He picked one up with his mouth, tossed it into the air, and caught it in his mouth again before swallowing.  He balanced the next human on the tip of his snout like he had seen some humans do with dogs and then snapped him up after a couple of seconds.  The iguana used one of his claws like a fork on the third human, impaling it on the tip of a claw, raising it to his mouth, and licking it off the claw and into his mouth.  On the fourth human the iguana decided to combine two of the boy's likes and crushed the human beneath a toe and licked up the remains.  With the final human the iguana tried chewing up the human which was a difficult thing to do since his jaw was not designed to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy applauded the iguana after each act and asked the iguana to do more.

To their horror the iguana began to deliberately crush everything around it.  Dozens of people were crushed with each step of the scaled foot.

The people noticed the iguana did not bother to chew his food and some thought it may be better to be crushed than to be digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iguana and the boy were having the time of their lives.  It was fun chasing down the people and crushing them beneath his foot.  The iguana really liked the crunching sound a large group of humans made when being crushed.  There was something that puzzled him though.  Some of the humans were carrying objects that made a loud noise and he sometimes felt tiny impacts against his thick hide after the noise.  All the noise served to do was bring his attention to the humans that had made the noise.  If he were fleeing from something much larger than himself, he would try to be as quiet as possible.</span></div></div>",

The croc wonders what to do that will get the humans to come out of the bus so it will not have to eat it to.  Then, inspiration hits.  It puts the bus on the ground.  The croc then lowers its scaly foot onto the bus and begins to slowly apply pressure.  Sure enough, the people start to flee the bus avoid being crushed.  A couple of people were too paralyzed with fear to get out and wound up being crushed with the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour bus driver had managed to pull a rifle out of the bus with him and tried to get of a few shots at the croc.  It did no good however.  Even at the crocs normal size bullets would have had a hard time penetrating its hide.  At the crocs current size it did not even notice the impact of the bullets against its thick hide.  The noise just brought the attention of the croc directly to the driver.  What followed looked like a recreation of a scene from the movie \"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms.\"  The croc bit down on the driver with half his body sticking out of his jaws kicking wildly into the air.  The croc tossed him up in the air and snapped him up in mid air.

Another fell to her back hoof, in a similar fashion, the only difference was that they got to look up and see the monolith above them move away before they saw the hoof descending on their world. The rest watched with baited breath as she took another step forward. She didn't crush any with that one, but she did stop after it. They watched her bend her back legs, as she made to sit down. The cities underneath her could only watch as the mare above them sat down. Her rear spreading slightly as the movement made the flesh jiggle slightly. Her rump made contact with the ground, and with it, more than three cities found there end under the warm plot of the mare. With a wiggle, she made sure that not a soul survived under her rump. She then proceeded to lower the front half of her body, then laying more on her side. The few citied underneath her could see everything, as she blocked out the sun for them.

Flopping onto her side, she let another sigh out, as she lay there soaking in the sun. Her skin tingled, and her fur gently swayed in the wind. She leaned up after a minute and looked up at her herd. Thinking about letting them know about the spot, she focused on one of the spots from before. She could only see it since she was so close, so she lifted a hoof.

It didn't get anywhere near, but that was enough to convince everyone they needed a safer location.  Thankfully, the Ferguson's apple orchard was just by the town square, so it only took a week of travel to reach it.  After another week of climbing, they reached a thick branch with plenty of massive, juicy apples for food.  Each summer, half the town would carefully climb onto one of the red orbs, and spend the next few months harvesting and mining the fruit.

Grassy fields spread all throughout the world, leaving plenty for them to feed on.  Humans, animals, even insects were all shrunk to a near invisible size, giving the equines full dominance over all the land.  Yes, life was quiet and uneventful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo uneventful.  The horse huffs, it's been a while since something interesting has popped up. Human settlements have been harder and harder to find, all the ones in the open have been unknowingly crushed, and the rest are hiding too well.  The female horse walks under an apple tree, slurping up some water from a puddle underneath it.  She notices a shiny red apple, and stretches her neck out to grab a bite.  That's when she notices the tiny specks atop the fruit.  A quick sniff confirmed it: these were humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and the others were frozen in fear.  A monstrous pink worm slithered out of the horse's mouth, lapping up a pool's worth of water in a single slurp.  The drinking horse unknowingly created 'small' waves, which traveled toward the apple.  A few workers were busy lashing together rafts at the shore, and didn't notice the massive surge until it was too late.  The crashing wave sucked them out into the open water, where they were taken into the horse's mouth.  Sam knew there was no survival for them.  Suddenly, the horse's eye looked forward and locked onto the red apple.  The massive maw rose above the water, and loomed towards them.  The muzzle stopped just an inch away from the terrified workers, who watched in slight confusion.  Before anyone could act, a short burst of wind sucked another worker off the fruit and into the cavernous nostril.  As he lay on the ground, Sam noticed that the world was getting smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse grew the apple to about ten times its size, and got a better look at the humans.  They were all wearing the same clothing, and seemed to have built structures out of the apple.  Mildly impressed, she thinks about what to do with her new playthings.</span></div></div>",

She concentrates on the apple and its passengers, letting it slowly shrink down.  She continues past their original size, eventually turning them microscopic.  Thanks to her gift, she was still able to see the infinitesimal humans.  Satisfied with her work, she lowers herself down, resting her head in a way that allowed her to watch them and see what they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and the others looked around in confusion.  They had grown huge!  Well, about half an inch, but that made them larger than any human alive.  Wait, did the horse do this?  As Sam turned toward the slightly less terrifying horse, he watched her watch them.  The beast closed her eyes, and the world slowly returned to its massive size.  A small gust of wind sent the apple sailing across the ocean.  However, as it travels they notice the world, including the apple, is still getting bigger.  The blades of grass become towering citadels, each dozens of miles tall.  The lake-sized puddle is now an ocean; luckily for them the now massive apple was drifting towards the shore.  The insects that were once insects are now almost twice their height, lazily flying around the enormous fruit.  A massive earthquake rings out, shaking every man to his core.  They slowly turn to see the horse, lying down next to the puddle, with a godlike eye watching them.  The equine was originally 'only' 2 miles tall, but now she was thousands of miles in height.  She might as well have been a planet at this size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and the others cry out in despair; survival was difficult when you were barely a millimeter tall, but now?  They weren't even half a micrometer tall!  They'd be lucky if another human ever sees them.  As they turn to one another and fearfully wonder what to do, the ground lurches sideways and sends them sliding off the apple.  Their massive \"ship\" had reached shore, but where were they?</span></div></div>",

A single hair is almost a mile in diameter now, not to mention the horses that are now the size of a planet each.  The mites they used to tame are now 10 miles tall, completely unaware of the microscopic humans around them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a disaster for humanity.  Anything and everything was lethal to them.  Any humans in an open area would get swept up by hurricane-force winds, scattered throughout the enormous world.  A stray hair falling down could crush an entire expedition party.  Flies and mites larger than mountains would land and feed on the skin, unknowingly picking up dozens of humans alongside their meal.  If they survived the feeding, they'd be crushed by the ocean of hair that was the horse's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any humans managed to land safely on the ground, they'd find an even more hostile world.  They were too small to outrun anything that could kill.  Lake-sized crushed dozens and drowned even more.  Snails and slugs would accidentally crush survivors under their mucus-covered bodies.  Occasionally the enormous maw of a horse or other herbivore appear overhead, and slurp up the pathetic specks along with a mouthful of grass.  Afterward, the survivors would have to sit in fear and pray one of the monolithic hooves don't step on them, or that the animal doesn't drop a brown mountain on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumanity would continue to live for a few more years, but nowhere was safe.

So the female horse attempts to grow the entire planet, well most of it anyway.  The voice had said that she could grow anything and this would certainly be a test of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the horse concentrated the Earth began to balloon in size.  Grass, wheat, and other plants that horses find delicious grew to over 15 miles in height.  People around the world watched in wonder as grass began to tower over mountains.  She did not bother growing mountains because the things would get in the way of their runs, trees too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the other giant animals were grateful for this as well.  They had begun to wonder what they would eat as they quickly worked through the available food supply.  The female horse did not want to accidentally crush the animals she had grown before, so she made them as tall as the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new world order was shock for humanity.  Every time a rabbit, cow, deer, or other herbivore double the size of a mountain passed through a city it would be left devastated.  When a horse would pass through a city, it would simply cease to exist, either crushed beneath a hoof or accidentally eaten along with the vegetation that surrounded them.

Though the effects of the foals little trip could be felt for hundreds of miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you approve little....er big one!\" the older horse said smiling up at her grandchild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal looked up and saw the clouds in the sky and wondered just what they might taste like. Were they like cotton candy, icicles, snow? The little foal didn't know but the certainly wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma is this the best you can do? I wanna be even bigger!!\" the foal shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'd say you're plenty big enough wouldn't you?\" The grandma replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH I See, this is the limit huh?\" The foal replied playfully. \"Its okay that is fine if you can't make me any bigger, I understand.\"<br>\r\n\"EXCUSE ME! I'll have you know I don't have limits you little young'in!\" The older horse shouted.<br>\r\n\"I'm Little now?\" the foal asked arching the brow above one eye<br>\r\n\"Well compared to THIS you are!\" The older horse shouted and immediately concentrated and double her young grandchild's size nearly instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal shot into the air, rising higher and higher, watching the landscape shrink and the delicious clouds get closer. Suddenly the growth stopped. From most normal horses perspectives on this new world the Foal was now nearly 300 ft, though given the average of a horse now size the young creature was actually much larger. But on this newly enlarged planet perspective was everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" Said the grandma<br>\r\n\"Pffft, I can barely tell I grew.\" replied the foal<br>\r\n\"OH really?! Try this then\" and again the older horse concentrated on her grandchild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 300 hundred foot foal watched as its body began to expand outward, and upward. passing 400 ft, then 500, 600, 700....<br>\r\n\"Yeah more more, I want to eat...er see everything\" the foal cut itself off mid sentence not wanting to give away its goals of chomping down on the clouds far above.<br>\r\nThe foal passed 800 feet and finally stopped growing at 900 feet tall. Many other horses had taken note of the little one's growth spurt and while some worried, none said anything they new their matron was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go little one, now that's big.\" replied the grandma nodding her head, she was barely 1/10 the size of the foals hoof now.<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry was I growing I couldn't tell.\" the foal said as it sat down. halving its current standing height.<br>\r\n\"Why you incorrigible little whipper snapper! You want big I'll show you big!\" The older horse responded, while thinking to herself how she hadn't had this much fun in years. Sure she grew and shrank things but not to many seemed to actually like it, they just sorta accepted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little foal looked down, \"Oh yeah tiny you couldn't grow a fly!!\"<br>\r\n\"OH that does it!!\" the older mayor shouted half riled half excited and then thought about her little foal growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal looked down and suddenly felt a rush of power. Something flooded its entire body, and 900 feet, became 1,800 feet doubling in size in but a few seconds.<br>\r\n\"Wow that was quic...\" The foal began to reply but suddenly 1,800 ft, became 3,000, then 4,000, then 5,000. At 1 mile tall the foal looked around and saw a nearby cloud. it was time to chow down. Or so it thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in a quick series of spurts 1 miles became 2, then 3, 4, 5.<br>\r\n\"oh wow, I'm getting really big.\" 6 miles came and went and the foal watched as not one cloud but a whole sky of clouds filled the area.<br>\r\nthen 7 miles came, and still the foal grew. bigger and bigger 8, 9, 10 miles. The foal couldn't take it anymore it immediately began to eat the nearby clouds.<br>\r\nOpening its mouth and inhaling clouds for miles around started to to move towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh was that your goal, little one, eat some fluffies?\" The grandma asked from far below before grinning mischievously. In a flash the grandma grew the clouds till they filled the whole sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM, more, more!\" shouted the foal its mouth filled with delicious cloud fluff.   Th e foal had meant more clouds, but the grandma thought it wanted to be bigger to eat more clouds. So she happily obliged. Halfway through the foals next bite 10 miles became 100 miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH wow, I'm big...MORE!\" The foal cried and began eating clouds left and right, clearing the sky for miles around. changing the day from cloudy to partly sunny.<br>\r\n\"More? well if that's what you want\" Grandma horse replied, and the foals size began to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one chomp the foal cleared a few hundred clouds, then 100 miles became 200, 300, 400...Suddenly the foal stepped forward and chomped down on even more fluffy treats, and 400 miles became 500, then 600, still the foal ate, and grew, and ate and grew. Bigger and bigger with every bite 600 miles became a memory and 1,200 miles a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that!\" said the grandma<br>\r\n\"MORE GRANNY, MORE! I WANNA CLEAR THE WHOLE SKY!!\" The mega sized foal roared its shouts shaking the ground and rocking the oceans.<br>\r\n\"Little one are you that hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Pshh, granny, the pebble you grew earlier reached this size. i wanna be big, real big. I bet you can't make me as big as...the continent....no as big as the WHOLE PLANET!!\"<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge?! Well Challenge accepted!!\" and the grandma horse concentrated on the foal and making it absolutely huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foal immediately felt its body begin to swell, growing from 1,200 miles to....</span></div></div>",

Even if he got close enough to be made bigger the dolphin probably wouldn't make him bigger than the dolphin, let alone as big as he wanted to be.  So instead it turned its attention to the possible food above. The school of 100 foot long tuna still swimming and churning the water into chaotic tides. But how to get one.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark had an idea, just do what it always does. The fish might be bigger, but only the dolphin was acting differently. The 100 foot fish were still acting like fish. So if he, as shark, got close enough they would presumably act like fish and swim for it. Then all he had to do was chase one down, not get swallowed and tear it apart for a good meal. Here goes nothing....and everything the shark thought to itself and swam upward as fast as he could snapping his jaws the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school of fish were having a great time. They had never felt so good, the humans were gone, there was still plenty of room in the ocean, A shark was approaching at high speeds.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of spotting the shark the entire school of fish panicked, blasting out in every direction. Most of them escaped effortlessly, a 100 tuna can put a lot of distance between where it doesn't want to be, and where it is quite easily. But, much to the sharks delight one of the fish had been thrown into a spiral downward, set adrift by the massive waves its friends has churned up in their escape. The fishes eye's settled on the shark and moment later all it could see was blue, then red, then black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark was amazed. It really didn't think that would work. But now it had a meal like no other. So the shark began to eat, and eat, and eat, and eat, and eat, and eat, to his hearts content. But no matter how much he ate he didn't seem full. Even worse looking back he realized he had eaten nearly half his meal. How was this possible thought the shark. But then at a second glance the shark realized how. It had grown, with every bite of the 100 foot fish it had devoured it grew larger, and larger. Not nearly as big as the monster it had taken down. But the shark, which had originally been about 5 feet long was now nearly 15 feet long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark didn't even need to think on its next move it quickly ate the rest of its dinner, expanding to nearly 20 feet long and then</span></div></div>",

No that wasn't a good idea. Oh of course eat and grow, and grow, and grow so Big that it could eat the dolphin. Then it would get as big as it wanted or make food get bigger, and then keep eating and growing. It was all so simple. Looking ahead the shark spotted its next target. Another one the 100 foot long fish. Apparently it had gotten separated from the group while fleeing the shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large fish was swimming calmly now through ocean, when suddenly everything went black. The 20 foot long shark had swam straight at the beast from below and with one chomp from its massive jaws, it crushed the larger fishes skull, its killer instincts apparently worked even better when it was bigger.  A moment later the shark began to feast and grow. 20 feet became 25, then 30, then 40 feet long. The shark had doubled in size but still it was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More, I must have More!' thought the shark as it spotted another 100 foot long tuna nearby. the shark lunged forward, now almost half as big as its prey it simply  bit down on the creatures mid section, and severed it in half. Then the shark ate its meal, this time growing from 40 feet long and nearly 12 feet wide to 45 feet, 50, 55 feet. The shark noticed it had not grown as much as it had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis told the shark one thing. It needed to eat more, much much more. Charging forward the shark again approached the massive school of fish. This time again they split up fleeing in every direction, But this time the shark was fast enough to catch one, then another, and another, and another.  Four, the shark had incapacitated four whole fish before the rest of them got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the shark ate, and ate, and ate. It devoured the fish the first in 6 bites, and it felt its whole body shake, and stretch. The shark grew from 55 feet to 65 feet. The shark ate the next fish in 3 bites. Again its whole body expanded outward in every direction. passing 70 feet, 75, 80. MORE! The shark ate the next two fish each in 2 bites and again it grew and grew, bigger and bigger. 80 feet became 100 feet then 120 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the shark.....</span></div></div>",

Should he be on the lookout for a tiny goldfish that was gonna end his day? Well actually a piranha probably could the shark thought, vicious little  bastards.

Worse the shark was now in the middle of the school of monstrously large 1 mile long tuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nope, screw this, I'm gonna try it anyway' the shark thought. After all what's the worse that could happen then eat him? He was small enough to live in their bellies, they didn't even have sharp teeth like he did. He'd just eat them from the inside out if it came to that. So the Shark swam up to the nearest mile lone monster and promptly bit into its belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even notice. Okay now the shark was both angry and depressed. Some mighty hunter he thought to himself. I couldn't even get its attention. I'm a 120 foot long barnacle. Then the sweet taste of blood filled the sharks mouth. 'Well at least i get something for my troubles' the shark thought. Then it happened the shark felt it, he was growing. He drank up more blood, and he grew...slowly 122 feet, 123, 124, 125. As the shark grew  he let go and noticed the fish continued to bleed. Unaware it had been wounded. This gave the shark a great idea. He swam out and bit another fish. Latched on just long enough to be sure it was bleeding, grew himself to 127 feet long and let ago. Then he repeated the process, again, and again, and again and again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark bit into fish after fish making them bleed slowly accumulating a red tide of enormous proportions. It took the shark nearly ten minutes but he eventually had a a few hundred Fish bleeding. Now it was time to feast! The shark opened his mouth and gobbled up the blood. Every last drop, and as he did he felt his body grow, and grow and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was soon 300 feet long and nearly 100 feet wide. Still the shark ate, and grew. 400 feet came and went, then 500, 600, 700, 750. 775....the shark knew his growth was slowing, He was running out of blood. But is didn't matter he was now 800 feet! the other fish were still 5 times his size but he was at the center of their school.
