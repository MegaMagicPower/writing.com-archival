It was a pendant, attached to a a gold string. \u201cUm, thanks grandpa?\u201d Dave said, noticing the note beneath the pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDave, you always were my favorite grandson, so I\u2019m giving you my most prized possession, a wishing pendant.

I think gramps went senile. So, how was your day?\u201d Dave answered as he slipped the pendant over his head and onto his neck. \u201cUgh, it was awful Dave, I wish you knew what it was like to be me, it\u2019s a tough job.\u201d Said Jennifer. Dave felt an electrical tingle on his chest where the pendant lay and the room began to shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room slowly stopped spinning and Dave found himself looking into his own eyes. But his body just flipped on the TV and began to watch it as if nothing was wrong. Dave looked down at his body and saw two C-cup breasts sitting on his chest, dark black hair fell over his eyes and he got up and ran into the bathroom. Running felt very weird as his new breasts bounced up and down in Jennifer's loose-fitting dress. He looked in the mirror and saw Jennifer looking back at him!

Dave thinks about this and realizes he can use it to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave starts swinging his now feminine hips seductively and licking his lips.  He says \"Dave, I want to make wild passionate love to you, but I need you to do one thing first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer/Dave says \"OK baby whatever you want I'll do, but make it quick.\"  The real Dave says \"Please just say, I wish everything was back to normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer/Dave says \"I wish everything was back to normal\".  The room starts spinning and in a few seconds, the real Dave and the real Jennifer were back in their real bodies.  They were also back at the kitchen table where Jennifer had innocently made her wish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave asks Jennifer how her day was and she replies \u201cUgh, it was awful Dave, I wish you knew what it was like to be me, it\u2019s a tough job.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room starts to spin and Dave lets out a scream in his new feminine voice.  Someone who looks exactly like Jennifer asks \"What is a matter Jennifer, why did you scream\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave thinks for a moment and hesitantly replies \"Sorry Jen, I just got startled for a second\".  The real Jennifer looks at Dave and giggles \"Did you just call me Jen?  I'm Jan your twin sister, silly\" while she gives you a playful slap on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave quickly replies \"I'm sorry, I just feel so scatter brained today, perhaps I'll feel better after I use the bathroom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave walks to the bathroom, he is amazed at how much his apartment has changed.  Obviously he now shares this apartment with his former girlfriend turned his now twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an incredibly interesting time going to the bathroom he comes out and 'Jan\" invites him to join her to have a cup of cocoa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sounds good to Dave, he never liked cocoa before, but it suddenly sounds yummy.  Did he really just think the word yummy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jan' tells Dave/Jennifer about her new boy friend Rob and innocently says \"Jen, you have never had a boyfriend, I wished you liked guys more\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave lets out another scream, but quickly composes him/herself.  Fortunately he realizes that he is not gay, but is resigned to the fact that as long as he is in this body he will be attracted to men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave decides to:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dave/Jennifer is intrigued by the whole situation.  He is amazed by the fact that Jennifer seems to have always thought that he was Jennifer and she was his twin sister Jan.  He also realizes that anything Jennifer/Jan wishes will change reality, so he figures since reality could change at any minute he might as well just stay like this.  Being his girlfriend for a few hours could help him understand her better plus this is a lot better than having his old body hit on him constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Jan asks Dave/Jenn if she wants to stay in tonight and watch a movie.  She explains that her boyfriend Rob is gone for the weekend with the National Guard.  Dave/Jenn thinks this sounds good, if he is home watching a movie that means he won't be out on a date with some dumb guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Jan says \"Hey, let's go to the grocery store.  You pick up some snacks and I'll rent a movie.....how about your favorite movie, Sleepless in Seattle?\".  Dave/Jenn replies \"Great, I love that movie!\".  Dave thinks about this for a second and realizes that he has always hated that movie.  It is Jennifer's favorite movie though and since he is now her it only makes sense that he would like it now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer (now Jan) does the driving to the store which makes sense to Dave because the real Jennifer hates driving.  He is amazed by the fact that he really now does hate driving, while if he was back in his old body he would love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave/Jenn starts shopping for snacks and instinctively starts buying snack food that Jennifer would normally eat.  As he is picking up some low-fat rice cakes he notices a couple mildly arguing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man appears to be in his mid thirties, is wearing a Chicago Bears muscle t-shirt, has a shaved head and a couple of tattoos.  His wife is also in her mid thirties and has long brunette hair and is quite pretty.  The woman playfully tells her husband \"Do you always have to think like a guy?  Sometimes I wish you would think more like a woman\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave/Jenn's jaw drops as the room starts to spin and he notices the man's appearance and demeanor rapidly changing.  In a few seconds the tough looking guy was transformed into a metrosexual looking guy.  He now had some hair, he was wearing a pink polo shirt and had no tattoos.  He was acting totally different as well, but amazingly both him and his wife didn't seem to notice anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave/Jenn realized how powerful this pendant was and wished he could take it off, but he still had to wait another week.  Just then he heard the same woman whose husband had just been transformed say \"Must you always think like woman, sometimes you are so mamby pamby I wish you were a woman!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave looks over in amazement as the room starts spinning again.  Within a few seconds the man turns into a fairly attractive woman.  Even more amazingly the woman who made the wish starts changing as well.  Her hair gets really short and her facial features become slightly more brusk.  Dave/Jenn watches them interact with each other for a couple of minutes and realizes that they are now a couple of lesbians.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave feels bad for what just happened but can't figure out how to approach the woman to ask her to wish everything back to normal.  The woman is going off on some rant to her former husband/current girlfriend about how much she hates men.  Dave/Jenn decides he needs to get away from her quick before she makes another ridiculous wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He hopes to get out of the store quickly and away from people before someone else makes a stupid wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he is standing in line he notices a mother (who appears to be in her late twenties) and her three children.  One of the children who is a little boy who seems to be about three years old asks her if he can have a candy bar.  The mom sweetly says to him \"Now Joe you know you can't have any candy before dinner\".  He starts pouting and says \"I wish I was the mommy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave Jenn starts shuddering as the room begins to spin again.  He watches in amazement as the boy starts to grow taller and turn into a woman.  Simultaneously the mom starts to shrink and turns into a cute little girl who looks like she is three years old.  Her fancy hairstyle is now pigtails.  The other two childrens' appearance slightly change as well.  They now look more like their new mom than their old mom.  The former mother hugs her new mom/former son and says \"Me love you mommy\".

Looking back to where he was originally standing after waking up, he saw a teenage girl that looked a lot like Jennifer, who he instinctively knew was really Jane. In this new reality, Jane and Jan were fraternal twins. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go find Jan, we\u2019ll be back before dinner, mom.\u201d Jane said, walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay...sweetie.\u201d Dave felt compelled to call her that, so he did. He went to a mirror and saw an older Jennifer staring back at him. \u201cThis is getting out of hand.\u201d He needed to come up with a plan to return everything back to normal. He didn\u2019t want to be his former girlfriend, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to be a middle-aged version of his former girlfriend, who happens to be the mother of his original girlfriend, as well as her former mother. When he thought about it like that, it seemed more confusing than it really was. \u201cWell, I might as well act like the mother I appear to be until I come up with a plan.\u201d So he started cleaning while thinking of various strategies to getting someone to wish everything back to normal. Last time he told someone to wish everything back to normal, it just ended up making things worse when the same wish he was trying to reverse happened again. And he was just trying to reverse ONE wish at the time. Now he needs to reverse several, and simply telling someone to wish everything back to normal might turn out bad again, and maybe even worse than this time, so he has to be careful how he gets someone to make the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was cleaning...</span></div></div>",

Every single male around him had changed into a female. Little boys turned into little girls. Old men turned into old ladies. Every male, became a female. Feeling a little guilty about this, Dave also felt a little turned on. This meant that he was in a world filled with nothing but girls, which is every boy\u2019s dream. However, since half of those girls were boys until a few seconds ago, he was a little disturbed by the possibility of dating a former boy, but that feeling quickly went away since he fell into that category as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out his, formerly Jennifer\u2019s, phone, Dave decided to search how humans are capable of reproducing if they were an entirely female species. He quickly found that humans contain both ovaries and sperm within their bodies, and eject the sperm when ejaculating, so it\u2019s even possible for both sexual partners to get pregnant at the same time. Dave found this both interesting, and disturbing. He couldn\u2019t help but think about the possibility of being responsible for two babies at once, and neither parent being capable of working. Along with all the other things that would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued searching through his phone about how the world works now...</span></div></div>",

And this time, she was really enjoying the feelings her body was giving her. Soon there was the same rubbing of her breasts, the same hand then went inside of her panties, but this time, while the feelings were new and strange to her, they were also erotic and wonderful! As a male, she had done this with Jenn before, but now, she was on the other side, and as she began to breath deeply, she realized she was getting very horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in stopping now. She had planned to tell Dave/Jenn about the pendant and try to convince him that they had swapped bodies, but now that she wanted to stay a female, she decided to wait until after they had made love, then tell him, but not the part that they had swapped. She would let things be, and Dave/Jenn would think that he had always been a male named Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exciting to her to undress for her boyfriend. She found a huge thrill at the feeling of him sucking on her nipples! Soon they were naked and rolling around on the bed, kissing and stroking each other's bodies. She did not resist when Dave/Jenn rolled her over on her back. She spread her legs wide, and she gasped in pleasure as she felt herself being pierced for the first time! If she could have wished for herself, she would have wished her body to be a virgin again so that she could experience loosing her virginity, but they had made love often before, and she could not be the one making the wishes. She loved the feeling of Dave's cock inside of her! She loved it so much that, even if he had not made the wish that he had, she might have loved this body so much that she might have tried to stay anyhow! The feeling of him inside of her was incredible! She had her 'first' female orgasm as she felt Dave cum inside of her, and like the original Jenn, she screamed in pleasure! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were both done, Dave/Jenn pulled out of her. Other than the sticky mess of his cum leaking out of her pussy, she loved sex as a female! She never, never, never wanted to be male again! She kissed Dave/Jenn and thanked him. She decided that this was an appropriate time to tell him about the pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, he said, \"So you can't make any wishes, but anyone around you can, and they come true?\" She nodded.

He just needs time to see it, if only I could be woman enough to show him.\" She sighed, \"I will admit, you have it lucky Jenn. Sometimes I wish that I was Dave's girlfriend, being treated like a princess, and you were the one with this crazy, adoring love for Craig that made you marry him right out of high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave gasped! This could not be happening! But the world around her was blurring. Memories were filling her head. There was Craig, at a party. He was Linda's boyfriend, and as usual he was being so mean to her that she could not understand why Linda put up with him. But when he dumped Linda, she noticed him looking at her. She realized that he was handsome, and he did talk nice to her. She convinced herself that he was great, it was Linda who was not woman enough for a man like Craig, so she was thrilled when he asked her on a date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered him pushing her around, but she did not care, she loved him. When he told her they were going to get married right after she graduated, she was thrilled! She remembered their wedding in front of the justice of the peace, and the rough sex that Craig had with her on their two-day honeymoon. It was not until Craig lost his job that the beating started. She knew it was only stress, and at least he was careful not to hit her where it would leave a mark she could not cover up. She remembered him just a little while ago punching her in the arm so hard that he knocked her down, then kicking her in the ribs. She deserved it though. She had over-cooked his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and tried to fight it, but it was no use. When things cleared, Audrey was sitting there in a robe and Jenn/Dave was sitting across from her in a shabby dress, holding her sore arm and sore ribs and wondering if one of her ribs was broken. She thought, \"I only had this stupid pendant a few hours and I go from being a guy, to a girl, to a wife! How much more could happen?\" To make it worse, because of Dave/Jenn's wish that she be happy with the girl she is, she was now happy to be married to Craig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and they heard Craig's voice, \"Jenn? Sweetie? Are you okay? I heard you fall down those steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave knew he was lying because of Audrey, but if she said that in front of a witness, Audrey might call the poice, and the thought of Craig going to jail because of her was frightening! \"I am fine.\" She went over and opened the door. \"Audrey and I were just sharing some coffee and talking girl stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig looked angry, and pulling Jenn/Dave out of the door, he said, \"Yeah, I will bet. I heard her telling you to leave me before.\" Then looking at Audrey, \"You think you know so much! You don't even love you man enough to marry him! I wish you and that jerk Dave would just get married and be too busy with each other to ever talk to Jenn again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave gasped on the inside as she felt the pendant tingle. She saw the look on Audrey's face. As Craig pulled her out the door, she could see that Audrey was already heading toward the bedroom. She knew that her original male body would be married to Audrey before the day was out! It almost bothered her until she looked up at Craig and though, \"But so what? I am married to the greatest guy in the world!\" She would miss talking to Audrey though. She is a nice girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to their house, Craig's sister Amy was there waiting, \"Hey you two! How are you?\" But she could tell what was up. As soon as they were inside the house, she said, \"Craig! You jerk! Jenn loves you so much and you keep beating on her like this? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the few people who could get away with talking to Craig like that. He blew her off. \"Mind your own business sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"You need to stop this Craig! You don't know how lucky you are to find someone who loves you like she does! Every guy I date is a jerk who just wants to get in my panties, they don't care about me. I would give anything to have what you have. I wish that I could have your life and Jenn's love, and you could learn how to deal with the jerk guys instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave gasped as she felt the pendant vibrate a little. In a few moments, she saw the looks of shock on the faces of Craig and Amy. They had just swapped bodies! Jenn/Dave had to keep herself from laughing at the thought of the macho Craig in the body of his petite, redheaded sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Amy's body say, \"No! No! No! This can't really be happening!\" But Craig's body was staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig's body said, \"It is somehow. Sit down 'SIS'. I want to go talk to 'MY' wife for a moment.\" As Amy's body sat on the sofa crying, Craig/Amy put an arm around Jenn/Dave and guided her to 'their' bedroom. When they were inside with the door closed, he said, \"Okay Jenn. I don't know how this happened, but I think you do. I saw your face. Tell me how this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave sighed and told him the story. Because of the way Amy had worded her wish, Jenn/Dave now loved her in Craig's body as much as she ever loved the real Craig, so she did not want to lie to him so she told him the whole story. She finished, \"The only think I don't know is why the two of you know you swapped. Ever time I swapped with someone, they did not seem to know it happened. The only thing I can think of is because you said you wanted Craig to learn how to deal with jerk guys, so he has to start off not know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared a while, \"It could be.\" Then he paused, \"So do you wan to go back to being Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn panicked, \"No! I like who I am! And now with you in Craig's body, my life would be perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig/Amy said, \"Well, I can't\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

And I already like being male, so Craig can stay Amy permanently, but I still want her to learn her lesson about how she treated you when she was in this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave smiled and said, \"I can't wish, but you can. I have some suggestions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Jenn's prompting, Craig/Amy wished that Amy/Craig would be lonely and compelled to find a boyfriend, but the only guys who would even consider her from now on were the bad boys like he used to be. To add more to it, she would easily fall madly in love with the first guy to ask her to be his girl, and would stay that way no matter what until her time of two years was up, or he kicked her out, in which case she would have to start over with a new guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got rid of Amy, Craig/Amy used her wishing power to heal Jenn/Dave completely, he undid the wish of Dave and Audrey not talking to Jenn, added the same sexual modifications as Dave, and then used them to make love to Jenn/Dave all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Craig/Amy wished up a high paying job. While he was at work though, there was a knock on the door. It was their neighbor down the street, Krista. She was short, with waist-length blonde hair, and as always, she had her kids in tow. She had a two-year-old boy, an eight-month-old girl, and was clearly pregnant with number three. She belonged to some kind of strict church that only allowed women to wear dresses and skirts, so you never saw her in pants, and apparently, birth control was not an option either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave said, \"High Krista! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked flustered, \"Oh, I forgot to give Sam his lunch this morning, and now I need to run it to him at work! It is such a bother to drag the kids along for such a short trip! Would you mind watching the kids till I get back? I will pay the usual amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Craig's new job, they would not need the money. Jenn/Dave wanted to comment that, if Sam could not remember his own lunch, his pregnant wife should not have to suffer for it, he should just go hungry. Instead she smiled and said, \"Sure, but no charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista thanked her and left. Jenn/Dave found that she liked having kids around. Maybe someday she would have some of her own. When Krista got back, they sat down for tea. Jenn/Dave smiled and said, \"You seem frazzled Krista. Why don't you and Sam take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista was frazzled. She normally did not complain. \"I would like to, but, well, it is up to Sam, and he wants to have a very large family. He came from a family of ten, and he would like to have at least that many if not more.\" Clearly, the way she said it, she was not happy with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenn/Dave said, \"Wow! Better you than me! I like kids, but not that much! I am glad Craig and I are waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista sighed, \"Yeah. It is not the way I expected life to be. But I do love the children. I am not sure I can handle a lot at once though.\" She sighed, \"Sometimes though, I wish\u2026.\"</span></div></div>",

Krista said, \"Sometimes though, I wish I could trade places with someone like you, so I could do what I want and let them follow all the rules of my beliefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Jenn/Dave moaned, and sure enough, back to the blur and spinning. When it cleared again, she looked down at the baby girl she was holding, and she felt her swollen belly. She was now Krista, and was four months pregnant. But in moments, Jenn's old wish for her had kicked in, and in spite of herself, she was happy with the woman she had become. She even found herself saying, and meaning, \"But then I look at my little sweeties here, I am glad I have a husband who wants a large family. With a couple like you and Craig, I am surprised that you are not already pregnant. Don't you want children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, since she could not change things herself, that old wish of Jenn's was a help, or she might have gone crazy with these changes! She now was happy with her pregnant body and the life she was handed, even if it meant only being allowed to wear skirts and to become a baby machine. Of course, what happened next made things even more interesting. The new Jenn answered, \"Well, yes. But Craig wants to wait. If it were up to me, I wish I was already pregnant and had the same due date as you so you could guide me though my pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista/Dave gasped to herself as reality changed and she watched Jenn's belly grow. Krista/Dave held her breath, but apparently Jenn did not realize anything had changed. In fact, the conversation shifted. Jenn smiled and said, \"I am so glad we are both pregnant at the same time Krista. Your experience and advice has made things much easier for me when I have doubts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista/Dave smiled, \"You know I am glad to help. I look forward to babysitting for you to pay you back for all of the times you helped me.\" She also realized that, even if she went back to Jenn's body, she would now be pregnant no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista/Dave saw the clock, \"Well, I have a lot of wash to do, so I should get home. Call me if you need anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrista could not believe how much work she had to do, all while pregnant, nursing a baby, and taking care of a toddler! But one thing was for sure, it seemed like no time and her Sam was coming home from work. The only problem was, Jenn/Krista's wish did not include love, so Krista/Dave was just doing her duty as a wife and a woman. In her mind, she had no choice. It was odd to love her life but not really love her husband, and still be happy. Then again, she would learn to love her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days when by, and mostly since she had no time to go anywhere and the children could not talk yet, she was able to avoid any new wishes. He husband Sam was interesting. He was a man of few words, but very horny, and very creative. She had sex with him three times already, and one was a real shock. She was cleaning up after breakfast when he walked up behind her, lifted her skirt, pulled her panties aside and took her from behind right there in the kitchen! She was glad the kids were still in bed! She realized that, with Sam, it would be hard 'not' to get pregnant! But it felt good, and he sure kept it varied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going fine until Sam took her to the grocery store. It was a real challenge with two little kids, but it was in the checkout line where things happened. Sam was not really a bigot, but their church believed that inter-racial marriage was wrong, and Sam was always one to go overboard. So when an inter-racial couple got in line behind them, Sam made a comment to Krista, about how wrong it was, only the man heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who was a caucasian with a black wife, said, \"Damn it, I get so sick of you idiots! I wish you were an inter-racial couple so that you could see what it is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the pendant vibrate with power. When it was done, \u2026</span></div></div>",

She was even shorter now, and her waist-length hair was now a glossy black. Nobody else seemed to notice the change, except, by the look on his face, her husband Sam. She was still obviously pregnant, but when she looked at her children, she realized what she must now be. Her two-year-old boy , and the eight-month-old girl now had black hair like their mother, and while their skin was lighter than she now noticed her skin was, they had very clear Asian features! Krista/Dave also suddenly knew that her name was now Jun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stuttered, \"You\u2026 you\u2026 you look, like a, a China girl! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very insulted, \"I don't know how, but somehow I know that I am now of Chinese decent and I really don't like being called a China girl! I was born in this country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jun/Dave was paying for the food, Sam said, \"What are we going to do? I can't be married to someone of another race! What will our church say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned. Sam did deserve this. What was wrong with her being Chinese? Of course, really, she knew Sam and that he was not a bigot, but it went against what he had been taught all the same. She looked up at him, \"Honey, I may look different, but it is still me.\" As they got to the car, she took his hand and placed it on her swollen belly to remind him, \"Remember, you are still the one who put this here.\" Then pointing to the kids, \"And they are still your children. What are you going to do? Abandon us? Is that how a good father would act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \"No! Of course not! But, what about our church? You know this won't be accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his hand, \"If you still love me, I don't care. We will put up with them if we need to, or if not, we can find a church that does accept our marriage. Do you still love me, even if I am Chinese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged her, \"Of course I do!\" He kissed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of days, Sam seemed to enjoy her new and exotic body even more than she did! Unfortunately, they did have to change churches, but Sam was okay with that in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost at the time when she could remove the pendant now. Many small wishes had been fulfilled, but thankfully not life-changing ones like all of the one's before that turned her from a single white guy into a young, married, pregnant, Chinese, nursing mother of two children! But on the evening of her last day before she could take it off, they encountered a 'free-living' couple that didn't seem to think anything they said was insulting, as long as they said it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at Jun/Dave, the man said to Sam, \"Man, she is one sexy bitch! Are you two into wife swapping? I would love to put the next baby in that hot belly, and I think my woman here wouldn't mind wrapping her legs around you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Jun/Dave knew something just had to happen next, and it did.</span></div></div>",

Most of the other ones are associated to other parts of the world.

It grants wishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't ask me.\" Sam gave a little chuckle. \"Those crazy Italians called it a curse... But then again, think about what Dave told us earlier. He can't pull that pendant off for a week! That's a curse for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave joked, \"Or I might just be Jesus. Suffer for people's strange and odd wishes. That's a tale for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess then thought around for a second. \"You know, we really shouldn't be joking about this at all. What if we accidentally made a wish?
