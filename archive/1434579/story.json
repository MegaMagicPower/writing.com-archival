In the midst of the widespread conflict that keeps the galaxy in its iron grip, there is an island of peace, order and calmth called the Jedi Order. With the help of the Jedi, who function as generals in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), the clone troopers struggle to repel the mechanical menace of the Confederacy of Independent solar Systems (CIS) and it's endless legions of battle droids. There is also a secret order that operates in the background, and is rumored to consist of former Jedi who have abandoned the Order's beliefs. This order is called the Sith. There are, as the rumors say, only two of these so-called Dark Jedi, but they are rumored to be very powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat side are you on?</span></div></div>",

You ran towards the Cloning Chambers to see a couple of your squadmates guarding the area. You nod to them and they nod back, then you all ran towards the entrance to see a couple of landers coming down on the landing platforms. You order the troopers with rockets to open fire on the landers. They fired their rockets at the landers successfully destroying three of them, but 2 more had already touched the ground and the droids came out of it. You ordered everyone to open fire on the droids, then you aimed your rifle at them as well, and you started firing at the droids successfully tearing through them. Then the droids started firing at you and your men. You and your men got down but some of them were torn to shreds by the blaster fire. Then you threw a grenade at them and watched as they were blown away. You smirked under helmet as you watched the anti-air cannons destroyed the rest of the droid's fleet. You looked down to your fallen brethren and ordered a medic to take them away, some of them were thankfully still alive and you went towards the barracks to get some sleep after what had happened. Once you reached the barracks you saw a Jedi with red skin and horns on her head, a Togruta, looking over the other troops. After a second you recognized her as Jedi Master Shaak Ti. You slowly walked towards her wondering why she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Ti, what are you doing here?\" you asked, your voice being somewhat more intimidating with your helmet on. She then turned to you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, lieutenant. Allow me to explain: the 501st has been placed under my control, so I came to check out my new troops\" said general Ti. You nodded, and went towards your bunk. You were about to fall asleep when you noticed general Ti had walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I share this room with you?\" she asked. You nodded and turned back to your original position. Meanwhile, Shaak Ti laid down on the bunk opposite to you and fell asleep right away. Because you were still her subordinate you didn\u2019t care to look at the body of the Jedi, and you decided to take your helmet off and get some shut eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were walking in the corridors of Kamino like always, after all ever since the end of the war, the clones were no longer needed.  Some of the clones were banished to the farthest reaches of the galaxy for trying to live with normal people.  The rest of the clones decided to stay on Kamino.  It was really the only place they were accepted as they were.  You didn't really care though, orders were orders after all.  Then you heard an alarm going off and you ran as fast as you could towards the command room, but no matter how far you ran it never seemed to get any closer.  Then when you just about got there, you saw a dark jedi killing some of your brothers, you grabbed one of the large DC-15 rifles from the rack on your right, and then you charged at the dark jedi.  You let loose with a flurry of blaster fire, the dark jedi wasn't fased in the least, infact, she just smiled as she blocked every shot with her dark lightsaber.  Then you ran out of ammo, you were nervous at the moment, but you stayed calm and activated your wrist blade.  Every clone trooper had a wrist blade, they just never liked to use it.  These wrist blades were strong enough to stand against a lightsaber though.  You charged at the dark jedi and blocked a slash from her lightsaber, then you tried to kick at her, but she blocked it and slashed at your arm.  It fell limply to the ground and you screamed trying to throw away the pain.  Then the dark jedi took off her hood revealing Shaak Ti smiling down at you as she stabbed you in the face with her lightsaber.  You woke up with a start as you took a quick look around noticing that you were still on  Kamino and in your bed.  You looked over to see Shaak Ti was still asleep and you sighed as you grabbed your head in your hands and just sat there.  Then just as you got up putting your helmet on, an alarm startd going off.  Shaak Ti woke up to the alarm as well.  Then you two made your way towards the command chamber.  When you got there you were surprised to see...</span></div></div>",

Shaak Ti immediatley bowed to General Yoda as you saluted to him.  He told you both to be at ease and he explained the current situation that the droids were making desperate attacks against Kamino to try and destroy the clone army.  Under your helmet, you were fuming, those tin cans were trying to kill you and your brothers off just like that?  Shaak Ti nodded at General Yoda and she went to get ready to take off for one of the Separatist Systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your men, go with her you must.\"  Ordered General Yoda, you saluted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission acknowledged sir!\"  You said to him and you got your men ready to take off with Shaak Ti.  As you and Shaak Ti got onto the large Republic Cruiser she stopped you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you fight?\"  Asked Shaak Ti, you didn't even turn around as she asked that question and you checked your DC-15 to make sure it was loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our job general.  And it's all I know how to do.\"  You said in an emotionless voice.  Shaak Ti must have taken that as a sign to end the conversation because she didn't say another word after that.  You went to the barracks and decided to sleep until you got to the first planet under Separatist control, Mygeeto.  A couple of other troopers were talking about how Ki Adi Mundi would be there as well to help the 501st defeat the Separatists.  It didn't matter to you either way, Jedi or not, the Republic would win this war.  You were about to take your helmet off when you heard the door to the barracks open and Shaak Ti walked in.  You quickly stood up and saluted her, she put her hand up and you stood at ease and you sat back down on your bed.  When you took another look at her, you noticed she was nervous about something.  Now usually you wouldn't give a damn, but something told you this was related to the mission, and if even one soldier is off in the mission, everyone is off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong General?\"  You asked as you looked your blaster over again.  She just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I'm fine, just worried about the mission.  I'm worried about all of you.\"  She said, you stopped looking over your blaster as you thought about that, then you just shrugged.  She probably only cared because you were soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's what we were born to do.\"  You said to her, this only caused her to frown and she left the barracks.  You sighed to yourself as you took your helmet off and layed down on the bed.  Then you finally got to sleep..</span></div></div>",

There were six in total with another Jedi, master Daakman Barrek. Suddenly you sall one gunship take a direct hit from an anti-air round completely destroying the unlucky. The pilot came over the intercom telling the crew to hold on. You felt the craft go through evasive manoeuvres as a blast ripped through the right wing taking the unfortunate ball gunner with it. \" Damn we're loosing altitude, brace for impact!\" You felt a hand on your shoulder before your head struck the back wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You regained consciousness to the sound of an Acklay. Your instincts force you into consciousness. You open your eyes to see your helmet currently attempting to repair a gash in your visor. You look up to see the wreckage of the gunship. You try to move noticing your leg is trapped under a piece of metal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       As you try to free it the Acklay you heard prior had found the crash site... and you. Its piercing reptile-like eyes lock on you. You look for a weapon, anything you could see. Luckily a deceased trooper holding a shotgun was lieing next to you. You came close to dislocateing your shoulder as you manage to grab the weapon only to see a spiderlike appendage next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You turn off the safety and fire at the leg severing it causing the beast to fall. It shrieked in pain as it fell onto its back as you fire point-blank at its head effectively ending it's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        You slowly push the wreckage off your leg. You then remember Shaak Ti and limp over to the crash site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she there, or missing?</span></div></div>",

The dark side fueled his ambition, power and desire to destroy.<br>\r\n  Ben endured misfortune after misfortune as he matured. He fought the urge to allow the hatred cast at him to inflate the growing bitterness. After losing his wife to a sickness no Jedi could heal, Ben lost his identity. His mind fell to madness. The pent up rage, despair and madness was released upon witnessing his wife die. Ben used this hate to take the lives of the two Jedi who could not save his wife.<br>\r\n Ben escaped the medical facility, but not before using the dark side of the force to electrocute security teams and brave souls who tried to stop him. He spent weeks hiding in less reputable cantinas and smugglers' hideouts. That is, until a cantina goer slipped him a note and used a stealth generator to disappear from view.<br>\r\n \"I know who you are and what you have done. Welcome to the dark side, my apprentice. The man you were before was weak. That man is now dead. The Jedi could have healed Desra. They did not because they needed her out of the way. They planned to recruit you as a Padawan after filling your mind with lies. I've read your mind. You were weak to allow others to betray you. That was your failing, your fault. Remember the lack of mercy given by others. The betrayal, the lies, the failing. Use your hate to become more powerful. Jedi are searching for you. They aim to kill you. Do not let their tricks consume your mind. All Jedi kill their prisoners. Have you ever seen a living being after being captured by the Jedi? Will they prove their prisoners are still alive? No. Because there are none. The Jedi are no different than the Sith. I cannot see you personally. Much needs to be done. The Jedi Council has been watching me closely. The time will come when you stand at my side. The galaxy will be ours, but only when all Jedi are dead. I'll be watching. May the force be with you...

What to do next swirled within his darkened mind.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He's obviously not a full fledged Jedi, perhaps a padawan I think they call them. But he is Jedi in his own mind and certainly lacks none of the self righteous pomposity his order is known for.<br>\r\n\"Look,\" I added, \"I have a signed order form the provincial Governor to bring Raxall in for theft. He's a wanted criminal and I am taking him in to have his fair trial. That's what you do to criminals right?\"<br>\r\n\"He's not a criminal!\" the boy yelled and charged.<br>\r\nHe held his light saber in both hands over his head and brought it down hard.<br>\r\nI raised my left arm in a truly reflexive defense maneuver.<br>\r\nHe must have thought that I was really going to let him lop off my arm because he was genuinely shocked when his light saber struck my photon buckler. His second surprise came when I punched him in his shocked expression with my right fist. It struck with the force of three normal men. And that was the low setting. He flopped hard but only for a moment. A split second later he was on his feet and coming at me. Again he swung his weapon with two hands. Only this time it didn't connect because another light saber had intercepted it.<br>\r\n\"Stand down Bratat,\" commanded the Jedi Master.<br>\r\n\"But Master Gelcheldin, he's a bounty hunter and he has Raxall tied up like some animal!\" the boy complained.<br>\r\n\"Stand down. I wont ask you again.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Master.\" <br>\r\nThe boy turned off his blade or whatever Jedis do so the light part does cut through their own stuff. He stare at me and I only smiled back. He turned to his master and then turn his gaze to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Hooray for calmer heads,\" I said. \"Here is the order for Raxall. I'm sure you'll find everything in order. I'm Clate Rimrunner. You'll find my license is in order too\".<br>\r\n\"Zeret Gelcheldin,\" the Jedi replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh I know you master Gelcheldin. We have met before.\" As I spoke I raised my arms so my hands were above my head. My sleeves dropped to my shoulders revealing where my prosthetics merge with my own flesh. \"Yes I was at Branaxus when you and your Jedi friends raided the starport. Gee I don't think I was much older than your padawan there when this happened.\"<br>\r\nA look of recognition cam over his face. Then he too looked down at the ground.<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like your orders are legitimate. I don't believe Raxall is capable of the crimes listed so as he is a friend I will take him into custody,\" Gelcheldin said.<br>\r\n\"That poses a problem. You see I flew all the way here to Zabooine at  my own expense to capture this wanted criminal. I was going to use the bounty to recoup my losses and make a little profit. If you take him in, I don't get credit and I don't get paid.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an interactive story which takes place in the Old Republic somewhere before, during and after the Clone Wars. The main characters are humans and aliens of different species. The storyline depends on the character you choose. I will add as much characters as possible, but then it's your turn to bring them to life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few rules:<br>\r\n1. NO SEX! I don't want to see anything which is a direct hint at sex. You can describe a girl, but just say she is a tall and beautiful girl, don't start to describe cup sizes and that kind of characteristics. There are other story's to do that in, but this isn't one of those. So keep the sex away from this story or I will have to delete it. You are allowed to let characters have children, but in such a case you just cut away the sex part, but a little hysterical behaviour is ok (\"Honey, I'm pregnant!\" \"WHAT DID YOU SAY??\" *faints*)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. YOU MAY GET YOUR CHARACTER INTO A LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION, BUT DON'T KILL IT AFTER JUST TWO CHAPTERS. It is allowed to get your character killed, but make sure there are plenty of chapters that the character has lived through. Ergo, if you got him/her into the midst of a space battle and he/she just has the luck to be in a ship that's going to be destroyed, that's okay. But don't, like after two chapters, get your character ran over just out of the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. TRY TO FOLLOW THE PATH THE CHARACTER  HAS TAKEN.<br>\r\nThat means, you should have the character follow the main storyline, but you can add an option which, for example lets Mace Windu slay Agen Kolar, Saesee Tiin and Kit Fisto and join Sidious as an Apprentice. That is allowed, but if you want to add such a storyline, just let one option be a continuation of the regular storyline, and one option the alternate storyline.</td>",
