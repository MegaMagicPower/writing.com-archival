Janet and Marie both looked to Diane for guidance, and fell silent.<br>\r\n     It took about thirty minutes to arrive at the school.  All the girls quickly exited the car, and were told by Corrine that they would be picked up in the same area at 3:00.  Denise looked frightened and wanted some assurance.  She slowly walked into the school, and proceeded down the stairs to the lockers.  She found hers and opened it.  This was the first time she had a locker to store her things in.  <br>\r\n     Denise looked at her watch, and realized she had to find room S-45, her home room.  She found it, and there was Mary. sitting two rows away from her.  Mary was very outgoing, while Denise was painfully shy.  None of the other girls in the room struck up a conversation with Denise, so she just listened to the teacher, took some notes. looked at her schedule, and proceeded to find her English class.  She wondered would she ever find a friend here, or would it be the four most boring years of her life.<br>\r\n     What should she do next? </span></div></div>",

She looked at her schedule, and noticed that her Speech teacher was Mr. Sill.  Could they be related?<br>\r\n     Mrs. Sill started the roll call, and stated that everyone  had to be seated alphabetically.  This, for Denise, would be horrendous.  She would have to sit in the back.  After the roll, an assignment sheet was distributed and explained.  Questions were taken and answered.  Denise wondered how she should approach the teacher in regard to her eyesight problem.  She knew this would make her an outcast immediately, and friendless for life.

Denise is stunned, but grateful that at least someone care about her, even if it was only on a legal level. She sits there, staring at her sandwich and begins to wonder if she will ever find friends. Then, after what seems like a second, the bell rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...? How can lunch be over already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looks more closely at her sandwich and realizes it has started to turn hard on the outside, she's been sitting there the entire hour, feeling aweful about herself and worried she will be alone the rest of her high school career. She begins to break down...but she has to get to class. On the other hand, she has no idea how she will react if something else bad happens to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and devours her sandwich, trying to salvage what is left of her meal. As she does though, she feels a hand begins to reach for her backpack, and begin to slowly pull it away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe freezes a moment and considers what to do next.</span></div></div>",
