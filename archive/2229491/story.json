They also wouldn\u2019t have been surprised, as these arguments had become a regular occurrence for Dominic and Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m at my wits end with you, Dom.\u201d Stopping in the middle of the garage, her face red with anger, Rebecca said, \u201cI go to all this trouble to get us an extra week in Miami; and suddenly you decide not to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company that Rebecca and Dominic both worked for, Northam Technologies, was spearheading project designed to predict the formation of hurricanes with greater accuracy.  Rebecca, as the head of Media Relations, was holding a news conference in Miami announcing the start of the project.  They both agreed, weeks ago, that they would spend an extra week down there as a vacation.  \u201cOh please, you had no trouble getting us that extra vacation time.\u201d Hurrying to catch up with Rebecca, Dominic said, \u201cYour family owns the company, you could\u2019ve asked for a month off and they\u2019d give it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived at their car, still fuming, Rebecca said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Dom; you always find some reason to weasel yourself out of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Becca; I didn\u2019t want to come to Miami in the first place.\u201d Angrily opening the driver\u2019s side door, Dominic said, \u201cThis time of year, do you have any idea how hot it\u2019ll be?  I\u2019d rather stay up here New York.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca expected Dominic to turn the car on and leave once she climbed inside.  Instead, he just sat there staring out the windshield.  Looking at him, Rebecca said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with us, Dom?  All we\u2019ve been doing lately is argue with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Becca.\u201d Sighing as he started the car, Dominic turned to look at Rebecca.  \u201cI think we\u2019re just stressed; with work and planning the wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d muttering under breath, Rebecca said, \u201cThe wedding you want to postpone again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we not start that argument again; I told you last night why I think we should postpone the wedding.\u201d Sighing, Dominic continued, \u201cI think we should wait until we\u2019re able to pay for more of it ourselves; and not have to rely on your uncle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca\u2019s Uncle Harold, who was the company\u2019s CEO, had pretty much raised Rebecca and her sister after their parents died.  While Rebecca was just old enough to remember her parents, Harold was the closest thing she had to a father.  \u201cAnd I told you, Uncle Harold would see it as a slap in the face if we sidestep his offer to pay for the wedding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t know what we should do, Becca.\u201d Sighing as he drove out of the parking garage, Dominic said, \u201cWe should sit down with your uncle when you\u2019re back, maybe we can get him to see reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around a 25-minute drive to the business park that housed the corporate headquarters for Northam Technologies.  After giving each other a quick kiss, Rebecca and Dominic went their separate ways.  Rebecca took the elevator up to the 9th floor and walked down to the end of the hall.  Entering the reception area, she waved at the receptionist behind the desk, \u201cMorning Carolyn, is he in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Ms. Northam; he\u2019s a little busy at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolyn didn\u2019t bat an eye as Rebecca continued through the next set of doors. <i>Must be nice</i>, she thought, <i>being related to the owner of the company</i>.  Meanwhile, Rebecca saw her uncle sitting behind his desk looking at something on his computer.  Looking up, Harold Northam smiled and said, \u201cGood morning, sweetheart.\u201d Getting up from behind his desk, Harold gave Rebecca a hug and said, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you and Dominic be on a plane to Miami?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe flight isn\u2019t for a few hours; and now Dominic\u2019s not coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the pained expression on his niece\u2019s face, Harold gestured for her to sit on the couch.  Taking a seat next to her, he said, \u201cYou two had another argument, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night, and it was a nasty one.\u201d Sighing, Rebecca said, \u201cDominic wants to postpone the wedding until we can pay for it ourselves.  I tried to tell him that you wouldn\u2019t like that, but he insisted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold never particularly cared for Dominic, and this was something that Rebecca was aware of.  He thought that she could do so much better than some lowly IT technician; one who, despite having a decent work ethic, had no sense of ambition.  Rebecca was also an attractive young woman, a champion gymnast in High School, while Dominic was a little on the pudgy side.  \u201cHas it ever occurred to you, honey, that perhaps money isn\u2019t really the reason Dominic wants to postpone?\u201d looking at Rebecca, Harold said, \u201cWhat if this is his way of backing out of the engagement; putting up enough obstacles until you\u2019ve had enough and called it quits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot this again, Uncle Harold; regardless of what you think of him, Dominic isn\u2019t the type to just walk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can do.\u201d Placing a sympathetic hand on Rebecca\u2019s lap, Harold said, \u201cI can speak with Dominic, to try and knock some sense into him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the offer, Uncle.  But,\u201d looking at her uncle, Rebecca said, \u201cI doubt there\u2019s anything you can say that will get through to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, Rebecca; I have my ways.\u201d Reaching over to hug his niece, with a sly smile on his face, Harold said, \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at what I can do.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He tried sending her a few apology texts but she either didn\u2019t see them or was refusing to respond.  He was about to send out another text when he sensed someone standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, his heart skipped a beat when he saw Rebecca\u2019s Uncle Harold standing at the entrance to his cubicle.  \u201cM-Mr. Northam, w-what a pleasant surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca came to see me an hour ago; she told me how you two had an argument last night.\u201d Walking into the cubicle, Harold said, \u201cRebecca and her sister are like daughters to me; so when Rebecca comes to see me all upset, it doesn\u2019t make me very happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic knew that Harold didn\u2019t have a high opinion of him, as Harold would frequently say that Rebecca should find someone better.  \u201cLook sir, I-I love Rebecca more than anything; but I want to prove to her, and you, that I can provide for her on my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you expect to do that working as a lowly IT technician?\u201d scoffing, Harold said, \u201cRebecca deserves to be with someone who has the drive to move up in the world.  You\u2019ve worked for this company for 3 years, and you\u2019ve turned down several promotions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say, sir; my dad always told me that money isn\u2019t important, so long as you\u2019re doing something you love.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore Harold could respond, they were interrupted by a young pregnant woman with a buzz cut.  \u201cHey Dom, can you help me with something really quick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic took one look at Harold before turning back to the coworker.  \u201cSure thing, Marci.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold waited until Dominic and Marci were out of sight; reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a small vial.  Opening the top, he poured the contents into Dominic\u2019s coffee mug.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dominic.  But,\u201d returning the now empty vial to his pocket, Harold said, \u201cI\u2019m certain this will help give you some perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic returned a few minutes later, looking mildly annoyed about something.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry to cut this short, Harold; but something\u2019s come up.\u201d Grabbing his mug and laptop, Dominic said, \u201cThere\u2019s an issue down in one of the labs that I need to look at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize Dominic, I won\u2019t take up any more of your time.\u201d Getting to his feet, Harold said, \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll think about what I said; alright?\u201d</span></div></div>",

After finishing off the last of his coffee, he said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the problem exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with one of the decontamination showers.  Apparently,\u201d putting her access card against a reader, Marci said, \u201cIt\u2019s not opening once the decontamination cycle is completed.  One of the techs had to be set home, as the experience triggered a claustrophobia-induced panic attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting with the remaining lab tech, Marci and Dominic entered a changing area next to the showers.  Rather than risk putting Marci in a potentially dangerous, as well as embarrassing, situation Dominic agreed to be the guinea pig.  Once he\u2019d changed into a pair of boxers to protect his modesty, he stepped inside and signaled Marci to start the cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as the shower door closed, Dominic was hit with the worst cramps he\u2019d ever experienced in his life.  It was almost like his insides were on fire.  With no other options, he hit the panic button.  Dominic\u2019s pain grew exponentially worse as the alarms started blaring outside.  It seemed to be spreading through his body.  His last thoughts before losing consciousness were of Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crews arrived in near record time, running into the room to find Marci making a feeble attempt to open the door.  \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know.\u201d Trying to remain calm, Marci said, \u201cHe started to scream and then he hit the panic button.  That\u2019s all I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rescue crew finally managed to open the door and go inside.  Seeing a figure lying prone on the floor, they said, \u201cAre you alright,\u2026sir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure on the floor sat up.  From Marci\u2019s description they\u2019d expected to see a man.  However, while the figure was wearing a set of men\u2019s boxers, she was most definitely a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness you\u2019re here.\u201d Looking up at the men of the rescue crew, running a hand through her wet hair, the woman said, \u201cThat was quite an experience, let me tell you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Marci remained with Dominic as he...she was brought to a nearby room to be examined, her reasoning equal parts concern and curiosity. After all, it wasn\u2019t every day that someone you worked closely with for 3 years suddenly becomes a woman. Despite being a woman herself, Marci was asked to wait outside while a company physician did a thorough examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed the time by giving a statement to the rescue team, who were just as confused once they realized Marci hadn\u2019t mistakenly said Dominic was a man. It wasn\u2019t long before the closed door opened, and the doctor stepped out. Looking at Marci and the guards, she said, \u201cThe patient is ready for visitors; but not all at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as quickly as her pregnancy would allow her, Marci entered the room to find Dominic stepping out of the bathroom while buttoning his shirt. Dominic looked up at her with a wry smile on his face, \u201cHey Marci,\u201d doing a little spin, Dominic continued, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, or asking if it was alright, Marci walked over and placed her hands against Dominic\u2019s chest. \u201cY-You\u2019re a woman? H-How is that possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing surprisingly calm given the circumstances, Dominic said, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know for sure, but the doctor things I was exposed to something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing concerned, Marci said, \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly calm about this whole thing, Dom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is.\u201d Looking at her appearance in the mirror, her voice becoming bolder, Dominic said, \u201cI think I look pretty good for a 38-year-old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Marci had to admit that Dominic made a rather good-looking woman \u2013 tall, slender frame with not an ounce of fat. She was about to comment about that, when she realized what Dominic had just said, \u201cWait a minute...38 years old?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right; I don\u2019t look a day over 32.\u201d Sitting down on the exam bed, Dominic said, \u201cApparently whatever changed me into a woman also made me 13 years older.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci, once again, was beginning to question why Dominic was so calm about this. Before she could ask him about that, the doctor re-entered the room. \u201cWell Mr. Harrison, you\u2019ve certainly given me quite a mystery to solve.\u201d Looking at Dominic, she said, \u201cI\u2019m no closer to figuring out what caused this; but my preliminary tests show that you\u2019re healthy and not a threat to others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, with a smile, Dominic said, \u201cThat\u2019s great news, doctor; I assume that means I\u2019m free to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see no reason to keep you here; I\u2019ll call you if I find anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dominic started towards the door, Marci stepped in front to stop him. Thrown off by the contemptuous look on Dominic\u2019s face, Marci turned her attention to the doctor. \u201cDoc, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s smart to let Dominic go just yet.\u201d Ignoring the annoyed groan from Dominic, Marci continued, \u201cI think there is something wrong with him; if you found yourself turned into an older man, would you be this calm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Doc, you said I was fine; it\u2019s probably just shock.\u201d Dominic turned around to defend himself, \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll start freaking out once I get home and explain everything to Rebecca.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor had to admit that she\u2019d shared some of Marci\u2019s concerns; she wouldn\u2019t be this calm in a situation like this, but people handle situations differently. Having other pressing things to do, including writing a report on this, the doctor said, \u201cIf you experience any unusual behavior, call me immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor walked out of the room, leaving Dominic alone with Marci. She blocked him again as he tried to move towards the door. \u201cLook Marci, I know you\u2019re just being a good friend; but back off.\u201d gently pushing her aside, Dominic said, \u201cNow\u2019s my chance to have a little fun without that loser holding me back, and I intend to take full advantage of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarci tried to protest, but Dominic left the room before she could say anything. She\u2019d worked closely with Dominic for almost 3 years; the only person who knew him better than her was Rebecca. She knew there was something wrong with him but couldn\u2019t put her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominic beat a hasty retreat towards the exit, having no urge to stick around longer than she had to.  Contrary to what everyone else thought, Dominic was experiencing an unforeseen side effect.  Not only had he been transformed into an older woman, but another personality was slowly taking control.  With a smile on her face, \u2018Dominic\u2019 walked through the parking garage to where the car was parked.  \u201cGod,\u201d chuckling as she climbed into the car, \u2018Dominic\u2019 said, \u201cIt was almost too easy convincing those two that I was loser Dominic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new personality couldn\u2019t care less about what caused her to come into existence; all she cared about was taking advantage of the situation while she could.  <i>Time to have myself a little fun</i>, driving out of the parking garage, the woman said, <i>and Dominic can\u2019t stop me.</i></span></div></div>",

Looking up at the screen, he saw that it was nothing more than an incident report.  He\u2019d made it policy to include him in every email about an incident anywhere in the company.  He didn\u2019t normally read them, but this time something told him he should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely skimmed the email before he was on his feet and running out the door.  He ran down the stairs so fast his feet barely touched the floor.  Running into the IT department, he saw Dominic\u2019s coworker sitting at her desk.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Dominic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctor sent him home, sir.\u201d Sighing, Marci said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a smart idea, but she overruled me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe IT department was woefully understaffed right now, so Marci was the only one in the room.  \u201cA grown man turns into a woman, and she sends him home?\u201d leaning against the cubicle to catch his breath, Harold said, \u201cDid she say anything about what may have caused such a radical transformation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Getting to her feet, Marci walked over to the water cooler.

But how could that be true if she were on a plane flying to Miami.  \u201cSir, we need to find Dominic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Harold turned and left the room, once more dialing Dominic\u2019s number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at strip mall across town, \u2018Dominic\u2019 saw that Harold was calling her again.

As she placed an apron om Dominique to keep away the hair, the woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you around here before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t.\u201d focusing on the mirror, Dominique said, \u201cI\u2019m kind of new in town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, welcome to Lavish Locks; my name\u2019s Michelle.\u201d With a smile on her face, Michelle said, \u201cWhat can I do for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve recently experienced somewhat of a rebirth.\u201d With a devilish grin, Dominique said, \u201cI\u2019m basically looking for a fresh look to show off the new me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Michelle was at all confused by Dominique\u2019s frankly vague response, she didn\u2019t say anything.  How would she have any way of knowing what Dominique was really alluding to.  Reaching for her scissors, Michelle said, \u201cEveryone deserves a fresh look every now and then; so, let\u2019s see what we can come up with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Dominique assumed would take only a short while ending up taking almost 2 hours.  But, as she looked at herself in the mirror, she couldn\u2019t argue with the results that she was seeing.  Michelle spent most of the time putting highlights into Dominique\u2019s hair, following that up with a modest use of the curling iron.  \u201cMichelle, you\u2019re a miracle worker.\u201d Getting to her feet, Dominique leaned in to give her a hug, \u201cThis is the best my hairs looked in god knows how long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, Dominique.\u201d Leading Dominique back to the counter, Michelle said, \u201cNow all you need is a new outfit, and you\u2019ll have your pick of men at the bar tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique wasn\u2019t sure how long she\u2019d be around for; so, she knew she had to take advantage of the situation while she could.  <i>It\u2019s probably best I have fun while I can</i>, she thought to herself, <i>before I go back to being that dullard</i>.  After paying Michelle for her work, and giving her a generous tip, Dominique returned to the car.  As she pulled out into traffic, Dominique said to herself, \u201cNow to go find an appropriate outfit for the evening.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Besides, Dominique thought to herself as she rode the escalator, at least the money is finally being used for something.  That wasn\u2019t entirely true, and Dominique knew it; the money was being saved for Dominic and Rebecca\u2019s wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping off the elevator, she made a beeline to one of the high-end clothing stores.  Walking inside, projecting an air of confidence that Dominic could never pull off, she walked up to one of the workers.  \u201cHello there, I\u2019m planning a fun night on the town tonight; and I need an outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker, a young woman in her late teens, looked less than thrilled as she gestured towards the woman\u2019s clothing section.  \u201cFollow me,\u201d with no enthusiasm at all, the woman said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you what we\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique silently followed the woman, while internally she debated talking with the manager about her.  <i>No</i>, thinking to herself, <i>I\u2019m not going to be a Karen</i>.  They were barely in the woman\u2019s section for a minute before Dominique found a dress that she thought was perfect.  It looked just the right size and would leave little to the imagination.  Taking it off the rack, she said, \u201cWhich way to the changing room, I want to try this on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman silently pointed a short distance away, before walking off.  Dominique took the dress into the changing area; <br>\r\nentering one of the stalls, she closed the door and got undressed.  It was only once she was completely naked, that she realized she was wearing men\u2019s briefs.  \u201cGood lord,\u201d disgusted with herself, Dominique said, \u201cI guess I need to buy some new underwear, and possibly a few bras.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out the dress was just the right size, if only slightly bigger than it needed to be.  But it still clung snugly in all the right places, which was all she cared about.  Once she was satisfied with the dress, she changed out of it and back into Dominic\u2019s clothes.  <i>If I\u2019m going to be sticking around, I should probably get some new clothes to wear.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a pack of underwear, along with a few bras, she took her purchases to the counter.  She left the mall a few minutes later, feeling better than she\u2019d had in a long time.  As she got back into the car, she thought about to do next.  She figured it was only a matter of time before people started looking for her, so she couldn\u2019t go back to the apartment.  \u201cOh well, guess I\u2019ll just have to get a room for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Miami International Airport, Rebecca was getting off the plane.</span></div></div>",

Going back to the apartment was out of the question, so she settled on getting a hotel room.  The problem with that was there was a Comic Book convention in town this weekend, Dominique knew that it would be difficult to find a room anywhere.  Arriving at one of the nicer oceanfront resorts in Northern New Jersey, Dominique parked the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the lobby, projecting an air of confidence that Dominic wouldn\u2019t have been able to pull off, Dominique walked up to the front desk.  The clerk, a woman in her mid-20s, walked out of the office and said, \u201cWelcome to Seaside Resort &amp; Spa, how can I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her card across the counter, Dominique said, \u201cI\u2019d like a room, please; preferably a suite but I\u2019ll take whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the card, the clerk took one look at it and said, \u201cThis card says Dominic Harrison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess it was only a matter of time before someone got smart.</i>  \u201cIt\u2019s alright; that\u2019s my card too.\u201d Licking her lips, Dominique said, \u201cPlease; I can be very...appreciative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk smiled for a moment as she took a casual look down Dominique\u2019s cleavage.  Blushing ever so slightly, the clerk said, \u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d  After a few seconds passed, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re in luck; we\u2019ve got one suite available overlooking the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was upstairs in the room, Dominique chuckled; being only a few hours old, she wasn\u2019t sure if she was attracted to men or women.  But, as she eyed the bikini lying on her bed, she knew figuring that out was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure she looked presentable, Dominique made her way down to the pool; flashing a flirtatious grin towards the clerk as she walked by the desk.  Once on the pool deck, she ordered a <i>Sex on the Beach</i> from the bar and found a vacant lounge chair nearby.  Between sips, she found herself enjoying the looks she was receiving from both men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time she\u2019d finished her drink, she noticed an older man approaching her.  He looked to be in his early 50s and, if the tan line on his ring finger was any indication, he was looking to have some fun.  Taking a seat next to her, the man said, <br>\r\n\u201cHello there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Dominique smiled and said, \u201cHi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGesturing to Dominique's empty glass, the man said, \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you.  But,\u201d with a smile, Dominique said, \u201cI could go for a <i>Slow Comfortable Screw Between the Sheets.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled back as he casually walked over to the bar to make an order.
