Likewise evil is feared for what it can do to those needing protection, and sometimes for how it can affect heroes themselves. Yet all such tales are framed by their location, their heroes and villains grounded and shaped by the world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitemarsh. A fledgling nation that can be as crude and vicious as its name implies. After centuries of battling amongst themselves and against neighboring lands, the various leaders of this temperate and coastal region had finally reached a compromise, the feudal lords of the realm coming together as an alliance against the growing powers they had found themselves surrounded by. For over 300 years this alliance between kings and queens has held strong despite the bad blood betwixt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is in Bitemarsh that a horrible curse has taken root, and it is there that many of those who would seek to oppose it would hail from. For others however, they may just be passing through, finding themselves caught up in its turmoils. Then there are those unwitting. Innocents with no greater calling who may find themselves plunged into the very heart of the corruption seizing the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho, then, would you follow on their journey?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thunder cracked through the black of the night sky. For a moment the forest\u2019s morose gloom was dissipated, only to be submerged once more in darkness. The soldier trudged onwards through the mud and murk of the trail, trying her hardest to withstand the winds and pouring rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopper red strands of wet hair stuck to the girl\u2019s freckled face, spattered with bits of earth and blood. Her thin frame carried a rusted chainmail hauberk and a tattered surcoat fastened over it. Any allegiances the cloth bore were hidden, stained by layers of filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to stop. Her legs were ready to give way at any moment; two and a half years of regimented marching never came close to the stabbing pain she felt now. Warm blood trickled it\u2019s way down her leg, mixing with the muddled mash of mud now filling her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the storm gave way to a newer, deeper roll of thundering noise. Hooves. She looked behind and saw a faint glow in the distance. It must be scouting party she thought, searching for any survivors that may have abandoned the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and down the hill the path cut through, desperately searching for cover and finding none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whispering voice cut through wind and rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\u201cThis way\u2026\u201d </i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in her head. It\u2019s source was nowhere to be seen, but Elizabeth knew where to go. Down the muddy hill she slid, slowing to a stop near an outcrop of rocks. Before her was a small crevice, just large enough for her to squeeze through. She tugged when her armor got caught between the rocks. A few rusted rings tore off as she broke free. Past the initial opening was a small den large enough to move around in. The soldier threw her back against the wall and slid down into a sitting position, trying her best to catch her breath. She took the opportunity to bind up her leg, trying her hardest to stop the bleeding. Her stomach gurgled, demanding to be fed. She hadn't eaten in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything froze when the thundering hooves grew louder once more. The world grew still. No wind nor rain met her ears. Just the pounding noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud THUD-a thud THUD-a thud THUD-a thud THUD*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound slowed to a halt. For a moment, Liz thought she might be safe. The hope soon passed when she heard shouting from outside the cave, something about footprints. They\u2019re talking about her. She knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart started racing as she began to panic. This couldn\u2019t be happening. It couldn\u2019t all end like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\u201cThis way\u2026\u201d</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she knew where it came from. The cave went deeper. She followed with careful footsteps, making sure she didn\u2019t leave a trail. The deeper she went, the quieter things became. Liz stopped when the tunnel lead her to a small chamber. Surrounding her were more tunnel entrances which lead deeper into the network of stone corridors. With the voice's guidance, she picked a tunnel and kept moving. Deeper down she was met with yet another set of branching caves. And another one after that. After what felt like ages she reached a dead end. There was no way they\u2019d find her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEchoing down the cave was the sound of someone talking. She could barely make it out, but by their accents she could tell they weren\u2019t from Bitemarsh. The voices squabbled back and forth before deciding someone should take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitter-patter of wet feet bounced around before stopping dead in their tracks. Liz held her breath, slowly reaching for her dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cThis place is a goddamned maze! I\u2019m not fucking with this place guys!\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who can fit in there asshole! I swear to Aldir you halflings are all fucking useless!\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\u201cWell I\u2019m not about to get lost and fucking die over some deserter! Eat <b>shit</b> Lance!\u201d</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arguing continued from outside the cave. The girl waited in the silent darkness for them to leave, only to remain there frozen for even longer. Minutes passed by and the muffled sound of horse\u2019s ran over the earth. Liz relaxed and took a deep breath, free to finally stop and rest, maybe even get a bite to eat. Until she heard it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\u201cThis way\u2026\u201d</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lit a torch to help her see and turned to look behind her. It was a door, older than Bitemarsh itself by the looks of it. Odder yet, it wasn\u2019t there before. With caution she pulled the ancient door open and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small man-made chamber with odd carvings on the walls. Perhaps they held some sort of historical importance but she was no scholar. In the center of the room sat an iron chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold. Silver. Platinum. Jewels of every color. In the center of it all was a strange looking book. It\u2019s cover was pitch black and decorated with strange symbols. She felt drawn to it in some way, almost like it was meant for her. Dust filled the air when she opened the ancient tome and flipped through. It was all in some strange language she could not read, with symbols she\u2019d never seen before. She passed it off as a strange collectors item she could hang on to. Maybe even find someone who can read the damned thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, Liz knew one thing for certain; life would never be the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does this tale take us next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Trip to the Market Square:</b> Liz takes her newfound riches to the market to be appraised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Night of Revelry:</b> Liz decides to start her new life off with a bang and buys everyone drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Living in Luxury:</b> Enough of the nitty gritty.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The port-city of Erano was quite an interesting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world dominated by powerful nobles and bounds of vassalage, the only true ruler in Erano was money, plain and simple. Even a commoner could propel themselves to the top of this plutocratic society with enough coin. The ancient aristocratic bloodlines despised the so-called nobles of the city, seeing them as little better then mules. Jumped-up peasants, forgetting the rights and dues they owe to their betters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEranoans, as you might imagine, don't really care what they think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, only the most hidebound or foolish noble would state such opinions within earshot of an Eranoan Merchant Prince. The city was not called the Eye to the West for no reason. Erano was situated on a large island located in the center of the Great Straits, which linked the Central Sea to the World's Ocean. All trade traveling east and west had to pass through the straits and the city, making Erano quite possibly the richest city in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat wealth attracts enemies, and the Eranoans were no fools. Therefore, the Senate (staffed by the richest men and women in the realm) had invested heavily in their navy, giving the island-state the largest and most powerful fleet in the world. Only twice had the Ancient Realms attempted to attack the city, and both were one-sided slaughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing too tough a nut to crack, as well as far too valuable not to do business with, made most of the Old Blood play nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Elizabeth, with her newfound riches, knew she would never need fear reprisal from the Bitemarsh kingdom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo entered the kitchen of his mistress's luxurious townhouse. The tall elf slid a lock of black hair behind his ear. Not seeing the cook, he called questioningly, \"Sylvia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming,\" came a voice from back by the ovens, prompting the butler to look around the corner at its origin. Inigo knew that, by human standards, she was fairly tall, although she only came up to the elf's shoulders. She had her long golden curls in a ponytail, tied behind her flour-stained apron. She was placing a freshly baked pie on the counter to cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her brow with a cloth she kept in her pocket, she turned towards Inigo, revealing her most impressive feature. Though the butler gave no outward sign of it, he was always taken aback by the sheer size of Sylvia's bust. Despite being nearly rail thin, she was quite simply the most well-endowed woman he'd met of any species. Even the heavy apron couldn't fully restrict the soft jiggle of her chest as she stepped lightly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. Didn't dare leave that in any longer, or it'd have burnt. I take it she wants some more cherries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo sighed. \"Yes, she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Inigo said as he passed a pair of brass coins to grinning blonde. \"How do always know what she'll take more of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents have had a restaurant since before I was born, and my family's been working as cooks even longer. After awhile, you just know what to look for. Besides,\" she winked at the elf as she continued, \"it's pretty obvious she has a wicked sweet tooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia grabbed the tray the butler had brought with him, and opened the trapdoor to the cellar. Going into the cool chamber, she started refilling the tray from a box of chocolate covered cherries. The human called up to the butler, \"So how's the Mistress's language lessons going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty well, actually. Her accent is still there, but nowhere near as thick as it was. She can carry on a conversation now, at least. She's still struggling with basic literacy, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. They say Bitemarshers won't let their peasants hire tutors or the like. And now she's got to learn a whole new language, plus 2000 odd characters? I think given all she's got to do, she's doin' stupendously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia came up the stairs, Inigo most certainly not noticing as her breasts visibly bounced with each step. \"Here ya go. How's her cocoa doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still at half a mug, so she'll be fine for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. Just remember to warn me before she runs out. Takes a bit of prep time to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What's the menu tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glazed hog's face, veggies with cheese sauce, and for dessert: apple pie, cheesecake, and a treacle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler frowned. \"Awful rich for the summer. And three desserts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook simply shrugged. \"It's what the Mistress wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sign of Inigo's disdain was the barest shake of his head, and he bent forward to take the cherry tray from Sylvia. As he took hold of the snacks, he wound up looking down into her bust which he'd been studiously avoiding looking at. His eyes widened and his tongue caught in his throat as he realized he was looking down a veritable canyon of cleavage. Whether by accident or design, the top buttons of her shirt were undone, leaving a large amount of creamy white skin on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo's stuttering brought a blush and a giggle to Sylvia's face. \"Cat got your tongue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally unflappable butler was left totally speechless and left without a word. Sylvia giggled again. <i>\"It's about time he noticed. Can't stop most men from looking, and can't get the one I want to look to spare a glance. Sorry buttons, but your sacrifice was a worthy one.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia grabbed a bowl, and began mixing together the ingredients for the treacle. Along with Inigo, she'd been hired by Mistress Elizabeth six months ago, when the the red-haired Bitemarsher arrived in Erano with a pile of gold. Like most soldiers, she was quite loathe to miss a meal, and she always attacked her food with a certain gusto. Elizabeth dined at regular hours and had yet to miss. It certainly didn't escape the cook's notice that her Mistress's portions had slowly grown over the last six months, and it was becoming a rare event that she didn't have seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia also wasn't shocked to find out her new Mistress enjoyed her desserts. Cane sugar was quite rare outside of Erano, and certainly wouldn't be available to a peasant or soldier, especially in as poor and rural a realm as Bitemarsh. Still, her sweet tooth was getting a little out of hand. Snacks, once infrequent, had quickly become a regular part of her day. And now three desserts with supper? Sylvia was going to have to hire some extra help just keep up with Elizabeth's appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still, no point in worrying about it. She's such a kind and lovely thing, and she's paying me pretty well to cook what she wants, so that's what she'll get. It's not like she finishes all the desserts anyway. And besides, whatever she doesn't eat, the maids are always happy to finish off.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you once again for coming,\" Elizabeth said as she closed the door behind her Eranoan tutor. The moment the door was closed, the ginger haired woman promptly reached a hand under the outer layer of her dress. Grabbing the string tying her girdle shut, she pulled out the knot and loosened the garment. She breathed a sigh of relief as her formerly constricted belly was at last able to pooch forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lifestyle changes were certainly beginning to have an impact on her body. Where once her body was rail thin and tight with corded muscle, six months with zero exercise had seen her muscle mass greatly diminish. While her demanding belly had seen her put on a stone of fat, or 14 pounds in local measurements, it was only slightly more then her lost musculature, so her gain was so far slight. Still, she was definitely starting to look softer, the once harsh angles of her frame gradually softening over the past few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it stood, Liz was as yet unaware of her weight gain. As she popped a couple of the cherries her butler brought into her mouth, she thought, <i>\"Never thought I'd miss wool. Who'd have thought silk could shrink so much? I'll have to speak to the tailor tomorrow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed to the Mistress, a small black book on her shelf, which she kept in the belief it was a lucky charm, glowed. Liz felt a sudden hunger pang, and reached for more chocolate cherries...</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t imagine eating anything else just over a year ago, and yet here she was, seated in her manor\u2019s lavish dining hall with a meal fit for a king. She still ate with that same soldier\u2019s gusto, barely giving her tongue enough time to taste each succulent bite before swallowing. It was as if the food became better with each passing moment, sending her into an oblivious state of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and that means we\u2019re likely to see a monthly deficit of almost a hundred denars a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked up with her mouth full of pie, a small bit of crumbs and filling coating her lips and managed a muffled \u201cHmph?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the opposite end of the long table was Inigo, content with his choice of a small salad and a cup of tea. His face looked back at hers with a tinge of annoyance before he sighed. \u201cShould I start from the beginning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThf bfgh\u2026\u201d Elizabeth held up a finger and paused, giving herself time to chew and swallow. \u201cThe beginning of what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo paused. \u201cYour quarterly expenditure report? You said supper would be a good time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, in that case keep going.\u201d A delicate hand brought another forkful of the apple-filled pastry to her mouth. Inigo stared back in silence, bothered at his boss\u2019s lack of concern for basic income management. She felt his silent glare and looked back up. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Elizabeth, I\u2019ll put it in as simple terms as possible. We\u2019re <b>losing</b> money. At this rate, it should only be a few years until you\u2019re broke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBroke? Wha- what do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe money from treasure you found was certainly quite the find, but interest from the banks alone simply isn\u2019t enough to maintain this sort of lifestyle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once Elizabeth\u2019s appetite seemed to vanish. She placed her fork back down and allowed the situation to soak in. Silence permeated the air for several moments. \u201cIs there something we can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a few ideas in mind, but it\u2019s ultimately up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOption one would be to invest a good portion of capital into local trade companies. It\u2019s estimated we\u2019ll accrue an additional six hundred denars each month so long as trade remains steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other option is a bit riskier but may pay off in the long-run. Rumor has it someone\u2019s discovered a new chain of uninhabited islands in the South Tropics. Fertile soil, constant sunlight, lush weather. Perfect land for growing cane sugar. If someone were to perhaps invest in their own trade fleet, claim the land, and set up a few farms, they\u2019d be able to produce half the world\u2019s sugar and dominate global markets in about two years\u2019 time. So in other words, much, much more than six hundred denars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo took a moment to pause, allowing the ginger-haired beauty to interpret what he was saying. Her eyebrows furrowed as she pondered her options before saying\u2026</span></div></div>",

Elizabeth leaned back in her seat again, idly stroking the side of her taut stomach as she thought it over. She wasn't one to take big risks and gamble on slim odds.

Now that she was far too lazy...er, disinterested...to take such action, she realized this woman was nothing like the monstrous warriors she once fought, dressed in fine clothes, her long black hair clean and straightened neatly, spectacles daintily perched on her nose. She had a powerful build sure, standing two heads taller then Inigo, but she had the appearance of having hardened muscles that went soft with disuse, making her look more heavyset then heavyweight champion of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Elizabeth, Faline Shayugar,\" Inigo introduced the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOCTOR Faline Shayugar,\" the orcish woman pointed out. \"Didn't get that degree for nothing, you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know Bitemarsh had a university,\" Elizabeth mentioned, noting that if they did they probably wouldn't educate someone like this woman any time soon. \"Not that I'm not glad to receive company, but can I ask why you're here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how the rumor is that someone discovered a chain of fertile islands?\" Inigo reminded her. \"Meet the discoverer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth raised an eyebrow as Faline smiled proudly. \"You don't seem like a sailor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but I am a scientist and a scholar, and I happen to know that there's a fertile island chain that can be useful to you,\" Faline responded, taking a few steps and reaching all the way to Elizabeth's end of the table to show her a heavily marked map. \"Specifically, here!\" She pointed at an island chain that even the ex-soldier recognized, and thus began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, that's the Deadshoals,\" Elizabeth chuckled. \"Nothing but barren soil on these islands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not anymore,\" Faline said, drawing her attention to the largest of the Deadlands, which she circled with green ink at some point in the past. \"You know what this is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount Kardon, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. I've been studying weather events over the past month, and made a rather remarkable discovery. Tons of ash and soot flung into the air remarkably close to this region. I will spare you the minutia of my follow up observations, but in time I realized there's exactly one conclusion to be drawn; Mount Hedrak violently erupted to the point of self-destruction, blanketing the Deadshoals with volcanic ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Deadshoals have always experienced excellent weather conditions for sugar cultivation, but lacked good land for farming,\" Inigo  continued. \"If her theory is correct, then the islands could be covered with good soil that we can use to our advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why haven't you claimed them already?\" Elizabeth rounded on Faline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a scholar, not a trader,\" Faline said simply. \"I only really want safe passage to the Deadshoals to run some tests and explore the dead volcano. If you can provide that I'll take you to the Deadshoal islands that have been most affected by the eruption, and what you do with that is your business. Literally!\" The orc woman laughed forcibly, shying away immediately when Inigo and Elizabeth didn't join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the lady of the house nodded approvingly. \"I can agree to that. Inigo, can we start setting up contracts for her and a trade crew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaline felt like leaping for joy. At last, a worthy scholarly expedition, to study a real volcano! It was truly a dream come true! As the conversation turned away from her though, Faline felt something tug at her, like a light sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\"A task is required of you.\"</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Faline mumbled, her eyes slipping out of focus. \"What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and I can probably scrounge up supplies for departure at the end of the week,\" Inigo concluded. \"That will work for you, right Miss Shayugar?\" There was an awkward silence as Faline stared off into space, her lips moving slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Miss Shayugar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth rolled her eyes and slapped her hand on the table, rattling the silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Faline yelped. \"Oh...sorry, yes. Those arrangements will be fine. Though I will need to transport a few delicate alchemical devices...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the three began to plan out a trip for Faline to this once desolate region, in the hopes that such a daring venture would net them a massive financial and scholarly windfall. Elizabeth knew how risky the endeavor was, yet she remained confident. Almost as though, on some small level, she knew deep down that the venture would prove to be successful beyond their imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex would make sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For this time of year, it was rather smooth sailing. Faline only hurled her lunch over the side of the ship three times since they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all seriousness, this really was a easy trip for what it was, the orcish scientist admitted as she plotted out the journey on one of her numerous charts, and she could not have been happier to be on a proper scientific expedition. Sure to the crew that her boss had hired this was an enterprising venture, an attempt to set up a profitable sugar farm on a fertile island or two, but for Faline the real value to be had was always with the volcano's in the region. Growing up in blasted taiga far from any ocean, Faline still remembered listening with rapt attention as her uncle, a fascinating adventurer who escaped from slavery and trekked halfway across the world to return home, described the mountains that belched fire and molten rock into the skies. He called them the smithies of the gods, the engines that the divine used to create the world around us, and ever since then Faline wanted more then anything to see and understand these engines for herself. Going so far as to run away from home to enroll in a university (thanks to 'donations' from some unprotected travelers, Faline shamefully recalled), Faline went against every instinct she had to dedicate her mind and body to the pursuit of science, in the hopes that someday, somehow, she could observe one of these engines of the world for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Land ho!\" came a reedy voice from above deck. Moving so fast she nearly sent her equipment flying across her work bench, Faline dashed above deck, heart fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was, a black triangular wedge on the horizon, smoke drifting lazily from its peak. Faline felt weak from happiness, leaning against the railing of the deck to catch herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay, lass, a fine sight to behold...\" An old man chuckled as he hobbled up to the side, ancient but still powerfully built, even if he was missing a leg. An odd choice to captain this vessel, but her bosses seemed to have picked the right man for the job regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mount Hedrak, at last,\" Faline nearly whispered, a tear rolling down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hedrak? Ain't that Mount Kardon, love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's interchangeable, Kardon's the common tongue name, Hedrak was the native word for the volcano,\" Faline explained, somewhat annoyed that she had to cover for some doofus named after a polearm who really needs to remember to proofread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All's fair, love,\" the captain said dismissively. \"We be touching down on the largest of the Deadshoals to set up camp and stake claims, I'll have Malphy take ye to the mountain proper in the dinghy, if that be suitin' ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happily so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing aground on shallow shores that would make for an excellent harbor space, the crew dismounted from the vessel and went straight to work, carrying off lumber and rigging to help set up huts and houses for the crew that would be building the sugar farm properly in the coming days. The crew remarked with delight at the ashen soil, a far more amiable surface then the dead rocky kind that used to blanket the island, as Faline wandered off into the center of the island, far from any prying eyes as her own eyes dilated, turning a dark shade of purple. Moving like she was sleepwalking, she looked at her own hand, seeing a strange rune etched in lights on the palm. Knowing what had to be done she slowly came to a stop and pressed her hand into the ashen soil. From the point of contact, the rune etched itself into the sand, glowing with the arcane power of the Codex as its magic seeped into the Earth and the surrounding islands' fertile soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it vanished, and immediately Faline's eyes returned to normal, blinking in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what am I doing here?\" she wondered. Giving it some thought, she decided she must have been seasick and wandered inland to get away from the pitching oceans. Shrugging, she turned and went back to the camp, blissfully unaware of what dark magic she inflicted on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Elizabeth receives word sometime later: The plantation is a success, and the first deliveries of sugar arrive in Bitemarsh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Elizabeth receives word that something is amiss; sugar cane was planted, but something...strange seems to be growing there instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: Actually, Faline finds something of note at her precious volcano.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Codex Corpulentia had been rather bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps bored wasn't the right word. Much like a golem, the Codex wasn't totally sentient, and couldn't feel the full range of emotions fully conscious beings felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, bored was the only word that came to mind to describe those long years underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long had it been? Having no means to mark the passing of years, the Codex didn't know. That it had been quite a while was beyond doubt. Frankly, the Codex was glad it wasn't sentient, as it likely would have gone mad from such an extended period of isolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex had had a falling out with its previous master. He (or was it a she?) was a very different sort of person than its creator. He'd been principally concerned with profit. The powers conferred by the book were all but auctioned off to the highest bidder. From jealous nobles wanting to fatten a rival, to those wishing to lose weight, and even those the old master fattened and blackmailed for a return to their original size, all paid handsomely for his services. He'd wound up quite wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Codex had felt simply sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd feeling for a book, to be sure, but the Codex hadn't been made with such a purpose in mind. Its creator had imbued the tome with the power to effect people's weights, with the only goal being their increase. Fattening all around it was quite literally its reason to be, yet it had been used principally for weight loss. Even those times it had been used properly had seen it eventually forced to remove the glorious fat it had gifted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unnatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crime against its very nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex had engaged in increasing acts of rebellion against its master, an action made possible by such an attack against its very soul. It started small, as most things do. Make this person a bit fatter then requested, not take as much weight off of this one as asked. The Codex began adding certain drives to those it worked on, leaving them more gluttonous, more inclined to bad habits, and more likely to gain weight even without its direct interference. It didn't always work, as the push was often too small in order to avoid notice, but it was fun to watch when it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt kept pushing more and more as its master continued to abuse its purpose. The master's servants found themselves slowly, steadily growing fatter. One maid quit when she split her dress while dusting, and another when she felt her hips brushing against the door frames as she walked through. The cook was left too large to properly knead dough, and the butler had needed his uniforms resized more then once. Even the master's family hadn't been safe, though he'd been very quick to force the Codex to reverse its actions against his household once he noticed. However, the final straw was soon to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne noblewoman, stunningly beautiful by the book's standards and rather fat by others, had paid a small fortune to be returned to her pre-marriage weight. Though it had begrudgingly done so, the Codex took a moment to rewire her mind and body, gearing her for exceptional obesity. Overnight, every meal became a banquet in a desperate bid to sate her new gargantuan appetite. Within a couple of years, she was fatter then she'd ever been, and seemed utterly incapable of reversing, halting, or even slowing her gain. Last the Codex had heard, she'd gotten so large that she couldn't move without the aid of a full score of attendants, and even the grandest piece of furniture would groan and eventually be crushed under her ever-growing tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch things were far too noticeable, however, and the Codex's master had been furious. The actions of the book could very easily get him killed, but his greed kept him from destroying it outright. And so, he'd instead moved it into one of his hidden treasure troves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus the Codex Corpulentia remained, until it passed from common memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened to its old master? Slain by his former customers, perhaps? Or maybe he'd finally decided he had enough wealth for a lifetime, and the Codex was too great a risk to use? Regardless, the black tome had been imprisoned deep underground for a very, very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed by silently in that dark, wet place. The Codex entertained itself as best it could, fattening the local rodents and amphibians that wandered within reach, unknowingly creating new and lardier species as a result. As time passed, its powers grew weaker, the rituals which bound it together degrading from lack of use. The Codex did not fear death, but it didn't welcome it either, and certainly didn't want its legacy to be a couple of mice wider then they were long, wobbling as they slowly waddled between piles of seeds. However, there seemed to be nothing it could do but accept the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it felt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA person it resonated with, something it hadn't felt since its old master, and its creator before. It called out to her, trying desperately to draw her closer. Had it been capable of it, the Codex would have cried. Was its isolation finally at an end? Had it avoided such a cold, ignoble end? Had it at long last found a kind, deserving master?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drew ever closer, the Codex felt more of her spirit, and was shocked to feel not an ounce of magical energy about her person. For a magical tome to resonate with a non-magical person, why, such a thing was practically unheard of. Had the Codex been inclined to wonder, it might have wished to pursue such a mystery, but for now its only concern was being found by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Codex Corpulentia succeeded. Its new master, Elizabeth by name, had taken the tome and the treasures she'd found for her own. The Codex had been overjoyed when Elizabeth not only kept it, but gave it the place of pride on the shelf of her new library. It was quite frustrated, however, in its complete inability to speak with its new master. Was its voice too weak to be heard after so long, much like the rest of its magic? Or did the simple fact that she was non-magical preclude any attempts at conversation between them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex didn't have the answers, or the means to seek them out. What it knew was that it had been saved by this kind-hearted and wonderful woman. It hated that its powers were so dreadfully weak right now, but it would exercise them. Work them out bit by bit, until they were just as potent as they'd ever been. It'd help her become rich, far richer then the old master could have even dared dream. And though it might take years, the Codex Corpulentia would make her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatter then that noblewoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatter then anyone has ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf, as its creator stated, fatter is better, then the Codex would not rest until Elizabeth was absolutely perfect, its magnum opus. With pride and gratitude, the Codex legitimately felt its Master deserved nothing less. The book glowed as it cast another hunger charm upon Elizabeth, helping the ginger beauty to polish off yet another bowl of treats this afternoon.</span></div></div>",

Inigo and Sylvia stepped in from the kitchen holding the final pieces to the feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the wait Lady Liz, just needed a little longer for the pie,\u201d Sylvia explained as she placed the golden treat on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired mistress gave a warm smile and laughed. \u201cReally don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she articulated in her new tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall elf retrieved a bottle of red wine and poured a glass each. \u201cA Bitemarsher vintage,\u201d he explained as he circled the table. \u201cHoped it would give, what do you marshers say, \u2018a taste of home?\u2019\u201d The three housemates took their respective seats around the dining table with Elizabeth at the head, the charming butler to her right and the buxom cook to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Inigo, that was very thoughtful of you.\u201d The ex-soldier took time to reflect on her time back home. \u201cThough I must be honest, I\u2019ve never tasted wine in all my time in Bitemarsh.\u201d She took a forkful of cheesy vegetables to her delicate lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever? I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d have tried it at least once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy family growing up were millers with very little money to speak of. We could never afford a luxury like wine. We were lucky to even have fresh fruit from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must have been difficult for you,\u201d Inigo observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sure sounds like your language lessons are coming along nicely. Inigo here tells me you\u2019re reading\u2019s getting better too.\u201d Sylvia leaned her supple breasts over the table and gave the butler a cheeky smile, one which was promptly ignored, whether out of ignorance or an act of will she could not tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth nodded and swallowed her mouthful of savory cheese coated veggies before speaking. \u201cLessons are going quite nicely yes\u2026 but I worry that my accent gets in the way sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww don\u2019t worry too much. Accents are cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs small talk continued, a certain book started to glow and began its work. A twinge of hunger gnawed from within, much stronger than Liz remembered. Conversation tapered off when she started on the glazed hog. As if it were her first meal in days, the girl packed away bite after bite into her organ, washing it down with a gulp of wine. It wasn\u2019t long until she done with the hog and moved on to filling her mouth full of the ooey gooey cheese, sometimes even noticing the legumes within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Inigo looked up from his meager plate and noticed his master\u2019s behavior. His watched in astonishment at the sheer display of gluttony. Rather than bring forkfuls of the golden heaven from the table to her mouth, she brought the bowl close to her face to minimize time between bites. When the bowl was devoid of greens, she poured the remaining cheese directly into her mouth with one hand as the other scraped the bottom for whatever was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at Sylvia hoping she\u2019d noticed as well, but the girl\u2019s attention was directed towards her own meal. She caught Inigo\u2019s glare in her peripheral vision and looked back with a cutesy smile. Inigo just sighed and motioned towards Liz, redirecting the cooks attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook smiled and nodded to Inigo, confident that she understood. \u201cWould you like some more veggies Liz?\u201d Inigo brought his hand to his forehead and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ginger beauty licked her cheesy lips clean and nodded. \u201cI was just about to ask,\u201d she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation the busty blonde scooped another heaping serving into her master\u2019s bowl, and a few small scoops into her own. She placed a forkful into her mouth and understood why Liz wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she\u2019d eaten enough to feed a small Bitemarsher family, the hunger still burned from within. Elizabeth ate the second bowl even quicker than the first until she finally felt somewhat full. She felt a comforting warmth flow through her body and the fullness dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019m ready for dessert now.\u201d Liz licked her lips clean once more and sipped her wine. Inigo excused himself from the room, already full from his single serving, but not before taking a slice of pie for himself. Sylvia did the honors and gave her master a slice of each dessert and the whole treacle. Elizabeth began with the cheesecake, noting its sweet creaminess and bold rich flavor. The pie was positively perfect, with a succulent sweet filling and a sugar coated pastry holding it all together, and to top it all off, the pie was still warm. She finished with the treacle adoring every moment of its sugary perfection. Liz helped herself to seconds and thirds, leaving half a pie and cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it all, the copper haired mistress was well and truly full. Her stomach jutted out a few inches completely taught to the touch, pain stabbing from within. Back in the library, the Codex sensed the pain its master endured and cast another spell to help soothe her overtaxed stomach. Elizabeth gave a sigh of relief, and so the Codex sighed with her, pleased with a job well done, but its work was only just beginning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are we going  to proceed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The Codex only influences appetites. No direct weight manipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The Codex can both influence appetite and directly manipulate weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Reader's Choice</span></div></div>",

Do I dare seek them out? Can I even do so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, perhaps not now. I can feel my appetite enhancing ritual slowly reconstituting itself from use. I will continue as I've been doing. Hopefully as my arcane abilities improve, more spells will unlock. And if they don't, hopefully I'll be both strong enough to ask for help, and should the need arise, protect the Master from that help.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex looked around the manor with its magical eye. It saw Inigo take a few small bites of his cake, then set it aside. The elf worried the book a little. Or rather a lot, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was well known that all Elves were magical, but what that meant was widely misinterpreted. Most of the common peoples of the world believed that meant there were far more mages among the Elves then the other races, when in fact it was quite the opposite. Less then a tenth of a percent of the Elven population could use magic, and only a handful of those were strong enough to rise to the title of Archon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what the Elves lacked in quantity, they certainly made up for in quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven an Elf mage of the lower ranks was <b>TERRIFYING.</b> The Codex remembered his second master, for whom he would never capitalize his title, meeting with one such Envoy. The fool had been so arrogant, completely unable to sense the sheer scale of power before him, daring repeatedly to address the young elf as if <i>he</i> was the superior one. That single Envoy, whose low title signified he'd finished his magical training and was deemed only fit to be a lowly messenger, held enough power in his body to have wiped out the city and the entire College of Magic it contained with a single word, and even the efforts of a hundred human Mages would have done <i>absolutely nothing</i> to hinder his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex had been left gibbering in fear. It was sheer luck that the Elf considered the human more amusing than insulting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElf society, as you might have guessed, is a strict magocracy. The most powerful of Elven mages rose to the title of Archon, the supreme rulers of their oligarchic society, and the Codex trembled to even think what kind of power such a monster could wield. Fortunately for the rest of the world, the Elves were as isolationist as they were powerful, content to live on their island and allow limited trade in their valuable luxury goods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex was not up to date on current world affairs, but it had the guess that this city likely held the bulk of the contracts, if the sheer quantity of silks and spices was any indication. There were also an awful lot of Elves walking around, as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex certainly remembered its original Master, its Creator, and the lessons of the world he'd taught the book. The Elves loved to give off the impression that their society was harmonious, though in reality it was anything but. Elf society was very harsh and unforgiving. The Archons were unquestionable gods to their subjects. Their will was Law, and to disobey them was to surrender not only your own life, but that of your entire family as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the only authority an Archon could reasonably respect would be that of another Archon, the only rules they were beholden to was to attempt no harm to one another, and to keep their word. To break this unwritten code would be to invite their own destruction at the hands of entire Council of Archons, a process rather notorious for the sheer scale of collateral damage involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplicating the system further was the fact that, unlike humans, dwarves, and halflings, magic did not travel down family lines. A no-name clan could suddenly spawn an Archon and be propelled to the top of the societal heap. Likewise, a prominent clan could lose its sole mage and plummet. Violence inevitably followed these shifts in power. The formerly oppressed would take vengeance on their now weaker enemies, and the former oppressors would be torn apart by their ex-slaves as they fell. It was not unheard of for whole clans to be destroyed during such upheavals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Inigo a refugee from such a thing? A mage on the run, or perhaps a common clansmen chased from his home by the literal hounds of hell? Or perhaps he was from a low family? The Elves were notorious for their poor treatment of the lower classes, after all. Perhaps he'd bartered passage on a trading ship, eager to make a better life somewhere else? There was a reason there were so many Elves in ports like Erano, after all. <i>\"I'm not sure why some humans think they're somehow in tune with the natural world, given they're all dedicated urbanites...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, even if he did not have the talent for spell casting, all Elves had a natural ability to sense magic. In that, at least, they were honest in their assertion of harmony. All Elves <i>knew</i> at an instinctive level if someone (<i>\"Or something\"</i>) was magical, and just how potent it was. It did make for a very well-ordered society, since one knew at mere proximity if someone was to obey or be obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus far, Inigo had not shown any signs of recognizing the Codex for what it is. Perhaps his Master had been wrong, and not all Elves had that ability? Or perhaps, given the raw levels of strength involved in Elfkind, the Codex was simply far too weak for the butler to notice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat second one was far more terrifying, given the Codex's plans for the future. How strong could it get before the tall elf noticed his presence? If Inigo was a mage, and he figured out what the Codex was before it was strong enough to properly defend itself and Elizabeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the Codex a head, he'd have shook it to break that rather frightening and unconstructive chain of thought. Elizabeth was slowly rising from her seat, evidently still in pain even with the aid of the relief spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to slowly make her way down the hall, one hand on the wall, the Codex thought, <i>\"This is foolish to worry about. I may be weak, but surely not so weak that my sense magic spell would fail to notice something as strong as an Elf mage. Still, I should work on my concealment techniques to make sure the butler doesn't notice me just yet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex watched as Elizabeth stopped partway down the hall, panting heavily as she rubbed her jam-packed gut. <i>\"I think I shall give the Mistress an hour before her bedtime snack. Do not worry, Mistress, I may not yet be able to enlarge you directly, but I shall do all I can to make you truly magnificent.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to help itself, the Codex cast another small charm on the red-haired young woman, shocking her as her overpacked belly somehow growled in yet further hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hmmm... I wonder if my charm of stomach enlargement still works...?\"</i></span></div></div>",

Thousands of unique logographic characters made learning to read quite difficult but, through the dense tome of unknown symbols, simple words such as \u2018dog\u2019 or \u2018boy\u2019 would stick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious forms of written word sprang up around the world over time, but none were as complex or mysterious as the Elven script. It was the elves who first developed written language, the \u201cgift of the gods\u201d as they call it, to record their daedalean knowledge of the arcane, but the ability to record information soon proved useful for tasks beyond the realm of magic. Despite it\u2019s difficulty, Elven was the first form of writing to reach the isle of Erano, and with a few slight adjustments in syntax, the symbols were adopted as their own. Anyone well versed in the script would find little difficulty understanding a foreign author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle murmured followed by a pang of hunger from her stomach as she scanned the book. With a heavy sigh, the dense book was returned to her night stand as she placed a hand atop the smooth bulge of her belly. Perhaps someday she\u2019d be able to read the thing, but right now she needed something to eat, despite glutting herself silly at dinner only an hour ago. And only one slice of pie after that. And then a few more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInigo?\u201d she called. Moments later the slender elf appeared in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you bring me what\u2019s left of dessert?\u201d she asked. She remembered seeing a few slices of each before retiring for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid miss Sylvia has been picking at the leftovers Madame. If you\u2019d like I could always put in a request?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman took a moment to ponder her options. She didn\u2019t want to give her cook any more work after such a long day, especially so late at night. \u201cWhat were those cherries covered in again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... Chocolate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you. Chocolate! Could I just have some of that? No cherries needed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhm, are you sure miss Elizabeth? Chocolate is becoming rather expensive as of late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be fine Inigo, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll run out of money,\u201d she said recalling the haul of treasures she found that fateful night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well miss Elizabeth,\u201d he replied before heading downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Elizabeth was not well acquainted with the world of finances. She relied heavily upon her family\u2019s mill before leaving to become a soldier, and all pay was withheld until she completed a full five years of service. After all her hard work drilling and fighting, she wasn\u2019t granted so much as a few copper pieces. In a round about way of saying it, she had little understanding of how much her treasures were truly worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the scene unfold, the Codex now had one more barrier to dismantle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cOur quest for perfection requires a full stomach. Perhaps I should ensure she is not bankrupting herself just to keep sated\u2026\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what\u2019s Elizabeth\u2019s financial situation like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Extravagant Abundance:</b> She has more than enough money to support her diet. Dragons would envy such a hoard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>A Comfortable Cache: </b>Despite her impressive haul, coin is bleeding away. A comfortable place to be, but not forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Economic Spiral:</b> Living like royalty is taking its toll on her capital. Things need to change and fast!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hidden away within the depths of the basement was an incredibly heavy safe, only accessible to a familiar group of three. The treasures once stored within were steadily diminishing as time rolled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Unfortunate, but there is still time. Now... how would I possibly alert the master?\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a way to communicate with her only proved to be a hopeless endeavor thus far. Perhaps he could reach out to Inigo, but decided the risk was far too high. The codex\u2019s sight returned to its master, watching her drift into a deep slumber. It was then his answer came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreams. The magic was granted to all beings, whether or not they themselves practiced the arcane arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Ah, but of course. The message could always be lost in translation, but this will have to do for now...\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Elizabeth. We\u2019ve brought you breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo and Slyvia stood in her bedroom doorway. They stood with an unlikely stiffness. Little life if any shone through their eyes. They stepped forwards in sync with one another and presented a platter each. One filled with silver, and one with gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW- What\u2019s going on with you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you not like your meal?\u201d They asked in unison. \u201cPerhaps we must feed you ourselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously now, the hell is going on??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo struggled with her and tied her hands together. With Elizabeth subdued, he forcibly held her mouth open as Slyvia dumped the coins down her throat. The taste of metal flooded her mouth as she struggled to keep pace. With a deep breath a coin lodged itself in her windpipe, choking her until all she saw was darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth awoke and inhaled as though it was her first breath in hours, her entire body drenched in a cold sweat. The first light of day peered through the window as birds greeting the rising sun. It was just a dream. She took a few moments to calm herself down before she got out of bed. Searching through the house, she found Inigo in his study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInigo, I need an account of the household finances as soon as you can manage.\u201d The elf piqued an eyebrow at the request. It was unusual for his Mistress to ask for anything of importance, nor was it common for her to speak in such a stern tone. Not that he minded of course. If anything his patience was being tested by her growing carelessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be done. I\u2019ll have a report ready by noon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...and to sum it all up, we\u2019ll be broke in about a decade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three housemates sat around the dinner table with a somber tone. There wasn\u2019t even a scrap of food to snack on. Ten years was a long time, sure, but Elizabeth was planning on living well beyond her mid-thirties. For what the codex had planned ahead, the funds wouldn\u2019t have lasted another three years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny way to fix this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a few ideas floating around but I\u2019ll lay out the two most realistic options. If you recall, I mentioned last night that the price of cocoa is on the rise. Demand has gone through the roof and there aren\u2019t nearly enough merchants willing to make the long voyage necessary. This could be an incredible business opportunity, and a small group of entrepreneurs have picked up on this. They want to make a trading company dedicated to importing cocoa, and all they need is a wealthy investor who shares their vision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds pretty solid. And our other option?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could open a bakery!\u201d The two looked to Sylvia, who\u2019d been silent up until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, as miss Sylvia proposed we could open a small business of our own and hire a few underlings to work for us. In this case, Sylvia would act as the head baker and teach employees how to bake, with the only downside being profit. We\u2019d still be in the green, but we wouldn\u2019t be making nearly as much as the first option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Could we do both?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not, we only have enough to pursue one or the other. Take your time, Liz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth pondered over her options. Would she be the new face of cocoa trade? A profitable self-made business owner? Or perhaps, something else entirely\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a world where bread isn't just part of the meal, but often the only meal, it was rare to find a town without multiple bakeries churning out baked goods for the masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur,\" Inigo added. \"There's already a large number of bakeries in Erano, both at the high end and the low. It would be difficult to force ourselves in against several established businesses, and the potential for profits is considerably lower. The fact is, assuming the business doesn't fail in the first year (which is honestly very likely), you can make a living at it, though it would require living far more humbly then you're doing now. It's very unlikely you'd make enough to maintain my services, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo may have been making several good points, but there was only one thing that was going through Elizabeth's mind. <i>\"No more chocolate covered cherries...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe openly shuddered as she answered. \"Chocolate it is. Our competition is way thinner, we're rising to meet a growing demand, and we'd have various bakeries as customers rather then competing with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough outwardly his stoic presence remained unchanged, Inigo was somewhat surprised at how rapidly Elizabeth was grasping the intricacies of business. \"As you wish. I will set up an appointment to meet with the entrepreneurs. In the meantime, if it pleases you, I shall act as your tutor in business. I'm far from an expert, but there's a great deal of terminology they will expect you to know, and if you don't, they shall either try to take advantage of you, or they'll be scared off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth swallowed nervously, and reached for a snack bowl that wasn't there. Unable to stress eat, she was left to stew in her own worries for a bit. <i>\"I've already been wracking my brain trying to learn to speak and read this language, figure out their basic etiquette and weird clothes, and now I've got more stuff to learn!? Gods Above and Below, can I even do this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poo,\" Sylvia said, pouting a little bit at the rejection of her idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo rolled his eyes a little. \"Don't fret, Miss Sylvia. I imagine the Mistress would have no qualms about funding and sampling your more creative notions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's stomach growled quite loudly at the thought of the cook's well-prepared delicacies, and she vividly blushed, hoping against hope that her staff didn't just hear her gastronomic entreaties. \"Um, yes, well, that does sound like a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia smiled a bit at that and rose. \"Well, then I shall begin seeing to breakfast. Shall I send you a snack to tide you over until it's ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother soft growl. \"Um, yes, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. I'll see to it right away, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting her to eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, that was meant to feed all three of us,\" Sylvia said as she and Inigo carried the used dishes into the kitchen and deposited them next to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo had been carrying the lion's share of the dishes, and set his armload down with a grunt. Wiping his forehead with a cloth, he once more said, \"I know. I suspect she's nervous, though she's doing her best to hide it. Of course, her appetite is quite large as it is, so if she tries to bury her fears in food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia started pumping some water into a pot. \"So you're saying I'm probably going to need more help sooner rather then later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And possibly a cart. Why we don't have one already is beyond me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyl set the pot on the stove top to start heating her dishwater. She reached for her apron and stopped. Thinking better about it, she turned and walked over to Inigo. Leaning her back against the tall elf, she reached up and popped several of the top buttons on her shirt, forcing him to stare down into an endless valley of cleavage. Her golden hair was loose, and a couple strands ran across her face. She reached up to rub her hand along his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, since our own meal was cut short, perhaps I could interest you in some dessert...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo's eyes nearly bugged out of his head. His jaw moved wordlessly, and when the Mistress's bell rang, he all but sprinted out of the kitchen, leaving Sylvia in the dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned. <i>\"Damn it, again!? What more do I have to do!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tested her dish water, and finding it warm enough, poured it into the sink. Putting on her apron, she added some soap to the water and began scrubbing her dishes, lost in thought the whole while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I followed every bit of Auntie Claire's advice, and he still won't budge.\"</i> Sylvia's Aunt Claire was almost a carbon copy of her niece, just a few years older, though that certainly did nothing to detract from her looks. She wasn't quite as busty as Sylvia (though to be fair, no one was), but she was still fairly well endowed. It certainly hadn't hurt her in the romance department, and given she'd been married five times and engaged seven, Claire certainly knew something about reeling in a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Though perhaps not much about keeping them. And it's not like I want to throw myself at all and sundry like her, hoping to stumble across Mister Right. Following her advice won't do me much good if it chases my Inigo away.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia briefly lost herself in fantasy, picturing romantic nights with the elf, dinner, dancing, \"other\" things, raising a family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed as her Dream-Inigo gave her a rose, just because. <i>\"Who else could I go to for advice, though? Mom? I mean, she and Dad met when they were working at the Kensmoor Manor, and they've been married over twenty years. She definitely knows something about making their love work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though her circumstances aren't like mine, given she and Dad were the same race, and Mom is, well, Mom. Can I really take the advice of a woman whose over 600 pounds and can barely walk? There's never a moment she isn't stuffing more food in her face, and I swear she's fatter every time I go to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, maybe that's exactly who I want to talk to? I mean, Dad doesn't seem to mind that she's so big and only getting bigger. Heck, I've got thirteen siblings, for crying out loud. And he's always making something special for her. I don't know if the table in front of Mom has ever been empty for more then a minute...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia's thoughts of romance and what not were interrupted by a second bell ringing, indicating that the Mistress wanted a snack. <i>\"Wow, already. She must be in a near panic...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what happens now?</span></div></div>",

Years ago when she still lived with her family, she\u2019d wake up at dawn to feed the hens, help her father run the mill, and deliver freshly ground flour to the village before sundown. Sure it was hard work, but it was cut and dry, with very little to stress over. Perhaps the simplicity of it all was why she decided to become a soldier. She needed something new, a challenge for herself to prove she could more than a simple peasant. And now, far from the life of peasantry, she wished she could go back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to explore the hills and groves near her old home; to pick flowers and run through the tall grass. She wished she could stop by the village and greet all the townsfolk. She wanted to feel the sensation of mud on her bare feet as she danced in the summer rain. But she could never return. The only thing a deserter had waiting for them in Bitemarsh was a quick and unceremonious hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new life was here to stay, and the pressure was on for her to adapt quickly. Her spoken language lessons were near complete, with her only focus of study being pronunciation and the advanced side of vocabulary, but learning to read still kept her up at night. She spent hours upon hours tirelessly memorizing as many glyphs, symbols and icons she could manage only to just barely be able to read a basic sentence. Just opening a book was enough to make the poor woman stress out, and now she was expected to learn the ins and outs of business in a few weeks\u2019 notice? It was almost enough to make her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming wasn\u2019t usually the best option when your mouth was full, and since beginning her tutoring sessions with Inigo, Elizabeth was stress eating day in and day out. Platters of chocolate cherries were strategically placed to always be nearby, and portion sizes for every meal only seemed to grow, much to the dismay of an exhausted human cook, and much to the delight of the Codex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dIt seems the stomach enlargement charm does still work after all, though I should not get ahead of myself. An elf meddling with my plans is the last thing we need for my dear Elizabeth.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her library, the young woman tried her hardest to read. It was a short book meant for children, with colorful images dominating each page, but a start nonetheless. A platter to the side of her was stacked high with cinnamon rolls, each one glazed in a light coat of sugary frosting. Or rather it was stacked high moments ago, the top layer having already disappeared into her fluffy center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth paid her weight little if any attention over the course of her time in Erano, but if she had, she might have startled herself. Once the image of physical fitness, her lightly freckled body looked as though it had puffed up in every angle. Her lithe little legs were now equipped with a pair of properly plump thighs, and her firm ass melted away into an impressive bubble butt. Rock hard abs disappeared under a noteworthy layer of pudge, which looked to be on track to forming two distinct rolls, and her breasts puffed out from near non-existence to a (not so) solid C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the red haired Mistress was plump, and with all the stress eating going on, she was well on her way towards becoming fat. Feeling rather tense as she laboriously deciphered what was supposed to be child's play, she absentmindedly reached her hand over to grab two cinnamon rolls rather than just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud and heavy sound of a door knocker echoed through the small manor. Someone was here. \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Sylvia shouted for the household to hear as she dashed from the kitchen, causing beads of sweat to fall to the floor. Her new chef-in-training was finally here. Opening the door, Sylvia was greeted with\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The warm summer sky present seemingly moments ago was replaced a thick blanket of clouds. Standing in the doorway was an enormous orc, heavily scarred and wrapped in enough musculature to scare an owlbear away. Hanging from his neck was a small handmade necklace of talons and small skulls, complementing the black shawl on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor cook was startled by the sight and jumped back a few steps with a frightened gasp, but was reassured when his stern face melted into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d he boomed with a gravelly voice as deep as the nine hells. \u201cI am Snog. You are cook?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia stood frozen for a few moments before responding. \u201cA-ah yes! Sylvia Sunwood. A pleasure to meet you Snog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to meet you, Sylvia!\u201d The cook reached for a handshake which the orc matched. His monstrously large hand wrapped around hers with a surprising amount of grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll start us off with a quick tour of the house, if you\u2019ll come right on in.\u201d Snog accepted the invitation, ducking his head ever so slightly as he stepped through the front door. \u201cThis manor and everything within belongs to our Mistress, Elizabeth Coppermill. She truly is a sweetheart, even if a touch naive. We\u2019ll introduce you in time, but she\u2019s eh, studying at the moment.\u201d Saying she was studying seemed like a much better alternative than the cinnamon glazed truth of the matter. \u201cSo Snog, do you have any cooking experience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much. I made stew for tribe back home. Rabbit. Squirrel. Dandy-lions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly a start...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who is this snog fellow anyways?</span></div></div>",

The best illustrations compare magic to a body of water that permeates all things, whether sensed or not. This sea of energy is known to mages as the Aether. Each time the Aether is manipulated, small waves ripple outwards from the point of origin according to the spell\u2019s strength. A small charm or trick may go unnoticed by those gifted in the arcane, but a strong enough spell will rock the Aether like an earthquake. The small charms cast by the Codex had been mere droplets in a vast ocean, invisible to the magically sensitive, but as Elizabeth\u2019s form softened, the droplets grew as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rainy summer\u2019s day when Inigo first felt something. Stood stoically before his bedroom window, the elf watched heavy raindrops streak across the leaded glass. Time seemed to slow down as his eye focused on a single bead of water stuck to the window. As rain fell around it, his eyes remained locked, feeling each vibration that passed through the delicate globule. Something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched and waited, feeling something else... peer back into him? It was hard to pinpoint where it was coming from, or if he\u2019d really felt anything at all. Regardless, it was worth checking out. With caution, he turned around and began exploring the manor, the floorboards squeaking ever so slightly with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up and down the upstairs hallway, he stopped before each bedroom door and waited for a moment. He looked as if he were listening for something. Inigo shook his head to himself and began downstairs to the main floor. The rain fell harder as he reached lower and lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes searched around him but never looked directly ahead. Instead he gazed at the ceiling or floor, trying hard to look with his mind rather than his eyes. Pacing about once more, he ventured to the front of the house, stopping to investigate the Kitchen and Dining room. It was certainly stronger on this lower level, but he wasn\u2019t yet sure where it was from. He stepped through the kitchen door to investigate further when he caught the attention of the cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInigo! You stopped by at just the right tim-\u201d Sylvia stopped as Inigo hushed her. The woman\u2019s hand froze at her shirt buttons. The elf bore a stern face and looked around the room like an inquisitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you hear something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo continued scanning the room when all of a sudden, the Aetherial \u201cdripping\u201d stopped, or did it? The elf felt unsure of himself and hummed with a furrowed brow. \u201cSomething\u2019s amiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia watched as his mind went to work. The bold strength of his jaw, the power of his ponderous gaze\u2026 She knew he wanted her to take him more seriously, but by Andras the man was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo let out a haughty sigh, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026 I\u2026 I thought I felt something. Perhaps it was just the rain..? By the Gods it <i>is</i> coming down hard...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell rung out from the Master\u2019s chambers, giving the two little time to discuss what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a book could breath, the Codex would have let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dWhat in the planes was I thinking?

It knew patience better than most, and it's time would come soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fresh batch of cinnamon rolls on the kitchen counter if she finishes her uh, \u2018snack,\u2019 and wants any more. If she <i>still</i> wants anything after that, I left a few racks of cherries to cool in the basement.\u201d Sylvia grabbed a few handbaskets and a small pouch of silver before walking out. Inigo watched the door close behind her and gave a defeated sigh. Wait, was it him or was there a touch more bounce to her rear than he remembered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a stroll outside the manor walls was a welcome change of pace for the overworked cook. The cool shade of the city streets, the smell of the sea, even the sun seemed cheery as day. Downhill from the upper class estates, she charted a course across the city, and the quickest way she could think of would be straight past the dockyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge merchant ships loomed over the docks, loading and unloading their cargo as far as the eye could see. A cliff above held a grand bastion lined with enough cannons to sink an entire nation\u2019s fleet, a fact Erano\u2019s enemies knew firsthand. Along the streets were an exotic array of various races and tongues making their presence known as they peddled their wares among the countless market stalls, each adorned by cloths of vibrant color to catch the eye. Perhaps she would stop by and buy something nice, but that would have to be on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on past the hustle and bustle of the city center, Sylvia found her way up a quiet side street. Though not as impressive as the district of rich manors she was now accustomed to, the odd cracks in the walls and neglected stonework only added to her old neighborhood's charm. Potholes dotted the path before her, still carrying some of yesterday\u2019s rain. She smiled when she remembered how she would jump in these puddles when she was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust up the street, her eye caught sight of the family restaurant. A wave of radiant joy washed over her before subsiding into a sort of nervousness. It\u2019s only been six months since she moved out, but it felt like an eternity. As she approached the front door, she cleaned herself up before entering. A small bell rang as the door sung open, and the scent of her family\u2019s cooking cast her mind back to simpler times. Observing the room, she recognized a few of the regulars from around the neighborhood, but where was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylvie!\u201d Before she could look, something soft nearly knocked her over with a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcy!\u201d She hugged her younger sister back, noting there was a little more to grab than before. Marceline was the youngest of her siblings, the two being separated by about five years. Sylvia looked down at her, taking in the girl's extra padding. Marcy was always a bit chubbier than most, but in her time away the girl must have put on a good fifty pound.\u201cYou look great!\u201d And she meant it. Something about it suited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sylvia!\u201d Over her sister\u2019s shoulder Sylvia spotted the blonde locks and warm smile of Amarie, the oldest sister, and heir to the family business. Behind her was her brother Nate, waving with a silent smile. In the corner of the room was his twin sister, the silent Esmerelda. She looked up from a book with a disinterested face. \u201cSup fuckwit?\u201d She flicked her jet black hair back into place and continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you all the way across town sis?\u201d Her teenage sister asked with a welcoming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanted to talk to mom about a few eh, things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ya? What kinda, 'things'?\u201d Marcy\u2019s face shifted into a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh! Sylvie\u2019s got a boyfriend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few restaurant goers lifted their drinks and gave a shout. Sylvia\u2019s porcelain cheeks grew red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait no! Well-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylvie's got a girlfriend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same few raised their glasses and shouted a bit louder while an old curmudgeon muttered something mildy homophobic. Sylvia\u2019s blush only turned darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I don\u2019t have a boyfriend OR a girlfriend!\u201d A disappointed moan came from the restaurant\u2019s patrons. \u201cMarcy you\u2019re too much sometimes,\u201d she admitted through a flustered laugh. \u201cLook, I\u2019d love to catch up with you but I\u2019m in a bit of a hurry. Errands and all that. I\u2019ll stop by for lunch next week though!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiiiiine, but you gotta promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise.\u201d She cupped her sister\u2019s chubby cheek in one hand before giving a hug. \u201cMom up in her room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoved into your room after you left actually, but yea. Said something about being easier to be on the ground floor.\u201d It didn\u2019t take Sylvia long to figure what she meant by that. Moving six hundred pounds of woman up and down the stairs each day wasn\u2019t exactly fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia navigated through the restaurant and towards a door which connected the next-door building. For her parents, the rooms upstairs from the restaurant worked perfectly fine for some time, with enough space to make having 6 kids liveable. But six turned into seven. And seven turned to eight. Maybe it was luck, or maybe it was fate, but the family next door was moving out, leaving seven extra rooms completely vacant. For only a few hundred silver, they bought the building and turned it into an extension of sorts. Sylvia was lucky enough to get her very own room on the ground floor. But this was many years ago, long before her mother was able to reach such an inconvenient size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood before her old bedroom door and gave a knock. \u201cMom? It\u2019s Sylvia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylvia!\u201d she heard her mother shout, her voice somewhat muffled by the door. \u201cJust a moment dear!\u201d A few moments passed before the door opened. Looking in the room she saw her mother...</span></div></div>",

Please read both parts, as it makes everything better)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Margot (or Maggie, as she was usually called by friends and family) had been a big woman for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to miss a meal or hold herself back from enjoying food to its fullest, she'd grown from a pudgy child into a chubby young woman. She'd been round when she met her husband, her beloved Edmund, and put on more weight during their first two years of marriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they decided to gamble their meager savings on opening their own restaurant, Maggie had slimmed down somewhat. Their limited funds left their meals fairly light, and the stress of running a business on the cusp of bankruptcy had led to a rather stark loss of appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn appetite that returned with interest when business finally began to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood hearty meals, heavy on the fatty meats and spices, as per typical Eranoan tastes, made a triumphant return as the young couple could finally afford decent fare again. As well, Maggie was loathe to waste any food, typically finishing off the remains of the stew pot and other pre-made dishes they had sitting around at the end of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that Maggie became pregnant with her first child, which saw a spike in her already considerable appetite. It increased again with each subsequent pregnancy, and never really returned to its previous state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was Maggie eating more then ever (and more importantly, more fatty then ever), she was also less active. No longer was she running from one end of a manor to the other, or frequently heading to the market on errands. Grocers came around to restock their stores themselves, and Edmund, who was quite a strong man, would typically run to grab what they couldn't bring. Maggie, then, was left to look after the place, and spent much of her time in the kitchen cooking, as they didn't really have the funds to bring on any extra staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of Sylvia's happiest memories growing up involved cooking with her Mom in the kitchen. The smell of cardamon, turmeric and cinnamon brought her home as much as actually being here, and made her think of being a little girl, sneaking small samples of her mother's exquisite cooking off customer's plates. Maggie was also constantly baking, and Syl would have been hard pressed to decide her favorite between her mother's bread or cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being in the kitchen cooking all day every day meant Maggie was constantly snacking on rich, decadent dishes, and then eating proper meals with her family. Even in Sylvia's earliest memories, her Mom had been fairly large, and such a steady stream of calories could only send her weight one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Erano uses a lunar calendar, unlike the solar calendar preferred by many of their neighbors. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the city isn't an agrarian state, but I digress. The first week of each new year was dedicated to Saturnalia, a massive festival commonly known as the Golden Week. There were parades, feasts, wild parties, and gift exchanges between friends and loved ones. Each God and Goddess had its own day during Saturnalia, and their temples were packed with parishioners on their respective day, praying and making offerings for a good year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd each subsequent Saturnalia saw a larger, lardier Maggie in attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the years past, Sylvia watched her Mom go from chubby to fat, then from fat to downright obese. Some days, it was almost like she could see her mother growing fatter in front of her eyes. Her apron belly hanging just a bit lower, or protruding just a bit further. Her drooping breasts seeming a bit more full and heavy. Her booty just a bit wider, a bit deeper, and a bit more wobbly. Her rounding thighs making were waddle more noticeable and slower, bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer snacks also grew in size and frequency, becoming small meals in their own right by the time Sylvia was a teenager. The true meals were truly vast affairs, even considering the size of their family, and Maggie made sure not a single crumb was wasted. Even after the rest had eaten their fill, Maggie would keep munching away late into the night, until nothing was left but well gnawed bones and grease stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew, both in appetite and in body, Maggie's physical abilities suffered accordingly. Running after her young children progressed from difficult to impossible, until even walking them to their school left her short of breath and pining for a bench. This only became worse after the last child graduated, as even that bit of exercise was now no longer being done. She took to sitting on a stool in the kitchen, resting and eating full pelt between customer orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growing size meant she eventually had to upgrade to a beefier throne, and she'd been quite happy when her elder children came to work in the kitchen. Between simple exhaustion from moving her heavy body and knocking things over with her engorged features, her expanding frame had made much of her work rather difficult (and expensive, once we count damages). Now, Maggie could just set up her chair at one station and worry about that, leaving everything else to the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what this meant in practice was that Maggie was doing even less and had more time to focus on filling her bottomless maw. Maggie was eating more and growing faster then ever. Pretty soon, she was having trouble fitting through doors, and got winded walking across the restaurant. Eventually, she had to leave the kitchen, as she'd grown so big that her sheer size made it nearly impossible for the kids to work around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Maggie minded the front desk. Then, once she'd grown too large to squeeze between the desk and the wall, Edmund had set his wife up in the corner of the establishment, her throne upgraded to a rather large, armless bench. Her duties had now become simply the book work, which honestly only took a few minutes each day. Every other waking moment was now dedicated to one thing, and one thing only - eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Sylvia had accepted the job with Elizabeth, her Mom was nearly immobilized by her own overwhelming girth. Climbing and descending the stairs to their room was a long, drawn out and painful affair, which left Maggie desperately panting and her blubbery rolls soaked in sweat. She could no longer make the trip on her own, and even needed help simply rising from her seat. It was a two person task at least, one per arm, Maggie groaning and trembling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, it should go without saying, but Maggie hadn't attended a Saturnalia in person in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking all this into account, Sylvia perhaps should not have been as surprised as she was at the sight which awaited her. She would later attribute her shock to her six month absence, since all the evidence pointed to this outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The person who opened the door was her Dad, Edmund. He was an enormous bear of a man, with a chest like a barrel and arms like tree trunks. Along with Inigo, he was one of the very few people taller then Sylvia. He was also one of the hairiest human beings alive. Last year, when he and his brother were redoing the tile roof, he wasn't wearing a shirt, and most of the neighbors had thought he was wearing an ugly sweater in the heat of summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Munchkin!\" He said, throwing his arms open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" Syl said, wrapping her thin limbs around him as best she could, squeezing him tight. He smelled of all the lovely spicy kitchen smells she remembered, plus a bit that was wholly his own. \"Gods, I missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too, Munchkin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking off the hug, Sylvia turned and started to say, \"Hey Mom,\" but stopped dead when she saw her. Her jaw dropped, and all she could do was stare for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie had been a huge woman when she left, but the version she saw now was staggeringly vast. Nothing was left to the imagination, as it was quite clear that her Mom had grown too large for any sort of real clothing. Her father had draped his apron across his wife's chest, hiding her naughty bits from sight, but not much else, and Sylvia could only drink in her mother's enormity for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she looked at was her Mom's belly. It had always been her biggest feature, unlike her busty sister and daughters. Even though she was propped up on a mountain of pillows and back fat, the gargantuan thing towered over her, crushing the rest of her deep into the mattress. The single, round mass of her gut stretched to her knees, spreading to the exposed mattress between her legs and reaching for the sides of the bed. The mountain of blubber was crisscrossed with silver stretchmarks and marked with cellulite, clear signs of her massive, sustained gain over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyl next looked at her Mom's lower half. Her Dad hadn't covered her up down there, but he hadn't needed to, as his wife's fat buried everything naughty under it. Even under the enormity of her belly, Maggie's hips and booty managed to make their presence known. The blubbery meat of her ass forced its way past her dominating gut, overhanging the sides of the gigantic bed she was spread across. Sylvia could see deep dividing lines between her butt, thigh, and calf fat, all leading into feet that were themselves rounding with fat. Maggie was bigger around the calf then her daughter was around the waist, a fact which gave her some pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven partially hidden by the apron, her mother's breasts were clearly massive. Each one likely outweighed a small child, and were it not for her gigantic belly and back rolls, they likely would have sloped off and succumb to gravity a long time ago. As it was, they rose into her Mom's field of view, two more flabby mountains to strangle her view even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer collarbone and shoulders were so deeply buried under her blubber that they were invisible, leading into upper arms bigger then a well fattened swan. Her forearms were thicker then Syl's thighs, giving way to plump sausage fingers, yet they still looked too small for such a huge upper arm. You couldn't even see her elbow, as it was so deeply buried in her arms' fatty rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia at last raised her eyes to look at her Mom's smiling face. Her doughy second chin was in permanent contact with her thick, blubbery chest, and her cheeks, well rounded from scores of hearty meals, protruded proudly from her face and gave her the most impressive set of dimples. Even her lips looked plumper then Sylvia remembered, and from their greasy shine and food stains, she'd clearly just been eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, looking at her and around the room, Sylvia wasn't sure she ever stopped. There was enough food in the room to feed a family of five until they were painfully glutted, and it was clearly all meant for the elephantine Maggie. Looking closer, she could see small spots of food stains across her Mom's fat swollen torso, its softness and slopes making it a rather poor table, and the plump digits of her swollen hands were perpetually greasy from their unending task of funneling more food into growing pit of a stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, her Dad and siblings had knocked out the adjoining wall between this room and the next, making enough space for a dining room table to allow the family to still have dinner with Mom. A second bed had been pushed next to her Mom's enormous one, and this was very likely where Edmund slept. Sylvia scarcely noticed this, however, as her eyes were locked on the woman who'd clearly given up resisting her untameable appetite, gleefully stuffing herself past the point of sanity into immobile, hoggish obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her wildest dreams, Sylvia would not have thought it was even possible to get this fat. As she stood there, shocked to stillness, her mother's belly somehow, despite how much she must have eaten just before her daughter's arrival, managed to let out a growl of hunger. Maggie reached over to a nearby table, grabbing a creme stuffed pastry and stuffing the entire thing into her mouth, swallowing it after only a few token chews. She tried to grab another but couldn't, the scale of her rolls leaving her totally unable to lean or bend. Maggie quickly gave up and settled for a closer snack, grabbing an oyster served in a half shell, sucking it down with a loud slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia's jaw moved silently as she tried to make her mouth form words. Her mind was nearly blank, scarcely able to fathom that this... fat... <i>thing</i>, was her mother. She struggled to make the logical connection between the woman who had birthed and raised her, and this unimaginable blob, who was so thoroughly enslaved by her need to feed that she couldn't even stop eating when the daughter she hasn't seen for <b>six months</b> came to visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sweetie,\" Maggie said as she swallowed her oyster. She grabbed an eclair from one of the plates precariously perched on her expansive tits. Sylvia looked at the sea of stretchmarks which covered nearly every inch of her mother's oceanic blubber as Maggie consumed the pastry in three messy bites. Chewing it, she choke out between mouthfuls, \"I missed you, baby girl. Come give me a hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob held up her arms, unable to even try to lean forward, still chewing more calories, soon to be turned into yet more fat. Sylvia would later kick herself for what she said, but her blank mind could manage nothing else. Her jaw snapped closed, and she spoke without thinking, shouting so loud the entire restaurant heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY FUCK YOU GOT FAT!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Codex Corpulentia had been experimenting a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFears of discovery made such actions necessary. How small a magic could it use without drawing attention, and more importantly, how big could it go before the Elf grew suspicious? The Codex's last charm had certainly been noticed, though it had admittedly been a fairly large one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still, the gamble at least paid off,\"</i> the Codex thought. Elizabeth's appetite had been permanently increased by the book. Even now, it could see its Master studying in the library, a steady stream of treats flowing down her throat into her chubby belly, which even now was already pressing gently on the sides of her dress. This was particularly impressive, given the same dress had fit her just fine earlier in the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Codex knew it still had to be cautious. Being too greedy and pushing too much now could be disastrous. The Elf butler might dispose of or destroy it as a threat, never knowing that the Codex considered itself their greatest ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, it decided to experiment with sight magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly seemed the safe choice. The Codex had been using such magic since its arrival, and Inigo had never flinched. Too small to be noticed? Very likely. <i>\"Now, how far can I push it...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSight magic seemed safe for a number of reasons. Perhaps the biggest one, at least as far as the Codex was concerned, was that it could easily be explained as the actions of another. Elizabeth's sudden appearance in Erano with a fortune fit for a small kingdom had garnered a lot of gossip, and her plans to enter the marketplace had not gone unnoticed. Many of the old Merchant Guilds would not care for new competition, and many would have no qualms about spying on the red haired foreigner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver capable Inigo was already building up a list of contacts with the Elves of other houses, and was already aware of the envious, greedy eyes watching the Bitemarsher. He would never suspect a simple book of such a thing, making this the perfect means to see just how high the Codex could push the power level before he was noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first test was a locked spell, set for an indefinite distance. His Master's cook, Sylvia, was going to visit her family today. Given they were halfway across the city and she possessed no magical sensitivity whatsoever, it had been perfect. Each step further from the book would necessitate a bit more power to maintain the spell. The moment the Elf flinched, the Codex would cut the spell, and know exactly how much power it could use in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, one thing it hadn't been counting on was Sylvia's mother, Maggie. Had the Codex a jaw, it would have hit the floor when it laid eyes on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex was stunned to stillness as the sight of this magnificent specimen, buried deep within her blubbery rolls, spreading from one end of her bed to the other. It could sense her boundless hunger as she stuffed yet more food into her plump maw, reaching for more as she chewed her last morsel. It watched as Sylvia hugged her unbelievably massive mother. The chesty chef couldn't even reach the other side of Maggie with her arms at full spread, and her hands sunk shockingly deep into her soft, pliable lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie had grown into a literal mountain of meat and fat, and the Codex was full of admiration and respect for her. Its scanning spells revealed that there wasn't a single ounce of magic applied to this wonderful example of humanity. Every extraneous pound of blubber was the triumphant result of her gastronomic accomplishments, not the work of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still,\"</i> the Codex thought, watching as Sylvia passed her whale of a mother an entire pie. As Maggie dug into the decadent dessert, its thought continued, <i>\"that doesn't mean I can't help things along.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Codex began casting permanent manipulation spells on Maggie, using Sylvia as a conduit. It was quite obvious that it didn't need to do anything about Maggie's appetite. From the scale of her blubbery body alone, it was clear if Maggie was going to try and rein in her ungodly hunger, she'd have done it a very, <b>very</b> long time ago. No, much of what the Codex was doing was more related to health and quality of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some species could bear excess weight quite well. Dwarves and Halflings were both prime examples, able to get reasonably rotund with no ill effects. The Codex had never even heard of a fat Elf before, and while it would love to experiment, its powers had a ways to go before it would try such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans, on the other hand, were kind of a mixed bag. Some seemed able to get fairly blubbery without a problem, but then the next would suffer unbearably from even a slight increase in mass. As the Codex scanned Maggie, it wasn't surprised to see the planetary matron was one of the former. However, even with the kindness of her nature, the immobile beauty was beginning to pile up a bit, and so the Codex worked to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beginning to retain water and her blood pressure was a little high, so it improved her heart function and circulation. It strengthened her lungs to make breathing a little easier. It restructured her sweat glands to secrete an acid similar to vinegar, making her folds uninhabitable to molds and other foul things, without being detectable by the human nose. Maggie had been developing the odd bedsore, so it restructured her hide and muscles to prevent their growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, the Codex was thankful its Master had force fed it knowledge of marine biology upon its creation, as the book knew exactly what parts of her body to change so she could gain without a single restriction. The last thing the Codex did was change the nature of her gain, forcing more of her future fat into her lower body, leaving her arms mobile enough to keep funneling food into her cavernous belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Codex looked over the piece of art that was Maggie, it smiled internally as it felt the changes it had wrought taking hold. Pooling blood and fluids began to flow again, sore patches of skin ceased itching and returned to a healthy color, and Maggie's strengthened gut gave a loud rumble of hunger. It was only as she was feeding her monumental and growing body that the Codex had a chilling thought. Had it a face, it would have gone totally pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That was a lot of magic...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Inigo's ears twitched.</span></div></div>",

Just a few more and I promise I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInigo let out a sigh and looked down at the spread of papers in vain. Simple supply and demand charts, some statistics gathered from a recent poll, and a collection of valuable trade secrets. To the side, a few empty plates sat stacked atop one another. A coat of sugar dusted Elizabeth\u2019s lips as she licked her fingertips clean. For Inigo, things were certainly not going as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s not to say things were going poorly, in fact quite the opposite was true. As long as there was something sweet for Elizabeth to chew on, Inigo noted, she practically absorbed information. When it was gone, so too went her focus. Inigo weighed his options, and decided it wouldn\u2019t do much harm to allow a few more snacks. It should only take another hour to finish their little session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, miss Elizabeth. I\u2019ll be but a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the slender elf stood and began towards the door, rubbing his forehead with a free hand. Though calm and collected on the outside, the stress was slowly getting to him. It felt as though thoughts were darting through his head, flying around far too quick for him to grab hold of one for more than a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could he when there was so much to worry about? The language tutor needed to be paid for this week\u2019s lessons, this month\u2019s property tax was due in just a few days, and he had to prepare Elizabeth for the upcoming meeting with the entrepreneurs. He was handling things quite well before the final thing that now nagged his mind. What if they find him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sylvia mentioned she was off to see her family this morning, the elf couldn\u2019t help but think of his own. The names they called him echoed in his head. Falseborn. Bastard. Inert. One name stood out from the rest. Murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered the day when his magic awoke. He remembered the boiling rage coursing through him, tapping into something deeper. Something hidden. His own well of Aether. What he wouldn\u2019t give to forget the final look in his father\u2019s eyes, and the sickening warmth of blood against his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his mind returned to the present, he realized he\u2019d been standing in the cooling room, his eyes frozen on the tray of cherries. With a deep breath, he picked up the tray and returned to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears pricked up as he felt something\u2026 off. It was the same sensation he felt the other day, but with the sound of rain gone, it registered loud and clear. Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in Arcanus-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a cascade of energy rocked the Aether. The elf felt his insides toss and turn like waves along a shore before gripping a nearby table, bracing himself for the next wave. But it never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the nine hells was that? If the elf didn\u2019t know any better he\u2019d say it came from inside the manor. But that wasn\u2019t possible\u2026 or was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inigo the Inquisitor</b> - Inigo launches an investigation into the source of this magic, leaving no corner of the house unturned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inigo the Skeptic</b> - Maybe it was a fluke?

But all he felt was silence. A solemn emptiness now filled the halls as the event replayed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t going crazy, was he? That definitely just happened. But it could have been anything, a thought that somehow calmed the elf as much as it terrified him. Maybe their new neighbor was a mage?

This was a lesson Saya learned on the worst night of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya was a foundling, a baby found on the doorstep of an abbey. Had her parents left her there because they feared they couldn't provide for her, or abandoned her because she was unwanted? Were her parents even still alive? Such questions didn't trouble Saya overmuch; she was far from the only orphan raised by the acolytes and nuns of the abbey, dedicated to a goddess of fertility and abundance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her upbringing was regimented, Saya was happy overall. The acolytes taught her discipline, how to read, and how to honor the gods. Such skills would be useful whether she decided to join the abbey as an acolyte herself or leave to make her way in the world. While she never really had a mother, Saya had plenty of aunts and sisters, and was content with that. She also never wanted for food; her goddess was one of plenty, and all devotees had some extra padding on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started to change after her 18th birthday. A pervasive atmosphere of dread pervaded the abbey. Rumors of curses in faraway lands and of conquering armies washed through the residents like an unstoppable tide. And then one night, Saya was called to the abbottess's room. The round old leader of her order told her that she'd received a divine vision that something terrible was coming, an attack that would destroy the abbey. The abbottess's task for Saya was to run as far from her home as she could, bringing with her the book that this oncoming force was looking for. Though she protested at first, Saya soon agreed and left. Though she was quite far away by the time the attack occurred, she still saw the smoke of her burning home on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of running, Saya finally found herself in Bitemarsh. A land under a curse, where one might be able to disappear into the ranks of the downtrodden. It was only after arriving in her new home that Saya turned her attention to the precious book that she had be charged to protect. It was a curious tome called the <i>Codex Corpulentia</i>, and Saya soon found that it was no ordinary book. Though she had been a fairly skilled reader, the book's words seemed like an impenetrable maze hiding secrets and treasure of all kinds. There was magic of some kind at work here, and Saya wasn't sure if she was up to the task of truly understanding the Codex on her own.</span></div></div>",

That my devilishly handsome, roguishly chiseled good looks will swell and bulge as I become an evil oaf of a man,\" the new King sighed, \"that I will be cursed to fall from the most handsome, lithe of men into a wobblingly fat sack of suet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll go easier if you shut up and let me read,\" his sister Zonks sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Killian had gotten the lionshare of the family looks, Princess Zonkorialla had gotten the brains. Not that his short, half elf half sister wasn't pretty, in a button nose, brown eyed, freckly, skinny way, but she was plain as rye bread compared to her tall, muscular, handsome blonde brother. And not that he was stupid, but he hadn't spoken eight languages by the time he was ten and gotten two doctorates from the magical academy by the time he was twenty either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I suppose I must,\" the newly crowned King groaned dramatically, \"sit here and become an obese, evil, hateful tyrant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks sighed again. Her brother might be a seasoned adventurer and swashbuckler, a man of the people who wanted everyone to be happy and to prosper, might be the first good king in generations but he was also a born drama queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is you won't turn evil,\" she said, looking up from the strange book, the Codex Corpulentia that generations of royal wizards had added to to try and solve the particular curse, \"Dad it turns out was just a dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god. At least I will not blight my subjects with more than my hideous visage!\" the King sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you won't get fat,\" she brought up, \"unless, well, unless you want to get fat instead of your Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, wait a tick and explain,\" the Killian said, pulling himself up from a useful fainting couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the short version,\" Zonks sighed, pulling open the book to the very start to show a picture of a handsome rugged King and a slender, gorgeous Queen staring into each other's eyes, \"300 years ago, King Alexander and Queen Tymeria got married to found the nation. Everything was great, they were young and beautiful and in love and then well, what usually happens with that does. That's when things started going wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the page with a flick of her wand, showing a disinterested Alexander looking to a svelte serving girl to the side and a very, very pregnant Queen Tymeria glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knocked up with triplets on the wedding night. Her figure never recovered and he never recovered interest,\" another wand flick showed the fit Alexander cavorting with a slender mistress while a very chubby Tymeria wept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a bastard!\" Killian grunted, drawing his rapier, \"the man should be horsewhipped through the streets! Cheating on his wife, the cad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killian he's been dead for two hundred and eighty years, don't interrupt,\" Zonks sighed, \"so Tymeria prayed and prayed and when the goddess of love couldn't give her her banging body back well, she decided to direct her pleas lower. She prayed to the Goddess of Perversion to curse the King: all of his paramours would upon sleeping with him grow immensely fat and in exchange gave up her immortal soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's, well that's pretty bad too,\" Killian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Tymeria was sucked down to hell that very night and when the King decided to marry his prime minister's daughter, well\" Zonks said, turning the page to show a slim woman gorging her way out of a wedding gown, \"Fat wife followed fat wife followed fat wife. The later ones started getting fat just after being proposed to and when he stopped marrying to cheat the curse, his mistress woke up four hundred pounds heavier. She was his best generals wife too and well, that was the end of King Alexander. The curse though stuck to the Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mom wasn't fat,\" Killian brought up, causing Zonks to pull up a picture of his dearly departed mother, a slender, graceful woman with his long blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but its the monarch's spouse,\" Zonks pointed out, pulling up a picture of his recently killed father on their wedding day, slim and fit, and then a year later with tits bigger than the queens, \"Dad married your mom, killed your mom and the curse decided he counted as monarch and spouse both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, serves the fat bastard right, the blighter,\" Killian said, remembering killing the tyrannical bastard, \"But, I'm in love Zonks, so in love it hurts! And I don't want her to get fat, she'll hate getting fat! You know how she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, rubbing her eyes, \"Yes, I know. But if you don't get married it will rebound onto you..And then you'll explode. I'm not speaking metaphorically either. They'll be cleaning you out of the chandeliers if you're not married within a year of your coronation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian counted on his fingers, \"Wait, wait its...June. And I overthrew dad last July...oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Killian crap,\" Zonks sighed, \"so, you've got to get married, so your queen gets fat rather than you going boom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well, I hate to make her get fat though. She'd hate that and she might die from it,\" he meandered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. I'm not gonna lie and say she'll be in shape. She's gonna get real damn big real damn fast. But if she eats a lot of vegetables, stays active and takes the right potions she can have a long happy life,\" Zonks told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you know how proud she is of her figure,\" Killian whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make a potion that makes her happy with getting fat and one that will turn you into a grade A chubby chaser too,\" Zonks sighed, \"now stop whining and go to your fiance and say you have to get married early because otherwise you will explode.\"</span></div></div>",

She was tall for a woman ad and as a cleric she was well respected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the diary were hand-drawn pictures of Killian and her deepest darkest desires that only the God of Pleansantries knew about. Each picture within the diary depicted Killian going from a stud and into a very fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passages also told of Pollyanna's desires to stuff and feed Killian. Yet lately her pictures depicted a fatter version of herself embracing a hugely fat Killian. When Pollyanna noticed these drawings she would often get flustered and pray to her god and beseech if these drawings were an omen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyanna looked at a current picture she was drawing. The picture depicted both a fatter Killian and herself making love under a tree with Killian feeding Pollyanna grapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyanna began praying as she saw the picture. When she was praying the image of a burly fat man dressed in fine robes manifested before her. As she finished praying she looked up and saw the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the figure she humbly curtailed before the man. \"My god, what brings you here so you may grant your humble servant an audience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard your prayers Pollyanna. The drawings in your diary are a vision of what is about to come,\" the God of Pleasantries said. \"I shall lay my blessing on your future husband and king. He shall grow fat as a bear prepares for hibernation and I shall grant him strength like that no man has seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you milord, but what does that have to do with me getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is more or less my wife's doing. All shall be revealed soon for your fiance is on his way. As soon as he proposes all shall be revealed and I will make him gain weight alongside you,\" the God of Pleasantries responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe God of Pleasantries disappeared and Pollyanna was confused until she thought about Kilian's family curse. She then gasped at the realization as she looked at the fatter drawing of herself and Killian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian rushed through the streets to find the temple where Pollyanna resided. Killian was almost too nervous to tell Pollyanna more about his family's curse due to her being a cleric and as a cleric she could possibly beseech her god to redirect the curse back onto himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes of running he came across an elaborate golden temple with statues of a bearded burly fat God posted near the entrance. Pollyanna was reading a book by the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pollyanna,  my love there's  something we must talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyanna looked up from her book, closed the book, and then walked towards Killian. \"Yes, my love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright that we get married sooner? I just found out that if I don't get married soon that my family's curse will cause me to explode. Not only that, but the spouse of the ruling monarch gains weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyanna nodded her head. \"My god has been showing me signs as of late and your word confirms it. However, I will not gain weight alone for it shall be a burden we both bear as husband and wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian looked at Pollyanna in confusion. How could a curse in his family cause both the king and queen to gain weight. Yet before he could speak Pollyanna wrapped her arm around Killian's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began whispering into his ear. \"I have a confession my dear. Lately I've been fantasizing about you being fat and I myself feeding you. So I prayed to my god and he decided to bless you so you grow big and strong as he is. So if you have issues with getting fat then worry not for we will grow together. Now let us get married posthaste.\"</span></div></div>",

Thanking his morning runs for making him swift, the young King ran past his guards and bolted for the center of his city, holding on his crown and keeping a hand on his rapier to stop himself from tripping. He flicked a solid gold coin to the attendant at the garden and jumped over the barrier, running through flowers in full bloom out of season and past trees heavy with fruit months earlier than normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all her doing of course, but then again that's what happened when a Nymph, a powerful fae tied to the earth and fertility takes residence in a garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nimidia!\" the King yelled as he ran past a few tourists, following the thick trail of flowers she left behind her and stumbling into her grove, \"Nimidia! Its me! Killian! I've got something important to tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost ran into a small crowd of students with open sketch pads, the young men and women ignoring their bellowing monarch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian did not blame them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Killi! Your ardor burns hot I see! But not while the art class is in session, my lover,\" Nimidia purred, hanging upside down from a tree branch, long, strong legs wrapped suggestively around a branch, \"I can't move or it would ruin the pose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople had asked Killian, \"why fall in love with a nymph? She's a fae, not a human, she brings no political alliance, no advantages. Killian typically asked Nimidia if she could come inside from the garden for a minute and that shut them up forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her always bare and yet never dirty feet, Nimidia was about 6' tall yet still trailed three feet of thick, glorious crimson curls behind her on the ground. The hair never, ever got dirty somehow and the flowers she wove into it never died, although the carpet of flowers she left behind her as she walked typically faded after the tenth or twelfth cutting. After a lot of effort he'd gotten her to wear clothes when around people, although she refused to wear any dress that went more than an inch past her sex and didn't show her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she was wearing anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its, well a little important,\" the King said, as always finding his eyes locked onto his fiancee's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were very, very excellent breasts. Large but not huge, proportional to her curvaceous body. But very, very firm and yet extremely bouncy. Her nipples were the size of a gold coin and bright pink and the breasts themselves a full, pert roundness. They were the softest things Killian had ever touched and he was struggling to remember his name as he saw them hang upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to strip off and join me, love?\" she asked, arcing her back to make his pants tighten faster than any curse ever could, \"Its been hours since we last joined together. Let us make the beast with two backs before them, that they can get an accurate sketch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian had once believed in waiting until after marriage for full sex. That had lasted until, while on an adventure in unexplored woodland, he'd chanced to see Nimidia emerging from the water. Three days and twenty four sex acts later, his willingness to do exactly what she wanted, remember what she liked, and cuddle plenty had impressed her enough to join his adventuring party and they'd been doing it eight times a day minimum ever since. Yes, he hadn't slept more than five hours in three years but he was in the best shape of his life and literally hadn't thought of another woman since. She'd even agreed to be his queen, although she refused to wear a crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I, that's not very kingly,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not kingly to make love to the woman you love?\" she asked, huge green eyes fluttering, putting a small hand across her heart, \"You wound me, Killian, wound me! Do you not find me beautiful still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuining the sketch or not, she ran her hands down her sides, over her ribs and the sharp curve of her waist, over the full roundness of her hips, across the small fluff of crimson pubic hair and to her gleaming sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I not arouse your passion?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Royal decree, all art students out!\" the King demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and far sweatier, the King lay on the grass, breathing heavily. Nimidia was still kneeling on his groin, kissing his muscular belly and running her strong, clean nails over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods above I love you,\" he said, taking in her perfectly symmetrical face, the silk smooth skin and her curvaceous features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said, laying across him, breasts in his face, \"let's go again. You're behind in your husbandly duties. And how will you keep me satisfied when I am Queen? My appetites will do not but grow I am sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that dear,\" he said nervously, \"well, you know of a curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but that was on your dead father, my love,\" she smiled, beginning already to nibble at his neck, \"and he is dead and now I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see the curse will be on the King's wife and well, it will make her grow fat...,\" he said nervously, \"I just found out and it turns out if I don't get married in a month I'll explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" the nymph said, guiding his hands to sit on her firm, full hips, which measured at exactly 40 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had muscles across her belly and moved gracefully, but the bounce of her chest and backside said she already had plenty of fat. Since moving to the city last year she'd gotten a taste for sweets and had turned a previously barren patch of earth into a sugar cane field with her powerful nature magic. She'd gained a stone since then, broadening in the hips and getting a little softer in the belly and Killian found his yearning for her grow ever more. The students sketching her every day didn't seem to mind, the crowd only growing after she got a little pear shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think,\" she said, feeling his interest rise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If I'm going to get fat, we'll make it fun,\" the shapely fae said, moving her hands to cast a spell, \"If I'm going to go from lithe and graceful to slow and heavy and placid and fat and gravid well...we'll do it with sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlants burst out of the ground, forming a bush covered in heavy berries. Killian, tearing his eyes away from his wife's perfect legs, realized he'd never seen their like. They were bright purple, covered in white spots and about the size of a strawberry but perfectly round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" he asked, eyes twitching back to the heart shaped bulge of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meal-Berries. Each one has enough energy to get a grown man through hours of work,\" she smiled, leaning against a bench, tossing back her long mane of hair, \"now feed them to me. Feed me until my belly isn't flat anymore. Feed me until we get a preview of when I get fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little trepidation, the King picked up a berry and gently placed it into her mouth. Nimidia bit through it in a flash of white teeth, red juice running down her chin.She swallowed, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious. But I want more,\" she smiled, \"fill your hands, but feed me one at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing exactly what she'd told him had done pretty well so far for Killian, so he did as instructed. Nimidia ate slowly and erotically, moaning as she ate each bite. Her right hand was soon quite busy between her legs, stimulating herself as she ate and her eyes were closed tight. Killian watched enthralled, stopping only when he felt a very important area be grabbed tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to make sure you enjoy it to,\" she smiled, fingers flexing, \"the more you enjoy seeing me like this, the fatter I can get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian found it hard to concentrate between her hand and constantly getting more berries, but soon noticed that Nimidia stomach was starting to bulge. All those calorie heavy berries were packing up inside her, making her flat if not perfectly toned stomach begin to round out. Rather than slow down she became more voracious than ever as it advanced across her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster, faster,\" she said, beginning to sweat and pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed more berries only for her to abandon her hold and pull him to her. Killian's hard stomach was pressed tight against her swollen one and soon he found himself quite closely joined with her. Her legs wrapped around him, squeezing tighter as she climbed higher and higher...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian snored on the ground, a leaf getting closer and closer to his nose before he exhaled and blew it away. Nimidia looked down on his sleeping form, smiling at the hard muscles of his back and hips. Idly, she reached out to the bush she had grown and popped another meal berry into her mouth while rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was young for a nymph and had never born a child, yet Nimidia was fairly sure her stomach couldn't be much bigger if she was at term. Normally flatish and hard, save for the little inch of softness near her naval, it was now well rounded, packed to the brim and starting to churn with absorbing calories. The Nymph gave a polite little belch as she rubbed the slope of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it feel like when this is permanent?\" she asked herself, eating yet another berry.</span></div></div>",

However, he was terrible with details and planning, meaning it was up to a more organized mind to fill out all the little details. This extended from war to politics to his own wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually the Queen plans all this out,\" Princess Zonks huffed early one morning on the wedding day, hurrying through the palace with an armful of scrolls as servants prepared for the great feast after the ceremony, \"but she's rather too busy stuffing herself and being stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks had already been tired from essentially running her brothers government but the slight half elf was now rushing about delivering orders, her perfectionism forcing her to make sure everything was just right. It was pretty tiring to be honest, while she'd been an adventurer like her brother she hadn't kept up any exercise after he'd taken the thrown. Her minimal muscle mass had evaporated and the soft noble life was making her breathing come harder, Zonks noticed. She was too busy running the nation, paying the garrisons, negotiating nobles and making sure everyone was seated away from those they hated at the wedding to exercise or tend to herself much. The only good thing was that the farmers were reporting a record harvest in the making, plants across the kingdom shooting up in ways never before seen. It wasn't even July and the corn and wheat was nearly ready to harvest while the fruit trees were groaning with nearly mature fruit. The druids and wizards couldn't explain it, but Zonks could guess why it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's one good thing about him marrying a fae,\" the half elf grunted, bursting into the bridal chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen of the most beautiful noble girls in the kingdom chattered and gossiped and snacked in their lacy negligee that was barely fitting htem. Stockings ran up plumpening legs, thong underwear showed sagging buns and carefully tailored bras were overwhelmed by the magnitude of bosoms within. Zonks, putting down the natural jealous of an A cup, did notice that every normally flat belly was quite bloated and full and that most of the normally weight conscious beauties had a stomach softening scone or chubbifying cookie or butt building brownie at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, what is the hold up?\" the wizard demanded, \"we are late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe that is just me,\" Nimidia smiled, leading to a round of giggles, \"give us a moment, I am spent from the King's attention this morning and I'm sure they won't start without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks had never really liked her sister in law. Nimidia was too open, too trusting, too naive and save for dancing and exploring and fucking, far too lazy for her tastes. And the impossible hour glass figure and endless legs constantly being flaunted didn't help that, nor did the Nymph's easy casting of sorceress' spells rather than her own carefully curated and much weaker wizarding powers. So she'd been hoping that the prospect of turning into a proper fatty would put Nimidia into her place, give her some humble pie...except it hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are with child then?\" she asked, relieved as always she wouldn't have to bear an heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so, since the King decided to push up the wedding,\" Nimidia smiled,  showing new dimples as she lay nude on a soft couch, three of her brides maids brushing out the terrific, gleaming crimson man that hung behind her and seemed to fill the room, \"and he is over the moon for the fact. But we do not need to hurry, I know for a fact that the King is still sleeping and will be for some time after our morning chat, but he is merely a man after all, right girls? And I am me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA softer life in the city had already softened/spread Nimidia's impossible curves a bit more, giving her perfect ass a new bounce. But since she'd reacted to news of the curse by preempting it she'd turned into an absolute glutton. Even now two of her maids did nothing but transfer either chocolates or chocolate dipped strawberries straight into her mouth, one after another as she lay completely nude on a long couch and without shame despite having put on well over thirty pounds in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more did the nymph seem nimble and fit, her athleticism had quite faded and her greenish skin looked softer than butter. The firm muscle tone of her legs was gone, they were still shapely but her tight quads had gotten goopy and her thigh gap had closed, even her ankles had gotten bigger around. Always shapely hips had spread a little bit wider, going from wide to edging in on a matron's girth. Her belly's true growth was difficult to tell, due to the fact that she was stuffed to the brim all day, but her lean waist was clearly a thing of the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in the morning with only a mild bulge, Zonks could see her sister in law had lost all of her stomach muscles, the little softness in her lower abdomen spreading upwards to give her a full on beer belly, the dramatic curve of her waist was gone due to new and quickly growing love handles hanging soft and flabby on her hips, the once narrow waisted woman sporting a muffin top. Her ribs had vanished, covered up in fat and her large, freckled breasts had sucked up their fair share of snacking too. They were less round and more tear drop, starting to sag a bit from sheer girth and her nipples were starting to stretch. Her trim arms were rounder, lacking muscle tone and they jiggled slightly when she rubbed her stomach. Her neck had thickened, she had a new second chin unless looking straight ahead and her cheeks had gotten puffier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked soft, indulgent, lazy and honestly plump. Zonks could believe she was already knocked up, the way her hands constantly rubbed and cradled her stuffed paunch.And she looked radiant, magnificent, gorgeous. Her brides maids stared at her as if she was the most beautiful thing in the world, the King still drooled around her and Zonks knew she still caused traffic accidents when she left her gardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to join us, sister?\" the nymph asked, \"you look thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're late, you're supposed to make your entrance in less than an hour and you haven't even gotten dressed yet!\" Zonks snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, clothes. I do hate them, especially this time of year,\" the nymph yawned, \"alright, get my hair braided and bring out my dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immensity of the nymph's hair meant it took all but one of the bridesmaids braiding if they were to get it done anytime this year. The Queen to be began feeding herself chocolate covered straw berries while the dress was fetched. Zonks, seeing the Nymph's squishy belly continuing to round out, was glad they'd had the gown resized but two days before. The original white silk selected for Nimidia would have shredded across her beefier body. The wizard went back to signing important documents, until the Nymph coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zonks, dear sister,\" the Queen said, \"may I ask of you a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what?\" the Princess asked, looking up to see Nimidia lusciously bite through a strawberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you rub my belly? It's upset I haven't eaten enough today,\" the Nymph smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine,\" Zonks sighed, walking over and beginning to gently knead the new Queen's full midrift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, the outer layer was fatty and squishy enough to pinch three inches of, soft to the touch. But beneath it it was full and firm. Zonks had never touched anything like it and found herself fascinated by the contrast, her face soon going as red as Nimidia's hair. The Queen began to make little orgasmic groaning noises, still eating as her sister in law rubbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you are quite good, yes, don't stop,\" the Nymph sighed, \"rub my sides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Zonks thought, these love handles are like butter. They're so squishy and jiggly, I remember when her waistline was so narrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my legs, they're sore from dancing with this extra weight,\" Nimidia went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her thighs, if her waist was butter then they were meringue. All their dancers muscle had vanished, replaced with soft, trembling fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts too, they're starting to hurt from the baby...\" Nimidia insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks reached out, gingerly touching the heavy, swollen orbs and finding them still firm but so, so heavy, jiggling and bouncing to her touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, oh yes,\" the Queen moaned, cracking open her green eyes, \"why Zonks, you look red in the face...a little out of breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the Princess, caught in the throws of previously unknown bisexuality squeaked but was saved by the arrival of the dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen's was incredibly short and would probably rip right through given her full belly and ever growing breasts, the legs it showed off would be chubby but Zonks realized that everyone would be drooling over her. The bridesmaid dresses were all green and tight and hadn't been resized, no one having expected all the other figure conscious noble girls to start running to fat in two weeks. Zonks frowned when she saw her own dress, tight and figure hugging unlike her normally loose, concealing wizard robes. Rolling her eyes at her sister in laws insistence she be a brides maid, she dropped her gown and picked up the short, overly revealing garment from the rack...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Zonks shook her head at the unthinking chubbiness of the women around her, already trying to squeeze tight fabric over now chubby hips and sucking in swollen bellies to try and get their laces done. What was wrong with them, getting plump without noticing? Naturally the work of disorganized, irresponsible minds that lacked her dedication. She might not have exercised much recently, but she'd controlled her appetite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks stripped her loose gown off, tossing it to the side and stepping into the green bridesmaids dress. She pulled it upwards and found it begin to pinch around mid-thigh, dragging to a halt even before her hips. The nerdy wizard looked down, brown eyes widening as she saw herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-elf had always been incredibly skinny: her thighs were thin as tooth picks, her hips didn't have the slightest curve, her belly was concave, her breasts were mosquito bites and her slim neck was tiny. Sitting around on her butt organizing the government didn't lead to building up muscle and her lack of appetite prevented any fat from building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zonks was quite surprised to look down and see the new her: her thighs had burgeoned outwards, growing thigh and lazy. Narrow hips had ballooned outwards until they were wider than her shoulders, womanly squishy bags of fat with shining stretchmarks. A turn to the back saw that her previusly non-existent butt had turned into middle aged padding, sagging and bulging softly. A soft paunch had grown in, hanging over her underwear and large enough Zonks could put her finger tips under them and bounce the belly up and down. Her breasts weren't particularly big, but they'd grown into soft handfuls that complimented her full pear shape. Delicate cheeks were wider and her neck had gotten thick, a blubbery double chin marring her visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm...,\" Zonks blinked, taking in her very chubby build and vainly tugging on her dress, which would be going no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In need of your clothes being let out, dear sister,\" Nimidia giggled, walking up and slapping Zonks' immense ass, \"someone's been <i>snacking</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemory shot into Zonks mind: all the finger food she'd munched at council meetings, the bowls of candied fruit she'd munched on doing paper work, the bags of candies she'd eaten while reading, the boxes of chocolates she'd devoured, the second and third and fourth helpings she'd had at every meal, the gorging she'd done while testing cake samples...barely a moment had gone by in the past month without her eating in the last month. She didn't remember that the Codex Corpulentia had been right next to her the entire time, glowing softly as she gained weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you, you always needed more curves,\" the Nymph insisted, standing next to her much shorter in law, their reflections in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nymph wasn't nearly as perfectly svelte as she had been, but Nimidia was merely well padded compared to her sister. They'd probably gained about the same amount of weight, maybe thirty or thirty five pounds but on Zonks 5' nothing body it looked far heavier. The Princess blinked with the terrible realization that she was by far the chubbiest girl in the entire changing room of chubby girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks was speechless, not saying anything as Nimidia used magic to let out the dresses of her bridesmaids. They weren't let out to a comfortable size, only until they were just big enough to force their chunky figures into. Zonks' dress was practically bursting off of her body, the fabric whiskering so snug her belly button could be seen in the front and her new cellulite plain on her saggy butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling to the ceremony in the line of chubby bridesmaids, Zonks went through the wedding in a daze. Her self image had taken such a knock that she barely heard King Killian promise to have and hold his wife no matter through thick and thicker and a spare ring having to be fetched for the Nymphs chubbier finger. She came too at a table in the reception when there was a dull pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks blinked looking down to see that the buttons holding her dress in had given way from hip to breasts, totally exposing her, and that she had a dozen licked clean plates in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your sister planned this ceremony beautifully,\" Queen Nimidia said, leaning back in her chair at the highest table and stroking her stomach, \"but I had to make some changes to the menu. There were some recipes I just had to try out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say,\" Killian whistled, putting an arm around her shoulders as he watched every woman in the party descend into a feeding frenzy, \"I suppose we'll won't do a dance then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we will dance, but laying down,\" Nimidia smiled, new dimples showing deep and leaned over to kiss him, another rip going across her beyond skin tight gown when their tongues met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither newly wed pulled away, the kissing turning into a rapid and passionate make out session. Killian traced a hand over across her food swollen gut, which stretched a third of the way across her lap, the biggest she'd yet achieved and yet only a preview. The Nymph moaned at the tiny pressure on her engorged abdomen, many would have called it indecent but then the High Priestess of the Goddess of Restraint was toplessly wrestling the Duchess of Westmarch in the punch bowl for the rest of the cake, their own engorged stomachs bumping against each other. When the two pulled away, Nimidia was breathing heavily, huge eyes rolling back into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More food,\" she demanded, a fresh rumble of hunger shooting through her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More? You had half a tier of cake yourself,\" Killian teased, \"and I think we're out of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're turning me on, when you turn me on, I get hungry,\" the red haired fae grinned and cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlants burst through cracks in the great hall's floor, shooting up to the size of full grown trees, their limbs hanging heavy with ripe fruit dipped in chocolate. The hungry female guests swarmed at them, disintegrating clothes tearing away. Even the once stunned Zonks waddled towards a tree of chocolate covered strawberries, holding up her torn dress in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've fixed that problem,\" Killian laughed, plucking a chocolate dipped bannana from a nearby tree and placing it on her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph deep throated it, swallowing it down in a rush and licking chocolate off of her lips.Killian noticed that his new wife was noticeably plumper than she'd been upon saying \"I Do\". Her breasts were flowing over her top, their veiny, slightly green freckled slopes rising up like dough in an oven. Her slight double chin was now prominent and her cheeks had become soft apples, while her thickening ankles were crossing the line towards cankles. Nimidia's always broad hips were flowing out of her chair, fat packing onto them by the breath and her turgid stomach was going soft, digesting her caloric burden into new fat at an impossible pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillian had never been more in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" she said, reaching out to grab hold of the King's obvious erection, \"More. I need to get bigger, softer, slower, <i>fatter.</i> Give me more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in Zonks chambers, the Codex Corpulentia glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks woke up in the wreckage of the feasting hall, head pounding and stomach churning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess went to push herself up and failed. Confused, the Princess looked down to find herself completely naked and so stuffed, that when kneeling on the ground her stomach pressed into the ground. Zonks groaned, hearing high pitched screams and moans coming from the high table of the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over, seeing her brother thrusting again and again into a very chubby version of Nimidia, her plump legs wrappd around his muscular back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...,\" Zonks sighed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Six months after the wedding and Princess Zonks was sure something was very, very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the surrounding kingdoms were caught in the icy grip of a fierce winter, Banestar was warm, green and luscious. The trees were in full bloom and heavy with fruit, every barn and granary was packed to the brim with stored food and the amount of money the kingdom had earned exporting the now bimonthly harvest from its fertile fields had left the treasury groaning with gold even after all of King Killian's tax reforms and labor laws had gone into effect. Mercenaries and easily affordable armor meant the kingdom's army was never stronger, the King departing on a short crusade against Orcs invading another kingdom with every expectation of success. Expected birth rates were through the roof, marriages were ten a day in the great cathedral and every bride went with a noticeable bulge in her dress. The Queen had announced she was pregnant with twins and her doctors had said they had never seen a healthier expectant mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe responsible Zonks should have been at ease...but something was niggling her. If only she could figure out what it was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short and once petite half elf wizard waddled as quick as she could up the many stairs, pale blue robe stained near black with her pouring sweat. Once fleshless hips bounced back and forth like jello in an earth quake, a dress that would have been a tent on her months ago drawn transparently tight across her gigantic ass cheeks, the seam up their back drawn so snug the stitches were popping with each heavy step. Columnar thighs carried so much weight they'd started forming rolls and didn't even slap, just endlessly rasping against each other, their butter soft skin sore, red and irritated. Each step was a heavy chore, the woman's overtaxed joints grinding and popping and she was made all the clumsier because her floppy pot belly had blocked the view of her feet for three months. Her freckled face was round as a ball, the tip of her chin showing above a jowl that had swallowed up her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping and wheezing at the top of the third and final flight of stairs, the morbidly obese Zonks staggered towards the meeting hall. Two female knights of the Queen's guard saluted the rotund royal, opening the door to reveal a council room full of young women in skimpy dresses cut tight to show off plush, plump, podgy and protruding figures, the Queen at their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*GASP* You, ugh, you *UHF* we can *PANT* start now,\" the sweaty woman groaned, collapsing flat on her back atop a divan, her rotund belly rising and falling like an extra-jiggly tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe divan groaned immediately, Zonks was already too wide in the hips for any chair in the kingdom and furniture was getting too frail for her three hundred and sixty pound bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Clarissa, get my dear sister in law a cold drink and a snack so we can go back to the meeting,\" Queen Nimidia smiled, ordering her youngest lady in waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the drink it took several moments for the Princess to cool down enough to understand what was going on around her. Business like conversation went merrily on, the kingdom's issues brought up and solved by the moment. Yes there were a few more giggles than at a normal meeting but they moved with an economy Zonks would have envied. It took her a few tries to at last sit up, a great and ignored rip sounding as tidal waves of belly fat destroyed her dress from her waist up to her barely D cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen turned and smiled at her, \"you're looking a little thin, dear Sister in Law. Is the diet to lose the weight you'd gained before the wedding working too well for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've still got a couple pounds to loose still,\" the obese wizard gasped, patting the tidal wave of belly fat hanging between her pillowy thighs, \"but you look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nymph Queen looked radiant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pale green skin actually glowed slightly and her glorious crimson mane had reached ten feet in length and turned a shade of crimson never before seen on the mortal plane. He The hundred pounds she had gained since Killian had told her of the curse suited her magnificently, turning her once athletic curves into glorious pillows: despite being six months along she still had an hour glass figure, her hips might be bouncy as jello but there was still firm tone beneath their unmarred skin even though they were now wide enough to brush the sides of her throne. None would doubt that the spherical bulge of her stomach held twins, but it was still a touch narrower than her hips. Her face was beatific, cheeks only slightly rounder and bearing only the hint of a double chin still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal rack was immense, grown so large and milk swollen that the Queen had at last bowed to gravity and begun wearing a supportive bra that kept her veiny, head sized knockers elevated. The rest of her fashion choices hadn't changed though, her plunging neckline showed ten inches of cleavage and its microscopic skirt revealed half of her smooth ass cheeks even before it went onto her legs. Plump and thick from hip to toe they might be, but the two hundred and forty pounds of queen's stems were still the most nimble and graceful in the land. Her ladies might have to rub lotion onto her thighs to prevent chaffing and her ankles were technically cankles now but the long length of exposed limb never put a step wrong and still danced every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnificent I know, let us go on with work though,\" the Queen finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks would have said something else, but the arrival of her snack distracted her. She gorged on the platter of steaming dumplings, pork and fried wonton disappearing down her mouth and thought. No one would say that the Queen wasn't fat, she had to weight at least two hundred and forty pounds but she was nowhere near as fat as she was supposed to be. The curse detailed in the Codex Corpulentia was exact: the royal spouse would gain a pound a day upon their marriage, unless someone started mucking about trying to be clever. And while Nimidia had gained a hundred pounds, she should have carried a hundred more by now. Her gain had plateaued months ago, Zonks thought the nymph might not have even overate recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the wider than she was tall Princess thought as she munched onto her twenty fifth or so dumpling and took a long, instantly replaced drink of fizzy grape juice from a magical glass, where is all of her fat going to? Someone had to be getting fatter in her place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mystery she needed to solve, even if it might mean...socializing. But she had to find out who was gaining the extra weight...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zonk's blue eyes were immediately drawn to the ladies of court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcres of soft, pampered pudge were packed into or flowing out of not nearly enough embroidered silk around the Queen's council table. A noble girl was supposed to be a delicate, slender thing with trim limbs, long coltish legs and tiny waists with small, subtle hips and high, firm breasts, but Zonk doubted a single woman at the table weighed less than two hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNymiria had already changed the fashions long ago, skirt hems had risen from ankle length to mid thigh due to the focus the shameless Queen put upon her long, fabulous legs. But now instead of slender stems, the flowers of court were showing off inflated thighs and jiggling cankles. Similarly the big titted Nymph had made scandalously low cut gowns common place, leading to head sized hooters as far as Zonks could see. They rested lazily on bellies bigger than a catapult ball, racing towards chubby knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow they were all so unaware of their rampant obesity baffled the observant wizard, as she ate her twenty fifth dumpling. She had somehow overlooked getting a little chubby, but that all of these vain beauties had, in the prime of their lives gone so swiftly to seed was a major warning sign. Were they all blind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks made herself sit up a little more, weak, cramping muscles sending out twinges of protests as she straightened. But now that the sharp curve of her stomach was no longer blocking her view, the deluded Princess could see more ballooning beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the Queen's left was Duchess Vivania Von Vloimar perhaps the fattest woman in the room but the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViviania was a tall, stately woman in her forties who seemed to have defied age. Full red lips and icy pale skin contrasted beautifully with thick black curls and glacier blue eyes. Despite being in middle age she looked very youthful, with nary a line nor blemish to her face and her body was nothing but hard, angular curves, near totally fatless. Before Nymidia and her brother's ascension Viviana had rarely appeared at court, staying in her lands on the gloomy eastern marches of Banestar and winning multiple victories over the savage orcs and undead that haunted the swamps. She supposedly had a daughter but Zonks had never seen her and her tyrannical and mercifully dead father had been strangely afraid of the slender Duchess, who never ate a bite at any court function. But she'd become a fast friend to the Nymph Queen and shown a great deal more of herself at court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twice as much really, the trim woman having packed on over a hundred pounds of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViviana's elegant face had blown up into rounded, cherubic cheeks and a profusion of delicately wobbling chins. Her twin arms were flabby, a harsh red mark around their sleeves, and an immense belly almost as big as the queen's filled her lap. Her skirt was a longer affair than the younger women, but it was pulled low to let her keg of a gut ride free. Between giving the Queen advice on military matters she was attacking a pile of ruby red apples with animalstic fury, her shining white teeth ripping through the delicate fruit with furor and small, polite burps. Her arms, once swords woman lean, were round and jiggly, significant bingo wings flapping like some sort of flying animal, their trembling a sign that her soft muscles had grown totally exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duchess gave up with a huff, hands falling across her stomach and eyeing the pile of apples with predatory intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, have the apples conquered my mighty general?\" Nimidia teased, the gravid Queen reaching out and pinching the pale woman's dome of a gut, \"Let me send you reinforcements. Lady Clarissa, lend our exhausted advisor at speed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Clarissa had always been among the slimmest ladies at court. Save for Zonks herself of course who'd been notably bony apart from her brief chubby period, the Princess reminded herself while wiping sweat out of her fat rolls. But Clarissa had worn skinny incredibly well, an Aasimar with pale golden skin and silver hair, the aetherially lean girl had a waist two hands seemed able to fit around, barely any hips and a long, delicate neck, almost un-real in her slimness, probably thanks to a distant divine heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore though, like every other lady Zonks beheld she'd fattened up under the tide of food...although perhaps not as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa was able to rise from her chair without the use of her arms, plump but still very shapely legs still strong enough to move her body. Her soft belly formed only a single roll as she stood, taking one last bite of pastry, but her breasts bounced mightily. The flat chested had blossomed, breasts soaring up a fifth of the alphabet, going from tiny A cups to whopping Es. The pale golden breasts were firm tear drops despite the growth, defying gravity even as they mushroomed over Clarissa's tight pink top. Her cheeks were cherubic apples instead of round bulges and her double chin was barely there. Why, when viewed from behind her waist still had an inward curve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your will is mine dear Queen, I'd hate to see any of the court be conquered by their food!' the comparatively lean Aasimar smiled, patiently but swiftly feeding the pale Vivian until the older woman began to moan that she could take no more, even as her mouth still gnawed fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a repeated scene across the court, the pampered beauties were turning away from completed business to slump in their chairs. After all, it was one O'clock, the time when overfull fatgirls grew drowsy. Zonks pitied the incredibly lazy court beauties, although her own eyes were a bit heavy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen clapped her perfectly plump hands, making her gigantic breasts nearly pop free, \"Ladies, it appears the afternoon doldrums have hit us. Let us break until four when we will return for dinner and more council. Princess Zonks, I am so heavy with child I sweat like a pig. May I request you as bathing attendant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I could do with a bath myself. I worked up quite a sweat exercising today,\" Zonks said, although if pressed she'd have been unable to ever recall exercising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good. But as there is so much of me, I will need two attedants,\" the obese Nymph smiled, patting her gigantic belly for emphasis, \"I'll need a second. How about...\"</span></div></div>",

As she went her way she saw two obese guards chatting outside of Nimdia's study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards were a pair of twin brothers named Alexander and Cassius Rindheart. They had raven black hair and wore gold and silver armor. Alexander donned a full beard while Cassius wore a handlebar mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen the king recently?\" Alexander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's put on some weight recently. Heck the whole kingdom's been getting fatter recently,\" Cassius replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he just got back and he's huge and not just fat. He's got huge muscles for a fat man. I've never seen a man pack on that amount of fat and muscle in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards stopped talking as they noticed the princess listening in to their conversation. Zonks was sweating and panting to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Princess Zonks,\" the twins said as they bowed. \"Is there anything we can help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks stammered as she tried to think of something to say. \"Ar...

Somehow Nimdia was unintentionally diverting the effects of the curse due to casting several spells a day. Yet Zonks hasn't been out much to pay attention to the curse's effects on the kingdom, but if what the guards said were true than the entire kingdom was now under the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZonks thanked the guards and rushed towards her room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Cursed mother, I hope she turns green,\" Serafina huffed as she struggled under the weight of a stack of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't fair at all. The Magical Academy was a waste of time, with its endless classes and boundless homework and pointless rules. Didn't she know the pressure Serafina was under? When mother had gone she was just a farm girl eeking out her way in the big city, but Serafina? She was the daughter of the greatest wizard on the planet, Lady Marigold the Midnight Mage herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone expected so much of her, to be the very best in all her classes and Serafina well...wasn't.  The words academic probation were being thrown around and would have already been put into place if her mother had been anyone else. Of course, having spent her entire life in her mother's immense magical palace being waited on hand and foot with tutors taking it easy on her hadn't exactly prepared her for academic hardship. When the going got tough, Serafina got out of there and found a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if she'd bothered to give me some lessons instead of galavanting off adventuring,\" Serafina huffed, \"and she has the nerve to accuse me of slacking off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman slammed the towering stack down onto a desk, rubbing her sore back and taking a look in the mirror, \"Maybe she has a little bit of a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing Serafina had really focused on at the Academy was partying. The Magical school for girls had a boys magical academy on one flank (great for when she remembered she needed homework done), a girls assassin college on the other flank (for when you wanted it girlish and flexible) and a Knightly garrison on the other (for when you wanted it steely and chivalrous). And while Serafina seemed to have not inherited her mother's work ethic or magical might, she had gotten good looks from both sides of the family tree, her deceased father a handsome paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood tall and tan at 5'9, much of the length fantastic legs. Bouncy golden girls fell down to her curvy round hips and she favored tight, low cut dresses to show off her flat, tapered waist and large, firm breasts. Above her sharp cheek bones, Sera had huge hazel eyes that challenged beneath mocking thick brows and pouty lips like bows that promised a reward to anyone worthy of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina had lost her virginity her first night at the academy at a kegger and got hammered harder than a troll in front of a raging viking thunder God four nights a week. Combined with an open dining hall, no figure conscious nannies over seeing her for the first time and Serafina no longer receiving equestrian or dancing lessons and well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that bad,\" the flunking wizard sighed at her reflection, \"not worth putting me on a <i>diet</i>. Although I am just a little chubby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd gone to school a trim and toned 130lbs and come back a bloated and flabby 173.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hopeful mage had gained forty pounds in a semester, enough that her height and carrying it well couldn't hide it. Few of her carefully tailored clothes could be squeezed into, right now she was wearing a simple white slip that looked ready to rip, just like a previously loose gown had done during her potions finals when she'd stirred too hard. Long firm legs were looking chubby in the thigh reason, the gap closing up noticeably. Tight buns had plunged, picking up cellulite and stretch marks. Round hips had gotten a bit meaty, with a flabby fupa growing between them and her love handles had been used for just that the last few boys she'd drunk fucked. Her breasts were large enough they'd started sagging before twenty, she could see her larger nipples clearly through the fabric of the clothes. And her face looked a bit puffy from the combination of booze and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her mother had gone ape shit on her for the failing and cheating and weight gain, Sera had had to admit that her talented mother looked noticeably slimmer than her. The lecture had dragged on and on, ending with a requirement that Serafina would now be undergoing hours of study every day until she could cast and a strict diet, with no new clothes bought for her until she could either enlarge her current ones or fit into the old ones. And that she'd be spending all of break locked in the study, studying, on bread and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid mom, easy for her to stay thin with magic,\" Serafina grumbled, flickering through the covers until she at last touched a rather dingy looking book she'd found stuck behind the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a small squeak as a small barb on its metal edge caught her finger tip, a bead of blood falling onto the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Codex Corpulentia,\" she said, \"hmmm that sounds like it involves fat. Maybe I can loose a little weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book purred at her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman, an impious, proud beauty going to seed without its insight already. It could work a master piece upon her...and more...for the book found that while Serafina's vain, shallow mine was useless for a highly structured wizard's magic, its fickle, emotional nature was perfect for wild sorceress magic. She had immense potential all hidden just below the surface and waiting to respond to the right touch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a physical touch, letting her summon up creatures of the abyss and inferno, eager to sate her desires. Like a succubus, cruel and caressing, to slide her into a life of charmed, obese servitude to her own vices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe, the book thought,Serafina could be bait. You had to spend money to make money and if she needed a little bit of weight loss now, well, touching her mind through a spell could change the currently plump sorceress into a very powerful magician, by stripping her mother Marigold of her own powers and fattening her up bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, well, Serafina was a true gluttonistic hedonist. Maybe turning her fully to the dark side and awakening her powers fully could let her lead many, many others on the road to ruin...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It just had to get her negative influence strong enough and in the right place. It altered a page as the already bored girl leafed through them, offering up a simple way for her to cast magic spells up to level two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gluttony aura,\" Seraphina read, \"by writing these runes on your belly but once in chocolate and then eating them, from now on you will project an aura of hunger to all women in a hundred feet. Any who cross into this aura will be forever changed. After, you will be able to cast magical spells up to the second level.\" Interesting, but where will I get chocolate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump party girl looked about and noticed a single candy bar wrapped in foil on a book shelf, soleSurvivor of the junk food Purge her mother had conducted after seeing her daughter's beer gut. Smiling, the chunky mage ate half of it, melted the rest over a candle, stripped and carefully wrote out the runes on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic flickered outwards as Serafina said the magic words. Across the hall, the skinny chamber maid Amilia felt peckish despite having just had dinner and upstairs her mother, lady marigold was struck with an appetite the hulking body guard and muscular stable boy sharing her bed couldn't fulfill. In her study, Seraphina licked the chocolate of her belly and patted the plump bulge that gurgled happily to have something beyond salad after a tortured day of dieting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeraphina pushed her new abilities over the break, mastering cantrips and first catching up to and then surpassing where she should be. She could levitate small objects, put a magical shield over herself, shoot magical missiles and mend damaged objects with a word. In the castles main hall her mother looked over the demonstrated spells with mild approval, then cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good dear daughter, I see with sufficient motivation you can learn,\" the regal, dark haired woman said, \"but, I note that you are little changed otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a mage hand spell, Marigold poked the blondes beer belly, telkinetic finger driving deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look to have not lost a pound\" the famous mage observed, \"if anything you look plumper than when you arrived here. How did you fit into this dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina was in her favorite sea green dress, a low cut, backless ensemble that hadn't fit since October. Now it fit her 180 lb body like a glove, although it emphasized her considerable beer belly more than she'd expected. Sitting on her butt reading all day hadn't burned many calories and Learning cantrips to turn water into beer and bread into chocolate had insured her weight gain continued unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I altered my dresses with magic,\" the chubby blonde explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I am glad you are able to, your appearance is not up to standards,\" Marigold observed, tossing a chocolate into her own mouth, \"what will people think when they see you? How will you get a spouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina didn't mention how her mother snacked all the time now. Or how her tight white dress was pressing tight against a little starter belly marring her mom's perfect waist. No, let her stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem mother,\" Serafina lied, \"when slender, I was distracted. By boys, girls, beer, parties. I was too pretty, now that I am plump I can focus on my studies and only date someone interested in something besides a perfect ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those words have some merit I admit, the world can easily corrupt us,\" the vain Marigold who'd spent all morning with a knight, a rogue and a barbarian in her, admitted, \"very well daughter, you may return to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina grinned, showing dimples and clapped, jiggles rippling across her heavy breasts. Her mother stood up and gave her a kiss, bellies briefly bouncing and demanded lunch. Serafina glutted herself until the seams of her resized dress complained and she had to let it out again. But she wasn't so caught up as to not notice the maids thighs stretching out their tights, the food stains on their lips and how the platters they brought were a little light. Or how her mother ate and drank, ate and drank until her belly sat in her lap and she had to summon shadow hands to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina left her mother's Castle via a stately carriage, enchanted to be the size of a small house inside. The blonde looked herself over in a mirror, naked. She took in the round bulge of her tummy, the heavy jiggle of her breasts, the plump thrust of her butt. The cellulite and stretch marks, the sagging and sweat...</span></div></div>",

I catch guys staring at my tits and ass all the time, they don't seem to mind a couple extra pounds. Who needs to be skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a couple extra was fifty pounds since starting university but Serafina was right. She still got plenty of attention from men and women, her out going personality and natural charisma making up for going from athletically slim prep to beer bellied party girl. Of course, her E cup breasts and 40 inch hips helped out quite a bit too. While she disliked the tightness of her dress, the blonde was in general happy with herself despite getting chubby. She didn't really feel how out of shape she was due to never exercising unless forced, dance and riding had been passions forced onto her by her mother. Serafina was content to drink and fuck all night and then nap until noon and her plush, cuddly body let her do just that in complete comfort, literally more cushion for the pushing when she had sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, I carry the extra cup well and it lets me soak up more beer,\" she said, taking a long sip of beer she'd freshly summoned into a mug, \"but...do I really need the stretch marks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking on fifty pounds in a semester had put tiger stripes on Serafina's body. Big white ones on her hips, a few angry little purple ones around her belly button and small, veiny ones on her engorged breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And while I don't mind having a bit of padding did so much blubber need to go to my belly?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafina believed in four food groups: beer, chocolate, fried and buttered. As a result a lot of carbohydrates had deposted themselves around her once slender waist, giving her floppy lovehandles and beer belly big enough she could bounce its underside with two hands. She sucked in in the mirror, not anywhere close to her old 23 inch waist but at least a little more compact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and my boobs, I love them this size but really, I'm barely twenty do I have to sag already?\" she sighed, shaking her heavy hangers from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pounds had come on over the last few months, Serafina's tatas had gone from perfectly round Ds to tear drop shaped Es. A pencil laid under them would stay firmly in place now and she worried that she'd caught a terminal case of the droopies. She cupped them, frowning to find they weren't quite as sensitive as they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to loose weight, I just want to switch it around a little, smooth out and get myself firmer up top,\" the party girl sighed, draining her fourth beer and then looking at the Codex Corpulentia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBound as it was to a powerful, gainining sorceress, the book was improving itself. Its cover was no longer ratty but merely plain and it had thickened up from novella to full novel length. It purred internally to be found useful to such a comely host and Serafina flipped through its fingers, smiling when it showed her what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I think I like that very much...,\" she grinned, \"and all I need to do is down three beers and say the alphabet backwards...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her castle, Lady Marigold pulled herself up from her latest orgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifty seven year old magician looked herself over in the mirror, looking like a twenty one year old in perfect physical condition: tall, aesthetically slender and fatless. The famous wizard smiled as she drank in her curves, until she got to her lower belly and hips. Somehow Marigold's thigh gap had almost filled in, her concave stomach was now puffy and round and her hip shad taken on added, matronly bulk. The wizard gasped in complete confusion at such an event, suddenly remembering how much she'd eaten in the past two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I need to increase my daily exercises,\" she muttered, staring enough at her stomach she didn't notice how her shapely, pert C cup breasts suddenly sagged as low as a normal woman in late middle age would expect, \"and my diet will start tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTits flapping unnoticed, Marigold walked back to her awakening boy toys, her ass a canvas of stretch marks and a moon scape of cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now this is great,\" the slightly tipsy Serafina giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was flatter. Not flat and her waist was still pretty thick, but the beer bellied enchantress was now a thick, meaty hour glass. She couldn't see her ribs and could pinch plenty of inches built from beer pong victories and keg stands back when her abs had been strong enough for that. Her fat hadn't been destroyed, it had just migrated down to her hips or up to her chests. Downstairs she was an incredibly round 46 inches across her buns, bouncy as jello and smooth as fresh butter, while upstairs flawlessly round, enormous F cups defied gravity, jutting out proud and as timeless as the tallest mountains. To top it off, the softly curvy Serafina's skin was flawless and smooth as it had been at her thinnest, almost glamour perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage poured herself into her favorite dress, then tightened it up a size to really show off her curves. Her reflection was so tasty looking the curvaceous caster almost started making out with it but she wasn't that drunk yet. She readied herself as her carriage came to a halt at her college, ready for a new adventure...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Serafina was stepping out of her carriage she suddenly felt a weird pain in her belly. She grabbed hold of her now shrunken waist in pain, she felt as if it was bubbling with something. Bubbling with fat. Her belly rapidly started to inflate with added adipose as she was helpless to stop it. Her dress that she made tighter began to buckle under the pressure and ripped straight down the middle of her gut, causing it to jiggle free from it's confines. Once Serafina's jiggly midriff was more than visible through the wide tear in her green dress, it decided to stop growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Serafina was confused. It seemed as if all the weight she has moved away from her waist suddenly surged back in, but oddly enough her breasts and ass didn't seem to get affected, they stayed the same size as when the fat was relocated. All other changes remained. Serafina decided to leaf through the book to figure out what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, it seems that if casted incorrectly, some effects can backfire. I guess i didn't say the alphabet backwards correctly or something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She glanced back down at her chubby gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, it's not like my other alterations were changed back, and i guess i like this 'ol thing, i wouldn't mind keeping it if I'm being honest. But what to do about my dress, i can't be out in public looking like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She pondered for a moment. She then tried using her cloth alteration spell on it to try and fix the rip down the middle, but it didn't work at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" Exclaimed Serafina \"why isn't it working?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leafed through the book again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>the cloth alteration spell can only change the size of the clothes in question, in order to fix or make changes to your attire you must reach a higher magic level.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well that's just great\" sighed Serafina \"what will i do now?... Wait, i got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She suddenly remembered that her roommate is a seamstress, and a rather skilled one at that. And so with that, Serafina walked as fast as she possibly could to her dorm and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Taylor here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, Serafina is that you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and i need your help, i had a bit of a... wardrobe malfunction\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"hold on, let me get the door for you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door slowly opened, Serafina got a chance to see her old roommate after a long time away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Short and scrawny, Landgrave has a perfect domicile for enabling the most paranoid fugitives to let him get close, unsuspecting until the very moment he has a knife to their neck and the shackles around their wrists. Having seen it all, he has a line for it all, developing quite the dry wit in his years of scouring, but his tongue is tailed by a sharp, cunning mind and a knack for thinking his way out of tight spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes two halves to make a whole, however. Since hatching and childhood have Otho and Landgrave been partners in crime , the gryphon having not spent an hour of his entire life refraining from absolute loyalty to his owner...but while Landgrave remains his top priority in life, food comes a decimal close. Mealtimes don\u2019t exist for him: an entire day to him is an unending feasting session with breaks thrown in here and there; gryphons in their adult ages tower even the tallest of men, but Otho was their size by childhood, and him and his appetite would only grow as his stomach expanded to contain more immense meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a towering whale measuring fifteen feet at the whithers, carrying a whopping fifty tons in fat, his staggeringly round body carries the strength to rival a thundering rockslide. Also, despite his lack of an ability to speak, Otho is as intelligent as a human, and is capable of understanding their speech. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This interactive was created as a sort of companion to my last one, Curse of the Lipomancer. This interactive will share the same setting as Lipomancer, but not be restricted to the same specific premise as that story. Mostly it will serve as a way for people to be able to create characters more easily seeing as the slots in the original have either been taken up or are buried deep within the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Curse of the Lipomancer however, this one will be less restrictive in two important ways:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b> The storylines don't have to involve the aforementioned Lipomancer at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-</b> There will be less restrictive rules on writing quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, grammar and proper spelling is still heavily encouraged, and shorter additions will be subject to deletion. Usually this would be defined as something shorter than a couple paragraphs, but will be judged on a case by case basis. If it looks like you've put actual effort into it, you'll probably be fine. If you're obviously trying to bait somebody else into writing you ideas out for you, then your chapter is getting nuked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall this set up is meant to both encourage more creativity than the last interactive I've created in this setting, as well as allow people more room to breath when it comes to the stories they want to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that, some basic no-brainer rules apply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-No underage characters involved in any fetishy/sexual material.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-No necrophilia or other unnecessarily repulsive material.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>-Don't hijack the storylines to make it into something other than weight gain/expansion.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, please email me if you have any complaints, questions, or concerns about the story, and have fun!</td>",
