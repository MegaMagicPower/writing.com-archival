I was this type of high school student, the too large, uncoordinated, and not caring for sports nerd, I became alienated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange it was to me that when the senior year and basketball homecoming dance at school, who would seek me out of the crowd, she ignoring all her rich and or handsome suitors, Alison asked me to take her to the dance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, the runner-up to the senior prom queen had her hot date given her the brush-off for not winning a title. She was down in the dumps, so much that she was willing to link up with about any fellow classmate that might ask her to come with him. This is when I happened to be there, she seeing as knowing me to be as much a gentleman, she made her choice and doing so, it instantly elevated my status at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was really great, it was easy to see why the hunk men of the football team liked her as a cheerleader and sweetheart, and she was for them an easy mark. Something unexpected happened during the school dance, Alison asking her new friend to take her home early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not understand her reasoning, but being the gentleman again; I did as ask why she wanted me to take her home. One the way, Alison began her learned ritual as what the team player liked her to do, she slipping down in her seat, got on her knees on the car floor and went for something she liked to toy or fondle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur drive to her house had some rather violent swerving moments, and when arriving, I discovered her parents were out that night to visit friends. We were alone, unbelievably alone, and she being hot had made me knowing a feeling of foolish desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI parked the loaned car from a friend where she suggested, putting it as inside the garage. As Allison got out of the car and rushed quick to press a wall mounted red lighted button what lower the garage door, granting us privacy. Everything from there on seems as much a blur in my mind. Alison came at me with intent, she wanted and expected of me to be as aggressive as was any a man on the team, or apposing teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillful, she was easy to seduce, as was I willing to be for her as sexual fodder. Like in school the teacher having first learned the program of study was there to show, teach, and then test the individuals as what they could comprehend. We together on her bed were so busy learning one about the other, we enjoying our thrills, did fail to take note of her parents coming home after midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroubled parents knew something was cooking when the garage door opened to show the usual parking spot inside the garage as taken by another car. They as parents to Alison knew from past experience what to expect. As I was at a crucial point of strenuous stroking of the heartstrings of Alison, as in walked her loving mother, she doing a late night bed check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs to explain and give reason for our actions, Alison played it as being innocent and suggesting it was I that wooed her home and into bed. She became as much an accuser as was her parents to me as a sinful creep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit seemed that no matter how good a person is, if they get caught once doing what is not acceptable, and they stand judged.</font></span></div></div>",

People will think what they wish, and talk, they look to those in authority to be as quick to judge. News that demeans a person tends to spread quickly, people, friends too, like to read about all the sordid details, as if the reporter assigned was there in that bedroom and taking dictation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex and the act of pleasure seeking is a commonality in high school, hormones run high, and if not caught doing it, all who try and learn go one to try, do, and enjoy life. This is where I in my life path came to a halt. The newspapers stated the needs of the public. The school principle added his two cents, he expelling me in my senior year, forcing me to take the year over again, humiliated then into some sort of social submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs defamed and forced out of school early, not allowed to do home study, not allowed to graduate, everything that seemed so well planned fell apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily and friends began judging without asking, and for this reason, dear Mom thought it wise for her son to do what his grandfather did to turn his wayward son into a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA family argument ensued for several weeks until Mom stood her ground and forced that nerd son to agree. She argued about sending me to live with her Uncle Ned. I wanted nothing to do with our family eccentric, that crotchety old Uncle Ned, he never venturing away from his small farm, never coming to visit us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom on various holidays went to pay her elderly Uncle a visit, she staying there for a whole day, not returning home until late at night. I worried about Mom, as when she returned home she always smelled vile, as sweaty, and had the scent of animals about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Ned was rarely mentioned by anyone of the other aunts and uncles, as if he like I was a family outcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProper then when mom came to me and forcibly informed me of my change of residence, me going to spend all summer with Uncle Ned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdmond \u201cNed\u201d Flycatcher is what I read his name printed boldly on the rural postal box setting at the end of his long driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a kooky last name that sticks still in the mind, and says a lot about what he did, doing more than operating a small farm, he was a fly catcher! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlies as those in a family that were a pest, he would capture and with time change attitudes, giving direction, the pest would return home different than when they had left. No more would they flutter about in trouble or making problems, but from what mom told about her uncle, he was a man among men, a rare commodity, someone I would learn to trust as he would teach the basics of what is life.<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

My dad, was attending then the university at Laramie, but for what reason he was there seemed then as undecided. A visit to Uncle Ned changed all that, as he told of my father learning to respect his elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom told weird stories about her Uncle, as she thought of him as a crackpot, a nasty old man. What Mom told was how my Dad acted as leaving his wife and family disgraced, but he changed Mom said, after meeting Uncle Ned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom did all the introductions, she talking, as explaining to Uncle Ned as of how her son was lacking in sex education matters, the fault she blamed on the lacking of a father figure, that took all the blame. She made me stand there as she told the established story of how a foolhardy son did turn to fondling, finding the answers of life with a pretty girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt quite embarrassing to say the least, was not allowed to speak while Mom did the talking. Uncle Ned then shook my hand as if assuring his nephew, I would do well by doing what mom and he agreed, even if in fact neither of them asked my opinion on anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWholly unexpected, as fortunately when mom drove away and left me there, Uncle Ned said little about my past, and suggested I walk around the farm to get my bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I had expected of Uncle Ned was what mother thought of him, he as an elderly old codger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle was the complete opposite of what I was led to expect. He was in his late seventies, but well dressed, drove a convertible sports car and had several other vehicles he used for farm business activities. He would ride a fiery stallion he named \u201cHostile Warrior\u201d, and had tagged to the walls of his kitchen many a county fair ribbons for bull riding, calf roping; some as recent as dated from one year previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly friendly, as considering all mom ever said of what her son did, Uncle Ned made no direct mentioning of it, but thought it a nice gesture that I have the same bedroom that my father had, when he was there for his visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room I saw pictures everywhere, a montage of wondrous years when an equally foolish son was at home and mimicked a loving father in all he accomplished. The room was untouched since that terrible day when at the last day of the Vietnam War, a stray bullet killed Uncle Ned's son, and ended his family heritage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyeing of the many pictures told much. I had a cousin I never knew, he older but from what all was there to remind and be remembered, I felt as if I had met a fine form of a young man.</font></span></div></div>",

Given a grand tour, while looking around I saw there that elegant red brick house and the farm buildings, they had aluminum siding, metal roofs, and not a scratch or dent anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon noticed was a black horse acting as if excited or nervous, Uncle introduced me to what he said to be a black devil in the form of a stallion horse. He told how they rode together every morning, and doing so went for a personal communing with all nature as they crossed few miles of open range. I was informed nicely but commanded to stay away from this one horse, Uncle alone was the only human the animal trusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarm life is different than living city style, as with an late afternoon dinner time means you go to bed just after sundown. Early to bed and early to rise makes a young man alert and hungry. Come the morning of the first full day at the farm began with hearing the voice of Mrs. Tweedy. She came to awaken the young guest. A good friend to Uncle Ned, she would arrive in the early morning hours to gather chicken eggs and clean, box, and sell them on a sales route. She as uncle called her was an old gal friend, she would make us breakfast, and once served would bid us goodbye and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat nervous misgivings there were from mom grumbling about that nasty old man and of living out in the boondocks of Wyoming, she had her son expecting something terrible lurked waiting. Expected to have chores assigned, Uncle said he had an appointment with some men, as he then mounted and raced off across the back pasture on his A.T.C. Ultimately I learned he had a fence needing repair and went to manage the men doing the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis leaving me there and alone presented time to look around, as wandering became more like snooping into the affairs of Uncle Ned, me wondering if he had some he would like to keep buried. I entered one barn, the larger of two; I discovered it had a basement lower level. A stairway built off to one side of the main floor of the barn, lead me down into the dank, humid darkness. A flashlight left hung on a nail served well, as if used too by uncle, once in hand it helped to see down the dark stairway and of what all might be in the basement. Meandering about, I noticed a steel door, and opening it there was a room or office, it having books, pictures, a desk, chairs, and many trophies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the room and looking around, I saw a blinking red light which marked where to find a light switch. A flick of the switch and the lights glowed brightly. In the center of the room set a cherry wood desk as if it were the primary reason for the room being there. Several bookcases stood with accounting ledges and various other books. Trophies and blue, red, and gold ribbons abounded the walls, telling of awards given for quality animals bred by uncle on his farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking was to begin to admire a man that mother thought was a recluse eccentric old codger. He seemed anything but of what she thought.<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Peering inside, the light there came on with the opening of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a dusty collection of racks and wooden pegs holding or hung on them were all sorts of leather strapping, harnesses for horses, halters, bridles, and collars galore, as standing on end in one corner was the neck yoke for an Ox..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterest was peaking, as becoming inquisitive did begin to poke about, the desk set coated over with the sifted dust and hay that came down from the barn floor above. Intrigued with what might be in the drawers, I did open the top right hand drawer. There filling the length and width of the drawer, lay a book. Lifting the heavy book out of the snugly fitted drawer, and placing it on the desk, flipped it open beginning with the front cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the first page of this book or ledger, as written in broad print from a quill pen and ink said, \u201cGranted unto friend Ned be the power to decide and bring on change for any reason!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping one page after another, I stood there mesmerized seeing there a photo of that black stallion, he the one uncle warned me not to go near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaging further, was an index that had a detailed example of what each line of information represented. As reading from top of a page to the bottom last line written told of varied animal breeds, a date, a name of each animal, the names of farms, ranchers, or scientific companies where those animals were sent for leased breeding, or sold. As noted were the mention of what became of the animals Uncle Ned had or held for an owner/donor, even shown was the dates the animal finally died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on to the next page it had a pasted photo and below it was information written about the animal. A quick look at the book, it had page guides, owing to sections of the book dealing with alphabetized breeds of animals as if the ledger was a history book about what uncle did during his life working and owning a farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book sparked a strange kind of interest, and taking a seat there in the swivel chair, I began to page through and look at photos as well read what was written in the book. Beginning with the tabbed section on cattle, I looked at a picture of a large bull. In generality what was written about him began with a name. The name was not some singular name as given to a pet, but a name as if a personal name; something already did not seem right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date there as to when the animal must have arrived here on the farm, and behind that as if a memo some six months later was another date. Dated, 06-11-49 as written, and the name of the bull, he being returned happily to his grateful parents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping a page there was another photo of a bull, this one looking as if smaller, more compact, all black. Here too another name, a date and then a date of some four years later, along with a note the animal was leased to the Wilson farm for breeding purposes, but by accident they sold it along with the herd serviced, all sent to a feedlot operative and slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping next page and several more, there was a grouping of bulls, no cows. These bulls were red with white markings, and the photos of them I noted they had in a couple, brass rings poked in the bridge of the bull nostrils. Named bulls on these pages that had ringed noses made odd mention as of the date arrived, but no date when sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ninstead a notation of the implied personality decided as preferable to liking farm life and asked not to ever return home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther notations as for this bull there was a complied record of numbers of sired calves, all of the Hereford breed. Paging on and reading about so many animals and their owners, a rare few animals remained with uncle for more than six months. In the section dealing with goats, a pair of them were at the farm but just for a month, and then notated they were reluctantly relinquished back to the donors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCattle, Capra, Equine, the breeds and list numbered maybe close to a thousand animals, but so many and seemingly in the past twenty-four years. The oddity of the number of animals being as Uncle Ned was born at the farm owned there by his father, residing as working and since owning it, he was in age some seventy years old. Why all these animal trades and leasing for the more recent and previous years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and walking around the room, I took note of some pictures hanging up were of the same animals a named in the big book. I took note of breeds and names previously mentioned near the photo of the animal, had written again as of which harness, halter, bridle, or odd apparatus was primarily used to keep those altered under control. Strange that certain animal pictures were when studied and then compared to the photos that were as well hung on the wall, the larger a framed picture of an animal, defined it as if they were really exceptional or especially dear to the heart of Uncle Ned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne took special attention, that of a large Hereford red bull, with a tag label placed under the glass, it read, \u201cNorton proud to serve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing closely the photo and so noted the large leather strap hung around the bullish neck, the same strap and bull bell as one setting on a shelf there in the room. Walking to where the neck halter lay next to the brass bell, with some exertion, I did pick it up. Holding up the broad leather strap, it like a collar, thought for a fleeting moment to put it over my shoulders and around the neck to see as feel what it might be like to wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking then back to the desk and plopping into the chair by it, did mumble aloud, <b><i>\"This does not make any sense!\"</i></b><br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

That very halter you thought to try and wear was what blessed him to become a fine purebred, Polled Hereford bull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in his new embodiment being that bull, he gave of his spirit the fullest of any endeavor, breeding well with all. He was a great sire and found a sense of fulfillment from being near with cows.

I asking if what he said was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes,\"</i> he responded calmly, as if what would be a magical miracle were an everyday occurrence there on his farm. His answer made for more wonderment and a feeling of apprehension of remaining there with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then you would like your nephew better if he was to wishfully want to wear this, and from hanging it around the neck it somehow would do the changing to me of becoming a Hereford bull too?</i>\" I asked of Uncle with an uncommon boldness, the story as spun seemed too fairy tale to be anything real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Similar of such, it was what your mother wanted for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad came for a visit and he took his turn some many years past.

Then as if patronizing me, he donned a draft horse halter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly and with the wearing, he after the time required for his body of making the change a reality, he resided here on the farm. Just the span of one year and he was begging, asking rather nicely to return to being his human self. His lifestyle and the trials of living as does a horse helped him to know best what he wanted for a proper future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew then both sides of the fence and that helped him to excel in life from learning the raw basic needs as he worked that one year as a draft horse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother was quick to decide about you after that foolish romp with the girl. It was a week later when she was at his wits end.

I decided then that Uncle Ned was some kind of nut-case, I had the momentary thought to run out the room, up the stairs, and get to where if needed, one could run and evade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the presence of my mind, Uncle slammed shut the room door, as turned and looking with a cold stare, sent the fear of the devil into me, his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>This is not the stupidity of an old man, but it is real, and if by\u2026 taking of this pony halter and dared to put it lightly over your head, you will feel the power that be, they are here, and can force fit it as if you were born to wear it for your entire life.</i>\u201d Uncle Ned said, as he holding up a small leather strap made halter, stood there offering for his gullible nephew to slip it on and over a foolish head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought this was some sort of testing, seeing if the nephew would do as told when told, the sense of humiliation for having to put it on stopped the wish to do as asked. Backing away from Uncle, the desk got in the way, trapped as Uncle approached, I stood there with eyes closed, as shaking angered hands slipped the halter then into place, it sent a shiver of shame down the spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes closed the sudden dreamy scene was of horse and ponies standing in a corral and to one corner of the pen were two horses going at it, mating with such brutality, that seeing it made for a feeling of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vision and the sense of personal dread left when Uncle had not let go of the halter, but holding it still, he lifted it up and over, off from the head, I then saw the scene seen, by the previous wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You saw as what she did, this halter last worn by Gracie, she your second cousin, as came from Denver to live here for two years. Had she remained a pony mare, she might well have stayed here longer. The stallion mating in the scene was a real born stud. He is here still, used as a stud to breed with mares, mares being born as mares, or humans changed and living as mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Gracie stood there in fright and became the next conquest of the stallion, she once impregnated, it would be necessary for her to remain a mare through foaling time, and live as a mare mothering her offspring with teats and guidance until the colt or filly were weaned and able to live by grazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dire situation might well, or would add to her life here, being as is a pony mare would last two more years, an eternity to someone changed. Worse, might be that she would like the experience of mating with the stud, and after her time of mothering she would allow the stud to impregnate her a second time; such would assuredly force her to remain a mare the rest of her natural life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natural life for a mare might be twenty years, but for those changed and deciding to remain an animal, they live the biblical promise. As promised, to live for three score and ten years minimal, that as seventy and more years as what they became.\u201d </i>Uncle explaining, his story seemed woven with logic over time, sounded possible if not real, or real to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot believing yet the spun story, but playing along with the situation, I did ask of Uncle, \"<i>So say by your first choice that with putting on then that big belt and the brass cow bell, you would want for your nephew to become then a prize bull</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle then began acting as nervous, he said, \"<i>If that be your choice, if you would like to become a bull, your course of living like one would last for at least three months. Next would come then a time when a changeling is required to give an answering of yes it was pleasing, or no, telling of your being a bull as disagreeable with your expectations. Once asked and so said, then comes the need to return, as this takes time after the choosing, more then of what would be your testing of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone changed begin as if full grown when first becoming like an animal. They need time to grow and the body to gain bulk. As starting like a yearling size of bull, three months would bring on the size and passions of being a mature bull. Once if after having mated a cow, the ritual done, the choice then is as made, a bull would you need remain for three months more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf decided then at six months to return then to being human it is possible to support a return to your human self. Ah, but be warned, that sexual behavior as of a sire animal is the crux. As from living on longer as or even without knowingly accepting the idea, comes then the fact of permanency, unchangeable, living your full life as then an animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn example, if once you become say a bull, the natural instincts begin to put pressure on your thinking and reasoning process. The beastly lusts excite and build intent for to procreate your new species. This in turn drains your human ability to reason and learn. Life takes on a bland sense of meaning, an enrichment of your want for greater sensation and sexual pleasuring tends to make the return to human existence, seem ridiculous, and hardy worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt certain times to come, the enchantment has limits, these when approached your mentality would return, able to think, reason, and understand your present situation you need then to choose. Ask then to return to being human, or if ignore the question poised and you walk away, the being an animal continues,\"</i> explained Uncle, the urgency of deciding then added a sense of urgency to his tone of voice as if an epic moment in time.<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

This seemed to defuse the urgency of deciding, and Uncle opened the door to the room, motioning for his nephew to walk out, take leave, or run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out and then up to some sense of freedom, the wonder of what all i had heard as do or become, my living with Uncle seemed more than strange a place to think and decide the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking aimlessly and returning for supper, it was quiet through the meal, and after when washing the dishes. Nothing said, but we were thinking, the looks coming from Uncle made my blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNine o\u2019clock and to bed we who be farmers do go, for a wondering nephew and son of my mother lay in bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking hard for the first time in his entire life. As of why but the sight of seeing such a strange and vivid vision, it happening when as Uncle had laid so slightly that pony halter over the head of his undecided, a deciding nephew. So real the scene, the sensations, feeling as if from being nervous like was Gracie, felt her tail flicking, whisking at furry buttocks, she as if a naked animal there in the hot sunshine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivid in the extreme and charming in a way never thought about, the idea of becoming as is an animal and living of life that way. The thinking of the feelings added to the sense of arousal as what Allan felt like when a bull, or being as might a pony stallion and wanting to mate with a mare. The more the thoughts of it all made a want to try a halter or harness on at a personal and private time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear midnight and sneaking out of bed, I dressed, and was out the house walking to the barn. Aroused so stiff by the anxious feeling, walking became staggering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the barn, down the stairs, flashlight in hand, did open the tact room door and went inside. Looking around, saw a light switch and it lighted the room in a yellow glow of a dust-coated light bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalter, bridles, harnesses, broad leather straps, some with bells, some without, all hung neatly on pegs, and above each were the names to those who wore them, and of when they did with date and years worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short while there at the farm I had seen then how bulls are and of horses mill about but remain close to their respective small herd. As Uncle mentioned of, he had some goats and sheep, but no pigs. The thought of what would wear what from the room, as from memory, pigs never wore anything of straps made of leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking and taking a visual inventory did note a wood peg and it having looped around it was hinged brass rings. The rings where they could open had sharp points that when pinched together, acted as would a scissors. \u201c<b>Nose rings</b>, as what went into the bridge of the nostrils and nose of a bull, used to control it when at show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerbally recounting what having seen, one of the bulls there at the barn, he trussed up for a washing, had a rope looped through the nose ring holding him tight and captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulls, cattle did not offer any interest as a fantasy for being like one, the thought of becoming a pony might. If allowed the choice of being a stallion and not a mare, the desire to retain being male seemed a primary desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the halters saw one that with its shiny black straps appeared as if used mostly when at show, at the county fair, or in competition, this allured in a way the others did not!</font></span></div></div>",

The leather straps first touching the top of the head filled the mind\u2019s eyes with a stunning vision. Turning of the head to look around, peered along sleek black colored flanks to a short but busy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA careful gaze down saw there forelegs and hoofs, while the longing increased with a want to let the halter drop into place, and accept being then what it would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cA Hackney is a coach horse, that was the halter to the one and the only such horse I ever had here on the farm. He, Daniel, made for a fine sulky horse. He won many races and lived in his stallion form for thirty-seven years. Sadly, he died from injuries given him by an angry mare, she a changer as was he, but she angry at the world and those living in it.\u201d</i> Said Uncle, he then in the doorway to the room, seemed intent but willing to let his nephew make the choice of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back at Uncle and the first thought to go along with his joke, I did laugh. A short-lived bit of humor as while seeing Uncle, saw as well what did Daniel when he had the halter strapped tight to his horse head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill undecided, I lifted up and removing the halter ceased the visual scene of being as was Daniel, when he was as horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting it back on the wooden peg, Uncle seemed saddened by the return of it to the peg, as if chosen by his nephew he would like it, and like having again another horse on his farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word of asking, I then pointed to various halters, some being bridles with bits a part of them. Uncle said nothing, he just stood by and watched, ready to answer any questions asked. A pointing at the nose rings stacked on a peg, each a different size from the other. The removal of a small ring from off the peg of one seemed to sadden Uncle. As I held the ring it was smaller in size but the metal looked more like piano wire bent into a circle. it was a small ring compared to the bottom of the stack of enlarging rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>Beware Nephew,</b> said Uncle, \"As all the other nose rings setting on that wood peg were for use on cattle, the one you are holding, I needed to use on unruly pig boar. He arrived here being a railroad bum, and after trying to steal from me, I thought of him being a pig as proper; but what he became was a brute beast, going crazy wild, as his body and lifestyle of being as a pig made a dangerous and vile animal mad at all the world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Oh really, Uncle Ned,\" </i></b>I said, grinning as wondering what Uncle would say or do if I then opening wide the ring, did lift it as begin to place it into my nose, I looked at Uncle to see if he would do the dishonor and do the closure of it into a locked position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>STOP Nephew</b>, you do that, as you close and lock it tight into your nose you do two things.

I inhaled with the thought to scream again, what began sounding like a human in pain, but finished with a squeal. Horrid feelings surged throughout my head, neck, as throughout my body and out into arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trailing fading stunned word that was as a <b><i>\u201cWhat,\u201d</i></b> turned to a grunting disdained sound as if a pig felt it as dishonored somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Uncle, he stepped close, took hold of aching shoulders and hoisted me to again stand uprightly. He summarily pushing, urged me to walk along. We went upstairs and directly to the empty hog pen. He said nothing, but began unbuttoning what his nephew wore, as soon a young male human stood naked in a pen, knowing his body was in the throngs of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the world of color dimmed to dark shadows of either black or white. In moments that followed, by blinking of eyes the more vivid color separation dulled to varied shades of grays and white. A reached out hand to beg for sympathy saw an arm changing to be a fore leg with cloven hoofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding and knowing some of what had begun, the stomach turned as super came up, puking from the terror begun by denial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunched over forward the feelings suggested a better way to stand was on all fours. Suggested, but not wanted, as by doing so would give in and standing in that manner might rush the change to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, trying to beg for help, the words set on the tip of the changing tongue, seemed to float off into the far recesses of a degrading brain. The feeling of as the bodily muscles grew stronger, expanding, turning a foolish eighteen year-old into soon a male pig, as if born of swine, maturing quickly to become then a Boar. Eyes wide, did but watch in some sense of horror and fantasy as sharp, coarse feeling bristles erupted out the darkening coloration to my skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning, I did stroke the changing foreleg across the thickening pelt of piggy bristles, the sensation not as frightening as it was arousing and oddly sensual. Big oval shaped ears, they all bristles too, began to move, mobile they could flick and flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror turned to a sense of humor knowing that the change and digression of body and mind would be then lasting for years to come, if Uncle told the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing then as a bucket of slurry slopped into a trough, Uncle stood there, pointing, the pig me then seeing his meal sauntered toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what to a pig is his food, I reacted as a raving beast feeling a great hunger, I shuffled to the trough, feeling like dying of hunger, the slop tasted fair, it filled an aching belly, giving aid to changes, growth, and maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was not without its sensual delights, as my maleness parts gained in size, length, and a much higher level of sensation. I felt then thee growth of a sheath, as huge testes bloomed huge, set more behind than between my hind legs. My maleness grew with raw passions, felt as pumping up my expectations for mating, breeding, as would a boar to a sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds, seemed as hours, watching as seeing of everything change in continuous motion, until near the end was grown a tail, it flicked and wiggled, tickling at a bare and open anus. This too was a sensation offering great wonder and an odd sort of delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Ned stood there and watched silently, helping when there was a problem for the changing. His warm hands were as a friendly note, applying a oily salve to the sheath. \"Hold still, this It an ointment what will remove all Christian resemblance of being human, deforming the circumcision to make a corkscrew shape of what was male and human.\"</font></span></div></div>",

He stood there eyeing his new Boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle said then, \"<i><b>Nephew you look just fine</b>, a true and pure of breed Berkshire hog boar is the new you, as stands here wanting, feeling many urges to begin his life. I promise to you, by me keeping you in the barn for a couple of months might defuse the power of this spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you away from scents and smells of other farm animals might give you some time to decide if this is right for you. Your body needs tending, feeding and gaining mass. You need help learning how to eat, and of grazing, consuming fodder; the fodder is the worst, I shall blend it with molasses until you get accustomed to the sour flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Remember Nephew </b>of your primary task is to learn and understand life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you relax and become then as a true Boar, your life to come will be that of a crude pig.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clipping, attached a rope/rein to the nose ring, giving it a slight tug, set a still maturing male pig to learn how to walk, me trotting on four legs, having cloven hoofs, and doing whatever my owner wanted. I was taken to the barn, and placed as put into pen there, was alone, did sniff the sweet smell of straw covering the floor, it seemed then so nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gallon bucket of water stood placed by the door and with it a tub full of raw grains for me to munch. I did eat and drink often until learning better as how to eat as a pig should. Alert to my surroundings, with little to do as keep my thinking along human ideals, time and my changed nature did guide a lazy pig to wander his pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went well and learning the piggish ways came quickly. Held inside the hot barn, I had found my life there to be a meaningless, as well mindless of action. Life slipped by as one day while groping in the trough, I grunting did cast a wary eye too look and see there dear Uncle Ned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there with a smile, pointing at me, as next to him stood then Mom, she with a scowl on her face told of great misgivings for me, who once was as her son.</font></span></div></div>",

I watched as Mom stepped close to the pigpen and looked at what became of her son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe though felt little love for mom, but held inside my mind I stood there wishing for some sows to tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle saw Mom's forceful reaction in a different light, as he walked away only to return moments later after an interminable amount of motherly silence, Uncle returned, as he opened my pen gate, letting into the pen two hearty big sows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>These or they were born as pigs, both are sows and well, they are willing to mate. You have not had the experience yet, that of breeding and mating with your own breed. You need to try it doing pig style, learning how best to mount, holding her in place, and inserting that shaft like a fine big boar.</i>\u201d Uncle said as he suggested what to then was something forbidden, as from doing it, the breeding, mating would seal the future and his nephew might remain as a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting and squealing the anxious many tries met with failures. The sows would walk away, forcing me to fall harshly to all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Uncle and Mom had given up with watching and walked away, leaving me to continue trying, learning a technique for breeding with sows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened finally near sundown, when one of the two sows seemed tired from my trying an allowed the insertion. Her sullen attitude offered a possible find to the sensual sensation so enthralling. I did as nature and swine instinct suggested to a weary mind, and it helped to the mounting, and of blowing three fired loads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy snorting from the thrills felt, as happened again in the morning, Uncle returned and he opened the pen gate. I froze scared with a sense of horror, wondering what Uncle Ned had as a plan for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two sows needed no urging, they ran from the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get going, you have a date with fate or folly,\" Uncle said, as I then followed the sows, we ran out the pen, along a tightly fenced run, what opened to a wide pasture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" I was surprised from being released, sent with the two sows to join then a herd of sows. Sows, sows, and more sows all with but one Boar; me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle felt the need for me to know all of what it is to being a hog and boar among a herd of sows. The sows sniffed at me their one boar, as I stood gawking there and then seeing numerous pigs of varied sizes, but all were sows!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201c<b>No</b>, he shall doom and damn himself with the sows.\u201d</i> Said a worried mother, as I her son did rush after the herd of sows. I later thought and suspected that mom did turn around and walked away, never to return to see how her son did with having a herd of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing among a herd of sows made it easy to lose all track of time, living, as does a Boar the need for a clock is next to useless. It was in the late afternoon as with lying in the mud near our herd of sows, we shaded from the hot sun, laid there lounging, I saw Uncle coming to visit. He kneeling down and petting stroked my head covered with coarse bristles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<b>It is again a time for the Nephew to decide</b>, six months now, as I need to know, be you still want the life of a pig boar, or are you ready to be as a man,\" </i> Uncle Ned did ask?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up from out of the warm mud, and with a cocking of the head only slightly did ogle an eye up at him, giving to thoughts for a short minute. Then with the usual struggle to hoist or turn the bulk pig body, turned the head and giving a look at a lovely sow, she stood as willing and ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was long hence a virgin, as standing there wanted of her boar some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look to Uncle, he watching, saw as his large, black, mature boar trotted to the young female, he mounting her, had a quick erection, my maleness from practice had become massive, did squiggle in and slid home. As done with the true rough and tough boar like manner, two twists and a few thrusts helped blow the load, it spewed into that sow, and a boar gave a wink of satisfaction to Uncle Ned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle stood near the pasture fence, a smirked smile told me he knew, and announced while his nephew could still understand him, he said, \"<i><b>I see,</b> well then you may continue on as a boar until next year. I will call your mother and explain, unlike so many others, you seem to have found your place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might be pleased, as with the coming of our County Fair, I plan to loan you for sire, and there are many more sows in the county! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce judged for your bulk and virility, you shall be the prime sire boar for show, and used to sire my herd and many others, gifting you lots of fun in the sun!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed slowly, as three years later, what became real then felt so right and even proper as the Fair Judge, poked with his sharp stick, urging a big boar to move as he directed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had sunk mentally to where any enjoying when at the Fair, placed in a box stall for three nights, to say I felt bored as a boar, left me as horny. As what when in the night should two girls sneak in late, they dared at entering that stall, they came to pet, feel my bristles and surprising me, fondled me, arousing my boar corkscrew. I as much longed to rut them but they made the better decision as not to let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sensuous night of fondled frolicking, Uncle arrived mid-day, talking with other men about his plans to loan out his prizewinner boar as promised. Me, his piggish Nephew by then into his third year, began moving from to farm. Vivid are the memories, remembered of Uncle telling how a Boar discover pleasure, and mounting older sows, their tough and leather like vulva took some toll on sensual boar flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rare as occasional need to lick it helped, but it toughened, making the sensual feelings less and the lusting passion the driving force in his life to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeary from boar duties, my seeing Uncle coming, he leading a woman with him, I recalled it must be that time again, seeing as Uncle coming again to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood nearby but not real close, as she a woman stood behind him. I listened and how, but understood what all Uncle Ned told to she, who I barely could recall as being my mother. Uncle told of my duty and the self satisfaction his prize Boar having done well. I had made him richer, as then he posed the same ole' question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stood wringing her hands in nervous frustration; no doubt, a mother knows of what was to do and renew. Uncle asked again that fated question, while Mom chimed in as well, both posed the question, if a son and nephew shall ever want to return to living a human life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother begged for me to consider, as from the longer amount of time spent in animal form, the greater the difficulty it is to return to be again human. All sense of any humiliation had gone due to my living naked to the world and the elements makes a body tough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRough is the life of a boar, sex is the one reason to keep a boar alive, and alive is what it felt like being as, and breeding with hundreds of sows during any year. The pleading of that loving mother figure who sent me to Uncle is beginning to stem the break between us, and having tried, exceeded, and enjoyed, maybe it was time to decide and return to living in a socially acceptable manner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mind whirled, but as a man, would there be as many females just as willing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deciding of the future was at hand; t<b>o what End, is this</b>\u2026.</font></span></div></div>",
