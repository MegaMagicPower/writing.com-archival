However, in your state of grogginess, you couldn't seem to make out where you were, and your vision was still blurry even after rubbing your eyes. It was like this for a few minutes and you started to get a little worried, but soon your vision finally started to focus, slowly but surely. As your vision started coming back, something felt really off. Not just what you could make out, but how you felt. There seem to be a strong draft, which was unusual since you didn't leave the window open; even if you had, that was some strong wind. Not only that, but you weren't even on your bed, that much was obvious from the surface you were laying on. Your senses started to come back, and you could finally make out where you were. And what you saw surprised you, everything was massive! When you looked at yourself compared to everything else, you were sure your height was _________ scaled to your surroundings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow small did you become? </span></div></div>",

Still, it was incredibly snugly, it made sense that you wouldn't have woken up during your transformation seeing as this would've made you sleep through anything. You felt the urge to go back to sleep, as if you just pressed snooze on the alarm and begged for just 5 more minutes. You lied back onto the fur and let it envelope you with it's warmth, as you buried your face into the world's most cozy field. But as you rested your head, you could've sworn you heard a heartbeat coming from underneath you. In fact, when you listened more closely, you heard what sounded like inhales and exhales of breath. What the hell? You heard a booming voice whisper \"It's awake!\" What kind of person would have such an incredibly powerful voice? It re-vibrated throughout your entire body, it didn't hurt your hearing, but it was like a sound wave passed through you. Either this person had to be really loud or they would have to be... a very... large... person... OH FUCK! You started putting the pieces together, the fur, the breathing, the heartbeat, they weren't just loud, you were on their gigantic body! Wait, this was no person; you understood them but you were sure as hell this wasn't just any person, this was a massive beast, a monster. You slowly raised your head to look at where this voice came from, something that took all your courage and will to force yourself to do. You subconsciously tightened your grip onto the fur in your hands, your breathing spiked into panting, and a hot itchy sensation spread across your back and injected itself into the rest of your body. God you wish you didn't have to do this, but you needed to know if there was some chance of escape. As it's face came into view, you saw the shape of it's muzzle and it's teeth, they were... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> A wolf! Not only that, a werewolf! One with a long snout, curly and grey head fur, wide eyes, and small pupils. There's something so human about him it's eerie, you knew he was some sort a werewolf as soon as he looked at you. And by the looks of it, you were on his shirtless chest. \"What kind of bug are you?\" the wolf said in a gentle tone, but because of his size, reverberated throughout your body once again. He brought his hand up to you to pick you up with his finger, but as soon as you saw those monolithic deadly claws you panicked and screamed. \"H-Ha-HAAAAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n Your scream startled the wolf as he involuntarily sprung upwards, sending you falling off his chest and onto the bed. Now's your chance to get away you thought. You trudged your way through the memory foam mattress and blanket as fast as you could, but it was hard because the mattress just kept pulling you in, but you eventually ended up at the edge of the bed. Below you was a steep drop, you weren't even sure that you would survive a fall like that, but it was either risk falling to death or being eaten alive by this wolf. You hesitated for awhile, which gave the wolf enough time to repose and look frantically for you, and then spot you. <br>\r\n \"Wait!\" he yelled, \"don't run away!\"<br>\r\n Whatever he said didn't matter as it took just one look at his fangs to send shivers down your spine, you were paralyzed yet again and couldn't force yourself to move. You could only shift your body in his direction and watch as the wolf slowly encroached on you. Subconsciously, you crawled backwards to get away from him. As his hand approached you, you shook your head from side to side as if pleading, with a face of pure desperation and terror. You seemingly had forgotten your predicament; while your hand looked for a surface to plant itself onto, it found nothing but thin air. Your weight shifted forward and off the bed and caused you to be sent into free-fall. You yelped a pathetic cry as you made your way down, from there time just seemed to slow down. You couldn't really think of anything, you just knew that this was the end, you couldn't even make a reaction. In your head, dying like this didn't bother you, at the very least you wouldn't suffer being chewed like bubble gum or swallowed whole only to suffocate and burn inside a giant werewolf's stomach. Just as quickly, the Wolf's lighting fast reactions caused him to leap over the bed and catch you with his hand. \"UMPH!!\"<br>\r\n You grunted as you hit some sort of surface, having opened your eyes to see yourself in the center of the Wolf's fluffy but stiff palm, surrounded by his claws. You shot your head upwards and saw the Wolf's ears peak out over the edge of the bed. His face peeked into view as he gave a sigh of relief and smiled. However, what you saw was the satisfaction of a predator who caught his next meal. No, no, no! You would've rather died by the fall! If you had landed on your head you would've died quickly. But now you were at the mercy of this wolf; he was surely sadistic, you were sure that he would keep you alive for as long as possible to torture you for his pleasure. No, you weren't going to be kept alive in agony by some sick werewolf, it still wasn't too late! You made another run for it, this time without hesitation as you aimed to go into another free-fall. This wolf must've sensed your fear, and therefore your intentions; he was too fast for you and his thumb swiftly pinned you against his palm. He put his other hand over the one that was pinning you down, and you were shrouded in darkness. Your heart was beating so fast you would've surely passed out, you got so lightheaded you began to cry. Unbeknownst to you, the Wolf was just trying to keep you safe and calm you down. He had read somewhere that the old technique to calming a panicking bird was to place a towel or bag over it's head to block it's vision, then the bird would naturally calm as it was out of the sight of predators. The wolf remained silent for several minutes as he waited for you to calm down, unable to see you. He slowly raised his hand to see you curled into fetal position as you sniffed and sobbed. Poor thing he thought, he was used to scaring herbivores accidentally before, but he never sacred anyone this badly. Just as he was about to say something he cut himself off, a unique and new scent caught his attention. It was coming from you; it wasn't a bad smell, just unique. Realizing this scent to be yours, he started to sniff you tenderly. This only frightened you even further, you just couldn't take it anymore. \"P-Please!\" you shouted, surprising the wolf. <br>\r\n \"Please, if you're going to eat me just kill me quickly! Bite off my head first! I just don't want to suffer, please!\"<br>\r\n The Wolf contemplated what to say, clearly you were scared of him, seeing as you were just a seemingly sentient bug trapped by a massive predator. \"Well... Even if I did eat you, I wouldn't really feel anything if I'm being honest... Mr.Talking Bug.\" <br>\r\n He acknowledged to himself that that was a stupid way to try to calm you down; he noticed your fear wasn't quelled either, confirming his suspicion. So he tried a different approach. Once again his finger approached you, he was being even more careful than he was before to be gentle with you. He lifted you from your arms and onto your feet, you didn't want to stare him in the eyes so you just looked away as he spoke to you. \"I um... Don't want to eat you anyways, I wouldn't be able to ever let go of the guilt if I did.... I-In fact it's not even legal for carnivores to eat meat, even if you are a bug.\" <br>\r\n This did stow you fear by a decent margin. \"S-So, you promise you won't eat me?\" you said as you wiped away your tears with your sleeve.<br>\r\n \"Of course!\" he said.<br>\r\n This didn't satisfy you though. \"S-Say you promise! I won't t-trust you if you don't promise!\" you demanded. <br>\r\n You felt pretty stupid for making demands, it's not like you have much of a choice either way. But whatever it's worth, you'd like to hear it anyway. The Wolf was thinking the exact same thing, but still wanted you to trust him so you wouldn't hurt yourself. Although he is nice, you still are a bug he's never seen before, and a talking one at that! \"I promise I won't eat you. I'll even promise to keep you safe!\" he said. <br>\r\n \"O-Okay... Sound- Sounds like a deal Mr.Werewolf.\" you said in timid voice. <br>\r\n \"Uh, do you mean Grey Wolf? I guess that doesn't really matter...\" He said. <br>\r\n He stuck his claw out to you as a greeting, which made you flinch. \"My name is Legosi, I'm a grey wolf, but you can call me wer- whatever it was you called me... If you want I mean.\"<br>\r\n He had an awkward grin, but this time it really seemed like he was doing his best not to scare you. You looked him in the eyes despite still being intimated to do so. You grabbed his claw with both of your tiny hands and shook it. 'My name-.. You can call me Beau... Beau the human! N-Nice to meet you Mr.Lego-... Lego-...? Lego-\"<br>\r\n \"Legosi, yes that's it, you have it.\" he interrupted as he could sense you were trying too hard to be polite. <br>\r\n \"Nice to meet you, Beau. That's a cute name\" he said. <br>\r\n \"Heh... Thanks...\" you said, not sure how to take that. </span></div></div>",

I'm actually not to different from you besides the fur. Heh...\" <br>\r\n\"I thought those were clothes you were wearing, to be honest I shouldn't have assumed you were a bug. I'm sorry if that offended you.\" <br>\r\n\"N-no, don't be sorry, I don't blame you for thinking I was one. I'm just glad I met someone as gentle and nice as you.\" you said.<br>\r\n\"You... think I'm gentle? But you were crying so much there, I thought I scared you so badly that you wouldn't trust someone like me...\" Legosi said with some guilt in his voice.  <br>\r\nYou feel embarrassed being reminded how fearful and filled with emotion you were. You also feel a little bad for Legosi, you get the impression that you may not be the only one who finds him scary based on his reaction. <br>\r\n\"W-What? Pfft, of course not. I'm just a little crybaby is all. Haha.\" <br>\r\nSaying that made you bite your lip, you wouldn't consider yourself a crybaby, in fact you only cried because you genuinely thought you were gonna die. But if playing a sensitive role will make this Legosi fellow feel better, then it's best to get on his good side and get him to help you as much as you can. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I'll try to be especially gentle with you then, Beau. Are you sure I'm not scary? You can be honest...\" Legosi said.<br>\r\n\"You're like a big adorable puppy with that glum look and those puppy-dog eyes. Heh...\" You said nervously hoping not to have insulted him.  <br>\r\n\"Hah, no one has ever called me adorable other than Jack.\" Legosi thought to himself as he chuckled. <br>\r\nHis chuckle thankfully told you that he took it as a compliment.<br>\r\n\"So, Beau, what exactly is a Hu-Man? You look similar to a chimpanzee or some sort of monkey, but you don't have any fur besides that little patch on your head. You're way smaller than a mouse, but the fact you wear clothes as well as understand me means you're too smart to be a bug. Uh, please don't take any offense to that... But, what are you, where do you come from? I've never seen anything like you before.\"<br>\r\nYou assumed that this wolf simply existing meant there were others like him, but you thought they were all wolves, you were surprised to find out that there were different animals like him. <br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'm way bigger than this, I dunno how I got this small. And a human is... How do I put this? So, where I come from, you would actually be considered a half-human half-wolf hybrid; a werewolf. Does that make sense? <br>\r\n\"Oh!\" An idea had popped into Legosi's mind.<br>\r\n\"My grandpa is a komodo dragon, which makes me a hybrid. But I don't understand what you mean by human hybrid. Wouldn't I have to be part human to be a human hybrid? I don't look like you so how does that work?\"<br>\r\nYou were doubly shocked to learn that different species could have offspring together in this world, how is that possible you thought. You also should've realized sooner that everyone in this world must be a were-animal, so of course this wouldn't make sense to Legosi. <br>\r\n\"Wait, no. What I meant is your species exists in my world, but you walk on all fours instead.\" <br>\r\nLegosi's ears were drawn towards you as he became more curious<br>\r\n\"All... fours?\" He said, obviously still not getting it.<br>\r\n\"I mean, you don't wear clothes and you walk on your digits, and you don't have knees either. You're also a lot dumber than primates. UHH, N-N-NO NOT LIKE THAT I MEAN, D-DON'T TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY, PLEASE. Y-you're just less sapient than humans, hahaha...\" You said as you quickly backtracked, realizing that you called the monolithic wolf dumb. <br>\r\nLuckily, your comment seemed to go unnoticed as Legosi became lost in thought, still trying to piece together such a concept. It's likely that such an animal wouldn't even exist in this world if he's having this much trouble picturing it. <br>\r\n\"Okay, that's definitely weird, but I trust what you say. So how did you get here in the first place? If you're saying this world you come from is that different, then how did you even find your way here, and how did you get so small as you claim?\" Legosi said. <br>\r\nWith your thumb on your chin and a hand on your hip, you tried your best to recollect what might've happened. <br>\r\n\"I dunno, the last thing I remember was going to bed and then I found myself on your chest... Wait, how did I end up on your chest?\"<br>\r\nLegosi ears turn bright red, supposedly a wolf's way of blushing.<br>\r\n\"W-well... I saw you outside on the window sill, at first I thought you were a weird bug, but you didn't look normal. Y-you looked so helpless... I thought you were dead or sleeping, so I put you on my chest to see if you would warm up and wake up. I'm sorry if that's weird...\"<br>\r\n\"No, no! Not at all! Your fur is really comfy actually, I would sleep on your chest all day!\"<br>\r\nLegosi's ears were a bright tomato color at that point. <br>\r\nYou realized what you said may have made it even weirder and you immediately backtracked yet again.<br>\r\n\"W-W-WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, HAHA. Y-y-you make a great pillow is all... Not that I would want to skin you and turn you into a blanket, HAHA. Wait, no... I-...erm.\"<br>\r\nNow you blushed and became a rosy color. You decide to change topics seeing as you made the situation worse. <br>\r\n\"Do you know if there is anyway for me to get home, Legosi?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I had no idea you even existed, I don't even know how you got here, let alone that it was even possible. <br>\r\n\"Oh...\" you said. <br>\r\nA melancholic brush painted over you, although unsurprisingly you weren't too broken up about it. It's not like there was much to go back to anyways. You just wished you'd taken those opportunities and risks when you had the chance. And now you'll never be able to. You sat there in silence for little while.<br>\r\n\"Hey, little guy, it's okay...\"<br>\r\nLegosi prodded you tenderly with his finger, and although it did give you some comfort, it was hardly enough to get rid of the feelings you were having. <br>\r\n\"How about this? I-I'll help you get back in whatever way I can, that's a promise! For now you don't have anything to worry about! You have me to depend on to protect you, okay?\"<br>\r\nLegosi's words cheered you up this time. Even though you just met, he's already determined on becoming friends with you and protecting you. You decide it'd be best to lighten the mood with some questions. <br>\r\n\"So Legosi, how many others like you are there?\" <br>\r\n\"Werewolves or human-hybrids as you put it?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess hybrids.\" <br>\r\n\"There are too many to count, hundreds if not thousands, more than I could ever remember.\" he said. <br>\r\n\"Can you name a few to get me familiar?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you've already been acquainted with wolves, but generally you can separate animals into groups like canines, felines, bovines, avian, reptilian, marine, etc. Do dogs, cats, tigers, leopards, pumas, lions, hyenas, rabbits, squirrels, seals, and sheep sound familiar to you at all?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, all of these exist in my world too. Are they all like you in your world?\"<br>\r\n\"Grey wolves? Of course not.\" he retorted.<br>\r\nYou giggled at his dry humor. <br>\r\n\"Human hybrids I meant.\" <br>\r\n\"I guess you could say that.\" he chuckled. <br>\r\nYou both continued talking for several hours throughout the day as he held you securely in his palms. You think you might actually like Legoshi. Your first impression may have been rocky, but you feel safe with him. Probably because he's the only one here you've met. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
