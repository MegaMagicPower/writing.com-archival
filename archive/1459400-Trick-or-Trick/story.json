But the real question is\u2026 For whom will it be a fun night?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mark: He\u2019s 19 years old, has a blond hair and is 5\u20198\u2019\u2019. Currently, he is having the year off after his high school. He\u2019s living with his girlfriend Victoria, who he met at in their high school, in a one bedroom house. He doesn\u2019t know much about his neighbours as he only barely greeted them few times. Victoria isn\u2019t home right now as she\u2019s at work tonight, as a waitress at a local restaurant. Unfortunately, you forgot to get any candy for the kids and your plan is to pretend you aren\u2019t home\u2026Is it going to work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Victoria: She\u2019s also 19 year old, with a shoulder length red hair. She\u2019s quit short and is around 5\u20193\u2019\u2019. She\u2019s been going out with Mark for over 4 years now and it was her idea to get a house together after high school. She\u2019s at work right now and is due to be back at around midnight tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Esther and Samantha: They are 13 Year old Brunette twins from across the street. They are both pretty are around 5\u20191\u2019\u2019 and personally, it\u2019s almost impossible for you to tell them apart. They were always very friendly with you, waving their hands at you whenever possible. They are trick or treating in cute matching witch outfits and they are so petite that it\u2019s almost entrancing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Torrey: Your blonde slutty neighbour. She's only 17 but she looks much more older than that. That pretty much sums it up. She's always wearing clothing that's very revealing and few times, she tried to invite you to have a drink with her, despite the fact that she probably knows that you are living with your girlfriend. But then again, you would have fucked her if not for your girlfriend... She's in her last year at a local High School. For some unknown reason, you can see her out the window, going around Trick or Treating, in what seems to be the whole Succubus outfit, with the tail and all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kylie: She\u2019s a good friend from high school. She enjoys you and Victoria\u2019s company very much. She only lives down the street and she actually had a short fling of about 2 months back in year 8, before you got intimate with Victoria. She\u2019s pretty sexy and she\u2019s just taller than you, at around 5\u20199\u2019\u2019. Her hairs are dark black, which shines in light. She was suppose to visit you around 12 midnight as she wanted a drink with you and Victoria, celebrating the good old times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a transformation/shrink story, much like many of my other interactives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nAdditions with Wrong Grammar or Incorrect use of Capital Letters will be deleted<br>\r\nNo Male Interaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you enjoy this story, please have a read of my other interactives as well.</td>",
