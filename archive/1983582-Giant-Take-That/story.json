The club is now near empty as the Take That members are exhausted and ready to call it a night. <br>\r\nMark is on the phone to his girlfriend letting her know when he'll be back. Jason and Howard nip outside in the cool darkness by the silent entrance of the club for a smoke together, whilst Robbie is enjoying a quick glass of whisky backstage in the dressing room as Gary packs his duffel bag next to Robbie chatting as they get ready to head home. The only people apart from the group left in the club are the group's guitarist for the night packing up, their manager on his phone and brushing past the bar ready to leave, and a bar man shutting everything up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings are about to change for the group in a BIG way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknown to anyone backstage in the group dressing room is a magical growing formula drink in a regular bottle, accumulated with a bunch of things they'd be given from fans and people across the world from touring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho finds the growing formula?</span></div></div>",

Gary smiles with chatting with a laid back Robbie, sitting casually on the dressing room table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over for his Hugo Boss aftershave, deodorant and bottle of water to fit in his bag Gary sees behind a clutter of fan gifts of teddy bears, flowers and various toiletries another drink bottle. Gary chuckles, \"You drinking for all five of us tonight, lad?\" reaching for the bottle and gesturing it towards Robbie, assuming it's another alcoholic bottle to add to the collection of empties around Robbie's dressing area. Neither recognise the drink or who it belongs to. </span></div></div>",

Gary replies honestly. \"Just found out in the dressing room with the other drinks and things. Thought you might be thirsty.\" Gary examines it in his hand again, the dark colour of the liquid and foreign looking label around it, assuming it to be an expensive, foreign alcohol like liquor. \"Might be strong stuff, this\".<br>\r\nMark chuckles as he lights up a cigarette in the night breeze. \"Fuck off, I'm not drinking some toxic you found!\"<br>\r\n\"Give it here, man.\" Howard orders, reaching out as Gary hands him the bottle. The street outside is almost silent and only occasionally do people walk past, after 2 am on a weekday. <br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm the only real man here...The only real big man!\" He smiles to himself, feeling slightly proud of himself. Howard being the biggest member of the group with Jason and looking down on the others, particularly Gary and Mark. Gary, Jason and Mark don't think much of it as Howard gingerly unscrews the cap and can smell the strong odour from the bottle. Howard smiles as two attractive girls in their mid 20's stroll past, linking arms after a night out, wearing tight dresses and their long hair flowing in the breeze. Howard just smiles as they glance over their shoulder catching the eye of Howard and watching as they walk down the road, pleased with himself as they seemed to smile in his direction.<br>\r\n\"Right lads, it's been a great night but I'm going to be heading off now. See you tomorrow\". Gary breaks the silence. Howard at that point takes a sip of the bottled formula, still smiling and looking in the direction of down the street. Just as Gary turns on his heels to head back inside to the dressing room Howard abruptly starts coughing and spluttering, he holds his stomach leaning over and his world starts spinning. Gary, Mark and Jason move towards him...</span></div></div>",

It was with our drinks and stuff backstage.\" Gary replies. <br>\r\nJason takes the bottle from him in a playful manner and jokes, \"You sure this isn't turtle wax for your car?\" He unscrews the cap and sniffs inside, smelling the strong odour and grimacing. \"I think we're good, thanks, Gary. Looks like someone's trying to poison us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking anymore of it Gary turns backs and walks back through the darkened club towards his dressing room, ready to go home now after a long day. Walking through the dark club barefoot Gary doesn't see a mop clumsily left in his way as a male cleaner gets to work. Gary stumbles over the mop spilling a few drops of the formula with the cap not fastened on and gets back to his feet...</span></div></div>",

Clutching the bottle in his hand Gary glances at the guitarist on stage setting the wires away. The young guitarist in his early 20's looks up as Gary approaches him on the stage in just his boxers and hoodie with his bare chest exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate, do you fancy a drink? I don't know what's in this but you might want something strong after a heavy night. You did a cracking job tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guitarist stands up from kneeling over his guitar case on the stage floor. Maybe about two inches taller than Gary. Though he's played for the band at gigs he still feels somewhat intimidated and star struck by them, particularly someone as confident and famous as Gary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\", the guitarist says, and out of politeness takes the bottle handed to him. The mid length curly haired and goateed guitarists unscrews the bottle cap and takes a sip of the strong formula, assuming it to be a strong ale. Gary turns around and starts walking back off the stage as he hears the young guitarist gasp and let out coughs and splutters. He turns back around...</span></div></div>",

He takes another sip of his glass of whisky and soon nearly falls asleep, slumped by his mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside Howard, Jason and Mark are finishing a cigarette. Approaching towards them at the entrance comes a bouncer who was guarding the doors earlier during their performance. A hulking man of 6'8'' with a frame like John Cena, in his 30's, still wearing his work uniform; his short sleeved black short almost bursting at the seams from the size of his pumped biceps and his shirt fitting tightly against his muscular chest visible even with clothing with the outline of pecs bulging, easily dwarfing the three men who watch up as he approaches them, naturally intimidated by his physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone seen my wallet? I think I must've dropped it on shift earlier.\" The tall bouncer asked looking down at the three band members, finishing their smoke, with his booming deep voice. <br>\r\n\"Haven't seen it, I'm afraid, mate. May be an idea to ask at the bar if it was handed in\". Jason replies up to the muscly hulk. <br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll do that...Great show tonight, by the way\". With that the big bouncer ducks his head slightly under the entrance doorway and the silent band members watch as his intimidating form and well built shoulders and chest brush past them under the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom, has my wallet been handed in here?\" The big bouncer asks to the surprise of the bar man he knows, placing his huge paw-like hands on the bar counter. The skinny, slighter built young barman in his late 20's looks up the bouncer. \"Sorry. I haven't seen anything.\" <br>\r\n\"Shit!\" The big bouncer utters in frustration, almost wanting to pound the bar counter with his fist. \"Could you get me a drink while I'm here?\"<br>\r\nThe smaller bar man with his slight built looks up, easily threatened by the physique of the doorman. \"Sorry, but we've shut everything up now...but...uh...I could ask around about your wallet.\" Tom, the bar man continues, not wanting to anger the bigger man and trying to be a help in some way. With that he walks round from the bar, leaving the tea towel he was using to dry up, and walks across the club somewhat nervously hoping he can find the wallet in another room as the huge door man leans at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho drinks the formula?</span></div></div>",
