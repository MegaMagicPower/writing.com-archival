You still remember the day fondly, as it was the day you went from that useless pudgy kid to big important chief. As usual it wasn't the biggest or best, but a sign from the stars who would be the next in line for chiefly duties. The new elder always kept an eye on you, asking you how you were every day, making it better if it was not so good, making it better if it was, and you had a feeling like he knew the entire time that you were destined to be chosen! Of course he would never tell, but you liked to think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour color? A dark green. Your height? A little shorter than normal, but not by much. And as for looks, you were handsome, as the hero of the story usually is, and at this moment looked like you could split into four and a half different yoshis if you divided your weight. As it was said you were pudgy before all this, then soon after you got fat, then you just got huge! Then again the women seemed to like a huge yoshi, as they still couldn't keep their hands off you, or your moobs, or your belly, or even your feet... it seems like they have varying degrees of fetishes in your tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently you were with two other yoshis in your hut, a fairly pudgy male and a skinny by yoshi standards female. The male had been a friend to you since you both hatched, and he was a bouncy active kid turned slow mature adult. The female was another friend, though one you did not like much for certain reasons. A conversation was taking place between the three of you, one you found repetitive and boring, but important none the less. You'd rather be asleep right now, curled up nice and close next to one lucky gal... or guy, you weren't picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the conversation, it was about...</span></div></div>",

Young chief are you ready for training?\" shrieked the Yoshi Shaman at the entrance.  His words scared you so badly you practically jumped out of your skin.  He chuckled a bit at your reaction.

You pat your grumbling stomach with an odd satisfaction, as if to reassure it that everything will be fine. He leads you inside the hut to a broad table inside a large room, stacked with more fruit than you had ever seen in your lifetime. You find yourself in a daze just staring at the bounty and cannot do so much as try to stop yourself from drooling. The Shaman brings you to an open spot on the table and pulls up a chair just for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all yours,\" He tells you, \"Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know exactly where to start, lashing your tongue out at a watermelon as big as your head. You then rapidly spit out the seeds one by one to the delight of the normally stone-faced Shaman. You then peel a bunch of bananas and gobble them up one by one, tossing the skins to the side. Next, you toss several apples into the air and catch them with your tongue. The Shaman takes notice of your appetite and approaches you the next moment you come up for air. Content with your meal so far, you thank him by rubbing your stomach in his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you were hungry!\" He exclaims, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd never had a breakfast quite like this,\" You announce, ending with a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready to begin your training?\" He wants to know.</span></div></div>",

That idea did not sit well with you at all, you saw the former chieftain was pretty hefty. He had to be the size of four yoshis. You just could not see yourself bulking up to that weight, in fact you didn't really want to at all. You weren't the most toned yoshi on the island, but you weren't going to throw away what slim figure you have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh quit your whining, kids these days.\" The shaman rolled his eyes. \"It's imperative that a chief reaches a certain size before he can rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I mean, can't we change that?\" You stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but you need to realize, that you are not only a leader, but a symbol.\" He started. \"The wealthier and more prosperous a yoshi tribe is, the bigger they can make their chief.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds ridiculous, this isn't the ancient days where if tribes didn't work they starved.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None sense you foolish boy, do realize that there are only a few tribes who have achieved that status?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...no.\" You reply. \"But this is still stupid, why should  I have to do that for the sake of bragging rights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just bragging rights boy, but the most prosperous nation gains favor of the elder stars. You get  five wishes to use on your whim.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught your attention. Now a wish was something worth ones life. You just had to get really fat and you got five wishes.

I have perfected a method that will lower the difficult yoshi metabolism, and after a few days of that you will be well on your way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you propose to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone respects you nonetheless though, as your are still a king of your own kingdom. Your daughter, a young pink yoshi, gives you a hug.

She fell asleep the moment I kissed her goodnight.\" You get into bed, which groans a bit from your weight. \"You're such a good father, you know that?\" \"Yeah, I guess so.\" As the two of you get tucked into bed, you start reminiscing about how you started out as the new king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were crowned king, you were as slim an any other yoshi in the kingdom. Things were a bit difficult at first, with all the decisions you have to do, and having to listen to all the people's problems. But the benefits of being king helped make it all more bearable...And kinda added to your shape as well. Then, that's when you met her. The love of your life, Helena, your wife and queen. She never even once complained about how you were 'growing' into your new position, and she always knew what to say to you. After a while, your daughter Elaine just...well, she just happened! Neither of you minded, as you were both already thinking about starting a family anyway. Whenever she wanted a big dessert that she couldn't finish, she would ask you to eat the rest that she couldn't eat anymore. This, plus her puppy dog eyes when you say no the first time, has added to your frame over the years. Eventually, that dreadful day when you find out that all your clothes have 'shrunk in the wash' has come, and walking has suddenly become so much harder came by sooner or later. One thing was certain though, no one minded having a tubby king. Especially Elaine, as she would spend hours playing with your stomach to keep her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you wake up with Helena already getting dressed for the day. You follow suit and creep inside your daughter's room to see if she's awake yet. As you open the door slightly, you see her sleeping so peacefully in her blanket. You walk next to her, give her a good morning kiss, and watch as she wakes up and hugs your round midsection. \"Good morning daddy!\" \"Good morning my little princess. It's time for breakfast, so get ready now.\" She gets up and opens her dresser. You help her get dressed and the two of you make way for the dining hall. The servants all bow to you as you pass by. As you reach the long table, you see Helena already telling some servants to get the food ready. You all sit down and wait for the food to come.

You thought once again how if you were like your father these walks would either be shorter  or nonexistent.  Your walks normally led you through the courtyard, through the kitchens, and finally into your son's room to wake him up and give him a morning hug.  You strolled through the gardens for a nice breath of fresh air, a pass by the kitchen told you what the chefs had planned for the day, and finally you were led to your son's bedroom to wake him up.  His face looks so peaceful in his sleep, and you brace yourself for a grumpy awakening as you start opening his curtains.  And audible groan comes from the bed as the sun hits his chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaad... I told you to stop waking me up like that...\" The lazy voice he gets in the morning always makes you want to giggle when you hear it.  By the way he says it like that it sounds like you wake him like this every morning, when in reality this is about the fourth time you've done it ever.  He always acted so lazy, it was kind of adorable actually.  You approached his bed as he sat up and rubbed his eyes.  You open your arms for that daily hug you always ask from him.  He rolls his eyes and reluctantly gives you one.  This embrace was one of the few things you asked from him, the others being that he always love you as you love him, and that he keep up with his lessons.  You hugged for awhile and notice that...</span></div></div>",

You got up and had your servants carry you as you prepared for your day.  Three carefully held you at your meaty hips and thighs while another two tended to your massive belly that had grown from a slightly pudgy paunch into what you've declared a royal treasure.  The Yoshi's beneath you are careful to avoid dropping you or even making the ride anything but smooth.  They know the penalty for displeasing you from the Yoshi's they've replaced and knowing your belly grows larger by the day it is a job that grows increasingly difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've freshened up and adorn your royal outfit it's time to sit on your throne.  Even for your size it's quite massive, but you've started filling it nicely.  You give your belly a little rub and marvel at it's greatness.  If anything was a physical representation of your corrupt and twisted empire that was solely there to satisfy your every desire it was that mammoth gut.  The rest of your body was fattening up as well, but nothing else could really compare to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should change my ways and be a good king?\" you asked yourself.  \"Perhaps hit the gym and get into shape.  Yeah right!  In a pigs eyes!\"  You laugh hoggishly as you think such a ridiculous thought.  You always do that every day to get yourself in a good and hungry mood.  In fact, speaking of hungry it was time to ring the royal bell.  You grab a nearby rope and pull it down sounding a belly that is heard down to the kitchen.  Remember the Yoshi's that were afraid to fail their king?  Well the one thing worse than carrying him around was feeding him.  It was a 24 hour job meaning they barely got any sleep needing to tend to his every craving whether it be in the middle in the afternoon or at the dead of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your waiter came to get your order he asked.  \"What is your stomach's desire, my lord?\"</span></div></div>",

He was very smart, so smart that he seemed to know everything, which was slightly creepy in your opinion. When you became king you almost instantly appointed him your right hand man. It wasn't just because he was your best friend, or because he was intelligent, it was because he knew you. He knew what you liked, he knew how to speak to you at any time, and above all he knew when you needed advice.

Yeah, he definitely had to be the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly dug in to the meal, trying to lower the stress of the looming banquet by doing what has recently come naturally to you. Eating. The chef had outdone himself with the food, everything tasted better than usual, like he had prepared it for Bowser himself. This fact just made you eat faster, and before you knew it, everything was gone. You scarfed down the sandwiches, ate every snack, drank the entire pitcher of milk, and devoured the two plates of dessert. When you came back to the world of the living, the chef, the servants, and your friend all looked at you incredulously. \"Uh... sir, maybe we should get you to your room for a little a rest, and I'll make sure the decorations are sped up.\" The food stupor you were in made you agree with the short yellow yoshi and he led you to your royal bedroom. Your friend got you laying down in the bed, and he made sure you were absolutely comfortable before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen about ten seconds later your eyes shot open, and you jumped (as much as a yoshi your size could) out of bed and startled your friend.
