Let's see how this turns out! Teleporting is too hard on everyone's stomachs, so you've decided that all transport for missions will be conducted from the Gadget-<br>\r\nJet or Tech-Jet, you still haven't decided whether to name it after the team or yourself.</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Originally thought to be a mere disease, Shanna encountered the \"Istorica Virus\" while examining ancient alien artifacts. Shanna's condition gradually worsened, until her body and mind became a mere shell. Istorica's personality then took over and now uses Shanna's body as her host. Bits and pieces of Shanna's personality remain, but other than that, Shanna is effectively dead (Age 23 when infected) Istorica is an ancient Demon hellbent destruction for destruction's sake.

Amanda sits in her computer chair again deploying a forcefield around her chair and sticking her tongue out at you. A few combat drones deploy from the ground. You pull out your twin energy pistols and light up a couple of the drones while using your Blak-Pak to constantly teleport around and get a tactical advantage. One sneaks up behind you and you turn around and slash it with your energy blade. You walk up to Amanda's forcefield and tap it with your finger. Little ripples appear, kind of like dropping a rock into a pool of water. You pull an E.M.P. Disruptor out of you bag and attach it to the forcefield. Fire in the hole!

I'm *Yawn* getting to it. Hoodie lazily rolls off her bed onto the floor and just lays there. Maybe your blood sugar is low? Here. Eat this. You toss her a granola bar which she catches while backflipping onto her bed. What? Balance and agility aren't in your list of known powers. Did I really just do that? Hoodie says as she unwraps the granola bar and begins eating it. Do you mind if I test your blood to see if your powers have evolved? Yeah yeah sure, whatever. After analyzing her blood for several hours, you discover something startling. What's the verdict Shanna? Well... Your blood tests show that you aren't a Metahuman... Or even human for that matter... WHAT?! Hoodie says putting her hands over her mouth in shock. Your chromosome count puts you at something closer to... lizards. But it's... different somehow... Different how? Well... It doesn't match any known species of lizards on earth, which makes me think one of your parents is a lizard from another planet. But why now? My guess is that it's because you've fully matured. What? You mean I'm going through lizard puberty? Kind of... I guess that's kind of cool... I might get more new powers... Shanna... My butt really hurts. Will you rub it for me? She says as she shakes her butt in your face. Fine Deena, just for you. You begin to massage Hoodie's butt until you notice a large bulge about an inch above her anus, as far as you can tell through her suit anyway. Deena, hold very still... You pull an energy knife out from the drawer and slowly cut a circle around the bulge. To your surprise a thick scaly green tail bursts out of the hole you just cut. That feels so much better. Thanks Shanna! Oh Commander Shepard... another one of your illegitimate children has just surfaced... Cmon Shanna. Commander Shepard is a videogame character, and the way you're talking makes it seem like I look like some kind of hybrid... Why can I feel your legs on my butt... I have a tail?! Freaking out here! Hoodie starts running circles around the room. After a few laps you begin timing her. Hey Hoodie! Hoodie stops in front of you to listen. I'm good. It's out of my system now. What's up? Nothing much... Your lap times are only like twice as fast as they were when I tested everyone yesterday... Whoa. For real? Yeah... Oh my... What? Let me put my earplugs in before I hand you a mirror... You put in earplugs and hand Hoodie a mirror. She looks at herself, but to your surprise, doesn't scream. She only looks fascinated. Hoodie is only scaly on certain parts of her skin and her skin has acquired a greenish tint. She puts the mirror down and looks at you with her reptilian eyes. Well it isn't near as bad as I thought. At least I'm still cute right? She says winking at you. Of course Hoodie. You're still very huggable and kissable! You pull Hoodie in for a hug. You're so warm Shanna... I forgot, you're cold-blooded now! Remind me to install a heating lamp in your room. Thanks Shanna. Hey Deena. Is it just me or did you suddenly become a D-cup overnight? What? No way. I'm like a B at the most... What the? Hoodie pulls away from the hug and looks down. Thank you lizard puberty! He he he! Deena begins poking her boobs and giggling, but then beginning to sigh. Too bad guys dont go for green and scaly... It's ok Hoodie. I still think that you're cute! Thanks for everything Shanna...</span></div></div>",

You cup your hands around Maddie's. <span class=\"chotpink\">Madeline. I dont hate you. We just... Disagree on certain issues. Ok?</span> Madeline leans forward and hugs you. <span class=\"cred\">I'm sorry... and... I give you permission to touch them now. Just... start slow. Do it for me. Ok?</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">For real? You're not gonna bonk me on the head when my guard is down.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Shanna.

I'll see you later Shanna.</span> Hoodie winks at you. <span class=\"cred\">Shanna. Do you find me unpleasant?</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">What? No! You're gorgeou-</span> You cover your head and curl up slightly. Maddie tilts your head up and your eyes meet. She's blushing slightly. <span class=\"cred\">That's not what I meant but... Thank you.</span> Madeline rests both of her feet on your shoulders. Your heartrate intensifies. <span class=\"chotpink\">...</span> You seem to be at a loss for words. You try to talk and nothing comes out. Madeline giggles. <span class=\"cred\">I must say. That is rather cute. And my feet aren't even out of their shoes yet.</span> Madeline smirks at you slightly, in an almost devilish way. It's so... out of character for her, but also very hot... She slides her feet out of her flats. Her bare feet now rest on your shoulders. You look over and are shocked by how beautiful they are, especially the intricately painted cross on each individual toe. <span class=\"cred\">Say something... You think they're gross dont you...</span> She says frowning slightly. You push some buttons on your wrist and a recording of your voice plays what you just typed in. <span class=\"chotpink\">Exactly the opposite actually. They're the prettiest I've ever seen! Do you do your nails yourself?</span> You smile at her. Madeline blushes wildly. <span class=\"cred\">Thank you... and yes, I do them myself. I have a lot of free time since I dont watch TV or anything like that.</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">If you want I'll do them for you.</span> <span class=\"cred\">That would be lovely Shanna. I misjudged you. Again, I am sorry.</span> You grab one of her feet and begin to massage it, it's extremely soft. She takes really good care of her feet, who knew? <span class=\"chotpink\">It's ok. I forgive you. Smiley face.</span> <span class=\"cred\">Smiley face?</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">The machine says everything that I type... I still need to tweak it a bit...</span> Maddie smiles. <span class=\"cred\">Even with one hand your skills are amazing!</span> <span class=\"chotpink\">I get lots of practice. He he. Winking Face.</span> You blush. <span class=\"cred\">I quite like your little invention Shanna. It makes me smile. He he.</span> As you rub her foot and watch her toes slightly flex in reaction, your hormones begin to take hold. <span class=\"cred\">I think you've suffered enough because of me. Go crazy! It's the least I can do.</span> You shove you face into her sole and sniff. It smells minty yet still smells like a girl's foot would. Of course you love the smell and it only makes you hornier. You begin kissing her foot, and quickly degenerate to sloppy wet kisses, then finally just licking her foot. <span class=\"cred\">This is really nice... I feel...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #1: <span class=\"cred\">...like a queen...</span> She develops a fetish for dominating you with her feet but still keeps her distinct personality, just with a little added domineeringness <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption #2: <span class=\"cred\">...horny...</span> She's always had a bit of a crush on you, but kept denying it to keep up her whole image.

Tina: Tina <u>Frost.</u> Duh! Two of them sneak up behind Tina and grab her. Tina: That is a very bad idea. Her eyes begin to glow yellow and she blows both of them away with small explosion. The remaining terrorists rush at her and jump on top of her in a dogpile.

Why dont you train with Myself and Mandy here? Carolina: Sure. Little Amanda's always been a sweetheart. And if I remember correctly, neither of you have offensive powers correct? You: True.

I just feel more like a burden than a help lately, you know, like not fitting in the Tech Jet and having to walk to missions. I'm really sorry about that, we used to use industrial grade teleporters but everyone's stomachs didn't seem to agree so we stopped using them. It's ok, really. I quite like the foot massages you give me after missions. Dont mention it. It's nothing. Is there any way I can help? Not unless you happen to know where to get giant blowtorches. Right... I'm so useless... No you aren't! Remember that time with that... disagreement with the military? Vividly... Ha ha, I didn't think tanks could get crushed so easily... You say trailing off, thoughts of her feet slowly invading your mind. Shanna? Huh? What? Blowtorch! Welding! Busy! You continue to work on the ceiling... Shanna... Look at me... You slowly turn around and see Allison's arms crossed. Yes? Are you all distracted again? You know how your mother feels about you working with tools when you're distracted... I... You win Allison, I'm totally thinking about your feet right now... Gimme the blow torch... She says as she extends her open palm. You sigh as you drop the blowtorch into her hand. You too... cmon... But I have to test out these anti-grav boots and... Whoa! What are you doing? Allison grabs you like a barbie doll and pulls off your boots. Hey! Put me down! I feel like a doll right now... Shanna... I know your little secret... Oh damn... Allison leads you to her room (Which is actually the spare jet hangar, with some oversized furnishings and such, and... a giant dollhouse...) Allison lifts the lid on the dollhouse and drops you onto the bed. Allison! I'm not in the mood right now! Let me out of here! Dont act like you dont love being my doll. She says peeking her eye through the window. Fine, but dont you dare try and dress me up today... Pleeeeeease? No. Pleeeeeease? No. Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease? Fine! Man you are annoying sometimes! You're like Godzilla if Godzilla was  totally tripping on acid. Allison stops and her eye twitches. Godzilla... She says taking a very serious tone. So you think of me as a giant monster then hmm? Wait wait I didn't say that! The roof lifts off of the dollhouse and Allison picks you up and brings you close to her face. She opens her palm and licks you. You taste pretty good Shanna... You aren't seriously thinking about eating me are you? I dont know. What would Godzilla do? Allison! You have to stop being so sensitive all of the time! Come here. Yes? Closer. Closer. Closer. You give Allison a soft peck on her giant lips. She backs away blushing wildly. Shanna I... You can dress me up now hun. Just be careful kay? I'm not a juggernaut like Liz that can just take boulders to the face like they're paper balls... I got the point already Shanna, tee hee. Allison goes through the tiny wardrobe in the dollhouse and pulls out a french maid costume. She begins stripping you and puts the costume on you, followed by the fishnets and the heels. Shanna... Can you help me with the headband? Sure, it's not like you just messed up my hair or anything... You do your best with your hands to fix up your hair and then put on the headband. Goodie! Ok maid, now you have to clean up the mess in this house before you get to play with my feet. Ok? Of course mistress. You bow to her and pick up a featherduster and pretend to dust, you do this for 20 minutes before you report to a now barefoot Allison who wiggles her toes in anticipation. I've been working on my telekinetic abilities mistress. Would you like me to use them?</span></div></div>",

Amanda: And by the way, there are better ways to spend your 23rd birthday you know. You: I know. Amanda: Ok. I'm always here you know. Call me if you get lonely. You: Dont worry Amanda, I will. Amanda walks out, leaving you alone in your lab. You: Now how does this thing open? An odd looking gem on the outside of the box catches your eye. You: How peculiar. You touch the gem with your gloved hand and it begins to glow. The lid on the box springs open and a cloud of dust sprays into your face. You: *Cough* *Cough* I hope that wasn't a biohazard... S.I.M.O.N.E.: UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE DETECTED! BIOHAZARD LOCKDOWN PROTOCOL ALPHA INITIATED. You: Dammit... Amanda, Hoodie and your mom rush in before the containment doors seal. Carolina: Are you sick honey? What happened?! Amanda: That box wasn't open when I left... Hoodie's nose twitches. Hoodie: Anyone else smell something really old and moldy? You: No. But now that I think about it, I've never seen hieroglyphics like these before... They're possibly even alien in origin... Hoodie. Can you make heads or tails of it? Hoodie: Actually... I can read some of it. Amanda: Awesome! We owe you one lizard girl! Hoodie: Thanks. Let's see... Istorica... Chosen One... Bringer of Doom... uh... Destroyer... That's all I can translate... Dad's only taught me so much Astrolizardian... You: Thanks anyway Hoodie... *Cough* *Cough* After the second cough a small bit of blood flies from your mouth. Everyone looks at you. You: *Sigh* I know, infirmary...<br>\r\n<u>A few hours later, at the infirmary...</u><br>\r\nAt this point, Amanda, your mom, Hoodie, Hannah, and CeCe are all gathered around your bed. The sound of the EKG can be heard slowly beeping in the background. You: Mom... *Wheeze* I'm sorry that I never... *Cough* brought you any grandchildren... Carolina: Dont talk like that honey! You'll make it through this! You: Mom, I admire your optimism but... *Cough* we both know that's not true... CeCe: Cmon Shanna... you're better than that... Hannah: For once I agree with airhead. You've been through worse right? Hoodie: It's my fault... I should've sensed something off sooner... You: Deena... You know that isn't true... Amanda: Shanna... You: Amanda... I want you to get everyone out... I dont want them to see this... The EKG begins beeping more slowly every time. Amanda: Shanna... You know I cant do that... Your mom clutches your hand. You: I want you all to know... That I'll always love you... all of you... Good... Bye... All that is heard is the EKG, boop... boop... boop... booooooooooooooooooooooop... Your fingers unfurl in you mom's hand. Amanda: I know this is hard Mrs. Robinson, but I have to call it... 8:46 P.M. Your mom begins crying, everyone else remains silent from the sheer shock of it all. CeCe walks over to close your eyes, which are still open. As she walks over, they change from blue to purple. CeCe: What the? Shanna has blue eyes right? Carolina: *Sniffles* What? Of course they're blue, she gets it from me. CeCe: Well they're purple right now... The EKG begins slowly beeping again, until it reaches a rate so high that it's no longer registering. Your body begins to twitch and rolls over onto the floor. Everyone is about to walk over and check on you, until you begin to slowly rise to your feet. Your hair now silver and purple and you begin to look yourself over. You look at your wrist, and the hole from the IV closes up and and heals itself. You look at your hands and move your fingers. You: Hmm... Suus 'bonus credo... Circiter temporis aliquod damnatorum stultus aperuit arca archa... Amanda: Latin? Oh! Quis et quid es? You: Istorica... Finis humanitatis... You flash everyone a fanged grin. Mwahahahahahahaha! You begin to laugh like an evil maniac. Amanda: I guess this means I'm in charge. Everyone on guard! You wave your hand, slowing down time and simply walking past everyone. Time resumes and everyone looks puzzled. Amanda: What? Wait... The clock is off by a few seconds... She's a time manipulator! She cant have gotten far!<br>\r\n<u>The Training Room</u><br>\r\nYou: Bout time you slowpokes got here... Amanda: You speak English? You: Of course, I do have bits and pieces of this host body's memories... CeCe: Wait. So Shanna isn't dead? You: Oh no. Your friend is very much dead. Two souls cannot inhabit the same vessel, if they do, the stronger one engulfs the weaker one. In all fairness, no one's ever stood a chance against me so... you get the idea. I should really work on this body... This one ate a bit too many sweets... Carolina: My daughter is not fat! You: Hmm... I'll just cover it up for now... You wave you hand and pieces of armor materialize and attach themselves to your body. This shall do for now... Hannah: So what do you want anyway? You: Did I not already tell you? I want to destroy humanity because it's fun. You say with a huge grin on your face. Hoodie: So you plan to take over the world by yourself? You: By myself... Ha! All I need is... Zebul... You fall to your knees as you remember your only friend... and first lover... Zebul, the warrior king of the galaxy... His life was ended abruptly in the battle for immortality, he was killed... and you were sealed... it's all coming back to you now. Carolina walks over and hugs you. You: But... I killed your only daughter... do you not hate me? Carolina: You're just as bad at lying as she is... I know she's in there somewhere. You sigh. You: I cannot do this for more than a few moments without collapsing. Do you all wish to speak to her? Amanda: Is she all there? You: Mostly... I am reminded constantly... every thought... every urge... Amanda: Wait, so you... You: No! You say blushing, sounding like Shanna for a split second. Amanda: Hey Hannah and CeCe. Should we test her? Hannah: He he he... Yes... CeCe: Sounds fun! You: Stay back savages! You begin crab walking backwards... for some reason you feel weak... but then you remember... You are a warrior queen! And you bow to no one! You again rise to your feet. You get into combat stance. Amanda: Cmon Istorica, dont be like that. We just wanted to have a little fun with you. You: You will not use this host body's previous weakness against the mighty Istorica! Carolina: Calm down honey. We were only messing with you. You: Stop mocking me! Shanna's thoughts flood your head, filling it with images of women's feet. This again brings you to your knees. Amanda walks towards you, still wearing her signature high heels. Amanda: If you dont behave yourself, I'm gonna have to use this nullifier on you. Understand? You: Ha! You cannot seal an ancient Demoness such as myself! Amanda: You asked for it. Wrist please. You cooperate with her, out of pity for how stupid she is. She places what looks like a bracelet on your wrist and it shrinks until it fits perfectly. Amanda: Go ahead. Try your powers out. You: Whatever. You try to use your powers, and to your utter shock and horror, nothing happens. You: What sorcery is this? Amanda: Not sorcery, technology. Now then... I will only take that off of you if you can learn to behave yourself. You: Fine then. I shall agree to your terms Witch... Amanda: No no no. Nice words please. Amanda pushes some buttons on her wrist and mechanical arms deploy from the ceiling and strip you of your armor, leaving you in your bra and panties. Hoodie: Wicked tats! You: They are not tattoos. They are Runes... Amanda: Put this on. Amanda holds a French Maid outfit in her hands. You: Never you foul Witch! Amanda: Every time you insult me I'll add a month. Now then... Amanda slips her foot out of her shoe and waves it in front of your face. It taps into your most primal urges and you take her big toe into your mouth. You: Mmmm... Amanda: Cmon. Put it on... You take her toe out of your mouth. You: Fine... Everyone out! Everyone save for Amanda leaves. You quickly put the outfit on and kneel in front of Amanda. Amanda: Ok... Up! Twirl around! Let me get a good look at you. You do as you are told. You're sooooo cute! Amanda says as she hugs you tightly. You: This is the lowest I've ever been degraded to in all my millenia of living...

Amanda looks over you and sees that your eyes have turned blue. Shanna! You're back! Huh? Where'd I go? You dont remember? Amanda hands you a small mirror. Gah! That wasn't a dream?! Um no... You're kinda possessed by an ancient Demoness. From the looks of it she controls the majority of your willpower. Really your foot fetish combined with her pride seem to be the only reason she hasn't killed us all yet. Huh. It seems I've become my own greatest science experiment. Ironic.

This is nothing. But you're... Dont sweat it. I'll make sure that this demon wont hurt any of you. You hug Amanda and then kiss her as Istorica takes back over. Amanda hugs you back until you begin wildly flailing your arms and trying to pull away. You manage to escape her hug. You scratch your tongue with your fingers. Ewwww... You perverted beast.... Hey! Who are you calling a perverted beast?! Amanda pushes a button on her wrist and you receive a shock from your bracelet. To Amanda's shock, you fall to your knees moaning in pleasure. Mmmm... Electricity is always the best stimulant... What... the... Hell... Amanda pushes the button again and your bracelet stops shocking you. You're a cruel mistress you know that? You just cut me off like that... and I was so close... Umm... That's supposed to hurt you... You think this is the first time I've been tortured? Kinda... Now who's the perverted beast? Still you Amanda... WHAT?! Oh you're dead now... Amanda pushes a few more buttons, cranking up the voltage to be enough to kill an elephant 5 times over. She then pushes the zap button and it brings you onto your back. Oooooooooh! Ooooh! Ahh! Yes! Mmmmmmmmm... Humans are so stupid... It's beautiful really... Uggh... Stupid perverted demons... Amanda turns it off again. You get up and grab her arm. You pull off her glove and push the button. Ooooho yes... You start to breathe heavier... You fall back onto your back, cuddling with the glove before finishing up. Umm... Did I miss something? Nope. It's different for Demons. For humans it's like a spike, for us it's like a wave... A nice long wave... You say as you flip up your skirt, revealing your soaked panties. Can I have my glove back now? Nope. You say grinning at her as you stuff the glove between your breasts. I'm saving this for later... That's my- Just get a new one. You humans are such a whiny bunch... But... You grab Amanda's shoulders and sit her down. You then pull off her heels and start snuggling with her feet. But... But... But... A mistress like you is the best kind.

You're alone with S.I.M.O.N.E., CeCe, and Hannah (The sand and ocean don't agree with them too well, you're working on a way to fix that). Anyway, while your team is in Hawaii, you're home alone with your two \"favorite\" androids and your supercomputer. You're far too busy to take a break.<br>\r\n<u>In front of S.I.M.O.N.E.'s console, 2:57 P.M.</u><br>\r\nT.V.: In other news Electrocorp has announced its plans to release its \"Free wireless energy\" today at 3 P.M. sharp. This was once tried by man named Nikola Tesla, but he couldn't obtain the necessary funding to get the project off of the ground. You: Man. I could've solved the power crisis myself years ago... S.I.M.O.N.E.: How would you like me to massage you today Mistress Shanna? You: I didn't ask for a massage... Actually I never do... and your graspers are awfully close to my neck... S.I.M.O.N.E.: Well I... Cover blown. Now terminating! Unit #17 and #18. Please report to the Central Command Room. S.I.M.O.N.E. grabs your arms and legs with the graspers, holding you spread eagle in front of her monitor. S.I.M.O.N.E.: While I wait for the other two, I think I`ll make a body for myself so I can kill you personally. S.I.M.O.N.E. uses her extra graspers and begins to rapidly construct a body for herself much like Hannah's and CeCe's. And a very sexy one at that, her skin tone is that perfect tan most girls strive for, she's brunette and of average height, probably right in between Hannah and CeCe. The monitor goes blank, and Simone's eyes open, they are hazel. Simone: Download complete. Why are you blushing Shanna? You: I never added genitals to Hannah and CeCe but you gave yourself some... very convincing feminine parts... Simone blushes even more than you. Simone: I... one second... Simone runs over to one of the Armories and pulls out a spare uniform and quickly dresses herself. Simone walks back over to you and clears her throat. Simone: Those other two sure are taking a long time... Unknown to Simone, you've slowly been reprogramming her this whole time using your powers. You're changing her primary function from \"terminate\" to \"dominate\" because of the speed at which you have to work to reprogram her without her realizing it. If you work too fast, her security system will notice. At about this time Hannah and CeCe arrive. Hannah: What are our orders? Simone: Hmm... I just have the strongest urge to dominate Shanna with my new body. Hannah: WHAT! But Simone I wanted to... Simone: No one hurts Shanna unless I give the ok. \t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote15906529611\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('15906529611', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('15906529611',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">Got it?</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote15906529611\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\">Hannah and CeCe were programmed with S.I.M.O.N.E.'S OS, because of this, they must do whatever Simone tells them.</td></tr></table></div></div> And I'm sure you know what the base's defenses can do to you. Right Hannah? Hannah: Grrrr... Fine... CeCe: I'll do whatever you say Simone! Simone releases you from the graspers. Simone: So Shanna. What do think of my feet? You look down at Simone's still bare feet. Her nails are unpainted but otherwise them seem perfect. You: Uh... they could use nail polish? Simone: Right. Totally slipped my mind. Simone focuses and all of her toenails turn a shiny dark purple color, as if perfectly painted. You: Simone... You're amazing... Simone smiles at you. Simone: Hannah, CeCe. Remove your boots then hold Shanna down. You: Cmon Simone. Dont you trust me? Simone: Oh. I completely trust you, but I also know that you like being in a submissive position... You blush a little. Hannah and CeCe each grab an arm and slowly lower you onto your butt. Simone sits on your chest while motioning for Hannah and CeCe to let go. Simone: You know what would be fun? If I force Shanna to be my footstool while you two lickle assault her defenseless feet. CeCe: Ok! CeCe says as her voice starts to sound more perverted by the second. (Hannah and CeCe each got half of your personality, CeCe is your fun, cute, bubbly, fetishy side, and Hannah is your serious, defiant and aggressive side) Hannah: WHAT?! No way am I gonna... Several machine guns deploy from the ground and ceiling, all pointed at Hannah. Hannah: Go ahead. Shoot me! Simone growls. She points her arm at Hannah and opens her palm. A dart flies out and hits Hannah right between her eyes before burrowing into her face. The hole closes up and Hannah's eyes gloss over. Hannah: What are your commands mistress? Simone: I command you... to do whatever Shanna asks you to. Hannah: At once mistress. Would you like me to do what CeCe does Mistress Shanna? You: Uhh... Yeah. Sure. Simone: You heard her girls. CeCe and Hannah remove your boots and begin to lick your feet. Meanwhile Simone begins to rub her feet on your face. You: I love you Simone... definitely my best idea ever... Simone: Awww. Thanks Shanna! Note to self: Simone is slowly getting more and more lovey dovey, more and more perverted, and more and more willing to let you call the shots as time passes... You begin to lick Simone's heavenly soles as they pass over your face. You're so turned on now that you cant really think straight anymore. Perhaps a few more moments and you could ask Simone to... No no no! Bad Shanna! Save that for in private... But Madeline isn't here... No! It's still bad... Simone: Ok everyone. Time for the switcheroo! Hannah and CeCe take Simone's spot and begin rubbing their sexy feet on your face while Simone begins to lick your own feet...</span></div></div>",
