Studying English at the Jason University, you have been fortunate to have parents with lots of money and no intention of intervening with your affairs as long as you don't mess up their image. Considering your hanging around student parties and other events the rich usually don't visit, your life as a student may continue indefenitely.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Currently, your mind is troubled. It's not the exams which are to take place in a few days (you figure that since you haven't invested any effort in them anyway, you don't need to worry about messing them up). It's about your girl- friend Marsha who is considering becoming your ex- girl- friend. You don't really understand why she would want to leave you. It couldn't be because of those two dates with Jane, and she needn't worry about Lisa either, so what gives? Probably just some female thing men are not meant to understand.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anyway, you have been at this rather dull party for some two hours and Marsha has been trying her best to keep away from you. Darn, should you approach her, and ask what's up? - No, last time you tried that she got mad at you calling you a clutz. Maybe she wants you to give her a present or have a private date with her. Yeah, that should do the trick.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as you are about to leave the bar in search of Marsha, you see something glittering on the counter. A silver ring with a single black jewel. You haven't noticed it before, and no one else seems to notice it. Finders Keepers, you may just as well try this as a present for Marsha, it does look kind of nice.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You touch the ring when you suddenly feel strange. The black jewel expands until it fills the entirety of your view and everything goes black...\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you recover, everything is odd. You are on a brown, flat plain. In the distance, you see what must be giants moving around. At least you can still here the music from the party. But where are you? Then you recognize things, although you can hardly believe it, the plain you are standing on must be the bar's counter. The sky scraper to your right must be the bottle of beer you were drinking from. You can't be  more than half an inch tall! The ring! Where is the ring? It all happened when you touched it. You look around, but there is no trace of the ring. What are you to do?</span></div></div>",

None of the guests at the bar are friends of yours, and being such small and vulnerable, you would rather not surrender yourself to the mercies of some drunken stranger. It is settled, you have to find someone who knows you so that you may get some help. So first order of business should be getting down from this counter.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With determination you walk up to the edge of the smooth plain you are standing on. You look down. You crawl back a bit and try to recover from the shock. At your current size, the counter must be some two hundred meters high. It certainly looked like it. If you happened to fall all that way, you would die an anonymous death as a microscopic pancake on the dirty floor of this darn place. But you have no choice. You need help fast.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gathering all your courage, you crawl back to the edge. The sight of the abyss sends shivers down your spine. \"Don't look down, don't look down\", you keep telling yourself while lifting your legs over the edge. Fortunately, the table is made of real wood (a miracle considering who's running this business) and has suffered quite a lot over the years. It takes your feet only moments to find appropriate footholds more than large enough to support you. Encouraged by this discovery, you begin climbing down. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Climbing down the counter is tedious and hard work. Although there are more than enough footholds, it is still a gigantic distance you have to travel. And from time to time, you have to cling onto the dirty surface in order to keep from being sucked away by a gust of wind created by one of the guests walking along the counter. Your arms are growing tired and your breath is more than forced, but there is no space for you to rest at. And if you fall - better not consider that again.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, the miracle happens, you really reach the floor after an eternity of climbing. Your arms feel dead and there is no part of your body that isn't hurting. Your lungs are burning with every breath you take. Unbelievably glad and proud, you collapse onto the floor. What are you going to do once you have recovered from this ordeal?</span></div></div>",

There has been a little trouble between the two of you lately, but you are sure that she would help you. Maybe you could even use that situation to your advantage. How could she be angry with you after you have turned into something so small, so protect- worthy - so innocent. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You set out onto the dance floor. It doesn't take you long to develop doubts about your choice. There are stomping feet everywhere and if you want to identify the dancers, you have to look up, nearly bending your neck to the breaking point. The music is deafening and you can only catch small pieces of the conversations going on. Still, you have made your choice, and returning to the bar won't do you any good either as no one will be looking for you there (especially not with a magnifying glass).\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>STOMP!</b> There, another near miss. You are breathing heavily again, and nothing but gigantic legs all around you. You wouldn't even be able to return to the bar now, as you have lost your bearings completely. The constant noise has also made you dizzy. All you can do now is keep on walking and dodging and hoping for the best.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>THUD!</b> All of a sudden, a gigantic rock crashes down in front of you. It is flaming red and glitters. Its surface is smooth and its right side is cut open. You shudder slightly when you realize that this monstrosity is merely a hand bag one of the girls must have dropped. Its opening is quite close to you, and you might make it. So what do you do?</span></div></div>",

Risking your life running around the dance floor won't get you anywhere but under someone's soles. With that in mind, you dash towards the hand bag just as you are able to understand \"... Ah! There it is! \" You leap for the opening while wondering why, no matter how much noise there is, people always hear the important, that is dangerous, stuff. As you land within the bag, it is lifted, obviously retrieved by its owner.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the gravity increases and your stomach takes a dive, your world is also turned by 90 degrees, the opening now visible high above you.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are lucky you found it again in that mess. And nothing's fallen out although you didn't close it!\" Just as you thought you were safe, the lights go out as the hand bag is closed. On the positive side, this also diminishes the noise tremendously allowing you to focus.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that your mind clears, you wonder whatever made you jump into a stranger's hand bag. For all you know, she could be an exchange student from another continent about to leave for home. Or she could be deadly afraid of bugs and crush you the moment you move. But now you don't have a choice. You can't escape, and your future is as dark as your surroundings. But wait! Although there is definitely no light entering the hand bag, you are still able to see things. The colors are darkened, but things are quite discernible.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since you have nothing else to do, you start exploring. The only problem is that the ground is constantly moving around as the girl dances, swinging then bag from side to side and up and down. Once you got accustomed to it, you are even able to run about, albeit feeling a bit sea- sick. Maybe you can get a feel for your unwitting host so that you may know how to introduce yourself best - or that you really need to escape before you are found.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Let's see, a part of a pipeline - thick and short, this must be her lipstick. A circular sheet of plastic inside some more plastic - preparations for long nights :) A big metal box with a single cut going around its entire body? Two pencils, some paper. A cigarette. Ah, then the box must be a lighter. Thus far, nothing uncommon, but no information about her. The ground is cover by some cloth, maybe a hanky?\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you dig deeper, you uncover a gigantic mural. Reminding yourself of your surroundings, you recognize it to be a photo on some government document. Great god! That picture is bigger than you are tall! Pushing the cloth aside, you identify it as your host's driver's license. As far as you can tell, she is quite cute. Under other circumstances, you might have offered her a drink or something. Well, let's see. Shelly Mason, 21 years old. Doesn't sound too bad.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shelly seems to be in a good mood today, as she keeps on dancing. The rocking motion and the distant music make you sleepy. This bag should be a safe place, and you have nowhere else to go. So what are you doing?</span></div></div>",

Barely noticible sandwhiched between her thumb and forefinger both of which much larger than you. Wow i really am tiny you think to yourself as Shelly turns. Looking far below, you see a body of water rimmed in white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Shelly please. No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout so much as a second thought she releases you. Plummeting towards the toilet bowl you watch her turn and stroll back into the other room. You take a deep breathe as you hit the water. Falling from so high up the impact knocks the wind out of you. You plundge deep into the cold water. Water rushes into your open mouth as you hit. Trying not to pass out you kick towards the surface to to fill your lungs with air. breaking the surface of the water you are a coughings shivering mess. Trying to tread at the same time you take of your waterlogged clothing. You watch your pants sink to the bottom then look around. Listening to the moans echoing from the other room it seems it's back to business as usual for Shelly and her guest. It doesn't appear that there's anyway to climb out on your own. Thinking to yourself almost deleriously, Maybe when She's done she'll think better of flushing me and help me out of here. Not likely but it's a hope. Then the moaning from the other room peaked to a cresendo and died. Shortly after you hear footsteps into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly? Your gonna help me out right? Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly's shadow fell over the toilet. But it was not the end you were hoping for. Instead of her smiling face you see her gigantic ass slowly descend towards the toilet seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Shelly please no. No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quiet for a brief second then came the sound you were dreading. It sounded like the rush of a water fall. Looking up you see a column of urine descending directly towards you. It hits with unimaginable force. Pushing you down deep, your chest hurt so bad that your almost certain you have some broken ribs. After a second you float back up the surface to see the column still roaring into the toilet. The stuff burns your eyes and stings your throat. waves ripple outward from the impact constantly rolling you back under the surface. then it subsides. After a few more squirts come raining down there is an intense quiet. Then rubbing the stinging urine out of your eyes you realize how bad the situation is getting. A long piller of brown is descending from the sky towards you. You find yourself praying Shelly flushes soon.</span></div></div>",

The man speaks up again his grip tightning on my torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think your hot-shit moving in on my girl Shelby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly looks more irritated. You would speak in your defense but he coudn't hear you anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you got the nessesary equipment to please her anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowers you towards his crotch. Pressing you against the tip of his penis he chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what little dude? Let me show you how it's done. This will be a free show of a lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moves towards Shelly on the bed. Your not quite sure whats going on when suddenly your dropped onto something soft. When you stand up you realize your standing on Shelly's left breast. Right next to you stands a nipple as tall as you are. The man grins at you and then looks back down at Shelly's bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay little guy. Show her what you got. You work up there I'll work down her. Maybe we can switch off later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Shelly's giant smileing face you figure it could be worse. You stride over to Shelly's nipple and try to figure out what to do. As you stand there the drunk gets to work on his half. You can't help but watch as he slides his locomotive sized penis into her. At first he's slow and methodical but he quickly ups the pace. Your quickly knocked off your feet as Shelly's tits start rocking. Holding on for dear life as the couples breathing quickens. That then gives way to moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah babe. I'm gunna cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly's mouth is wide air rushing in and out quickly. She tries to speak in between moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -aah- Forgot The -aah- Rubber -AAH!- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rocking does not cease as Shelly's gigantic breasts try to buck you off. The man pulls his locomotive sized dick out of Shelly just as a geyser of white fluid shoots from the tip. You realize too late where it's aimed at. As you cling desperately to the perky nipples a wall of white cream slams into you. The mans thundering voice is heard still panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah lick it off babe, lick it off those tits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get out of the sticky mess in time but it's covering you completely. You watch helplessly as one of Shelly's hands come up beneath her breast and presses it up towards her waiting mouth. You turn just enough to see a huge pink wall of flesh rush towards you. Along with the load of cum your swept on to her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah babe you rock! now swallow it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue complete with passenger rolls past her bright red lips and white teeth. She slowly seductively closes her mouth. You scream into the darkness then all at once you feel a wave of saliva wash over you sending you down Shelly's throat.</span></div></div>",

And worst of all it's bigger than yours. Much bigger. As Shelly's grinning face appears in the halo above your head a sense of scale sets in. Having handled condoms enough to know thier proportions pretty well you'd have to guess that behemoth about to join you in this thing is going to be about 80 ft... give or take ten feet for endowment. Guessing by now that your captors are too drunk to notice the struggling half inch man trying to avoid a most unpleasant experiance you brace yourself for the worst. Shelly's face high above you is suddenly blocked by something far far worse. You take a deep breath as Shelly brings the condom up to the man's dick. It starts pressing down through the latex towards you. Shelly picked a big one. It's gaping hole looks as if it's going to swallow you whole. It stops a few feet above your head. The dull thud of a heartbeat fills your ears. The world shifts and gravity is no longer pushing you down into the bottom of the condom but now everyhting is upside down and your sitting squarely on top of a purple tower. The flesh your sitting on top of is moist and hot to the touch. In fact the bubble that you now reside in is fogging up quickly. The slit your sitting next to is now oozing some disgusting liquid. It's getting unpleasant in here quickly. You wipe some of the condensation of the side of the bubble your in and peer out. When the latex is stretched this tight it becomes fairly transparent. What you see outside is not much better than in. The drunk giants are apparently lining up for there first pass. You see what in any other situation you might find very pleasing: A pussy. Nicely shaved with a landing strip above that you realy could land a plane on. The lips were huge and glistening with sweat already, and beyond...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess's pussy is rushing towards you or rather you are rushing towards it. This is going to hurt. Your slammed back into the man's dick as initial contact is made. It knocks the wind out of you and leaves you gasping for breath from the steamy confines of the condom's tip. It's dark. You can feel the incredible inertia's pulling you this way and that but you can't see a thing. Your still subject to the pounding sound of two heartbeats now beating out of sink. Just as your eyes are adjusting to the dark confines it's blindingly bright again. The bright pink walls rush past you as you fly backwards. Just as your getting a view of that trimmed bush of hers your thrown back towards her gaping vagina. As your rushing towards her again you catch a glimpse of Shelly's face between to rocking mountains of flesh. Then your inside her agian. The impact throws you against the man's penis.It's dark and you feel like the whole world is rushing past. Suddenly less scared and more angry you curl a fist and punch the dick as hard as you can. The blow is greeted by a shudder. Not a shudder of pain but a shudder of pleasure. Realizing that you probably just accelerated the process of your own demise you note not to try it again. Helpless to even standup with all the rocking you sit and let your eyes adjust to the darkness. It's a most unworldly of sights. A cave of pink half the length of a football field rushing back and forth all around you. Then rising over the sound of the accelerating heartbeats comes another sound a loud moan resonating deep from within Shelly. Then a sound worse then that. The man's voice joins her's. You watch the pink cave rush by once more then everthing stops moving. You turn slowly and in the darkness peer at what you believe will be your last pathetic sight. Then it comes. All at once a torrent of white cream spews from the man's penis. The bubble your in fills instantly as your crushed against the latex. You flail desperately in the thick fluid but thier's nowhere to go. You think to yourself what a horrible way to die. You then blackout as the condom is peeling away.</span></div></div>",

When you come too your staring straight at the cieling. You try to look to your side but quickly find you cant. In fact you can't move any part of your body. You slowly begin to realize where you are. The same place you were when you blacked out. On top of another man's dick. the world shifts your rightside up now at least. The man must be standing now. he begins making his way into the other room. Each step he takes causes his penis to bounce which quickly makes you feel deathly ill. When he comes to a stop he's standing over the toilet. You see his giant arm extend out and lift the seat up. Then his hand curls back and scratches something a little below where you are stuck sending you bobbing again. After a long exhalation you hear a rumbling, then like an explosion a bright yellow stream comes shooting out right below you. The stream was a wide as yourself and you'd hate to be caught in it. A voice from the other room echo's in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could of closed the door you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom directly above you comes a rumbling reply which you have difficulty making out over the roaring column of piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe, didn't think you cared. Wanna go again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last comment made your blood run cold. Doubtful you could survive another thrashing like that. The column of urine trickled down to nothing. Looking far below you could see the yellow lake still rippling from the last stray drops. Then the man apparently shook the excess off as you bounced up and down again. The man turned offering you a new view. Shelly had come into the bathroom and was fixing her hair in the mirror. Of course your view was limited to the lower portion of her body. Her ass still glistened with sweat, from your perch it seemed to be some distant landmark like an oddly smooth rock formation. Then it got a lot closer. As the man moved up behind Shelly you were forced aswell. Your view was suddenly filled entirely with her ass. Then still closer her cheeks closed in around you until finally your pressed against her soft wet flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do it right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man slowly bent Shelly over the bathroom counter. You felt the familiar thump of a heartbeat as you were being pressed harder into her rear. Then her cheeks seperated and you viewed your final destination. A pink little butt-hole came into view. Well it was not exaxtly little because it dominated most of your view. You braced again for what was going to be no doubt far worse that anything before. Your face presses up against her o-ring. You can feel it contract in suprise. Then suddenly your rushing away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm not doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly rotates now giving you a remarkable view of her landing patch. As she speaks again you thank god Shelly doesn't do anal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gunna go to sleep after this, but I'll give you one more treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once Shelly's face descends into view. It's huge, her enormous eyes showing signs of boredom. All at once you realize why she's at eye level. You scream as Shelly smiles than opens her mouth wide. He puts a hand on her head as your view is blotted out by encircling lips. It's dark and steamy inside Shelly's mouth. You blink your eyes but you still can't see. You feel her powerful tongue run over you again and again. The dried cum that was holding you on gives way just as a new loads shoots into the dank confines of Shelly's mouth. Then suddenly it's light again. Your predicament seems to have worsened even more. You realize your slowly dripping of this guys dick in a glob of wet goo. You watch in horror as Shelly swallows the first part. You see her throat work. Just a few feet away Shelly's bright red lips beckon. It looks like maybe you'll drip to the floor before Shelly can finish you off. She runs her tongue over her massive lips hungry for more. Then she lowers herself below you and opens her mouth to catch you. Theres no escape as her hot breath rushes by you you prepare for the plunge into oblivion. The drop of cum you found yourself stuck in falls splashing on Shelly's tongue then washing down her throat. Shelly swallows. The contents of Shelly's stomach that night are 6,000 pounds of some guy's semen 180 pounds of you.</span></div></div>",

As if offering a last insult one more huge drop of cum slips off the tip to fall directly on you. Then it's gone as suddenly as it appeared. Above you there is only the distant cieling. Then abrubtly your falling. The latex trap your stuck in is hurtling towards an unknown fate. Then THUD! The whole thing spills over dumping it's fresh contents and you out into the light. Picking yourself up from the puddle of disgusting ooze you look around. You appear to have been dropped in some colloseum sized container. Its brown sides appear to be woven. You suddenly recognise it. It's a wicker trash can. You saw this when you were on the bed. But something's wrong, it's to big to be just a trash can unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour getting smaller. No denying it. As you stand in the trashcan next to the condom that brought you here you try and identify your settings. There is a big tower of cotton or something like it. Oh shit, thats a tampon. You find the revelation more than disgusting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be 200 feet tall. guessing that makes me something like an eighth of an inch tall.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nYou mutter to yourself. Looking around some more you find the remains of a candy bar. It's less than a bite for that giantess Shelly, but you could live off this for weeks.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you it appears not to have been used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awakened rudely as your whole world shakes. You look up instinctively and she Shelly peering down into the garbage can. Oh no she's spotted me; you think to yourself. Then you realize she's staring at the condom not you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew thats gross, I gotta stop drinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slender fingers reach into the garbage can. With an awkward feeling of arousal you think about how one of those fingers could crush you flat without even noticing. Shelly prods the condom causing a little goo to leak out. Her gigantic hand retreats quickly. Then after a moment Shelly apparently starts walking with the wicker trashcan in tow. The bouncing just from her steps throws you off the tampon that you had been resting on and squarely into the molten bit of chocolate. You struggle in vain for a moment until the earthquake stops. Looking up you see it's daylight. Above you is only blue sky. Then your view changes. As the trashcan is turned upside down over a dark abyss. It must be a dumpster you realize as the tampon and condom tumble into the darkness. Your upside down but not falling. The chocolate your stuck in won't give. Just as you were breathing a sigh of relief you feel a jerk as the candy bar gives way. But your missing the dumpster. You seem to fall for an eternity before hitting the concrete with a splat. The chocolate broke your fall. A bit of good news. From your new perspective you watch Shelly walk away hearing each step of hers like a peal of thunder. Within moments she was miles away. With a bit of work you manage to free yourself from the grip of the chocolate. Just in time aswell. as ant comes walking up taking immidiat interest in the chocolate. Then something else catches your attention. Two children walking in this direction. The pounding of their feet was deafening as they approached. <br>\r\none untied sneaker a hundred feet tall comes crashing down just a few feat from where you are standing. You hear the voice of a young boy pounding in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember you promised. I'll show you mine if you show me yours, got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl awnsers. You stare at her bare feet on the concrete as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll do it. But you gotta do it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like where this conversation is heading. Then suddenly something else catches your eye. An ant probably the same size as you skittering across the concrete near the young girls feet. As she undoes the button on her shorts she picks up one of her bare feet and brings it crashing down on the ant. It's gone in an instant. smashed flat on the young girls sole.<br>\r\nThe boy begins to pull down his pants aswell. While you watch the young girls gaze passes over you.</span></div></div>",

Can't stop now gotta keep running. Then suddenly a mountain of flesh hits the ground in front of you. Without time to stop you plow right into it. Falling over backwards you realize the wall you just hit was the girls foot. Hitting the ground on your back you see the girls crotch almost a quarter mile above you. Then her hand descends and it all goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it to me! I saw it first! I'll tell mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy shouted.

It looks as if the boy might have neglected to wipe the last time he used the bathroom as there was debris the size of small cars littering the area and everything in a 100 foot diameter was stained brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the girls open palm you watch as she delicately brings two massive fingers down around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spit on it first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl raises you to her lips and lets a huge drip of spit land squarely on you.

You can feel his thick, powerful leg next to you, it curves inwards towards his crotch area.

Look kid, just show me what it is, and if you havent' stolen anything, I'll let you go...\" He suddenly cuts himself off with a loud yelp of pain. You guess that the boy must have stamped hard on his foot, or kicked him in the shin.<br>\r\n\"RUN!\" the  boy shouts, and a moment later, you feel your prison bouncing and jostling all around as the boy starts to run, bumping you against his leg as he runs to try and desperately get away from that adult.</span></div></div>",

Presumably the two are talking quietly, but their roars carry up to you just fine, and you realise that this is the babysitter to look after Richard while his mother is out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rules are explained as the babysitter enters, and Richard's mother prepares to show her through to the kitchen.  They will pass directly beneath your hiding spot, and it would be simplicity itself to drop down onto the head or shoulder of the babysitter as she walked by.  At your size the distance shouldn't be any trouble, and once you're that close to a woman you should be able to bypass the 'stepping on an insect' phase and get straight to talking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that's quite a jump.  The more timid may prefer to wait upstairs until the woman comes to you...</span></div></div>",

The roars of speech from this babysitter echo around you as you allow her thick hair to slide through your hands, and from the corner of your eye you can see the form of Richard rearing up as he meets with her.  For a moment you fear that he might have seen you and wants to pluck you up in his fingers again, but there's no chance of your one-eight inch form being spotted now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou out all thoughts of the larger world from your mind.  All that matters is the ear, that fleshy protuberance that your feet even now kick down against.

You stamp your foot in mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world rocks as it responds, your climbing ropes effortlessly brushed away and threatening your grip.  What was that?  There's a brief flash of a thick, rugged wall that passes by with a loud breeze, and then it crashes into the ear, rubbing against it with the intensity of a steamroller.  As you note the hardened platform scraping visible skin flakes clear to drift away, you realise that it is but a petite finger, summoned bu the minor itch you caused to sweep the hair back over the ear and have a good scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the finger of a girl is a terrifying beast!  You were lucky that she brushed you aside when she brought her hand to bear, otherwise you'd have been wiped from existence by her casual gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it seems that you may have to be careful - too much movement and even your pathetic self will be felt and squashed!  So, should you continue for the ear, knowing that?  While it's near, you could go for her hand, instead, and try to catch her eye rather than get her to hear you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, perhaps climbing anywhere right now should be out of the question.  Why not try and cling on just where you are, and wait until the girl lies down to sleep and try to get to the ear then.

Above you an eternity of bare flesh climbs up to become her leg, as naked as the rest of her monolithic body, but you have no time to admire her physique as she gets into the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot rises higher than its ever gone before, and your own feet dangle below you as you cling tight to a ledge of skin defining the print of her toe's underside.  A breeze hurtles past you, a terrifying storm to a person of your 1/8\" height.  As she carries her step forward, you cast your eyes downward to see an ocean fast approaching you, one dyed and bubbled by some cleansing liquids.  If you were to remain holding on, you might be dragged down to the bottom by the force of impact, too deep to surface before you drowned.

You've made contact, and you thrust your hands and feet deep into the gaps in the fibre, knowing that you'll soon be in for one Hell of a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anticipation is what almost kills you.  After so long expecting the very next moment to be the one where you are hefted upwards into the heavens, the actual lift comes as a total surprise.  It's a rush, that's for sure.

Here, you're isolated, alone and very, very far from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo distract yourself from the plunge, you look over your shoulder at the man in the bed.  He sprawls beneath the sheets, an insolent smirk indicating his lazy pleasure at Shelly's striptease.

The hallway is uncomprehendibly huge. It's cieling like a dark sky miles overhead. As you near the end of the hallway you suddenly hear the thunder of approaching footsteps. Quickly searching for somewhere to hide you spot a tan boulder near the wall. Quickly taking cover behind it, you watch as the titaness passes by down the hallway. When she's gone you take a look around to see if the coast is clear. You realize with dull ammusment that you were hiding behind a chereo carelessly left to rest on the hallway floor. Cautiously you make your way out into the living room. Shelly has turned on the TV and left for the kitchen. You stare up at the glowing box suddenly interested by what you heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This just in, we're recieving reports of widespread disapearances in the metro area begining early this morning.

You are intrigued by the news report. Just a hunch but you bet the disapearances are related to your situation. You then realize you gotta get out of here and figure out how to fix yourself.

It encircles you and the fabric your resting on and wrenches you from the bag. The blinding light of the room keeps you from taking in your surroundings for a moment. Then all at once as the hand releases the pile of fabric your tangled in you recognise where you are. Huge women miles tall tower around you in various states of disrobing. The giant woman you recognise as Shelly slips her thumbs in her panties and drags the down past her thighs. Her ass sways above you tight and perfect like a monument.

Even at this distance you can feel the heat coming off her genitals. A strip of hair, cleanly shaven rises up her crothch. Far above your head, Shelly's breasts sit upon her chest casting long shadows down her body. Shelly's face looks to be a mile away.

Instantly you realize it's the insole of a gargantuan sandal. Shelly's shadow falls over you again as she searches the floor for your tiny person. She sees you again and before you have time to react she reaches for the sandal you've landed on. As her massive hand wraps around it you roll off the back onto the floor.

Her hand carrying the giant whipped cream container arcs towards you. The white nozzle, it's opening as tall as you are stops a few feet away from you. Then you are knocked back by a burst of air and you watch in horror as a torrent of desert topping follows. It's like an avalanche. Instantly your buried and struggling for breath. The sweet stuff overwhelms you pressing you flat against Shelly's body. You fight your way to the surface. and tread in the creamy stuff. The brunnette smiles and then her lips part and her gaping maw approaches you. Her huge tongue licks at the cream and she swallows a truckload of it in the first pass. A massive finger sweeps past you carrying away a large chunk of cream you follow it until it disappears into Shelly's mouth. The can is back, a second huge flow of whipped cream sweeps you up in it. You manage to surface again. The brunnette is fingering Shelly her fingers moving in and out quickly. Then she spots you. Her mouth opens again her lips sliding past bright white teath. She laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There goes my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm breath washes over you.

The light again you look out past the open lips seeking freedom. All you see is another set of red lips approaching. Shelly's enourmous lips close the gap and her curious tongue slips in searching for you in long deliberate sweeps. You can feel the two giant women's breath rushing by, their playful grunts of pleasure echoing in your confines. The probing tongue finds you, and immediately sends you rushing towards another mouth. Not sure where you are, your tossed around hopelessly lost. Then light again. You are percariously perched on the brunnettes lower lip. Shelly is staring straight at you her lips still wet from the passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something on your lip, let me get it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly giggles and leans forward. As she nears she playfully bears her teath. Her mouth closes around you and her teath bite down on the lip you were resting on. You fly onto the middle of her tongue. The cavernous mouth hangs open. You can just barely make out the brunnettes face beyond the cage of teath. She taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallow him, swallow him whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva rises up all around you. Shelly's tips her head up and you start sliding towards her throat. The gaping hole waits for you. You try and grab hold of something but theres nothing to stop your fall. Her tongue slides up and blocks your exit. Then your falling, sliding down for what seems like forever. You fall into a deep cavern at the bottom lies a pool that burns your skin. Screaming in pain you watch as more whipped cream joins you. Later tonight what's left of you is splattered against the bowl of a toilet in a cheap mexican restaurant.</span></div></div>",

But oddly enough it isn't the thundering voice of one of the giants, it sounds like it's coming from somewhere on the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!

She grasps it with two fingers and raises it to her mouth. You watch it soar over and curiously stare as her lips part allowing the hundred foot thing to slide in. Glistening white teeth slice through it. A house sized crumb tumbles down impacting near you, then continuing it's long fall to the tile far below. The giantess slides the last bite into her mouth and chews slowly. You can hear each chew distinctly then the loud swallow and exhalation that follows.

It is a cardboard tube almost 150 feet long and having an opening diameter of 40 feet. You walk around to the opening and peer in. Inside about 10 feet in a wall of course cotton fibers fills the tube. Leaning up against it is a woman your size, no more than an eighth of an inch tall. She trys to cover her nude self and you instinctevely do the same. You talk calmly to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my name is John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi I'm Sarah, this is a weird place to meet, would'nt you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, speaking of which, we should...</span></div></div>",

Falling back on the cotton you look up to see the brunnettes arm soaring away towards her disatant face. You again realize what your trapped in. The air rushing over the opening of the carboard tube makes an odd wistling sound as you soar towards your destination. Looking over at your tiny friend you see tears rolling down her face as a shadow falls over both of you, she screams. You look back up again. A lacy pair of red panties barely conceals the canyon beneath. A hand apears and two adept fingers stretch the fabric back to reveal two massive lips. The same two fingers snake back and casually force their way in between the walls of flesh revealing a moist passage. Never before has it looked so intimadating. Muscles you never knew existed tighten and relax in the pink hole. You are raised higher until it dominates your vision. It moves and anticipates like a hungry mouth. The edges of your carboard container meet the skin. The smell is overwhelming. There is a moment when nothing happens, then You are pressed back into the cotton mass as it rockets upward. You are aware of pink walls rushing past you like some odd elevator shaft. Then it stops. You are aware of something. Unconciously you have wrapped your arm protectivelty around the tiny form of your female companion and she sobs quietly. It's completely dark and moist. As you wait.</span></div></div>",

You try not to stare at the mounds of flesh that ripple with every step she takes. She doesn\u2019t appear to notice the two eighth inch tall people trekking across the bench. After a few minutes you and Sarah reach the purse. It\u2019s gaping entrance looking like a promising shelter. Climbing the leather straps gets you up to the zipper with little trouble. Turning back you see that Shelly and the brunette are departing the sound of their footfalls fading into the distance. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A purple object roughly the size of a blimp dominates most of the space. You turn to Sarah who blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lonely nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles. You find yourself feeling quite inadaquate all of the sudden when faced with the 300 foot long phallis. The floor of the purse is littered with an obstacle course of loose change, breath mints, a massive cell phone, several items of a female nature which serve as a painful reminder of scale. After a few minutes of exploration you hear several voices outside the purse, after a moment they are joined by more voices and the sound of pounding feet and squeking sneakers. You are both instantly terrified and confused. These are male voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this was a girl's lockeroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends, in the afternoons the highschool football team works out here and use this locker-room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croud of giants quickly aproaches. The first few thighs sweep by in bright athletic shorts. From the opening in the purse you can see dozens of players streaming into the locker-room. A huge hand, veins bulging out reaches towards you. Four long fingers wrap around the purse straps. Suddenly your whole world shifts as the purse is unceremoniously dropped to the floor. It hits with an impact that throws Sarah and you to the ground. Then suddenly your deafended by a loud rumbling whine. Looking to your left you realize that purple vibrator has sprung to life awaked by the impact. It pivots as if moving out of its own free will and begins sliding towards Sarah. She screams and dodges out of the way as the thing rolls onto the spot she was just lying. Then again the huge hand reaches. This time it grasps the vibrator pulling it free of the purse. One finger with an untrimmed and dirty nail brushes Sarah sending her tumbling backwards. A thundering voice belonging to a stocky blonde highschooler fills your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey check it out, some chick left her dildo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shutup.

Leaning up against it's sticky surface you smell it's one of those unlikely combination of flavors, like almond apple or something like it. Just as you get into the secure shadow of the bar you see the giant brunette lean over the bench to pick up the red bra lying on the tile floor opposite. As she stretchs to reach the article her long breasts still unclad swing over only a few hundred feet up. Her perky nipples seem to be almost reaching out to you. Then just as quickly she has retreated overhead with the titanic red bra in hand. Looking around again you notice something strage. about a hundred feet down the side of the half-eaten nutrition bar you see another figure just like yourself apparently useing the morsel as cover as well. He is nude like you, but you try and ignore that in the interest of talking to him. You jog down the side of the bar to him. He is short, middle aged and balding, his pale shaking demeanor suggests he has not adapted to the stresses of being an eighth of an inch tall as well as you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm John, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak slowly and deliberately to the shaken man. He turns towards you fright still in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're monsters! Huge monsters. Why me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa calm down buddy. They're just women who don't even know we're here, so just stay calm and will get out of this fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man does not seem comforted by your words. You can hear the footsteps of the giant brunette pounding back and forth. Then her shadow falls over the bar again. The man starts to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit she knows we're here! She's gonna kill us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! I'm making a break for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can stop him the terrified balding man bolts from the shadow and starts running across the bench. As his tiny form sprints across the bench you watch helplessly as a single finger with a brightly painted red nail comes down on the man. You hear him stumble and scream as the massive finger rushes toward him. Then his scream is cut off with a sickoning crunch. a tiny spot of blood as bright red as the woman's nail oozes out. The murderous finger rises back into the heavens sluffing off a few crushed deformed limbs. The man is gone in an instant, crushed both deliberately and without a care from the brunette godess. Before you are even sure of what's going on two tremendous fingers curl around the building sized nutrition bar lifting it with terrible ease. You turn and watch the bar disappear in two short bites from the godess above you. Staring as she thoughtfully chews and swallows, her throat bobbing slightly as the tons of nutritious snack slide down. As you contemplate running again the brunette turns her attention on you. Your not sure if she knew you were here all along or just noticed, but already one of her massive hands is flying towards you. In a mere instant her finger is hovering over you. Looking up you spot the crushed remains of her previous victem. You can still make out his general shape even though every bone in his body is broken. A few drops of blood rain down splattering the bench around you. Peaking up you can see the bruntette's cruel boredom plainly on her face. With a small coy smile she brings her finger down slowly. You scream at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger comes down silencing you finally. The brunette raises her fingertip and smears your remains around with her thumb as Shelly walks back into the locker-room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lying flat on your back on the cold lockerroom bench you watch as the woman's backside settles towards you. You are in awe of the sheer scale of everything. Right as it hits you feel an uncontrolable tightening in your pants. All at once you feel a huge weight press down apon you. It feels as if your chest will collapse at any moment. You are aware of a radiating heat and smell that is overpowering. You've encountered it before but never in such intensity, her fragrence is forcing it's way into your nostrils. You can't move at all pressed flat against the bench seat, Then you feel the weight begining to ease off. You feel your back peeling off the finished wood then you are in the air the bench flying out of view. You are stuck to Shelly. Glancing around you see that you are sheltered between two towers of thighs falling away to the tiled floor a mile away. The soft skin your stuck two is a bright pink. Getting an idea of your surroundings you see to your right the other giant lip of her pussy like the door to some Airport hanger. Following that up you spot her clit peaking out like a cottage nestled in a ravine. Only everything is upside down. The only thing keeping you from plumeting to your unnoticed death on the tile floor is the sticky sweat adhering you to Shelly's privates. Far above you Shelly's voice echos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, gotta pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou here the brunette respond. This is not going to be fun. You wonder how much Shelly has had to drink today. You see the floor rotate beneath you as Shelly begins to walk. Her thighs rotate around you like huge canyon walls. Each time she brings her foot down on the tile below your nearly jarred free. You count the steps to keep your mind occupied. 1...2...3... After only a few dozen steps you manage to spot a porceilon rimmed lake come into view. Then all at once you are descending, the wind rushing by at a deafening roar. You watch her powerful thighs easily guide herself down. You crane your head and watch the descending ass in the reflection on the water. You try to spot yourself but can't even find yourself on the woman's underside. The water goes dark as Shelly settles herself on the seat. Whatever happens next you are front and center.</span></div></div>",

(this is something she does every day) Does she look relaxed? (She doesn't know there's a tiny person helplessly adhered to her pussy) Does she look thoughtful? (Maybe she just came in here to think). You wonder why any of this matters, then you here a rumbling. It seems distant at first. You always associated rumbling noises with natural disasters, then again in the right place at this scale Shelly could cause one hell of a natural disaster. You once saw Old Faithful when you were a kid, you were awed by the sheer power of it. Seeking for someway to predict what your about to see you visualize an upside down old failful wedged between Shelly's pussy lips. Then it happens, the rumbling grows louder as Shelly's bladder relaxes, in fact you can feel the entire muscle structure your attached to suddenly quiver than relax. A column of urine bursts from her womanhood directly right of you. Obviously the old faithful comparison failed because this rushing stream is wider then a grayhound bus and must be aproaching the sound barrier as it hurtles towards the water. You are shaken back and forth by the power of it. The stream dances right and left spraying stray drops big enough to fill backyard pools. One of those drops explodes out and hits you solidly weakening the bond holding you to Shelly from hurtling into the geyser below. The sea of water beneath this Huge display is rapidly turning a bright shade of yellow. As the acrid smell fills your lungs you yet agian wonder what it is like from Shelly's perspective. Hearing just the monotone \"tinkle\" in the toilet she is so accustumed to. She has no idea that she is coming close to drowning a grown man unintenionally. The stream starts to drift off. The lips your stuck to contract squirting the remainder into the lake below. Then just a few stray drops fall away into the darkness. You gaze back up at the only light coming in from between her legs. Then you watch as a cloud of white rushes toward you. Bewildered you remember the girls tend to wipe after they pee. The cloud drifts towards you suspended on Shelly's massive hand. It swoops up to wipe away the glistening golden drop still clingling to her just like you. Without least ounce of gentleness the cloud of tissue smashes you against the warm wet skin than without mercy drags you back over her pink asshole (which is much larger than you). Then you are falling. Light works its way around Shelly's retreating ass like the end of an eclipse. The tissue yourriding hits the water. Suddenly it's no longer a graceful cloud but a clinging mat of disintegrating pulp in a sea of urine. As you struggle to tread water you see Shelly's hand reach for the flush. Her last gift to you. Her day has just begun, but as the pool your in begins to fall yours is apparently over.</span></div></div>",

Everything is lit softly by the light streaming in from between Shelly's thighs. It is an entire upside down landscape made up entirely of the most sought after anatomy on a woman. An entire world to you made up by only four inches of Shelly. Stuck fast on this gigantic labia there is nothing to do but wait and expect the worst. You are aware of some movement. It seems as if the world your on is rotating. Coming up back into the light you watch as you are raised back into the canyon formed by Her spreading thighs. Her legs looking like buttes of the finest sandstone seem to quiver. Shelly is reclining back for some reason. Looking up you see her hand descending, fingers outstretched. As it aproaches cautiosly you are wowed by it's size and grace. The pointer finger angles down and touches the cottage sized clit ever so slightly. From your perspective it is met with an earthquake, Shelly's shudder of pleasure rocks her whole body. The massive finger hits the clit again this time not stopping. Another hand suddenly runs up the inside of her thigh and waists no time. The tip of one finger much larger than yourself plows into you rubbing you against the warm flesh. It's determined strength slides you to the right. Shelly's other massive hand rubbing her clit in steady deliberate strokes. You realize that Shelly is unwittingly going to make you a part of what she had intended to be a solo event. Your sliding closer to the rift between her massive Lips. You know full well what awaits you. The finger slides into the gap carrying you with it. Instantly you are plunged inside her a hundred feet. When the finger retreats you are lft inside. At this angle your sliding deeper inside her massive cunt. The walls are hot and slick with juices. It's dark and you are at the mercy of heavy contractions that rack the girls vagina everyfew seconds. The offending finger penatrates again bringing with it light. It lunges towards you, a powerful serpant flexing up into the cieling of the tunnel causing another wave of spasms. You slide deeper yet propelled by the rocking of your fleshy prizon. You land on a boulbous jutting of flesh almost twenty feet across. You search the memory of your anatomy classes and realize quickly it is her cervix. A rush of fluid fills the space so now you are chest deep in the thick guey pungent liquid. High above you the fingers, three now work with scary speed. They rush in and out always accomanied by the contraction of muscles and the growing moans resonating all around you. The whole cave is shudering, trembling with anticipation as you slosh around in the milky liquid. Then the fingers retreat but the trembling continues. As you watch helplessly every muscle contracts with crushing power. Suddenly your propelled forward. The walls of her vagina rush by then you are airborne along with tons of womanly fluids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly's moan seems to propell you. The stream arcs through the air hurtling towards the tile floor. It hits sending you sliding across the green tile dripping in her explosion. You look up scooping the goo from your eyes to see Shelly stand to her full height still breathing hard. Her face flushed from the rush of passion, a lone drop of her cum falls and hits the floor between her tremendous legs. You watch unable to get up in the sticky stuff. You watch as she takes a step forward to return to the locker room. Her foot slamming down on the tile infront of you. Then her other foot rocks forward casts it's incomprehensibly large shadow over you and steps down. Instantly you are reduced to a tiny spot of blood in Shelly's cum, easily mistaken for a bit of menstrel left overs when the janitor mops you up later.</span></div></div>",

Just as your deciding you might aswell head back to the hallway you here someone coming towards the room. You realize that so close to the door if someone comes in you'll likely be crushed underfoot.

Her bare foot falls just a short distance from you. The concussion of the impact throwing you from your feet. No she hasn't seen you. Not wasting any time you get up and start running. Sprinting as fast as you can away from her and into the room. You then realize your mistake, with each step she covers a football field's length. You look up. Craning your neck around you see the bottom of a tremendous foot moving at incredible speed. You hear the rush of air as it rises above you. Far, far above you see her crotch wrapped in pink fabric. For an awkward instant you think those must have been the same panties you were climbing in a few minutes ago. Then her foot comes crashing down. This time you see the heel as Shelly moves over you. The impact again sends you sprawling on the hard wood floor. She takes another step and is past you. Not thinking for an instant your out of danger you start running again, this time veering to the right to hopefully avoid Shelly's return trip. As you look back at Shelly the unwitting goddess you run straight into something. Instead of bouncing off you stick right to it. Your try to struggle free but your held fast by something sticky. It gives off a strong lemon scent. You then realize what it is. In all your rush to get away from the pounding feet of Shelly you ran straight into a sucker. A yellow house sized candy treat misplaced on the hardwood floor.

You can feel the tremor as her feet hit the floor. She could'nt be much older than 4 or 5, but even at that young age she must be approaching a thousand feet tall. So Shelly has a kid, wonderful. This is becoming a family affair. Shelly's daughter immediately starts walking towards you. Each step louder than the last as her light blue socks with frills come thundering towards you. You prepare for the worst. Closing your eyes you imagine the girl scooping the sucker up with you still attached then... Then the thundering steps are getting farther away now. Shelly's daughter walks right past you and out the door to the hallway. You breathe a sigh of relief. She is out of sight down the hallway. That was a close one. Then as if on cue the footsteps return. Shelly's daughter steps back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I put that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic child questioned aloud. You hope she's refering to a toy or a shoe or anything but the piece of candy sitting on the floor with a very unlucky passenger. Then it becomes apparent this young girl wants candy for break fast. Two more thunderous steps forward then a child's hand reachs towards you. The huge fingers wrap around the stick starting to wrench it from the floor. It takes a moment for the girl to free it, but when it gives  it begins the long accent to her face. Your dizzy and sick immediately, rising a thousand feet in the span of two seconds. stuck fast you have nothing to do but stare at the child who will probably be digesting you in a few short moments. In a futile attempt to prolong you life you call out to the titan of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know where I've been.\"</span></div></div>",

So you are crushed further into it, your ears and bones pounded mercilessly.  The fingers of the girl drop the stick, and the tower falls with a crash to the ground.  The echoes and tremors of her retreating footsteps shake your damaged self, although your hearing has not fully recovered.  Her bellows of \"Mo-o-om!\" are but a faint whisper in the distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope that the fall may have shaken you loose are dashed.  Drawing in a choking breath, you expel it with a curse, struggling for all you're worth and finding nothing new other than a pain over your entire form.  The lolly begins to wobble slightly, the massive structure beginning to bounce as an approaching behemoth draws ever closer.  Wrenching your head toward the doorway, you can see Shelly stomping into sight, her daughter behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seems to have dressed herself since last you saw her, her bare feet topped by a worn set of mom-jeans - and why not, since she is a mother?  Knowing for a fact that she's twenty-one, her having a four-year-old daughter implies that she made more poor life choices than just that dude who thrust you inside her last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly paces closer, her feet rising and falling in slow motion, each one a power beyond your imagination.  As your ears begin to function again, you can hear her scolding words: \"I told you not to eat things you find on the floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both feet planted firmly before you, she stoops, her hand reaching for your prison.  Those fingers are more than twice the size of the girl's, and at only an eighth of an inch tall yourself, they could smother trains.  The usually delicate pads of forefinger and thumb pinch the shaft, even that motion shaking your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are wrenched skyward once again, your screams nothing before this giantess, before this goddess, before this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisapproving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive eyes narrow as they inspect you, and Shelly tuts.  \"See?  Nasty little bugs like this crawl over things you leave on the floor, so you should not pick them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate her point, the mother casually waves the lollipop in front of her daughter's face.  For you, another nightmare journey at incredible speeds, shaken to and fro by immense force, overseen by a humiliatingly huge little girl, who sticks her tongue out in disgust at your puny self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remains now is to discover how you will be killed...</span></div></div>",

Her hot breath rolls out over you like a warm sea breeze. She rests the sucker on her tongue as her cavernous mouth starts to close again. The surface of her tongue is rough on your skin as your drenched in saliva. In the pitch blackness your tossed back and forth carelessly by the huge tongue. Then your pulled quickly back out into the light. Blinking you see the girls massive lips wet with saliva dominating your view. Then after a moment the sucker is again unmercifuly plunged into the girls waiting mouth. This time the sucker does not pause at the tongue. You can just barely make out a row of teeth approaching. As the teeth come down on the waiting lolly pop you slip free falling down beside her tongue. There is and incredible explosion as the sucker is crushed between the girls molars. Then light again, you see what maybe your last chance. The stick that held the sucker now clad with only a few chunks of candy is being retracted out of the girls mouth. bracing your self between the side of the tongue and a tooth you manage to lift yourself back on top of the tongue. Taking a few steps your window of opportunity is closing. The stick is now moving out of her mouth as her lips begin shutting again. In an amazing feat you jump and catch yourself dangling limply on the end of the retreating stick. The girls lips slide shut behind you. You hear her chew a few more times on fragments of sucker than swallow. You congradulate yourself on a daring stunt that saved your life. An amazing jump of ten feet which in actuality was a less than impressive quarter inch. You get a better hold on the stick preparing for the inevitable plumit into a garbage can or back to the floor. Looking down you realize that holding on to a lolly pop's stick a thousand feet up is less than safe. Then you start moving. preparing for the fall you brace yourself, but your moving in the wrong direction. Your not falling your going back. Turning you see the 4 year olds looming mouth open once more. As it closes again with you inside you quickly lose the grip you had on the stick. Your hit with a wave of saliva still reaking of lemon lolly pop. Then you feel the tongue move beneath you. In a cascade of Spit you tumble towards the girls throat. There is nothing to arrest your fall as you plumit into the darkness of the little girls belly. A few minutes later a truckload of chereos and milk join your digesting remains. In a few hours time a quarter inch tall skeleton will get to join in the joys of potty training.</span></div></div>",

There, she picks up her conversation with two other young women you recognize to be Gina and Alexandra. Quite beautiful, they are called the \"Ice Queens\" by the guys they have rejected as they are a reknown lesbian couple.

Although the slippery ground is fighting you, its uneven nature gives you enough footholds to make steady progress. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You have only finished one third of the trip when everything around you gets into motion, forcing you to lie low on the wall. As you hear a big \"<b>Splosh</b>\", you automatically look towards the swamp below, which is in great turmoil. Raising your head, you can see the gate to the esophagus open again among the tremors, revealing a load of liquid that drops into the swamp as single big block. After releasing that mass, the opening immediately shuts, only to widen again moments later to allow the next gulp to pass. You think you can sense the smell of beer in the putrid air, but with the incredible stench all around you, it is really hard to say for sure. Tearing yourself away from the spectacle, you slowly inch on towards your safe haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A while later, the girl seems to be done with her beer, and things become calm again. Despite of this, you don't dare to hasten things. After all, she will probably get a new beer soon enough, and there is still that ominous stomach movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, you reach the fold and find that it is just big enough for you to lie in it. Although a far cry from being a safe spot, it should help you relax and recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After you have settled down, you turn your head to look down over the ocean below and allow your mind to wander. You consider how unreal this situation is, you actually being inside another person's stomach, mysteriously shrunken to a ridiculous size. Will you be able to get out of all of this alive and return to your normal size? Or will you be stuck like this till the end of your days or maybe even shrink to nothingness like that man in that b/w movie? There are still so many things you want to do, you need to do. You can't just die now. But is there really anything you can do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your thoughts are interrupted by a sudden jolt that makes you lose your balance. In the very last moment, you are able to cling to the fold. The esophagus hasn't opened, but everything is in chaos nonetheless. You wonder whether your host may be throwing up, which wouldn't really surprise you, but after some more rocking and throwing, you come to the conclusion that it must be something else, leaving only those \"stomach movements\". They are quite violent, but after a while you have figured them out well enough to stay inside the fold and not automatically drop out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ages later, the chaotic movements of your surroundings are invaded by a sudden shift of gravity. The wall housing the fold you have been resting during the past hours suddenly turns into the ceiling as you drop into the swamp below. Your futile cry is cut short as you hit the surface and immediately go under. Panicked, you kind of dog- paddle back up. As you can breathe air again, you struggle to calm down again. You succeed in whiping the goo out of your eyes and turn your head around to get some orientation. Everything has shifted, and the former walls are far up above you, while the gate to the esophagus beacons you on the top of a gentle slope that's not really a climb. Delighted at the prospect of getting out of this prison, new strength flows through your body and you start swimming. But you haven't come very far, before your surroundings shift again, all angles changing. Then they do it again. As the sea gets too rough to make any progress, you can only concentrate on keeping your head above the surface. Finally, things seem to have settled down. The slope is a bit steeper that before, but shouldn't be a problem. Climbing out of the goo, you are so excited you don't stop to recover your breath but rather stumble towards the exit. The muscle ring guardening is tightly shut, but there seems to be a small opening between the glistening walls that you might be able to squeeze through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the courage of despair you start shoving your body between the hot flesh. You feel it constrict you from all sides, making it hard to breath. But you are lucky and succeed in entering the esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The walls that have mercilessly forced you down into the girl's stomach are now forming a smooth, slightly tilted tunnel you can simply walk along. Nothing betrays the enormous strength that hides beneath them. The air is a bit cleaner here, lacking the stench of acid. Thus you can make out more diverse smells of her hosts meal - all covered by a serious alcoholic stench. Fearing that something unexpected may happen, you make the ascend as quick as possible. By now, you have really exhausted yourself, your heartbeat seems to be splitting your head. Still, you carry on. Finally, you reach the mouth, a huge cavern with a pink whale, the tongue, resting against its side wall. And ahead, ringed by large, white boulders, you see an opening in her lips. This unbelievable luck gives you a final boost, making your heavy legs obey you again so that you can run to what seems a fata morgana you mustn't trust. But then you feel the cold air on your face. You have escaped Tartaros.</span></div></div>",

Now that I drifted over to a quiet area of the bar, its a plunge to certain death for me!</i>. He closed  his eyes and waited for death to claim him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nDeath, however took a holiday. Instead he found himself bouncing and rolling to a stop. Head still spinning, John shakily got to his feet. He quickly glanced around - a large dark cave with light streaming in from overhead. The smell of leather and a slight twinge of musk permeates the air. It's warm, a thick feeling in the air. And then in a flash it dawned on him -\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>Oh my god, I'm standing inside someone's SHOE! I'm so dead.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nKneeling down, he examined the embossed letters on the floor of the shoe - a gigantic \"S\" - the first part of the word 'Sketchers' - The second revelation in as many minuets - the letters were larger than he was. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>Yup - I am *SO* dead.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHuge, booming voices filter down from above. John realized that this shoe was not going to remain still -  or unoccupied for long. As he started to make his was towards the rim and freedom, there is a flurry of motion. He painlessly tumbles towards the opening end of the shoe. Rolling over on his back, he gazed into the reason for his pratfall. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nLooming far above him was young girl - probably about late teens or early 20's, with long brown hair tied back into a ponytail. The next thing he saw was her blue polished toes curling over the back of the shoe and shifting it back and forth in a playful manner. The girl wasn't even looking at her shoe, and it damn near killed him. A few moments later, she shoved her foot just a bit further into the shoe, making the tips of her toes lightly touch the sole. At least lightly to her. Meanwhile, Death awaited just a few feet (on John's scale) behind and above him\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sorry, lady - but you'll be the death of me\", he says as he slowly edged around the gigantic foot. Wisdom wins out over fantasy - this girl could kill you in an instant, and not even notice. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe walked quickly away from the opening in the shoe to the toe end. The going was made difficult by the constant movement of the ground. Meanwhile, the giant continued to fidget with her footware. John threw a quick glance over his shoulder - the girl with the blue nails had grasped the heel of the shoe between her toes. She didn't lift, content in rocking the footwear back and forth. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRegardless, John picked up the pace - this lazy motion could change in the blink of an eye. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen it dawns on him - relatively fresh air, no heavy musk smell, no wear and tear - <i>I'm inside a brand new shoe</i>. He reached down, touching the massive rubber ground. The material gave slightly under his touch. \"Hmmm, no sign of imprints - must be hot off the press new.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs John walked, he glanced around, eyes on the wall. He quickly came to the conclusion that there's no just other way out. You are in a dead end. There are no eyelits to slip out of. <i>Perhaps a break in the shoes seam was too much to hope for, huh?</i> he mused. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nNo, there was only one way for it - back towards the girl and her foot. Out the opening, hoping that he didnt get killed along the way for his trouble.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen - the shaking stops. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn spun around!\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The common noise of the city is surrounding you and movement is everywhere. The night has been mediocre. It was safe, but the ground was hard and cold and you are feeling a bit stiff. As you start stretching your body you notice some movement around the tree. Some big monsters are jumping around picking at the ground. You are shocked when you realize that it's just some sparrows.

It is all true.  Well, I know for a fact that the Brobdingnagian section is true, the rest could indeed be a work of fiction.  Anyway, following the loss of her little man, the little nurse became determined to followhim out into the world so that she could marry him, as she had always intended to do.  Of course, Brobdingnag is completely cut off from the rest of the world because of the inhospitable rocks.  Only a boat to the scale of Gulliver's race of Europeans could bypass them in safety.  So, the little nurse dedicated her life to finding a way of reducing herself in size.  Not just for the sake of leaving her land, but also for Gulliver's sake.  He had been reluctant to marry her before, but if they were the same size, he would have to agree, yes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, for many years the little nurse worked with the sorcerers of the king's court, and in time she bound a ring with the power to control the wearer's size.  Stealing away from court at the dead of night, she escaped in a small boat that she had constructed herself.  She was soon picked up by a British ship and, knowing enough of English from her discussions with Gulliver, was able to get passage to England.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She never found Gulliver, but did in time find for herself a man with whom she was content to settle down and have children.  Alas, calamity struck, and the ring was stolen from her, but she didn't care, because she was content to stay the size that she was.  Over the generations this tale has been told to her descendants, and each has been aware of their ancient heritage, though less have believed as the centuries crawled on.  I believe.  I spent years tracking the ring of my several times great grandmother, even moving here with my daughter when I learnt that it was in America.  You found it, didn't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, still trying to digest all of this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's gone now of course?  My researches have told me that the ring will eventually choose a host for its powers, shrinking you down to its own size and ceasing to exist itself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you now have the ring's power?  maybe this won't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't get too excited.  You can't control that power, and neither can I.  But I still need you.  The ring was more than a mass reducer, it was also a compass, that would point unerringly back towards Brobdingnag.  So you can lead me back there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The blood of giants runs in my veins, so I deserve better than this.  Back in the land of my ancestors, I can find a way to restore myself to my proper size, the proper size for normal people, and then tell my countrymen of ways in which they can travel the world, and bring you vermin under proper control.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's grinning now, and not looking at you.  Ranting, she believes that it would be a good thing for a race of giants to take over the world.  Doesn't sound too good to you.  It would be better for the world if you didn't help her to go home.  Though now that the ring is gone, this is the only hope that you have to restore your own size.  But can you really risk sacrificing the world to save your own hide?  If you do get to Brobdingnag and manage to become restored, you'll still be tiny in that land.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if you planned on escaping, this will be the only opportunity, while 'Glum' (if that is her real name) is spouting out her mealomaniacal plans for teaching the giants how to build planes and helicopters, suitably distracted.  If you want to help her with her plan, you have to do nothing but wait for her to finish.</span></div></div>",

Or how pale you are, you're not sure which.  You squeeze yourself between the two warm walls where the strap of the sandal divides the biggest toe from the others.  There is no smell here, somewhat surprisingly, the strap is something to hold onto in case of an emergency and you can't help but feel a little turned on at the feeling of these humongous extremities around you.  You look up, but see only darkness within the folds of the dress that lie above the pillars that are the ankles.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen there is silence where before was the constant drone of passing vehicles.  This is soon followed by a lurch as the foot sets of on its journey.

Many, many giants pass you by, on their way to work or school, wherever they have a pressing need to be.  You refrain from jumping onto any of their feet, even those of the attractive women, knowing that they're not heading where you want to go.  You keep your eyes fixed on one horizon, the one opposite the direction in which university lies, looking for a familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much time has passed before your hopes are fulfilled.  Seeing first the face, and then the rest of the body as she gets closer, you get yourself ready for the necessary run and jump.  It's going to be hard scaling a moving target, and evn harder to run through this crowd first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancesca, your saviour, you know from a mathematics class.  She is peruvian, and an openly talking woman who can go a bit far when drinking.  She is, however, a good friend.  In fact, you can't think of anybody that knows her that doesn't like her.  She wouldn't have been your first choice for a ride, or a potential help, but you'll take what you can get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is currently wearing a black woolen cardigan over a low cut purple top, and a dark ankle length purple skirt decorated with orange flowers.  Over her feet she is wearing open-toed black mules, and over one shoulder she has her black fluffy handbag.  Her other hand holds a ring binder, so you can deduce fairly happily that she is on her way to the uni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets closer, close enough that you can't see beyond her knees and can hear the flapping noise of her footwear hitting her heel as she puts her foot down on each step, you begin your run.  Only one man comes between you, but his shoes miss you by quite a wide margin, and soon you are jumping for the edge of the shoe as it hits the ground.  Your timing is spot on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the toe end, the mule is half the height that it is at the heel.  It's still just over a head taller than you, however.  Not being the most athletic of people, your hopes of leaping atop it in a single bound were hopelessly optimistic, but your fingertips do grip the edge.  The foot takes off again before you can pull yourself up, but against the odds you keep yourself there.  On the next impact you take advantage of the brief stillness to scuttle up and take shelter near the towering, dark skinned toes.  Using your previous experience of foot riding, you manage to find a relatively comfortable spot, nuzzled close beneath the paler undersides of the toes, where you can lie down and try to contain the food that you have not long ago ingested.  The warmth is nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world swirls around you, no hope of you discerning where you're going this time.  Instead you try to think, try to come up with a plan of action for contacting Fran.  You could just wait until she looks down at her toes, but that could be forever.  Plus, of course, she's one of those women that can't keep her feet still when sitting down, either rotating them around on their ankles when she crosses her legs, or slipping them out of their shoes to stretch them and wiggle her toes.  Neither of those bodes well for your chances of survival.  Alternatively, you could be more pro-active, and try climbing, or get off her completely when you get to her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of which, you still aren't exactly sure where Fran's going...</span></div></div>",

The only danger would be the large number of large boys and girls that would quite happily pull your arms and legs off, and then only if they fail to accidently step on you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt would be much safer to stay here with the mother.  If it is her mother.  You realise that you don't know what relation they are - she could be the girl's mother, an older sister or even just a baby sitter.  The only way to find out would be to ride her foot to its journey's end.  It's going to be a rough ride, but if you survive there should eb some food, or at least someone mature to get help from.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

You crash hard.  So hard that you don't even feel it when the bag is suddenly lifted up, and the girl heads off for the lunchroom.  Don't feel it when the bag is offloaded.  You finally stir just as the girl finishes her sandwich, and you cry out as you see the girl lift the brownie and start to eat it.</span></div></div>",

The sandalled foot crashes down between you and the scorpion, throwing you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, it is similar to the one that you rode in on, only its owner is paler and, you think, just a bit smaller in scale.  She is wearing a long blue dress, with what looks like a flower pattern upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you are grasped in fingers, only these are much bigger than the boy's.  She seems to be applying less pressure though, and you are at least able to breathe.  From your vantage point, held between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand, you peer past the whorled surfaces to see the scorpion held by the tail in the other.  Around, boys are getting to their feet, and you discover that you are being held above their heads.  Probably not a good idea to look down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, instead, you move as much as you can to allow yourself to see the face of your saviour.  Her young, open face is surrounded by a mass of strawberry blonde, curly hair.  Perhaps she's a teacher here, you guess.  You are proven correct when she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, boys, how many times have I told you?  If you want to see Boris eat, you can wait until his feeding time, like everybody else!  You certainly don't take him out of his cage!  What would have happened if he' stung one of you, eh?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys don't seem to have any answer to this, although a few mumble sorrys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, run along now and play and we'll say no more about it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are in motion, carried along at neck height by the woman.  You see crowds of kids pass by beneath you, some looking at you or Boris, others concentrating on their youthful games.  The entrance to the school loom before you, and she effortlessly ascends what would have been an impenetrable cliff of doom to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you are in a classroom, the alphabet running along the top of the wall above the blackboard.  You see the right hand lowering Boris into a large glass tank filled with broken vegetation, with a scattering of sand at the bottom.  Then you are live with fear; what if she intends to feed you to this creature?  You escaped from a sparrow's belly, yes, but a scorpion is bound to chew its prey into smaller pieces...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are relieved when you see her move away from Boris' lair.  She briefly raises you to her face and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now let's get you back you belong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you are ecstatic; she's seen you, and she wants to help!  But as you see what she holds in her right hand now, you realise that she is performing that trick so beloved of women everywhere; talking to a pet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops you, and you fall into the high sided plastic cup that she holds, along with the swarms of miscellaneous creepy crawlies already there.  You plunge into the mass head first, and are soon fending off antennae from a dozen admirers.  Clearly, this is Boris' food supply - he likes it live.  You came here looking for food, and it seems that you're now set to become it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brief moment of freedom, you look up to see the woman's face covering the entrance, smiling down at you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time to put you somewhere where little hands can't get to you.' she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no!  She's going to put the cup high up on a shelf somewhere!  If she does that, you've got no chance of getting down!

Standing right in front of you is the cat, and it has its eyes fixed on you. For some time you stare at the cat too terrified to move, and the cat stares back with its tail flicking back and forth.

You scream in terror as the cat quickly scoops you up into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself lying on the cat's giant tongue, completely in the dark.

The cat savors your delicious flavor for a few more moments and then its tongue starts to settle down. Unfortunately, that's when it starts to push towards the back of the throat, and you scream in terror again. Then the cat tilts its head back and with a loud gulp swallows you whole. You slowly travel down the esophagus to your final destination. It feels like you're going down a slimey waterslide though, as you become drenched in more saliva. Eventually your journey comes to an end as you land in the stomach with a plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the stomach too terrified to even try and save your life. Soon the digestive jucies begin to flow and start going to work on you. Fortunately you pass out from a lack of air as you start to be digested; thus saveing you from much excrutiateing pain.

The sparrow has relieved itself in midflight, sending you falling down towards a dark grey surface. You scream as you hit it. Although it turns out to be water, the impact is still cruel. Your head spins, and everything hurts. But you are alive.

Fish! You suddenly remember that there are fish in the pond. For a normal- sized person just some part of the background, but at your size, they should be as big as large sharks.

Wedged deep in a grotto, you find safety from the birds. The moments stretch into what seems like hours, as the pecking and scratching draws nearer. You feel as if the mammoth sparrow is right on top of you, mere inches away. You imagine it\u2019s sharp pointed beak stabbing at pecking at your flesh.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt\u2019s all you can do not to bolt and run.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSeconds latter, it\u2019s all over. The flapping of wings indicates your safety as the bird takes flight. You make your way out of the musty hole in the ground. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>That was close. Too close.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWalking out into the bright morning sun, you look around. The tree is smack in the middle of a little patch of dirt, just a bit away from the entrance to the bar. The street lies just beyond, to your left. It\u2019s not that busy - well, compared to a downtown street. The run down cantina finds itself just on the border of town, the last bastion of civilization before the three or so miles of wilderness to the collage. This is the main drag into to the academy, so there is a fair amount of traffic - both foot and vehicle. Getting back to safety should be no problem.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter walking for an hour - and making no appreciable progress in the meantime, you eventually reach the bus stop. [i]This is going to take me days - all week![/i] That\u2019s when you spot her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe\u2019s a young girl - freshman, you\u2019d guess. Long brown hair, deeply tanned skin. Cut off shorts, leather biker jacket, black sandals, topped off by round framed sunglasses. Her attention is currently held by a thick tome with a black cover of some sort. She seems largely oblivious to the world.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>*sigh* I know where this is going.</i> you think loudly to yourself, walking slowly forward.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis sandal is huge!! The sole part is two inches thick - well above your head. On the up side, it's also covered in carved designs, making it a snap to climb. Tentatively, you start making your way up the side of her shoe. Fortunately the girl doesn\u2019t seem to be moving a lot. It must be an engrossing book.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nReaching the top, you roll over onto the flat surface of the sandal. The ledge you are standing on is about 6 feet wide. Just to your immediate right is the where the strap meets the stitching of the sole. Above you is where the strap meets the ankle. Before you is a vast wall of flesh, covered in tiny (and gigantic) lines. You reach out and touch her tough, leathery skin. Its firm under your hand.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>I wonder if she is ticklish.</i> you ponder with an evil grin, poking her foot gently. No response, of course.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou look up - this is going to be a long climb, if you choose to make it. If the bus comes along and she starts moving, you could easily be dislodged. A fall from that height would surely be lethal. Of course, hanging out at foot level all day would get you nowhere fast. It might be fun, but certainly not productive.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhat will it be, trooper?</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take you long to reach them, and there are actually no tight spots for you. Inside, you find the usual implements: some sinks, toilet stalls, and all the other crap. Currently, there is little business going on, so you check out the stalls. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The first stall is empty. The paper is gone and the strong smell from the bowl ensures that there won't be any clients using it again for some time.

It's none of your acquaintances, which is actually a reason to rejoice as this guy definitely had one drink too many (actually must have been a couple of them). He is lying on the toilet, his head hanging down its side. Vomit is everywhere and the stench is terrible. The occupant is completely obliviously to this of course, as he is fast asleep.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you reach the other side of the stall, you hear the toilet door open and someone turns on the faucet.

You are just the right size to climb the without being seen by anyone. Not that Steve would be paying any attention to anything but his own reflection as he is repairing his battered image. But you are still too slow. Before you can reach the pocket or some other improved hiding place, Steve starts moving, effectively trapping you at your current location. Climbing up or down seems too risky, but as long as you stay where you are, you should have no problem holding on to him.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can't really figure out what tune he is humming as Steve enters the disco's main area. He stops, obviously checking out the situation. While you are still considering whether you should try to continue climbing up, he starts moving again. Thanks to your higher vantage point, you are able to understand that he is heading for the bar. The noise around you is deafening and being safe doesn't mean being comfortable, as Steve's would- be cool gait just makes you feel sick. Fortunately, the distance he has to walk isn't that long in spite of the fact that he has chosen the bar's opposite end.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he sits down saying \"Feelin' lonely littl' lady?\", you are able to see a white skirt on the next seat. Seems to be your lucky day as his prey is to the right side, the one on which you are as well. Moving your eyes upwards, you get to a pink blouse with not too big a bulge in it. Black hair, and that face - not cute, but beautiful none the less. You recognize her as Sandra Miller. She is known to be a bit shy and evasive. You haven't tried to score with her - yet. Seems as if Steve is about to beat you there.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back to your present situation, you consider your options. While it looked like a good idea in the beginning, following Steve may not be the thing you want to do. For all you know, he could stay here until the next morning, or he may end up at some girl's place. Although the latter needn't be completely disappointing, it would still be of no use for your current problem in size. Maybe you should cancel operation Steve and look for someone else. On the other hand, you have already come that far, you may just as well go along for it. So what's next?</span></div></div>",

So you are not likely to find a nicer person. And Steve is your neighbor at least, which is a very valuable advantage, given your current speed while walking. If he takes his time getting home, fine, you will just hide in his pocket and wait for him to arrive there, and eventually he will, as the supply of hair gel he can carry around with him is clearly limited. Therefore, Steve it is.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While considering your options, Steve was expanding his. Using a deadly combination of small talks, jokes (some of them involuntary results of his \"cool\" image, no doubt), and some drinks, he has begun to erode Sandra's defenses. It can't be long before she will finally agree to whatever he proposes (as if we all didn't know what he was after).\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Forcing yourself to stop marvelling at that guy's powers of seduction, you go on climbing up his trousers until you reach the pocket. With an elegant move you jump into it. It is dark inside, but you are still able to see the things around you. Giving them a closer examination confirms that you would have been better off in complete darkness: at least 2 used condoms, another one that hasn't been used, the sad remains of at least one cigarette pulverized in this pocket, and some big pipe that looks suspiciously like lip stick (would figure, though). The smell is nearly unbearable, as tobacco mixes with sweat and leather and you start liking Steve even less. Since none of these items will be any help, you climb back up to the opening and peek out your head.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It turns out that this is another case of perfect timing as you are just able push your head over the rim, moments before your surroundings are starting to fly. Steve has stood up, and looking to the neighboring seat, you can see Sandra's standing form. Judging from her happy, if not blissful face, you figure that he/the drinks has/have been able to convince her for this night out with Steve. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They both leave the party without any further comment and head for the alley next to the disco. Waiting there is Steve's car, a cabriolet desperately trying to pretend to be a Buick. While the canopy is open when on the road driving, it is closed at them moment. Makes sense, you don't want to invite people to use your car as a garbage can or anything.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Steve does open the car door for Sandra and helps her take it seat after removing the canopy. You don't want to judge whether this is really gentleman- like or just considering her heightened state of awareness. After closing the door, he bolts around the car and jumps into the driver's seat without opening the door. The experience is like riding the roller coaster, and you have trouble hanging on to his pocket. This time, you are not able to contain yourself and your dinner leaves through the front door all over Steve's trousers. He doesn't notice, of course, but if he knew you'd be a goner for sure.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Turning on the radio to some country songs or something, he starts up his little baby and rolls out.

The entrance is only a small slit, and no light could possibly enter. Yet, you are able to see your surroundings. It seems, as if your new state of being has granted you some bonus ability. It is wasted now, though, as his pocket is empty save for some dirt. Come to think of it, what do you have with you? 20 dollars, a box of matches, 5 cigarettes, a ball pen. Not exactly the kind of survival gear you'd need now, but you didn't plan to get shrunk. Well, let's keep the cigarettes for later, you are really tired.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take off your own jacket and use it as a blanket.

Foot steps are coming closer, and you can see a short woman with curly red hair and grey eyes wearing glasses heading this way. You immediately recognize her as Sylvia West. In spite of her shortness and the glasses, she is quite attractive. You had considered dating her, but your friends had told you that she already had a steady friend Michael Smith or something. You have never seen that guy, but people told you that the two are about to get engaged.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvia looks really cute in that light blue blouse and short dark blue skirt.

She is more of a 'traditional' beauty, long aired and tanned, and always prepared to wear clothes than display her ample body.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn the other hand, Laura is almost the complete opposite.  Taller, but with shorter, multi-coloured hair, she dresses more conservatively.  However, she is the one that has actually talked to you the most, and is always ready with a smile on her face; Louise is certainly more morose, or at least, not as quick to humour.</span></div></div>",

In your day you had to put up with - but no, you're not going to get distracted now.  And you're certainly not going to start talking like your father...), and at your size you can feel every tremor in the floor.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLouise is now dressed in a white nightgown of about knee height, and is clearly preparing to climb into bed.  Without thinking, you rush over to her, sprinting flat out.  if you should so much as take a step in the wrong direction, you'd be history...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWith a leap you manage to clamber aboard the little toe of her right foot, and hold on across the one next to it.

You take in the intoxicating smell of it, and then suddenly wonder why you did so.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe leg swings over onto the bed, and you are thrown loose.  You land on soft white surface without injury, but then the rest of Louise's body comes crashing down upon the bed.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou are buffeted around, and lucky not to be totally flattened under her bulk.  Then everything goes dark.  Looking up, you see that Louise has pulled her quilt over herself, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing to worry about.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou seem to have ended up pretty much where you began, next to her foot.  Judging from its position, bearing in mind that it's dark, you judge that she is lying on her side.  As you could never hope to lift the incredible weight of the sheet, you are forced to stick close to where she lies in order to keep under the tent-like space that spreads about an inch (her scale) from her.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk up her, rubbing one hand along her leg as you go.  You're amazed at how smooth it is; you'd never have guessed that she was THIS anal retentive about shaving her legs.  It feels good.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou pass into a darker area, now under both the quilt and the nightdress.  Ahead, you see that she is wearing panties as well.

The longer we delay, the smaller my chances of finding the ring become - no pun intended.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Or we could wait until morning, consult with Louise and see if she has any ideas.

A few moments, and it has righted itself, holding a hand to its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Told you that the restroom windows are never locked.'

Standing up, you're dwarfed by the size of Laura's acoustical organ. The skin is soft and supple. you can smell a faint trace of peaches in the air.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTaking handful of steps forward, you speak firmly into the ear. \"Hello! I am . . . um\" you stumble for a name \"Zelgadis.\" Yeah, that sounds appropriately fantasy-sounding. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nNo response.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGathering up your courage, I shout. \"HEY\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I can barely hear you.\" Laura's voice rumbles from all around you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGreat, You think, as you shrug. <i>No way am I coming this far, only to be stopped by a little thing like my size.</i> Boldly, you walk into the depths of Laura's ear. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few dozen feet or so into the canal, you began encountering a fine field of hairs, gentle and soft. Reaching out and grabbing one, running my fingers down its length, you quickly tell it has a vaguely plastic feeling to it - obivously from the wax all about you, no doubt. It's very firm, designed to keep dirt and other particles out. You brush them aside with ease and continued inward. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter the hairs began to thin out, and the buildup was left behind, Laura's ear canal narrowed around you. Gently running your fingertips along the wall as you walked, you could feel ripples in her flesh. You stop for a second, looking at the living ceiling above you. <i>I wonder what this feels like - to have someone walking around inside your head. Knowing that it was a human being, causing nothing more than a faint tickle in your ear - understanding that nobody in human history could go there - a near microscopic person inside your head.</i> \r<br>\n\r<br>\nCool. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually the narrow tunnel of flesh opens up dramatically and abruptly. Before you was Laura's eardrum. The membrane was huge and her eardrum was thin enough to be almost translucent. I could feel vibration throught the drum - it was her inner ear's mechanics, moving in response to the noises all around her. Here's hoping that I could become part of that noise.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can you hear me now?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Perfectly!\" she gasped out, clearly trying to deal with the tickle you were causing. \"Who are you? What are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well - you see,\" you say, settling down for a long talk, \"that's a long story.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou can feel movement outside her head. You'd guess that she's sitting up. \"Go ahead and tell me - I've got nowhere to go tomorrow and nothing to do. The night is all yours.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWell . .. . \" you begin, trying to formulate a good story - but then anything coming from a half inch tall man is already scoring points in the fantastic but true category. \"It's like this - you know all that Dungeons and Dragons fantasy stuff? \"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Know it - my ex-boyfriend was obsessed with that crap.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, it's true - at least most of it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Fairies, elves, pixies, dragons - the whole nine yards. It's about 85 percent real.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA slight laugh reverberates through you as she chuckles at the notion. \"You're full of bullshit. You're having me on.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, sorry - I thought I was talking to someone with an open mind.\" You stand up, beginning to make for the exit. \"I'll go find someone else's ear canal to walk around in.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, no - wait! I'm sorry.\" She hesitated. \"I believe you.\" You crack a huge smile at that - the lie was working. \"But if you're real, why have humans never heard of you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We tend to keep to ourselves now - anyway, how do you explain Easter Island and the Bermuda Triangle? What about bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster - although she'd be very upset to hear you call her that.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So what's your story?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnyway, I . . . . ah, it's a bit hard to put this, but - well, I was thrown out of society. Some might call me a rebel. A picker, a grinner - a lover and a sinner.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Stupid joke, never mind. So, like I was saying - they threw me out into the cold, hard world.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"They threw you out forever?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, not exactly - you see, if I bring joy and pleasure - both physical and mental, to an one who is worthy, I get to go back. Some crazy law and a loophole in that law. I know it sounds insane, but it's the gods honest truth.\" You begin to stroke her skin lightly - the inner workings of her ear are more than receptive to your touch. A massive tremor echoes throughout her body - a mere shudder to her. \"You are that one.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow. And I've never even won a contest on the radio before.\" You can feel the world shift again as she moves. \"So, where do we begin.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Firstly, you'll climb onto the top of Marsha's divine foot, and from there the leg...\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMarsha is shuffling quietly now, and it isn't too much trouble to get to your feet, steadying yourself on her toes.  At least you're still taller than them.  Taking a deep breath, you pull yourself up, clinging onto the large strap that runs along the top of her foot from the ankle.  There, the first step wasn't too difficult, you think to yourself as you make for the shelter of the ankle; a nice, soft and warm vertical surface to lean against, and something reassuringly familiar.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNow you can see where Marsha is heading, although each time her foot hits the ground causes your last meal to rise in your throat.  She's going back to the bar, maybe to look for you.  What will she do once she finds that you've gone?  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen you're rising again, pressed down by pressure as Marsha sits down on a stool, crossing the leg to which your ride belongs over the other.  This time you do actually puke, a pitifully small pool on the summit of her foot.  She wouldn't be too pleased.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen things go black, and you are lifted up once again, even less gently.  When the movement is over, the blackness divides before you, and you can see that you had been wrapped in a handkerchief by someone and picked up.  No, not just someone, you realise as you gaze up in awe at the deity whose face is now the sky.  Marsha.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou judge that you're now sitting in the palm of her hand, but you're more concerned with her face.  Her eyes are lit up, her canyon of a mouth split wide open in a grin.  She's happy to see you, you guess.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'So you did find the ring after all!' she laughs with a voice that threatens to destroy forever any hearing you may have had.  'Although I'd expected you to be more polite than to vomit over me to get my attention.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You knew about this?' you manage weakly, realising, even as you say it, that she can't possibly hear you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Oh yes, I knew.  And I can hear you, too; when you can shrink matter, a simple listening spell is nothing.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'So change me back!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Hah, it's your own fault.  Any fool should have known better than to touch the jewel of a magical ring.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe lets you see her other hand now, and you recognise the great black stone that sits upon a band around one of her fingers.  She pauses to admire it for a few seconds herself, before continuing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'It's nothing personal, you understand.  And I'll prove it to you!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe ground beneath you shakes as Marsha lays her hand upon the bar.  Taking the hint, you drop from the hanky and onto the wood.  You look back to see her withdraw her hand, winking at you as she turns to the guy sitting next to her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'What's that?' he asks her, his confused eyes on you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe shrugs.  'Takes one to know one.' she says flatly, raising her hand.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOh god, you hope that you didn't look like that when you shrank.  But it's not only the barfly that's affected; all around the monstrous chamber you can see previously eight hundred feet tall titans and giantesses convulsing and falling in upon themselves, disappearing to the floor beneath your line of sight.  You even see Megan drop into the pool where she threw the drink that contained you.  Only Marsha remains, a single goddess in a room full of insects.  She is clapping her hands and surveying her handiwork, forgetting you for the moment.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nDo you really want to remain here with the woman that you thought you knew, but now turns out to be some sort of sorceress?  She is the only person who could possibly turn you back, but her recent actions suggest that she might not be in full possesson of her mental faculties.  On the other hand, you could try and escape, find some other way to be restored, but risk her wrath if she notices.  Whatever you do, you'd better act fast!\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

It is impossible to get back home, so you need to make it home with someone nice enough to take care o you.  But who?  Megan seems like a spoiled brat but with enough resources to take care of you.  You notice from the directin of her voice that her sadals are the closest and directly in front of you.  She seems a risk but the only sure thing at the moment.  You're not sure where Jane, your current fling, or Marsha your long time girlfriend, are at the moment.

You attempt to make way for the shoe strap around her ankle, as the more fancy shoes have these staps nowadays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you get to the base of her ankle, your feel your stomach drop.

She sits there and drinks a couple of beers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL THAT BE ALL MA'AM?\" the bartender asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, I'LL CLOSE MY TAB NOW.\"  Megan says in her booming voice.

You don't know how much longer she will stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debate whether or not you should get her attention right now trying to prevent being stepped on inadvertently before she leaves, or just to ride it out.

Being smart, you begin to hold on tighter for there will be much walking ahead for you and your host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold on tight and try to enjoy the ride as best as you can but this ride is one which will decide the fate of your life.  You move at the speed of sound.  Up and down, up and then back down again.  BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM, Megan and Julie are walking and their footfalls are all around you. You feel a jolt greater than any rollercoaster you have ever been on, every time you hit the ground.  After covering what seemed like 10 miles in the last five minutes, you feel naucious and exhuasted.  You're not sure if you can hold on any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reach the car.  Megan, having only a couple of beers, was the sober one and drove.  You don't remember what the girls spoke about, it was girl stuff and lame afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Megan dropped Julie off and went on her way home.  Luckily you were on her left toe and did not get pressed mercilessly every stop and go drivers normally have during a simple drive.  She rested her foot on the left side, seemingly caring for you not to harm you.  But she did not know you were there right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally, Megan opens the door and gets out of her black Mercedes her father obviously bought for her.  You hear the keys rattling high above you going into her purse.  This pulsated against your ears. Finally it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final walk was difficult since you have been between her toes for 2 hours now.  Her feet began to smell like bad feet do when they sweat. You begin to lose your grip but still hold on for dear life. I guess even girls feet smell bad.  You make it to the door, and she opens the large monolith rather easily for her.  You walk into her huge marble house.  She closed the door behind her and off she went to her room. Finally, at the utmost opportune time, you lose your grip and are send flying in the direction towards her bed.  You luckily land on your butt, as you begin to take in your surroundings.  You see Megan a hundred feet away making her way in, but she  closes the distance so fast you have to back up and run away...under her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan decides to turn towards her closet to change.  You are relieved to be out of your former situation.  Your arms and butt are sore, but you are finally out from the noise and thunder of a hundred footfalls and people shouting and such as is the case with a bar.  You are not out of the woods yet.  You need to decide something: when do I try to get her attention. Tonight or tomorrow night? Do I get her attention at all?  What's an alternate plan?  Is this even a safe place?<br>\r\nSo, you decide to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is Saturday morning, though, so presumably she's in no rush to be awake.  Hell, it may not even be morning, for all you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, you creep out from under the bed.

She would never hear you from where you are and the slippery walls of the glass are much to high for you to scale. While you are still looking for a way out, Megan takes a gigantic gulp of beer. Before you really understand what's happening, everything turns dark as you enter her mouth. Immediately, the liquid and you rush down her throat, the sudden change of direction making you dizzy. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down and down you go. You don't know how, but you are able to see in the dark of Megan's throat. Not that there was anything noteworthy to be seen. Just glistening, dark red walls pushing you and the beer down towards the end of the lane. This constant, dragging motion is replaced by a free fall just before you hit the lake of beer, mushed food, and acids filling Megan's stomach. A foul stench fills the air and your nose tingles smelling the strong acids that are breaking down the food. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Megan's stomach is rather full, a giant swamp filled with unnamable debris. The dominating feature is obviously the acid. All the food stuff shows clear signs of dissolving, the smell is everywhere. In spite of this, you think you can also smell something else - alcohol. You recall that Megan looked rather lonely at the bar. Seems as if another friend had just dropped her. You smile at the uselessness of her life.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then you remember your own situation and start to wonder why you don't feel the burn of the acid. You are soaking wet, but besides that, you seem to be unharmed. This swamp you are in must be full of digestive juice, but yet you are untouched. There is no doubt about you being in Megan's stomach either: the wrinkled walls glistening with slime and fresh acid, the beer crashing down into the ever- growing lake, the constant, jerking movement as the muscles try to mix the food stuff. It may be your changed perspective, but you get the feeling that Megan is quite thirsty tonight. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is no dry spot for you to go to. At least you are alive. But the entrance you used is still far above your head, whilest the exit must be submerged somewhere in the stinking depths. Currently, you can't do anything but wait for things to take their course. So what will become of you?</span></div></div>",

You struggle to get out the way you came but it is too tight.  You suddenly begin to get sloshed around as Megan gets up from the table and starts walking.  The sloshing soon stops with a thud.  The opening below you that you entered through begins to open letting the fluid rush out at a heartbreaking speed.  The bladder is emptying fast and you get sucked through the opening through her urinary tract.  As you exit her crotch you manage to grab on to a pubic hair to the side of her vagina.

Megan then stands up and reaches to pull up her panties.

You are able to hang on to the strap of her high heel shoe just above her big toe.  Megan pulls up her panties and denim skirt and walks out of the bathroom.  The view up from here is awesome.

She then pulls out a pink leather thong. \"When I put this on there will be no way for you to escape my cunt.\" Megan explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then goes back to her bed and lyes down propping her head on the pillow and spreading her legs. She starts to insert you and pulls you up to her face for a minute. \"By the way little man; I'm glad you showed up when you did. Because now I don't need to masturbate. I have you to do it for me. And I couldn't do it all night. You can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan laughs in an evil manner than inserts you inside of her warm womanhood. She than pulls the thong up as tight as it will go without hurting her and lies in bed feeling you squirm inside of her. </span></div></div>",

You get the feeling that something is wrong immediately, although little has changed.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lake of food has risen a bit, but this could be just wishful thinking. The walls are still slimy and glistening with acids. You are still rocked around by the stomach's constant motion. There is the distant heart beat. The acidic smell. Now you get it! The alochol smell has become stronger! Just as the realization hits you, you get bathed in liquid entering the stomach from above. Well, this sure ain't no beer she is drinking now.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The movement of her insides has changed somehow. It's less regular, more jerky. You feel everything shift horizontically. She must be running somewhere and suddenly, the stomach walls contract pressing the half- digested food with you inside upwards. She is vomitting! The very moment you realize that, the ride is already over as a bright light blinds your eyes. You feel yourself falling and have no time to prepare for the inevitable impact.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the bone- shattering thud you land in some soft stuff. As you are regaining your senses, you start hearing a male  voice: \"... alright?\" \r<br>\nThe reply comes from high above you, probably Megan: \"Yeah ... &lt;gag&gt; ... I ... &lt;choke&gt; ... am alright. Just gimme a sec, will ya!\" This is followed by loud thunder making your ears ring. As the noise continues, you understand that she must have flushed the toilet. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, your eyes have readjusted, and you can see again. As expected, you are in a bath room. It is not the filthy one of the disco the party took place, but one as you would find it in any self- respecting apartment. It's kinda clean, although there is a puddle of smelly vomit next to the toilet, with you on top of it. Seems as if you had been really lucky not to send your regards to the great porcelaine god. There is no sign of Megan, she probably left while the roaring toilet was still deafening you. Fortunately, she forgot to turn off the light.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thereare now windows and only a single door, and as you approach it, you notice the noise of a bed taken to its limit combined with the moans of a couple. Seems as if Megan wasn't that lonely after all. So what do you do now?</span></div></div>",

She is wearing her cheerleading shirt, but a normal pants as opposed to her cheerleading skirt.  You watch as she roots around her purse and takes something out.  It's a bar napkin.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut when she unwraps what's inside the bar napkin, do you see something that sparks your interest.  It's the black ring.  Megan must have picked it up in the bar! \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou run towards her, heedless of your proportionate size and voice, trying to shout a warning for her not to touch it.  Too late.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou watch as Megan yelps out in surprize as she starts to shrink.

When you scooped it up, I was hanging to the napkin.  Litsen, I'm not sure, but maybe.. maybe if we touch the ring again, we can grow back to our regular size.  That's my only hope.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We may be shrunk down even further, John.  Did you think of that!\" Megan said accusingly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes.  But better trying and knowing then spending our lives as half an inch tall.  At least it is to me.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan looked up at the table where the ring rested.  \"So how are we going to get up there?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Easy, we climb.  I think our proportional strengths have increased.  Like ants being able to carry more than their own body weight.  Since we're lighter, it shouldn't be too much of an effort to get up there.\" you say. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan thinks for a moment and says, \"Only one problem with that plan.  Mrs. Kitty, my cat.  She's sleeping on the table.  If she wakes up, we're done for.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou decide not to mention your new ability to survive digestion.  Then you would have to tell Megan where you really were.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The other problem is Gary.  What if he spots the ring before we can get to it.\" Megan's face lights up as she has a brainstorm.  \"That's it!  We can ask Gary for help.

You prepare to dash for the ring as Mrs. Kitty stands up. As soon as the way is clear, you make a run for it.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou don't even make it halfway before you feel a large sandpaper tounge lifting you up into Mrs. Kitty's maw.  You feel her hot cat breath as the her mouth closes and her tounge pushes you back towards the throat.  Before you can do anything else, you're traveling the same pathway that Megan traversed not a few seconds ago.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few moments later, you fall into a much smaller stomach than Megan's (when she was full size).  And this one isn't empty either.  It has a sobbing Megan crouching in the fetal position.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I should have.. I should have called Greg.\" She manages between sobs.  \"I don't want to die like this.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hmm.. do you feel anything?\"  you say.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The acid.

She explores the rooms again and wandered all about the apartment, looking for someting interesting to do.  While she's doing that, you and Megan get sloshed around.  More than once, you bump into one another as her motion, as well as the jerking action of the stomach muscles, squeeze you together and cover you with stomach fluids.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I wonder if this is what it's like in my stomach?\" Megan asks and lifts up her shirt just enough to expose her midriff and belly button.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's probably roomier..  and full of alcohol.\" You smile. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No it's not.  I threw all of it up a little while ago.  Before I touched the ring.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, in any case, I bet you're stomach is much cuter than your cat's.\"  Megan smiles at your comment.  \"So is Greg your boyfriend?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan laughs at the thought.  \"No, he's my brother!\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do you have one?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What? A brother?\" Megan teases as the stomach actions cause you to fall on top of her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No, a boyfriend.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Not yet.\" Megan grins as she starts to remove her pants. \"But check back again in an hour.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou, in turn, also grin and begin to unzip your fly.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhat follows is the best sex of your existance, or at least your college experience.  Megan uses her cheerleading flexability to move in ways you wouldn't have imagined possible.  Mrs. Kitty's stomach motion only enhanses your actions.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou explore each other's body.  Megan's chest, while not the biggest you have seen, are the most perfect pair you ever encountered.  And that includes most of your private magazines.  Her blonde hair is beautiful, even coated with a cat's stomach secretions.  Her normal curls are replaced by a wet straightness, as though she just stepped out of the shower.  You loose track of time as you continue attempting to merge. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou wake up next to Megan who is still sleeping.  And you are both still inside Mrs. Kitty's stomach, but not in the same location.  You notice you are almost at the path that will lead you out of the cat, via the long way, through her intestines.  And Megan is already touching the tight ring of muscles.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou wake her up just in time for the next squeezing motion to occur.  Megan head and torso, all the way up to her hips get stuffed through the opening just as the motion stops.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nDo you..\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

No friends.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn walked back, sitting down next to her. \"Yeah, but at least we've got good company.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe leaned into his shoulder and hugged him. She nodded off to sleep moments later. He yawned - it HAD been a long day. He wrapped his arm around Megan and slowly found embrace in the sandman's comforting embrace.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn awoke to shaking. Not the whole world going topsy-turvy, but Megan shaking him at his shoulder.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I've got it! I'm such a fool for not thinking of it sooner!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hum? What?\" John mumbled, still dazed from his sleep.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Directly across from my dorm, and down the hall two doors is - well, she's the weirdo of the building.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This is your dorm room? It has it's own kitchen!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Daddy put up the money for remodeling.\" She said, gesturing casually. \"Now, like I was saying before I was rudely interrupted -\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sorry.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe ignored the interruption as she pulled John to his feet. \"Down this hall is Tegan Spengler. Her father is a scientist or celebrity on the east coast - something like that.\" Dropping to the floor, she began slithering under her front door. \"Anyway, she's studying physics or chemistry - I don't quite know what.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And?\" John asked, slithering right behind Meg.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"She's always coming up with weird shit - self-freezing ice cubes, solar powered flashlights. A couple of weeks ago, she mentioned something about a 'reduced mass particle transmogrifier'.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe stopped dead in the hallway, turning to face John. \"Duh - listen to the name! That has to be some sort of dimensional resizing unit. It's time to take back our destiny.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What exactly were you taking at college?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Physical sciences - but I read a lot of popular mechanics.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ah, right.\" He said, jogging along behind.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey run the length of the hallway, a short jog of half an hour across a large bare floor. The pair comes to a screeching halt in front of a propped open front door. A gigantic female about 19 or 20 comes out, carrying a large box full of clothes and other sundry items. Turning left sharply, she heads down the hall. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan quickly glanced in the room. \"Oh no - she's moving out! I hope she didn't pack up what we need!\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey scurry along inside, following the edge of the wall and using boxes as cover. Meg looks around, as Tegan enters the room, grabs a box and heads out again. After about half an hour of frantic searching, several close calls with Tegan's foot, and an incident where John nearly got packed away with some test tubes - Megan found the goal.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was a large machine, about four feet by four feet across. It looked like a convertible microwave with the top down. A large keypad was close to the base, off to one side. A mighty red power switch dominated one side of the control panel. Various wires and unfinished parts could be seen throughout the exposed superstructure.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's it?\" John commented, looking at the strange device.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What were you expecting? A Flash Gordon ray gun?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe crossed to where Megan was examining the controls. \"Do you know how to work it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The controls seem simple enough.\" She pointed to a large display, indicating yesterdays date, approximately 26 hours ago. \"See, she's used it recently.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You sure you know what you're doing?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No - but that's why you love me so.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter several moments of silent work, Meg looked up. \"There, that should do it.\" She shoved him towards the flatbed portion of the device. \"Get on.\" She commanded, powering up the device. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe humming increased, as Meg moved to join her boyfriend on the platform. . . .</span></div></div>",

A sense of vertigo washed over the pair as every fiber of their being tingled with static electricity. After several hours - or at least what felt like several hours, the sensation faded. The light faded. All they were left with was cold, hard floor.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That was intense\" mumbled John as he stumbled first to his kneeses, then to his feet. \"You ok?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah - I think so.\" She glanced around the room - wondering if her idea had been folly or successful. It took a couple of seconds for the world to stop spinning - but stop it did. Everything in the room was exactly the same size as before. They were still tiny in a world of giants.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, wait a sec.\" John began, \"Look at all the stuff - it's all unpacked.\" He wandered around the end of a coffee table, looking around at the disorganized dorm room. It was much smaller than Megan's was, and much more cluttered. Scientific equipment and piles of notes and diagrams were scattered across the desk - and the table, and the floor.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeg appears at John's arm. \"I've figured it out. Come here.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe led him through a maze of stuff, eventually coming to a humgous watch. She crawled up on the face of the watch and pointed towards her feet. John followed her finger to the ground, confused. Finally - it struck him. The date!\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That gizmo was a time machine. We're back exactly 26 hours and change.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn sat on the ground, hard. \"Well, that tops it. The weirdest day of my life just maxxed out.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, no.

The phone was hanging limply from her fingertips, as she slouched forward on her couch. The phone in question was her date for the evening calling to tell her that he would be unavailable for the evening. He had made some lame excuse about 'an unexpected engagement cropping up' or someshit. She knew the truth - dumped by a thoughtless, pig of a man. <i>Fine, you want Ice Queen Bitch of the Universe? You got her in spades, baby!</i>.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe glanced at the clock - 5pm. It was still early. She kicked off her shoes and dropped her socks to the floor. It was uncharacteristically untidy - but fuck it. She was tired and se was pissed. There was just enough time for a quick nap - then she would go out on the town. She swung her legs up on the other end of the couch, and closed her eyes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe'd show them all - she'd have a good time despite what the universe tried to dump on her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeanwhile, two tiny figures appeared under the crack of the front door. A much smaller Megan offered her hand to John, pulling him to his feet.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ok, I'll bite. What are we doing back here?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I've got something better in mind than waiting around in a wine glass to get swallowed by my brother's fianc\u00e9e.\" She led him across the vast hardwood floor to the sofa. Stopping at the side, she grabbed a handful of fabric and began pulling herself up.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What are you doing?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Less talk, more climb.\" She shouted over her shoulder.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually the pair reached the seat cushion. Meg was the first, rolling over onto her stomach and reaching back to help John. Moments later, he pulled himself over with one final exertion. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ok, what's this all about! I'm not taking one more step until you tell me what you have in mind!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe just smiled, and took a handful of steps backwards. It was only then that John realized exactly where he was. She was standing directly in front of a gigantic face - HER gigantic face. The mammoth Megan was on her side, sleeping peacefully, snoring slightly, and mouth partially open. A cascade of blond hair poured over her head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTiny Megan walked towards herself. Reaching her head, she turned, and leaned on Giant Megan's lower lip. Her arms were folded across her chest, and the best provocative look on her face. Giant Meg's breath came in spurts, causing tiny Meg's hair to fly everywhere.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're kidding.\" He walked forward carefully. \"You're nuts!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe smiled wickedly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What if you - I mean she find us?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John approached the giant mouth, his eyes following the pattern of wrinkles and lines - most far too small for the naked eye to see, but now lay before him like a beautiful, intricate maze. He placed his back against Megan's lower lip, his feet against her upper lip. He glanced over to tiny Megan, who nodded her readiness. Taking a deep breath, he pushed against the lips as hard as he could.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn's feet sank into Megan's upper lip ever so slightly, but it forced her mouth open a fraction of an inch more - which is all tiny Megan needed to grab the corner of her mouth, hoist herself up and madly scramble under John's legs.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe flipped over, sliding slightly down Megan's inner cheek as she landed. She spun around, clambered back up to her mouth. Megan maneuvered between her huge white teeth, and repeated the motion, opening the jaw ever so slightly. John squirmed loosed, leapt from his perch, and the two miniature people collapsed together in a heap. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nDespite her nap, Megan became dimly aware of all this activity going on within her mouth. Still half asleep, she rolled over onto her back, trying to remove the source of the irritation. All it did was provided a soft landing for when world straightened out again for the two lovers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two rolled to a stop, bouncing along the flat, hard, firm surface of Megan's tongue. It was sweltering, clammy and one big cavernous wonder. The entire mouth could easily hold a major league baseball stadium (plus fans) with a really big outfield and loads of room to spare. Her teeth seemed to stretch well over what seemed to be twenty or thirty feet each - maybe more. Her vast throat beyond - well, that was easily well over five or six stories tall. Saliva slowly began secreting from her tongue, drenching the two diminutive people. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This . . . this is amazing!\" Meg exclaimed, examining her own tongue beneath her. She playfully poked a long index finger into a small white-ish nodule on the surface of the tongue, the flesh yielding under her touch. There was no response from the taste bud to her prodding. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn leaned back, his arms folded behind his head. A broad smile crossed his face. \"Don't get too attached to it. We'll probably be moving on in a few moments.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAlmost as if giant Meg was listening, the cavern opened wide, the mighty muscle beneath their feet rolling and undulating. A stream of air poured past the couple on it's way to the lungs as a powerful sound - an \"UnnnGHHhh\" enveloped them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan was yawning.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe mouth snapped shut, and gravity went wild. The pair was forced down as Megan's head rose. \r<br>\nThe quivering and heaving of the tongue returned again before a powerful suction overcame John and Megan. Pools of liquid aided in their departure, as the two effortlessly slid the length of the tongue. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn wrapped his arms around his girlfriend as the wave of suction sent them tumbling into her darkness. Within seconds, the twosome landed with a meaty plop inside Megan's stomach. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRolling to a stop at the bottom of the stomach, Megan quickly looked up. The immense organic chamber stretched into the distance far above them. It came to a close at a large pucker - a ring of muscles holding the opening closed. Megan's body instantly sensed the arrival of two new particles of food, and slowly began secreting hydrochloric acid.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan touched the stomach wall, pressing both of the palms of her hands flat and pushing. The wall gave, with a spongy feel to it. \"Wow! This is so cool!\" She put her hear against the surface. \"I can hear the outside world! I've got water running and there's some rustling going on.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn gently traversed the cavity, grabbed Megan by the shoulders and spun her around. \"Enough of the pre-game show. Shall we get to the main event?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan succumbed to his embrace. Whatever she had been going to say fell by the wayside, as he met her lips with his own and the rest of the universe vanished. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n* * * * * * * * *\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe couple lay there, entangled in each other's arms. She lay in the crook of his arm, listening to the outside world muffled through a layer of flesh. Megan's vast heartbeat underscored the noises with a constant, dull throbbing. The chamber rocked back and forth occasional, as their unwitting host moved from place to place.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This is what it was like?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"More or less.\" John said, nuzzling her hair. \"There was a lot more alcohol here the first time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually, the noises outside Megan grew louder. The movements of their host growing more and more pronounced. Music drifted through the flesh chamber. Megan had finally arrived at the dance club.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Say, how long had you been there before you started in on the drinking?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't remember - not very long. Why?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n* * * * * * * * *\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan was done up in her cheerleader finest - short pleated white skirt, tight white sweater with scholastic logos emblazoned on the font. She had jostled her way past the crowd of people at the door waiting to get in - Daddies money getting her inside without the long wait. She moved long the edge of the dance floor, approaching the bar.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer best 'Just Fuck With Me, and I Will Destroy You' look on her face, she grabbed the bartender's attention. \"Beer.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe husky bartender ran a hand cross the stubble on his chin, looking at the girl and trying to decide whether or not to card her. He quickly dismissed the notion, reached for a glass, and poured the best beer had.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe set the glass before her, backing away from the scowl on her face. Grapping the glass, she began drawing a long drink. Such was her mood that she was unaware of the minuscule person bobbing in her drink, desperately trying to swim to safety. Moments later he was gone. For the third time that evening, Megan failed to notice the ever so slight tickle descending down her throat.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

I'm on my way down to your stomach, even as we speak!\" He grabbed his arm and began swimming for the other exit out of Megan's stomach. \"Ok, I'm only a film and video communications major, but even *I* know that we're about to create a major temporal paradox. Having sex inside your stomach is one thing, but meeting, greeting and interacting with myself is another ballgame all together.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn reached the door to the rest of Megan's interior. Bracing himself against the wall of her stomach, he tugged on the ring of muscles with all his might. Megan - giant Megan - squeaked and jumped slightly at the sensation as he pulled. Megan wiggled through the opening, amid a torrent of beer. John followed shortly after, the sphincter snapping shut behind him. Moments later, a dazed and confused John dropped into the meaty sack with a plop. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan leaned against the ring, a sigh escaping from her lips. \"Close wasn't it? Now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn glanced at his watch. \"Well, since you're due to throw me up in about two hours,\" John leaned in closer, their lips almost touching, \"I was thinking that we wait him out . . .\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn lay sleeping, his head on one of Megan's intestinal nodules - the soft, spongy material providing the perfect pillow for an exhausted miniature man. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan leaned up the wall, her eyes closed - but not asleep. She listened to the sounds of the body all around her, alive and vibrant. She could still hear the faint murmur of conversation outside of her host. She smiled, remembering the conversation taking place just outside of her intestines - an over eager, and less than appealing specimen of the male species refused to take no for an answer. She listened to her heartbeat, hundreds of feet away. The bass thrum of its pulsations growing stronger and louder as she grew more excited and agitated at the man. She listened to the gurgle of the digestive system as it processed her oh so long ago dinner.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe felt the gentle sway of her enormous counterpart's staggering as she left the bar and headed back to the dorm room. She felt the world suddenly shift - <i>that must be me hitting the bathroom floor</i>. All around her, the flesh heaved and churned, as the regurgitation process began. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA through crossed her mind - and suddenly her eyes snapped open. \"Oh shit! We have to get out of here!\", she said, grabbing John and shaking him awake none too gently. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\" the sleep addled response came \"What is it this time?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We have to leave - I mean we have to get all the way outside of my body!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn staggered to his feet, fighting both the sleepiness and the roiling landscape. He hadn't made the connection yet. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The ring - don't you get it? I'm about 45 seconds away from touching the ring! We're either about to get shrunk again, or we're about to explode out of my pelvis - neither of which I want to do right now!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh my god!\" John exclaimed as he lunged for the doorway back to Megan's stomach and freedom.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Lets do it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGiant Megan scrunched up her face slightly, a slight tingling coming from her crotch as she climbed the couch back to find the ring. She took a deep breath, and the feeling quickly subsided. <i>it must be due to the climb. My panties are riding up on me or something.</i> She quickly dismissed the feeling and continued the climb.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe pair rolled to a stop, deep inside giant Megan. \"Thanks - you really know where to kick a girl!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You pushed me in! I wasn't exactly in control of my fall, you know.\" She shrugged in response.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe looked up and down the massive tunnel. It was about twenty feet high and forty or fifty feet long. It was a vaguely pink color, irregular and lumpy. The area was hot as the dickens, the air heavy and musty. \"So that's what that was - I dismissed it as a random hot flash at the time.\" She smiled wickedly. \"I'll have to get you to do it again before we leave.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn stood up, and walked to the wall. Leaning out slightly, he opened his mouth and took a gentile bite of giant her's flesh. \"I'll be happy to.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You really know how to turn a girl on.\" She said, a shiver running up and down her spine. \"So I wonder if I should consider it cheating, if you try and boink a 12 hour younger version of myself. Should I be getting jealous?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I only have eyes for you, honey.\" He patted the wall. \"Well, either of you, really. So now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We safer, but we should move to high ground.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What ever do you mean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe moved to in front of the giant ring of muscle holding one end of the giant tunnel shut. \"Want to see what's behind door number three?\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Counting to three, he pushed and grunted with all his might, slowly widening the tiny opening. From outside the tunnel, a massive groan filled their existence. The ground began to buck in response, as tiny people began to invade Megan's body. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hurry up - I think you noticed us!\" Megan wiggled through the gap, legs flailing as she dropped through to the other side. Swinging his legs over, John started to slide into Megan's womb. As he pulled free, the ring of muscle snapped shut - around the tiny man's arm. The bucking subsided slightly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe tried pulling his arm free, but the opening was shut tight. \"Can I get a hand, here?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why? Am I too much for you to handle?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Just help me please?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe crossed to the wall, wedging her fingers in the ridges of the muscle, and pulled.

After a few minutes, a viscous, squirming fluid slowly gushes through the cervix into Big Megan's womb.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey, I guess we've begun to get it on.\" noted John.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithout warning, Big Megan's floodgates opened loose and her insides became a sexual amusement park ride, with bumps and loops and turns and safe landings.  The two tiny stowaways were shown inner depths of their host, even a quick glance at fallopian tubes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey wound up plastered against the wall by the horribly thick semen of Big John.  When they attempted to move and explore some more, they found they could not.  The heavyness of the protein and sperm kept them pressed against the uteral walls.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two passed the time, yelling sort of pseudo curses at each other, all in the name of fun.  The world shook a few more times as the two gigantic lovers went at it again, but then things calmed down.  After a bit of a lull, the world went black.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey had almost forgotten about the time machine.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn and Megan expected to be once again transported to 26 hours earlier inside of big, or now little big Megan, who would then crawl up inside the new big megan, who would go back in time in an endless cycle until the originals became sub atomic in size.  Or would they really be the originals?  If Megan stuck her hand into her vagina, would she feel millions of tiny other selves?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuch groundbreaking philosophical questions about the nature of self, self-concept, and the existence of a soul and the originality of the human experience were left unanswered.  Instead, When the blackness faded, John and Megan found themselves at a junction not unlike a mid 20's English railroad station, fully sized to match the proportions.  As the tracks moved off to the right and the left, they faded into a Picasso-esque fog of twisting tracks.  Rails melted in the distance like a Dali epiphany.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey were alone save for a middle-aged, thin, graying man, dressed in a tux and tails which made the two realize their own nakedness.  He wore an English rain hat and a monocle over a slightly lazy left eye.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn worked his nerve first.  \"Uh...sir...excuse me...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe man turned his head up to show he was aware of their presence.  He cleared his throat in an impeccably snobbish British manner.  \"Welcome to the bend of time, where those who don't belong in time come to iron out the wrinkles in the space-time continuum like bad crossovers in mainstream comic books.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan got very confused.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe man continued.  \"You see, we can handle two of the same people in the same place at the same time, but the two of you created a type of recursive for loop that makes the all-highest's operating system crash.  So the two of you unlocked a type of omnipotent safety.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn, who was a cs major, was still slightly confused.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe man continued.  \"Anywho, the two of you have a rare oportunity, only shared by Cher and John Travolta.  You can move through time and return here to rest, provided you never crawl up into another version of your girlfriend's poon-tang again.  Agreed?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two simply nodded their heads.  The man smiled.  \"Good.  You took a lot less time than Cher.  I had to explain it at least 97 times.  Where do you think she got the inspiration for \"If I Could Turn Back Time?\"  Anyways, I'm sure you two are itching to try this out.  Oh, and I'm afraid you will always be 1/2 an inch tall.  The whole black crystal wasn't caught by God's virus scan.  Once you decided where you want to go, step onto the tracks below this platform.  To return, simply focus your energy on the thought of this place and boom, you'll be here.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn turned to Megan.  \"This is obviously the most flimsy plot device ever.  But, it is a genuinly good opportunity to get it on in some pretty hot chicks.  Where should we go first?\"</span></div></div>",

The raging desire was made manifest by the bizarre surroundings - the interior of the woman's body. All round them, a powerful, pounding heartbeat droned on. The tempo grew louder and more intense. The rocking became more noticeable.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually the flames subsided to a warm glow, the tiny couple content in each others arm. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Have I mentioned - you're good.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm going to chalk some of it up the surroundings.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe mighty rocking began to increase in intensity. The heartbeat was a constant throb now. \"I think we're just finishing up.\" Megan slowly pulled apart from John. She crossed to the pile of clothes, and began to dress. John rolled over, his eyes lovingly caressing her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do you mind?\" she asked sheepishly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No. Not at all.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Call it a silly pet quirk of mine. All off - no problem. All on - no problem. A various state of undress, and it's creepy.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, sorry. Tell you what, I'll just roll over and stare at the wall of your womb.\" He rolled over. \"There? Is that better?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe threw up her hands. \"OK, point taken.\" Megan finished dressing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned as the rocking abruptly stopped. An viscous fluid suddenly appeared at the base of the chamber. \"Unless you want to get messy - I suggest we climb.\" She said, moving to a spongy wall. Grabbing a fistful of herself, Megan begin climbing the wall, just as John approached where she was standing. He looked up into the darkness - the magical illumination only extended so far. He couldn't see the upper portions of the chamber - although he did have a magnificent view of tiny Megan as she climbed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You want to stop staring at my ass and climb?\" he did so.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe going was easy, despite the movement of their host. The wall was covered in wrinkles and indentations - handholds and ledges were the order of the day. The pair managed to reach nearly all the way to the top of the chamber before Megan found a large shelf to sit on. She swung her legs out over the abyss and leaned back. John moved next to her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Helluva climb. I wouldn't think climbing around inside you would be that difficult.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Are you calling me difficult?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No - no, dear. That's not it at all! Really!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're lying - I know it.\" She shoved him, sending him rolling down the ledge. \"I'm going to cry now.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn bounced a dozen feet down the soft, fleshy wall, grunting as he went. Eventually, he came to a stop, wedged in a niche. As he stopped, his head hit something hard. \"Ow!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What happened!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn didn't answer. Instead, he sat up and reached around behind him. There he found a small, hard - yet pliable, sphere about the size of a bowling ball. He slipped it under his jacket and began the long climb to his girlfriend.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" You didn't answer. Are you OK?\" She asked, rising to her feet. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Here, I believe this is yours.\" He tossed the sphere to Megan. It was light - much lighter than she expected.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, wow. This is - is a . . . um. What is it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"An egg?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"An egg? You mean MY egg? Like, from me? But those are much smaller than . . . oh. Right.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Guess what kiddo.\" John said, moving in close and putting his arm around her shoulders. \"You're a winner.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned the small, soft orb of genetic material over and over in her hands. \"You don't mean - pregnant?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Perhaps - of course with us in here messing up the works, who knows what the odds are like.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan sat down hard again, the ground squishing under her. \"Wow - I never expected this.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn sat next to her. \"So, you want to try and do something about it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What can we do? Unless you are firing blanks, your rather energetic sperm will be here any time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe hesitated thoughtfully. \"Well, I've got a crazy idea - that may not work. But at the worst, you'll be no worse off that you are now.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

To his left was the immense crevasse they had just exited.  All around them was a tangled forest of hair, while a sky of cotton and denim loomed above them. There was motion of some sort, as the giant Megan moved about - completely unaware of her passengers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan bent over and helped John to his feet. Together the pair lurched into the nearby forest. \"Where are we going?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Anywhere but here. Although it's true that I enjoy the usage of that part of your anatomy, I don't fancy the idea of being crushed by a three hundred foot long version of it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't get it - it looks all the same, though.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It would - we're inside my pants, remember. They shrunk along with the rest of me. Now - get scaling.\" She said, pushing him from behind.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two diminutive people climbed like mad, picking their way through the vast forest of Megan's hair. It was much slower going on the way up than on the way down. Within moments, they were at the waist of the huge panties. Megan started wiggling under the elastic. \"I figure it took us about five minutes to get to the couch, ten more minutes spent climbing, and another five being eaten by my cat. So - we've got roughly fifteen or twenty minutes before we're crushed by two giant us-es getting it on.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn's reply was cut short. There was a impossibly loud metallic tearing sound from all around them. The sky brightened significantly, even filtered through the cotton cloth, as the heavy jeans were opened and pulled away. Flesh dominated the sky beyond.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh maybe we were unconscious longer than you thought and we're moments away from becoming a John and Megan sandwich!\" John exclaimed as he threw himself under the waistband and wiggled for his life. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey sprinted across Megan's field of flesh as fast and as hard as they could - but they could not escape the gigantic John dropping from the heavens. With the wall of John moments away from crushing the pair, John spotted salvation. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Jump!\" He shouted throwing himself to the ground. The shrunken pair rolled to a stop just inside Megan's belly button as the world crashed down around them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That was too close.\" Megan said, crawling over to her boyfriend. From somewhere deep within Megan, bestial grunting began.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn rolled over on his back, watching the skin above him. \"So, we're stuck for the moment.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It would seem that way.\" She leaned over and kissed him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We should formulate a plan.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Of course.\" Another kiss.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We shouldn\u2019t get distracted like this.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're absolutely right.\" A deep, long and passionate kiss this time.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin moments, the two lovers were distracted. . . .\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn was first to wake up. The sense of motion was all around them. He slipped into his clothes and carefully crawled to the opening in Megan and tried to look out - only to be mostly thwarted by the knit weave of the sweater she wore. Beyond he could just barely make out lights and shadows as the colossal girl walked. He turned and crawled back to his companion.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe was still sound asleep. He lightly touched her stomach, his fingertips just above her belly button. Her eyes fluttered open at the stimulation. \"Morning sunshine\", she said.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe pulled up next to her. \"I don't think we're going to make it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Make what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I was hoping that we could possibly make it to your ear in time - but it doesn't look like that will happen.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What did you want to do in my ear?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"To - to . . . I don\u2019t know! But if we don\u2019t think of something, we're just going to wind up going to Teagn's room, turn on the gizmo, and jump back a day and a half. Then we do the beast with two backs - and the large versions get shrunk. Meanwhile we go from a thousandth of an inch tall to a billionth of an inch tall.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned around and crawled to the opening, looking at the couch far below. \"Or, I guess we can get off here and fend for ourselves.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's easier going down than up, and there were plenty of times I laid down before going to Tegan's room. We'll have a easier time getting off me than continuing on.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Moments later she launched into the air sailing for the couch cushion far below, as the abdomen dropped away. She landed with a bounce and a thud, rolling to a stop dozens of feet away from the looming belly of giant Megan. She turned, catching sight of the tiny speck still at the top of the great living hill. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Come on! It's safe!\" she shouted, knowing full well that he couldn't hear her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt the top of the great sloping wall of flesh, John looked apprehensive. \"She's got to be kidding.\" Closing his eyes, he stepped out into space and plunged. He opened his eyes, screaming in terror as he went. Then, he spotted motion - a gigantic set of fingers heading his direction. <i>Oh shit! She's coming to scratch this errant itch!</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe watched helplessly as the fingers contacted flesh behind him, and started moving side to side as they headed in his direction. Just as the massive digits were poised and ready to crush him, he ran out of abdomen and flew into the air. He rolled to a stop half a football field away from his girlfriend.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Would you not do that, please!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sorry - who would have known that tiny itch was you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn looked around at the couch, and whistled. \"Now THIS is big.\" He said looking at the vast horizon of cloth. It was easily forty miles to the back of the sofa, and a hundred to the far arm. The near arm was much closer, at only three or four miles away. He grabbed her arm and started heading to a  place of relative safety near the arm of the couch. As they walked, the two watched their younger, larger selves. They waited an hour, gave up for Gary's arrival and headed for the door. The two insignificant people were left alone in the vast room. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe solitude was not long lasting, when a rattle was heard at the entrance. The door swung open, as two super huge people enter into the room. One - the thin dark hared man, is clearly drunk beyond belief. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's my brother. Looks like he's had a bit too much of the sauce. Big surprise there.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSupporting him was a shorter woman - about 5'7 or so, with long red hair. She dragged the drunken man into the bedroom beyond. Movement and rustling could be heard from the room. \"That's my future sister-in-law Theresa. I don't know her very well yet - I've only met her a couple of times.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It looks like you'll get to know her intimately. She's our best bet for contacting the normal sized world.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What's the plan?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Beats the hell out of me. I'm making this up as I go.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe question was answered as Theresa finished up in the other room. A weary look on her face, she crossed to the couch. Hesitating for a moment, she kicked off her shoes into the corner and flopped lengthwise onto the sofa. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt is said that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Action: several billion tons of tired fianc\u00e9e crashes stomach first onto one end of the sofa.  Reaction: the two microscopic people at the other end are launched high into the air in a graceful arc towards the titanic woman. . . .\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first impact - contact with some sort of thread - knocked the two lovers apart, sending them in opposite directions. The violent collision knocked John senseless, and sent him spinning. He was dimly away of several more hits, and one hard landing. He skidded to a stop, motionless.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe shook his head, focus slowly returning to his vision. He glanced around. He was at the bottom of a deep canyon of flesh. The walls were at least fifty feet high, and the whole valley was twenty of so feet wide at the top. The gorge ran off into the distance to either side of him for as far as the eye could see. Far above him, he could see strands of rope in a regular criss-cross pattern - spaced at least fifteen feet apart from each other. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Where the hell am I?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe skin beneath him was firm and dense - much more so than giant Megan's skin - but then it's owner was magnitudes bigger than she was. Dotting the landscape were hundreds of large round openings in the ground. Curious, he looked closely at the skin directly below him. <i>Damn if those don't look like . . . cells?</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd then it dawned on him. The pattern above him was her nylons. The huge round openings were pores in her very skin. He was at the bottom of a line somewhere on the underside of Theresa's one hundred mile long foot. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We are so screwed.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA shout from the distance caught his ear. It was too faint to make out - but then who else would be here to shout for him. \"Megan!\" he returned. In the distance, at the top of the ridge was a tiny dot frantically waving it's arms.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn approached the wall of the canyon. Microscopic at normal size, the rough texture of the skin was perfect. It was rough and covered with imperfections that would make the climb easier. He grabbed a fistful of Theresa and started climbing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe reached the top within moments. The top of the ridge stretched out for a hundred miles in either direction - fifty to the left and right. She was lying on her stomach, so the sole of her foot was upwards. The bend of the foot turned the relative smooth surface into a sea of ridges and hills. Above them was her great heel - extending into the air like a monolith. They had landed somewhere on the arc of her foot.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Thank god you're all right!\" She said, with an embrace. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Fortunately, we didn't get knocked apart. He said, returning the affection. After a moment, he puled apart. \"Geezous - you have any idea how small we are?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Into the millionth of an inch range, I think.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What the hell do we do now? How do we contact the large world now?\" He slumped to the flesh ground. \"Even if we could somehow survive the climb to Theresa's ear, we're too small to be heard.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan sat next to him. \"The first rule of crisis - one thing at a time. We'll worry about contacting her when we get there. As for getting there - \" She stood up, pulling him to his feet. \"I've got a plan so cunning, you could pin a tail on it and call it a weasel.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe pulled him along for a quarter of a mile. The landscape was strange and alien. The very pulse of their host as they walked near a vein sent earthquakes throughout the entire field of flesh. Finally she stopped at a grand canyon sized gash. It was a nasty, red laceration, yet the flesh was rendered in a smooth pattern, as if it was a clean cut. Far below, John could see massive red discs forming a great wall, trying to plug the leak.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow - and she didn't notice this?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"To her, it's probably just a paper cut.\" Megan walked to the very edge of the wound. \"I figure that why should we do all the work? Lets just hitch a ride in her bloodstream to somewhere near her head. It should be safe enough - considering some of the other places we've been and survived.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How do we get out?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Tear duct? Somewhere in her lungs? Perhaps we'll get lucky and wind up in her inner ear.\" She crossed to her microscopic lover. \"So, you game?\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

One or the other will pass through there eventually.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Right.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned to Megan. With a big kiss he embraces her. A nod of her head, he scooped the cheerleader in his arms and jumped into the cut on the sole of Theresa's foot.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe pair land at the bottom of the crevasse, and force their way past the rapidly hardening blood cells. Within seconds, they are inside Theresa's blood stream. Megan looked up in fascination, as all around them swirled huge organic boulders - often larger than either of the two miniature people. John turned to look at the wall of the tube racing past. During the intermittent stops, he can just barely make out the cells of Theresa's vein. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn looked at Megan, a quizzical look on his face. She shrugged and relaxed - there was no way to direct their course through the giant woman, so why fight it?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two embrace as they are carried along with the flow. More than happy to let Theresa's heart do all the work, John exploits the moment. Their passion, along with the plasma carry themselves along.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter some time, the tube they are in eventually opens and becomes wider. The pressure increases ever so slightly as the speed multiplies. Megan turns around, hands clutching John's jacket, and sees a large flesh wall before them. Seconds later the, walls roll back - and the pair surges again. She pokes John in the ribs and points. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWith a mighty BOOM sound, the pair are abruptly swept into a gigantic chamber. The glistening pink walls move further and further apart. Just as the two lovers slow down, the walls close in again. They squirt out of the chamber, through another exit and into another flesh room. Megan and John both start looking around for the exit as the pressure inside Theresa's heart begins to build. Just as soon as they entered, the pair are flushed out of the gigantic muscle and sent speeding on their way. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin moments, they reach their next destination - Theresa's lungs. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe walls grow thinner and more translucent as they approach the organ. The sense of motion, the series of surges, is different here, as the walls around them expand and contract. There is a deep, constant rumbling as the mammoth girl breaths in. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan reaches out, grabbing a smaller blood cell. The cell is about the size of a dinner platter to them, and slowly changing color. Carbon Dioxide being replaced with oxygen. The smallest miracle of life, on a grand scale - a special private showing for the two endonauts.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn pokes her in the ribs, and points up. If the air can pass through the membrane, then perhaps they could too. On the other hand, they have a LOT of climbing to do, if they leave Theresa's body now.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Casting an eye towards the clock on the end table, she winces - 4:23 in the morning, far later than she intended to stay. Sleeping off the night's alcohol took longer than she expected. Sitting up, she stretched again, sending shudders through her entire body - and violently shaking the two microscopic beings taking refuge near her lung. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nRiding the tremor out, Megan shakes her head in response to John pulling her towards the wall. Suddenly he was enlightened. If the pair were to leave Theresa's body here - well, who knows what would happen. Sudden air pressure changes could kill them, the hurricane force winds would surely tear them apart, one or the other could become entangled in the soft tree-like tissues throughout the sack. Bottom line, to paraphrase Mister T: I pity the fool who hangs out in a gigantic girls lung. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin moments, the pair are swept on by Theresa's undulating heartbeat. The shaking from her breathing quickly subsides. The tunnel twists and turns, rises and falls. Blood cells swirl around them as they are yanked into another passage. It's like an organic, larger than life roller coaster - without all the insane G-forces.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter an incalculable amount of time, passing through several of Theresa's more obscure and unrecognizable organs, they begin to arrive at their next destination. Megan lets go of her man briefly, in-between surges, stretching her arms wide. Her fingertips just brushing each wall of the vein. She cocks her head: [i]I couldn't do that before - the tunnel is getting smaller and smaller.[/i] She grabbed onto John just as the pair were forced further along. [i]I wonder where we are now?[/i]\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin moments, the passage has narrowed out enough that the pair have to go single file. There isn't even enough room for two blood cells abreast - or the strange particles that have joined the pair in the girl's blood. Then the corridor begins to twist and turn even more, winding it's way through Theresa's body. It's not long before both tiny people have no indication which way is up, let alone which way they are going.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn pokes his companion, pointing at the wall - in this network, the veins are noticeably thinner, and the peculiar particles are being drawn off through them. Of course! They were in one of Theresa's kidneys, watching as the natural filtering process drew out the contaminates from her blood. He caught the look on her face, as understanding and enlightenment crossed it about the same time. She too knew where they were.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe jerked her thumb, indicating the wall. They could, in theory, pass through the wall too - with a little force, and join with her proto-urine. It's not the most elegant exit from Theresa's body, but it is a way out. And it *IS* much safer than exiting from her lung - even if it does mean more of a climb. . . \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She snatched a glance at the clock - 9:15, a much more reasonable time to wake up at. She considered heading into the bedroom for a quick goodbye with her husband-to-be, but he was probably worse off than she was. It was better if she just went home.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSwinging her legs off the couch, she stood up. A wince of pane shot up her body straight from her foot. She dropped to the couch, crossing her leg. There, on the pad of her foot was a medium sized cut, about an inch long. She shook her head, <i>I must have been really drunk last night to have not noticed this.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStanding up, she tried the foot experimentally. It hurt, but not as bad as before. Clearly the pain simply caught her off guard. <i>It's no big deal - no harm done whatsoever</i>.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn however, would see it in a totally different way. The tiny endonaughts clung to a large, round-ish life raft  - a red blood cell. John looked around in amazement - the flow had picked up considerable speed as of late.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>As of late</i>, he chuckled to himself. <i>We've been wandering around inside this girl for who knows how long</i>. John paused in his thoughts as the blood came to a stop. He reached out and touched the inside of her artery. <i>Hours? Days? Weeks?</i> The blood surged forward again, carrying the helpless pair.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>I've seen more of the human body than most doctors. I've become closer to this girl than any man can know - and yet she doesn't even know I exist</i>.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe thought back over the last half hour. He had visited the heart again, and after another trip through the lungs, there was a definite sense of a rising motion. He hoped, he prayed, that he was entering Theresa's head. From there, it would be a simple matter to contact the titanic girl. If he found himself nearing her inner ear, perhaps he could contact her - provided that the everyday sounds of the outside world didn't kill him with a sonic bombardment. Perhaps they could make their way to her tear duct - escape his inadvertent captor just like in <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>. Perhaps reaching her brain would somehow provide an answer.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn raised his head. He looked onward, seeing a large junction ahead. They had been jetting around inside Theresa long enough to know the warning signs - the blood slows ever so slightly, the corridor widens just a bit. He's approaching one of millions of nexus points throughout the girl. Somewhere, far behind him, this gigantic girl's heart will decide which way he will go.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHis fate was held in the hands of girl that he didn't even know.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The auditory system\u00b9s main function is to detect sound, and the function of the vestibular system is to detect movement. Audio, of course, is important - but vestibular  keeps us erect, it balances the body when we move, it maintains images fixed in the retina and is constantly adjusting and rectifying signals from the environment so that organisms can interact with it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n Common problems include accidental damage to the inner ear and/or brain stem and cortex. Foreign objects in the middle ear, puncture of the ear drum, fracture of the temporal bones, blows to the head, so on and so on. Nowhere on that list did a physician include two nearly microscopic people - Megan and John.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe kitchen was busy with activity, as Theresa puttered about making breakfast. She hummed to her self - Beethoven's Ode To Joy, to be precise. Little did she know that the vibrations this simple act were threatening to shake her two microscopic passengers to jelly. She continued to hum away.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, without warning - the world went crazy. An intense wave of vertigo gripped her, the plate with the eggs slipped from her grasp. Unable to find her feet, the redheaded woman sank to her knees and dropped to the floor. In a desperate attempt to stabilize her senses, she slumped to the left. All the while she fought against the most gargantuan bout of motion sickness she had ever had the misfortune to experience.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe lay on the ground, whimpering to herself. Meanwhile, Meg and John continued to swim in her inner ear.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n* * * * * * * \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe veins narrowed, becoming one with Theresa's flesh.

He desperately prayed that whatever was rattling him to the bone would soon go away.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt did not.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe climbed like that for what seemed like hours. Suddenly the world opened up into a new venue, spilling the two tiny endonaughts into a coiled duct with nerve fibers and specialized cells. In their scale, the tiny length of the cochlea - approximately 30 millimeters long, was huge. Beyond words. It was overpowering to their tiny selves.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheir presence did not go unnoticed. The pair shook, as they sloshed back and forth in the fluid. Eventually John swam to a tiny pocket of air.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe gasped in breath, despite his sealed systems. \"Oh, thank god! I thought that ride would NEVER end!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I've seen more of my sister-in law in the last few days than I'll EVER want to again in my life.\" Meg dog-paddled to the wall. \"Where are we?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm guessing somewhere in her inner ear.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow,\" Meg whispered. \"Do you think she can her us?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I hope so - that's the whole point of the three day roller coaster ride.

Propelled along with Theresa's heartbeat was a small cluster of white blood cells. Theresa may have not noticed the two tiny people inside of her - but her immune system most certainly has. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nGrowing anxious, the pair begin to swim downstream in the plasma, hoping to outrun the attacking cells. The extreme concentration of red blood cells however, prevents any movement. For every foot the two travel, they are pelted and slowed by the oxygen carriers. The white cells however,  maneuver with ease. They thread their way through the biological obstacle course with grace and style. It would be an impressive show - if the two were not fleeing for their lives.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA protoplasmic tendril reaches for trailing Meg, wrapping itself around her ankle.

He is just no match, as it flows up to her waist.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, John is jumped from behind by another germ exterminator. It flows quickly up and around his torso.

Tom gazed out at the gigantic woman beneath them - she was tall - but then everyone is tall when you are a millionth of an inch yourself. A long mane of red hair reached the middle of her back, as she lay on her stomach. She wore an expensive evening green evening dress, cut from the ankle to the hip. Aside from sprawling on the couch, she looked elegant. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd they were descending right towards her. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA every so slight current of air altered their course. As Megan screamed, the bundled pair crashed into the soft surface of the leather couch - not the hard, back of the head landing that they were originally destined for. The impact was hard, jarring the two apart. John bounced, rolled and tumbled to a stop in a tangle of hair, while Megan sailed off into the distance, arms and legs flailing. John's skull connected hard with a strand of hair, reverberating throughout his body. Darkness claimed him, and he slumped to the ground.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe awoke to Megan's face, and a distant shaking. He was dimly aware of shouting, but couldn't make out the words. His eyes eventually focused on the Cheerleader's gorgeous green eyes. Suddenly the world returned to full volume, as sound came crashing in around him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"John! Get up! Come on - don't do this to me!\" She shouted, nearly in hysterics. \"Don't leave me alone!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn meekly held up one hand. \"Ok - I'm ok. Please, stop shouting.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe did more than that. She instantly wrapped her arms around him and hugged for everything she was worth. A moan escaped his lips as the abuse, and she backed off. He slumped and fell backwards from the unexpected loss of support.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Uhhhh - my head feels as if I've got a Frenchman living in it.\" He said, covering his eyes with his hand. \"Are you ok?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"More or less - I picked up some bruises and sprains, but it looks like the ring is good for taking care of that too.\" She flexed her right arm in demonstration. \"It almost feels like new.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I wish it would do something for this headache.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStop whining.\" She said, helping him to his feet. He finally took stock of where they had landed. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBy this time, the gigantic Theresa was fully asleep, on her stomach, head turned to face them. All around them was a tangle of hair as it cascaded off her head and surrounded her. It made the area smell faintly of shampoo. Her head was not more than half a mile away from them, so Theresa's majestic face dominated half of their existence. They could see the wrinkles in her cheeks, the eyes darting about under the closed eye lids, the twitches of her lips. Her nose flared in time with her slow and regular breathing.  It was a symphony of tiny, gigantic movements. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn blinked. He *DID* feel better, even in the short time he had been on his feet. \"So, shall we?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Shall we what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned to the tiny girl, gesturing to the mammoth one in the distance. \"Climbing, of course. We have to get in touch with someone, don't we?\" He started walking towards the larger woman.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe walk only took a little bit - a half hour tops. Eventually they reached Theresa's face, just above the bridge of her nose. At this scale, every imperfection, every flaw in the skin stood out like a beacon in the night. The very pores of her skin were deep impressions. The very wrinkles formed a stepladder stretching into the sky.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ladies first?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Age before beauty.\" She smirked, as John started the climb.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Aside from the regular movements associated with her breathing, there was no indication at all that this was a human mountain. Within half an hour, they had reached the summit of the bridge of her nose. The slope of her snout stretched off at a gentle angle, allowing them to make better time as they climbed. It was still slow going - the pores forced constant detours across the landscape.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey were nearing the summit, at the point where the nose joined the cheek - when disaster struck. Over the course of the climb, the shrunken pair had grown complacent - which as any climber will tell you - that's when it's the most dangerous. A brief slip of concentration, combined with a cough from Theresa - suddenly Megan was falling. She plunged with a scream into the distance, only to be caught up in a sudden gust of wind - Theresa's breath. But instead of blowing her out into space, she disappeared from sight.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn was down the side of the gigantic face in an instant, nearly falling into the giant nose himself. \"Megan! MEGAN!\" he shouted - but with no response. Either she was too far away to hear and respond, of the roar of the wind was to great. He glanced around, over his shoulder. Theresa's lips were apart, a louder roar coming from them. [i]If this is her breathing through her mouth, I'd hate to see what a full on sneeze was like! [i]\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn sighed - resigned to following his girlfriend. Climbing carefully down, he reached the edge of the nostril. Before him lie a dark humid cave hundreds of feet tall. Timing the gusts of wind, he slowly climbed into Theresa's nose.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe made is way further and further into the depth's of her head. All around him, a great forest of hair - thick and strong, reached into the sky. As he slowly picked his way through Theresa's nose hairs, he called for Megan. After what felt like forever - he heard an answer. Very faintly, in the distance - but it was an answer. He hurried his pace.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Thank god!\" she exclaimed. She hung, sixty feet off the ground, sweater caught on the very tip of a hair - either fixed by mucus, or snagged on the tip, John couldn't tell. He approached the hair, and begain climbing. It was slow going, considering the hurricane of wind that blasted him every ten seconds or so. As he neared the top, he heard Megan shout.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hurry! I think I'm coming loose!\" He did.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs he neared the end of Theresa's hair, he stretched out his hand. Megan returned the favor, stretching as far as she could. Their fingers brushed ever so slightly as a gust of wind hit them, hot and humid from the depth's of Theresa's lungs. In one last desperate act, he lunged, grabbing Megan's wrist. The movement knocked him off balance - timed with the gust from the outside world, the microscopic people were torn from their perch. With another scream, Megan and John tumbled into the darkness and towards Theresa's lung . . </span></div></div>",

Being shrunken - being eaten, that's one thing - but this, this is insanity.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned, looping his arm around Megan's waist. Just as a burst of electric blue light appeared on the platform, the shrunken pair dived off to safety. An electronic snap-hiss could be heard throughout the entire dorm complex as the mysterious machine melts down to a not-so-mysterious pile of goo. Sparks pop and fly from the remains of the machine as the humming dissipates.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTegan appeared in the doorway, out of breath as if she had run back up the stairs.

I didn't notice much.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You wouldn't have noticed me - although I sure as hell noticed you.\" John smiled sheepshly\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What did you do? Were you a distant admirer or something?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No - you, um - well, I got drunk.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe two reached the far wall and the cabinet with the glasses. The first shelf was several feet above their head, and towered in the distance.

Megan let go, fell several feet, contacted the cold surface and slid to the bottom. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Come on!\" She shouted, waving at the still climbing John.

With him was a woman, obviously her fianc\u00e9e. She was tall and very athetic, a long mane of red hair, reaching the middle of her back. She wore an expensive evening green evening dress, cut from the ankle to the hip. She kicked off her shoes into a corner of the room as she spun and collapsed onto the couch. Megan's brother crossed to the cabinet, and reached for the two wine glasses - and John and Meg.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn grabbed Meg and curled up into as tight a ball as possible, trying to look even smaller. Meg gasped as the fingers made contact with the glass. She watched in fascination as the flesh pressed flat and turned slightly white. But the examination was brief as a thousand pound weight was pressed down upon the two. The glasses lifted high into the air.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin seconds, Gary crossed the room, placing the glasses on the low end table. He spun on his heel and exited the room to the kitchen.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe guy is obviously my brother.\" She said, nodding to the closed kitchen door. \"The girl is Theresa Ashley Williams. I've only met her once before.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa adjusted her foot slightly, her big toe mischievously touching the rim of the glass and rocking the container back and forth slightly. The pair could look up and see the vast collection of swirls on the bottom of the Theresa's toe.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn leaned back against the glass, looking directly up at the massive toe not but 30 feet from his head. \"Playful, isn't she?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes. I wonder if we could get her to knock that off.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Would you like me to climb up there and ask her to knock it off?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThere was no need. Moments later, the toe withdrew. Rummaging and cursing could be heard coming from the kitchen. Clearly Gary was having troubles with the wine. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn leaned forward, folding his arms across his chest. \"So, I've spilled my heart out to you. You're turn - what's your story?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn the space of a heartbeat, Megan went from friendly to quiet. \"It's not important, now.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe didn't want to press. After a few long moments of silence, he decided to move ahead anyway. \"I take it not everything is great at home?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe nodded curtly. John slipped an arm around her shoulders. \"You can tell me. I've been more intimate with you than anybody else.\" He said in a light tone. That got a slight smile from the girl.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't have the lot in the way of friends. I'm not easy to get along with. I've leaded a sheltered life.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I noticed that.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What are they calling me now? 'Ice queen bitch'?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ah - something like that.\" He took a deep breath before pressing on. \"I think the words 'controlling, demanding bitch' comes to mind.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe moved away, every so slightly. \"That's just it - nobody gets that it's the public persona. Daddy loves to look like he's spoiling me, treating me like a princess, so I have to smile and play nice. When we're behind closed doors, it's quite a different story. And then I get nasty rumors started by jilted boyfriends when I don't put out.\" Megan looked away, unable to meet John's gaze. \"Am I perfect? No - but I'm not quite the monster everyone makes me out to be.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe moment hung long in the air between them Finally Megan spoke. \"Listen - I don't know why I'm telling you this.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Because I'm the only man who's been inside your intestines?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe smiled, and shook her head, her blond hair spilling out behind her. \"Let's not talk about it now - it'll just ruin the moment.\" Another total shift of mood in a blink of an eye - she was good at hiding behind masks, swapping them out at a moments notice.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen the torrent of wine hit them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<b><div align=\"center\">\r<br>\n* * * * * * * * * *\r<br>\n</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ta-dah!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGreg finally emerged from the kitchen, victorious. A mangled cork in one hand, the open bottle of Riesling in the other - and a broad smile across his face. Theresa shot up excitedly, swinging her legs off the table. Greg grabbed the one glass, pouring himself a healthy shot of the wine. He leaned forwards, and unintentionally drenched his tiny sister and her equally tiny boyfriend. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa leaned forward, gently picking up her glass. \"To the future.\" She said, lifting her glass aloft. With that, she brought the glass to her lips, and drew a mighty gulp, downing the contents (Meg, John and All) in one go.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA split second after draining her goblet, Theresa began coughing. Moments later, the fit subsided. \"Are you ok dear? \"I think I felt something else go down with the wine.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGary handed the mangled cork to her. \"It was just part of this. I wasn't very gentle getting it out of the bottle, so I imagine that there is the occasional stray remnant.

John started to dogpaddle over to his companion just as the glass was violently jerked into the air. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeg reached for john's outstretched hand as gravity equalized itself. Their fingertips brushed as their world went all crazy again - and the two were separated. John barely had time to bob to the surface again before the world went dark. It was hot, humid and non-stop. The currents in the wine twisted and tumbled, sending the pair out of control, as powerful muscles guided their every move. He plunged down Theresa's throat first, screaming all the way - more like someone at the top of a roller coaster, than someone gripped by abject terror. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan was towards the end of the flow. She bobbed to the surface just in time to hit her head on Theresa's dangling uvula. Tiny face met slimy flesh as Megan instinctively reached out for support. Her fingernails dug into the meat, slowing her decent for only a moment. The suction yanked her away and she too plunged into the darkness below.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe tried to flail as she dropped, but powerful muscles squeezed from all sides.  Moments later the meat tube opened up into a vast chamber. She rolled to a stop.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Welcome to stop one of the Theresa Tour.\" John said, his arms spread wide.

There's the door.\" He scrunched up his face, trying to identify a sound. \"I have no idea what that was - some sort of 'thunk' sound. That's defiantly a zipper and the rustle of cloth.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan lay between a fold of Theresa's stomach, on her belly, kicking her feet in the air behind her. \"And? And?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Water, I think.\" A kind of oscillation ran through Theresa's entire body. \"I think she's brushing her teeth.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few moments pass without running commentary from John. Then suddenly, the entire world shifts 90 degrees. The two miniature people tumble head over heels in a flurry of 'oofs' 'ouches' and 'arghs'. They roll to a stop against the soft, yielding flesh. The only noise is the omnipresent heartbeat far above their heads.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yup - she' s in bed.\" They both say simultaneously.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter brushing her teeth, Theresa crossed to the bookshelf in her bedroom. Grabbing a half-finished tome - a John Gardner spy novel, she walked across her room, sat on her bed. She flicked on the night stand light and lay down.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt had been a long, busy day - filled with a bunch of annoying, controlling people who insisted on getting their own way at the upcoming wedding. Mothers demanding this color, fathers insisting on this flower arrangement. It was a mad house she hated to put up with.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sighed. Finally, her time was her own. She was completely, totally isolated - nothing to disturb her, no interruptions on hand. She'd disconnected the phone, the door was locked - she was alone.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly the flutter at the pit of her stomach was back again. She shook her head, tried to ignore the sensation, and went back to reading. The feeling came back again, this time much stronger. It felt as if a butterfly had been caught within her belly as was trying desperately to escape.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe set the book down, and pulled up her nightshirt. All she saw was her taunt abdomen muscles - certainly nothing that could be causing this. She shuddered, as the feeling started again - much stronger and this time more sustained. The feeling lasted for nearly thirty seconds, as opposed to the brief spurts from before.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHesitantly, she placed two fingers against her stomach, just above where the feeling was coming from. Very slightly, very gently she pressed down. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nInside her stomach, the ceiling bulged in at Theresa's touch. John and Megan stopped their kicking, hitting and shouting. \"That's it! She knows we're here!\" John shouted as Meg leapt into his arms. They hugged and twirled for a moment, rejoicing in the moment.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Quick! Lets do it again over here!\" Megan shouted, dragging John by the arm.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe moment that Theresa pressed down, the tremble inside her stomach stopped. Mere seconds later, it began again - but not under her fingertips - but an inch and a half to the left. Reaching out with her other hand, she pressed down again. After a brief respite, the flutter started three inches towards her feet.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n{/i}What the hell is going on here?{/i}\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Meg used everything in the Official Cheerleader's Handbook to Jumping she knew - and some things she didn't know. John simply went six rounds with the stomach shaped punching bag. But despite their best efforts, the giant prodding fingers never returned. Finally, the whole stomach shifted to the left ninety degrees, sending the two occupants bouncing into the far wall. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What the hell is the matter with her?\" Meg said, kicking at the wall with her foot. \"She *HAS* to be noticing this!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn just lay on his back, staring at the ceiling, listening to the distant heartbeat grow slower and slower. The roaring sound of her breathes slowing, and becoming more regular. \"Theresa must think that we're figments of her imagination or something.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll give her figments!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You might as well give it up.\" He said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder. \"She's going to sleep.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeg sank to her knees and flopped on her back. \"How could she possibly go to sleep with two teeny people constantly poking her from the inside?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNo response.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan rolled over to glare, but her boyfriend had fallen fast asleep.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe flopped onto her back, rolling her eyes. \"How typical.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Morning sunshine!\" Megan said, nudging the other occupant of Theresa's stomach in the ribs. \"Time to get up!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh? What time is it?\" John said, rolling over sleeply.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"6:45. Our gracious host has been up for half an hour already.\" She elegantly rose to her feet, walked several yards away from the prone man, and began stretching. \"I swear, you could sleep through an earthquake.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I think I just did.\" John stood and moved over to where his discarded clothing was. \"So, what's she up too?\" He asked, gathering up his sneakers and slipping them on.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't know - I'm not that good at identifying the outside world through 10 feet of flesh.\" She said between bends. \"Something to do with running water, I think.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, the trap door just above Megan's head trembled. An inundation of liquid and solids erupted forth, squarely drenching the micro-cheerleader. John should have been concerned or worried, rushing to his girlfriend's side - yet all he could do is fall over, paralyzed with laughter. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAll Megan had time to do was shriek in surprise before another flood of food drenched her. An errant chunk of sausage knocked her off her feet, sending her tumbling into the depths of Theresa's stomach. She rolled to a corner of the belly, coming to a stop half submerged in a pile of masticated eggs. She had rolled over and was pulling her legs out, when a mound of bacon came rolling down pinning her torso. Then a barrage of Orange Juice, topped off with some toast cascaded down.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn-between the constant stream of cursing, the sit-com moments and pratfalls, all John could do is laugh. It was like watching an \"I Love Lucy\" episode, but with gastronomical juices instead of chocolates. Meanwhile, John was relatively high and dry at his end of the stomach, away from the constant flow of chewed food.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Thanks for the support.\" Meg growled as the laughter died away. \"Do you think I could get a hand here?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn started applauding. The clapping cut off abruptly as he had to dodge a thrown handful of eggs, lobbed by the food-covered cheerleader.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Geeze, you dump a quarter ton of egg on a girl and she gets all upset.\" He mumbled as he waded into the waist high sea of dissolving food. He sloshed his way over to the half buried girl, and grabbed her arm. Bracing himself on the stomach wall, he pulled. Between the two of them, Megan managed to extract herself from the mound. As she pulled herself free, she violently jerked her arm away from John. Without the limb to hang onto, John found himself free-falling backwards. He landed in the ocean of nutrients with a *KER-PLUNK*.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn bobbed to the surface, to find Megan laughing at him. He began wading over to her. \"Offhand, I'd say Theresa was making breakfast.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No kidding, Sherlock.\" Megan grumbled as she climbed a reasonably solid pile of sausage and eggs. All around her, the walls of the stomach began to undulate and tremble.\r<br>\n \r<br>\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm happy for this turn of events.\" John said, climbing next to Meg.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Because I'm starting to get hungry. The ring made us immune to loads of stuff, and gave us a strength boost - but hell if it didn't do anything for hunger.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeg scrunched up her face and stuck out her tongue. \"Oh - you're not serious!\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"She'll never even notice that the little bit we took is gone.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"*I'll* notice.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Now how is borrowing a little food from our generous guest any different than, oh say spending the night in someone's stomach?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I wasn't thinking - it was my, um - gut reaction, I guess.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn dumped a fistful of goo on her head for that. The brawl quickly degenerated into a gastronomical wrestling match. Ten minutes later, Meg pinned John between a wedge of sausage and a stringy something. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe several minutes consisted of Meg at the dry end of the stomach sorting small amounts of food the best she could. She was fairly sure that bit was eggs. The mound next to it was gooey and damp toast. Several chunks of bacon were stacked on top of each other. It was slow going, considering the mound was being dissolved out from under her, and the now constant motion of Theresa's digestive process was designed to thwart just such attempts. Admitting defeat, Megan grabs a handful of undigested glop and sits next to her boyfriend.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Stop delaying the inevitable.\" He said, biting off another mouthful of goo. \"It's not that bad - well, relatively speaking.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Relative to what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um - ah.  . . well.\" He stammered. \"How about that weather we've been having?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe just shot him a sideways glance and ignored the comment. \"So, you given any thought to how we're getting out of here?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Not yet. Have you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, we can go along for the ride,\" she said, indicating the huge mound of food surrounding them, \"or we can just climb out.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

With a slight 'pop' she pulled herself free of the sphincter and rolled to a stop in the sagging tube.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBehind her, an arm thrust its way through the center of the ring, waving for help. A rumble resonated throughout their hosts' body. She had been awake and moving about, doing her morning routine for several hours now. They could hear her talking in muffled tones, as she orchestrated her wedding via the phone. Running water sound indicated that she was in the middle of a shower.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn pulled himself through into Theresa's intestine, falling into Megan's arms. He laughed at the ridiculous position they found themselves in as he stared up into her face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly and electronic chirping filled the fleshy tube. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What the hell?\" Megan muttered rolling over onto her side and reaching into her back pocket. Grunting, she pulled out a small black device - a cellular phone.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Holy crap! Where did that come from?\" John asked, levering himself up.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe laughed, hugging her new boyfriend. \"All this time and I forgot I had it!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe returned the kiss, and broke apart. \"Well, aren't you going to answer it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe blinked for a moment, with a quietly bemused expression on her face. \"Oh, yeah.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nFlipping it open, she brought it to her ear. \"Hello?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan, where were you last night?\" Her brother was on the other end of the phone sounded extremely vexed. \"We waited at your dorm for over an hour, and you never arrived.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBullshit, she thought. It was half an hour tops - period. Nevertheless she put a smile in her voice. \"I'm terribly sorry, brother dear. I . . . I wound up meeting a most wonderful man, and we went out on an impromptu date.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSniggers from the other occupant of the intestine nearly broke Megan's poker face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGrowing more angry on the other end of the phone. \"Megan - I thought you had outgrown this irresponsible phase. I'm very displeased - and poor Theresa. She doesn't need this kind of stress before the wedding.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMeg slumped back, leaning hard into the soft flesh wall behind her. A gurgle of digestion activity rumbled throughout the tube as their air pocket moved just a bit closer to freedom. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few moments after Theresa's gastronomical event subsided, Gary spoke up again. \"What was that?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That? Oh, just a bit of gas.\" She snickered to herself. \"Listen, I feel extraordinarily bad. What's Theresa's number. I'll call her myself and apologize.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"555-7759\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan snickered again, collapsing onto John's shoulder. \"I'll give her a call right away - as soon as she gets out of the shower.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nGary almost asked how she knew Theresa was in the shower, but thought better of it. \"I'll call you later this evening.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She wrapped a towel around herself as her feet touched down on the warm shag throw rug on the bathroom floor. Her long hair was a ratty tangle of wet strands. She brushed them out of her eyes and quickly dried herself off. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nExiting the bathroom, she threw on a long flowing red dress, topping it off with a dark green sweater. She didn't care if the outfit was suitable for human consumption outside her home. It was comfortable, and that was all she needed. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe crossed to her living room and flopped in one corner of her futon. Curling her long legs up underneath her, she grabbed the TV remote and flicked it on. The DVD she was watching last sprang to life - an old copy of When Worlds Collide by George Pal. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTucking the sun dress under her bare feet, she leaned back only half watching the movie. Finally - a brief moment of rest amid the chaos of her planning. The wedding was still a couple of weeks off, so she had plenty of time. No point putting it off until the last second, though.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe considered for a moment. Perhaps she was pushing herself too hard. She had spent most of the day with an strangely upset stomach. It was a unique feeling - unlike anything she had ever felt before. It came in spurts, like a fluttering feeling deep inside her. She hoped it wasn't an ulcer.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer hand went to her abdomen subconsciously as the flutter returned. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nComments about strange upset feeling in her stomach all day long. Lies back and relaxes. Flutter again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe movie - and her musing - was interrupted by her phone. Shifting slightly, she picked up the cordless extension. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hello?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe voice on the other end sounded strange, yet familiar. \"Hi Theresa, it's Megan.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa sat up sharply, sliding forward to the edge of the couch. From the other end of the phone, sounds of commotion could be heard. She sits up. A look of confusion crossed her face. Of course, she could have no idea that the call was coming from inside her own body.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, it's you.\" She said coldly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Look, I'm very sorry that I skipped out on you guys.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't need this kind of stress this close to my wedding, thank you very much. Be dependable, or be gone.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I can only\" - the rest was cut off by a rumble - like a freight train passing in a subway. She took this brief pause to reflect on how hungry she was. As soon as she was rid of this distraction, she would make lunch.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I didn't catch that. What did you say?\" Theresa asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I said I can only say sorry so many times, you know.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSlightly satisfied, she sat back. \"OK - this is your chance to make it up to me.

I want to get back to normal.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe nodded, knowningly. \"Ok, hang on then - this is going to be rough.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe water began churning and heaving, tossing the tiny couple as they cling to each other. A deafening coughing/hacking was heard from far above, as Theresa focused all her attention on her stomach muscles. The walls collapsed, the chamber tightened. The agitation grew worse, and suddenly the water level of Theresa's stomach dropped. The shaking intensified, the rumbling grew louder and louder - and suddenly, there was a thrusting movement. The pair was dumped into Theresa's esophagus, where the squeezing and churning strengthened. Megan felt as if she was going to be crushed and torn apart at the same time.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe water surged forward again; the pair tumbled out into Theresa's mouth. The pressure was finally too great, and the micro-lovers were torn loose from each other's grasp. John sailed out of Theresa's mouth in a graceful arc, landing in the bathtub far below. Megan wasn't so lucky, finding herself wedged in-between Theresa's tongue and her back teeth. The flow eventually subsided, and John comes to a rest near the plugged drain.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe pretty face of Gary's fianc\u00e9e dominated the sky far above him - the first time John's gotten a good look at her. Her eyes, vaguely glazed over from the recent ordeal, were a beautiful hazel. She had a round face, dotted with freckles. If he had to pick someone's insides to explore, he could have done much worse.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she slowly and cautiously wiped off her mouth with the back of her hand, John looked around for Megan. Despite the enclosed area, she was nowhere to be seen. He glanced over at the drain, realized that the giant stopper prevented anything from progressing downwards. He looked up - she still must be inside Theresa! \r<br>\n\r<br>\nFar above the tiny John, Theresa's eyes finally focused. She sat back on her legs folded under her. She took a deep, deep breath - trying to clear the palate from the nasty taste of her stomach. She was so focused on the squirming in her belly - or lack thereof, that she didn't notice the unconscious lump in her mouth under her tongue. Shaking her head to clear it, she cast an eye back to the contents of the bathtub before pulling the plug on the drain. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe almost didn't see the tiny man, as he waved his arms franticly trying to catch her attention before she swept him away to oblivion. She blinked once, hand on the drain stopper - then she blinked again. She had trouble believing what her eyes were telling her. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What the hell?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn waved, smiling as broadly as he could.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What - what the hell are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hi - I'm John.\" The blank expression on his face told him she was unable to hear him at all. \"Nope, I didn't think so\" he muttered to himself. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe waved her closer, motioning to the ground by lowering his hand. It took a few minutes to get the point across to pick him up. A dawning crossed her face and she extended her hand to him. He walked over to her massive hand, the tip of the finger about twice as tall as he was.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Damn - now that's a big hand.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLooking over his shoulder once, he reached out and grabbed onto the tip of Theresa's index finger. The fingerprints before him stretched skyward like a flesh stepladder. The 'rungs' of the ladder were soft and springy to the touch, yet surprisingly firm. John quickly scrambled up Theresa and scurried to the center of her upturned palm. Theresa's giant brown eyes took in his every move.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe heat coming off her palm was surprising - it was more pervasive than he would have expected. He cast his eyes to the ground, the vast field of lines before him was beautiful and captivation. The fingers curling over in the distance looked like might skyscrapers - and hammered home just how fragile he and Megan were. He flexed his hand unconsciously.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe turned and motioned with his hand to the side of his head. Theresa blinked. He repeated the motion a couple of times, pointing to the giant. She nodded and raised her hand to her ear. He walked to the edge of her hand, took one look at the ground below, and leapt into her ear.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe landed softly within the concave folds of Theresa's ear. He sighed, moving forward.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few dozen feet into the ear, he encountered a field of hairs - much like tall grass. Reaching out to touch one, it had a delicate feel yet very firm. It (and the hundreds others just like it) was clearly designed to keep dirt and small objects out. Well, this was one small object that would not be denied. He brushed them aside with ease and continued inward into Theresa's ear canal.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually the hairs began to thin out, and the faint wax build on the surface of Theresa's skin was left behind. The ear canal began to narrow slightly. A few dozen feet more and the narrow tunnel of flesh opened up. It was a small chamber just big enough to stand up in. Before John was the thin membrane of Theresa's eardrum. The eardrum was huge, yet thin enough to be almost translucent. It was cool and smooth to the touch. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um, hello. How are you?\" he eventually said. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe booming response came from all around him. \"Wow - you ARE real. Who - what are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"My name is John, and boy do I have a long story to tell you . . .\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The first sensation that she was aware of was that it was very warm and extremely wet. Her eyes focused on a large wet red wall dominating her view. All around her, she felt movement - from the wall, from the hard things she lay upon, where she was at - <i>where am I at?</i> she wondered as she pressed her fingertips up against the wall inches above her. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly she remembered! This is the underside of Theresa's tongue! Those hard things jabbing in the back were Theresa's molars! The events came flooding back to her, how John and her had managed to convince the giant to toss her cookies - and them, up. She must have gotten lodged somewhere on the way out.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTrying to move as little as possible, she rolled over. Her hands sunk several inches into Theresa's gum line as she tried to wiggle out from underneath her tongue. She managed to find a gap where two gigantic teeth met - not quite large enough to slip through, but just large enough to move upwards. She squirmed between the hard wall of enamel and a thousand pounds of muscle, rolling over onto the top of Theresa's tongue. She turned around to face the mouth just as the opening widened. Seconds later, billions of gallons of water flooded into the chamber, sweeping her into the darkness and back down the throat.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Aw crap! Crap, crap, crap!\" she shouted, pounding her fists in tiny anger as she rolled to a stop inside Theresa's stomach.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa tied her robe as she walked out of the bathroom and crossed to the kitchen. She pulled a tall glass of water, hoping to kill the nasty taste of bile in her mouth. Downing the large glass in one go, she walked into the living room. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, John. I bet you have an interesting story to tell me.\" Theresa asked, sitting on the couch. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, see I was at the Blue Parrot club two or three nights ago.\" John began, while settling in and leaning up against the wall of Theresa's ear canal. \"I wound up being shrunk there.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You know - I'm not quite sure. A magic ring, but I don't know more than that.\" John paused, uncertain.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What's wrong?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um, it's a little disconcerting talking to a wall of flesh that's suppose to be you. Hang on a second.\" He reached into his inner jacket pocket and pulled out his ball point pen. Clicking the end, he began to draw on the flesh directly across from him. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa almost fell over from the amazingly light tickle coming from the inside of her head. It was all she could do to keep from scratching madly or laughing - both would be bad for her microscopic guest. \"Wha - what did you just do?\" she managed to finally gasp out.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm sorry - I drew a smile face on your eardrum.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa just laughed long and hard at that.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter a few moments, John continued. \"Anyway, I wound up hitching a ride home with - oh dear.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Where's Megan?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Gary's sister - you swallowed her as well! We were together when we came up - she must be inside you somewhere!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You mean like right now? There's someone in my stomach at this exact moment?\" She smiled. \"Cool.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So we were at Megan's dorm room when, she touched the ring and shrank too. She must have picked it up at the bar or something. We tried to get the attention of either Gary or you from the wine glasses - and you wound up the lucky winner. And here we are.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa had gotten up from the couch at this point. She was too excited to sit still, and so paced around the room. \"So, what do we do now?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We have to find Megan, get the ring back - and then . . . I don't know. First things first.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, how do we get her out?\" Theresa smacked her lips subconsciously. \"I'd prefer not to heave again - I'm still getting rid of the nasty taste from the first time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I could go get her, and then we climb out ourselves.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That should work if I lie down and don't swallow.\" She moved her right hand to her left ear. \"Ready when you are.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn stood up and traversed the ear canal once again. He looked up as he walked, running his fingers along the ceiling. <i>This is way too much room in here. I have to be smaller than the original 1/2 inch estimate. <i> he mused as he walked along. Passing through the field of hair he moved into the shell shape of the exterior ear. Beyond was the vast horizon of her massive palm. Stepping carefully, he moved onto her hand into the center of her palm. He was unready for the sudden motion as Theresa brought her palm around to her face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"When you get her, poke me as hard as you can. After that I'll lay down and try to keep from swallowing until you are out, ok?\" John jumped up and down and waved his arms in response.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe hand moved closer to Theresa's mouth as she stuck her tongue out. The tip overlapped the palm by several feet, allowing John to safely climb on. The muscle retracted and he found himself in darkness again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

The inside of the shop was long and narrow, the walls lined with dusty, ancient tomes. The air was slightly tainted with the smell of incense, masking the dust smell. A large black and white cat lay sprawled on a stack of books two feet high. He looked up as the female human entered, but instantly deemed her unworthy of giving him attention. He went back to sleep.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa wandered through the maze of bookshelves to the back, her tiny passengers safely tucked away in her left ear. She looked at a handful of the the titles as she passed. \"<u>Tobin's Spirit Guide</u>\", \"<u>Walberg's Book of Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen. </u>\", \"<u>Roland's Encyclopedia to Ancient Sects</u>\". The titles went on and on.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually  she mad her way to the back of the store. The owner - Ray, was a medium build fellow in his mid forties, with a hairdo that looked like it was a spiky, dead hedgehog. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Anita in?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Humph?\" Yeah, she's in the back.\" He mumbled as he gestured over his shoulder.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe walked back to find a short girl, about 28 or so, sitting behind a desk. She looked up from a big, thick book much older than she was. \"Theresa! How are you!\" She exclaimed, coming around the desk for a hug. \"What brings you by?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa held out the ring, wrapped in a cloth handkerchief.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita's eyes widened. \"Oooh - fourteenth century, European design - no, wait - defiantly Russian.\" She gazed at the black stone. \"Pearl stone, gold inlays - and probably about a four point four on the Psychokenitic energy scale.\" She sat down. \"Where'd you get it?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"A couple of close friends found it, and fell into a bit of trouble - \"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You could say that.\" Megan said.

The two styles are very similar around that period in -\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What about the ring!\" The two shrinkies shouted at Theresa.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The ring?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ah - right.\" She dropped a heavy tome onto the table in front of Theresa, a large picture of a Indian temple on the right hand page. \"In 1463, Lord Felton the mighty received this cursed ring from Alkazar the Black Knight - and was never seen again. The ring disappeared for several centuries until 1717 in Spain\" She flipped forward to a majestic looking Spanish lady holding aloft a character of the very same ring. \"Apparently it was instrumental in the disappearance of several high court officials.\" It vanished again for years - then the Nazis were said to have it. Although Hitler was big into the occult, I think this one was just but a rumor.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The ring was said to reduce people. Some say it stature, some say physically. Nobody knows for sure.\" She closed the book. \"And now you have it.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Can she unshrink us?\" John demanded. But before Theresa could ask, she was cut off by Anita.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So tell me just WHY are you so interested in a ancient artifact of unspeakable power?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Perhaps I should show you, instead.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita watched with fascination as Theresa reached to unhook her earring. When her fist came back, instead of a diamond stud in the palm of her hand, sat two very tiny people. Meg waved to the giant set of eyes far above her. The eyes blinked in amazement.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow. I guess that means the second set of people were right.\" She leaned in closer. \"May - may I touch them?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"If it's OK with them, sure.\" A round of nods came from the two tiny people. Anita held out her hand next to Theresa's, keeping it as steady as she could. Megan was the first across, stepping from Theresa's hand to Anita's with a light spring in her step. John crossed moments later, much less enthusiastically. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow - they're so tiny, I can barely even feel them.\"   \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Just wait until they start marching up and down your ear canal. Then you'll feel them.\" She dug the index finger into her ear and scratched as hard as she could. \"So, they've been eager to know if you can get them back to their former height. Actually, they've been very insistent.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe brought her hand up to the level of her eyes. \"Actually the process is very simple, as far as mystical rituals go.\" The diminutive leaped into the mans arms, and they both fell to Anita's palm rolling around and laughing. \"Before you two get too excited, there is a catch. There's a deadline to reversing the effects. If the ritual isn't completed by the deadline, the effects are permanent.  . . \"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She's even figured out how to shrink objects and clothes for us - no longer were we forced to wear the same thing day after day. Eventually she figured out how to shrink herself to our scale, so me and her finally have had a proper meeting face to face.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa's wedding eventually came and went, with two extra guests in the front row of the church. Since we were destined to spend the rest of our lives together, we exchanged vows also. It didn't mean anything in the eyes of the law, but between us and before whatever gods are out there - that was all that we needed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, honey.\" Megan started, as we leapt onto the gigantic passing bride amid the shower of rice, \"Where were you thinking of going for our honeymoon?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI rolled onto my back, watching the vast sky above us go by. \"Well, I understand that Theresa's intestines are lovely this time of year\", I said with a devilish grin on my face.

Megan landed a huge kiss on the man - he had at least 6 hours before the deadline, and she had nearly 12. He returned the favor, picking her up, twirling the micro-cheerleader around. He tripped on the lifeline in Anita's palm, a huge gash across the relatively even surface of her skin. The two tumbled into a heap, near the base of her thumb. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita watched the two's reaction. \"I'll take that as a yes\". She turned to Theresa, sitting across the table, offering her hand back. \"Here, keep an eye on these two while I get to work. I shouldn\u2019t been but a moment.\" As the pair jump from one plane of flesh to another, the gigantic woman set about her work.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn pulled Megan to her feet, walking down Theresa's palm, settling at the base of her middle finger. All the while under the gigantic eyes of the redheaded woamn. \"So what do we do?\" He asked, leaning back against the wall of flesh behind him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What do you mean?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I mean when we get to normal. Does everything go back the way it was?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe leaned in close, putting her arm close around her boyfriend. \"I don't think so,\" she said with a kiss.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly a torrential rain storm poured down on the two, breaking the embrace. John's head snapped around, looking at the skyscraper sized woman across from them. She held a small perfume atomizer, and was currently spraying the two (and Theresa's hand). She smiled and grinned, slightly shrugging. \"Sorry - part of the ritual.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita continued to light candles, wave incense and so on. \"Ok, I'm nearly set. For this part,\" she said pointing to Megan, \"you . . .um, ah . . . \"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan\" Theresa offered.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan, you get to play the big roll in the drama here.\" She grabbed a book of a nearby shelf - a dusty old tome, and began flipping it open. \"For some reason or another, only a female can properly harness the ring. Why - don't ask me, I just read the books.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa interjected. \"Then what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well,\" she said addressing Megan, \"you have to assert your will on the ring - some sort of mental dominance to show it who's the boss.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe tiny cheerleader looked confused. \"Just think happy thoughts. All the hocus pocus makes it seem more scary than it really is. You'll do fine.\" She nodded for Theresa to lower her hand.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe pair walked to the edge of Theresa's palm. By this time, they had gotten used to traveling on a moving mountain. Creases in her skin were easy to avoid, the pulse of her heartbeat was simply another rolling feature of the landscape, the pores were a simple matter to work around. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan lowered herself first, using the folds in Theresa's tan flesh as handholds. Swinging his legs out over empty space, John followed suit. The pair stepped off onto a purple felt surface, with some sort of writing and/or runes on it. What exactly, they were not in a position to tell.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita sprayed more of the foul smelling stuff on the ring, and placed it several dozen feet (their scale) away to their right. \"Any time you are ready.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTwo sets of mammoth eyes watched as Megan walked over to the ring, a hesitation in her step. She looked into the deep black gem as she approached. The blackness beyond twilight lay within - it was damn creepy. She stretched out one lone hand, laying her palm flat against the facet, filling her mind with happy thoughts as she did. Then, an atom bomb went off in her head, a flash of light filling her vision - her mind. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd all became dark . . . \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The man sitting opposite her was clearly not finding the sun quite as much to his taste; a wide brimmed hat was rammed on his head, and he wore a ridiculous looking macintosh, buttoned up so that all that could be seen of the man inside was the bridge of his nose, and the madly staring eyes that sat either side of it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You're sure that the Ring is coming here?'

Britney asked brightly, taking a sip of lemonade from one of the three brightly coloured straws that were in her glass.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I'm sure that I've explained this to you before.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Well I forgot, so explain it again.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Very well.  The Ring was crafted centuries ago by the last sorceress to live, and she enchanted it so that only a woman could use its power - any man touching it would suffer from its baneful effects.  It was a lot of trouble to go to to acquire it simply to protect a treasure map.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'But you want it more for the world domination aspect, right?'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Precisely.  But for the cursed circumstances of my gender, it would already be mine, but instead I've had to nurture you, raising you as a woman fit to be my vassal, to bear the Ring in my name!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'But I can have a little fun too, can't I?'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'But of course...' smiled the man, his eyes glittering as they caught the sun before he lowered them into shadow once more.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n***\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter an uneventful flight, John and Megan were ready to enter their hotel.  Still airsick, John decided to forgo the traditional threshold carrying of the new wife.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Well, it's not perfect, but it's as good as could be expected on your finances.' Megan announced after a look around the main room.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I'd forgotten that you were used to the finer things in life.' John mumbled, dumping the luggage onto the floor.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThere was a knock at the door.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Answer it, would you?' came Megan's voice from the bathroom.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You should really have gone on the 'plane.' John admonished her, opening the door back up again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You know tha-'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt all happened at once.  Megan screamed, and John was thrown back as a large man in a dark suit and sunglasses burst in through the door.  Dazed, he looked up to see a pistol pointing at him.  And Britney Spears.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'What the fuck?'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Sorry about this, but I believe you have a Ring that belongs to me.' Britney smiled.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'The ring?  Why should I-'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I'd think carefully before you answer.' Britney said, her eyes raising from John's prone form.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn turned his head, still mindful of the gun, and saw Megan being taken out of the bathroom, another besuited man holding one arm around her throat.  The other arm pressed a gun to her temple.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I'd hate to see this new marriage get off to a bad start.'\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The only sign of civilization was their camp. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was, in short, paradise. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly, a spear landed at Megan's feet, kicking up a plume of sand. John jumped to his feet to face the threat. He was met by several native tribesmen exploding out of the bushes around them. They wore primitive rags for clothing, bore shells and bones for jewelry, and all carried obsidian tipped spears. In short, it looked like something off a Gilligan's Island episode come to life.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt took John a few moments, but then it dawned on them - all the warriors were women. Not a man was to be seen amongst them. Megan obviously caught this fact too, as she glanced out of the corner of her eye at John.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin seconds, the lovers were surrounded. Then, a warrior - the leader of the hunting band - stepped forward. She was fairly pale skinned, much less than what you would expect. She had long black hair tied back into a functional pony tail. She was of course adorned with the animal skins and bones of her fellow hunters. \"Greetings outlander.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWell, that wasnt what I was expecting, thought John.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You were expecting some uncultured primitive dialect, perhaps?\" the native said, clearly reading the surprise on his face.

The normally quiet snoring emanating from her reverberated throughout the jungle. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe first warrior crouched near the gigantic heel of the large woman and peered around the corner. There, spread out in a nest of Megan's hair was their target. The normal sized man slept soundly, not but five feet away from the face of his woman. Both warriors looked at each other. This was going to take some doing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe older one started forward - only to be interrupted by Megan snorting and coughing. She ducked back behind the woman's foot. The younger warrior glanced at her master and shrugged. The older one reached up, touching the sole of Megan's foot. She scratched lightly against her skin - no reaction from the giant. Satisfied that she was still asleep, she motioned her partner to follow.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThey slowly quietly walked forward, drawing parallel to the sleeping man.

Native wall hangings, flickering torch light - two burley amazon-like women carrying spears on guard. The smell of smoke hung heavy in the air.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe rose to his feet slowly, shakily. She saw the mid-20's woman beyond the bars. She wore an elaborate, if minimal dress. She carried herself with an air of importance and power. Her hair was long and black, tied behind her back.

Maybe she should make him bigger too, so that she could understand what he was trying to tell her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stop, Megan!' John told his wife, grabbing her by the shoulders to prevent her from visiting any more devastation on the village.  'It's all right!  These people are our friends!  Now, if you'll just make us both normal size again...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way that he spoke, as if he knew her...  She should listen, she felt tired.  The rings could wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is as I feared.' K'lashan told the couple later, when the missing warriors had been restored, and John separated Megan from the rings.  'The power of the rings is great, but with it they bring great misery' - she swept her arm to take in the rebuilding work that her people were already beginning - 'and madness.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But what can we do to stop this?  I love my wife, and I don't want to see her go insane!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All power corrupts, and it is not you alone who would weep should the rings totally corrupt her.  The world would be ended.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great.  But listen to me again.  How.  Do.  We.  Stop.  This.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You must find the others rings.  This map tells of the location of the Ring of Shadow, in the land that your people now call Spain.  That is the best place to start.  Should you gather all five rings, and unite them in one place, one of two things will occur.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Go on...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If the uniter is pure of heart, the power of the rings will be destroyed forever.  Should they be evil though...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'End of the world?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The legends are... not clear.  But I think that it would be safe to assuem that it would not be good.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Piece of piss then.  We get the rings and break them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would that it were so easy.  Other powers in the world seek them, and this 'Britney Spears' you told me of is but the least of their agents.  There will be others, you can be sure of that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can we expect them to be pop singers too?  Or are we talking gun toting movie villains?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How should I know?  I've been stuck here in Hawaii all my life.  All I can tell you is that you should go at once.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But Megan, in her condition...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I am sure that she will awaken in time.  The injuries to her mind, however...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why don't you come with me?  You're pure of heart, right?  Megan can rest up here for a while, and then there's no danger.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nK'lashan raised her eyebrows.  'I thought that you loved her?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And being parted from her will hurt - but I'd much rather that than see her turn into a goddess of death and destruction in front of my eyes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good point.'</span></div></div>",

There was only one way for her to return to normal, and nothing would stop her.  One of her minions had transported her this far, but she had dismissed him when she had seen the savages approaching.  The two women had towered over her, each of their footsteps throwing up vast quantities of sand and causing her to keep her distance for fear of being crushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was relieved when they finally left, making off with the man.

It suddenly snapped into her mind why her husband looked so damn strange - even to her half asleep brain. \"You know it's not polite to walk on a ladies face.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan was lying on her back. John was straddling her nose, leaning on it's bridge. He playfully kissed her. \"Even if that lady is my wife?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe narrowed her eyes. \"Doubly so - short stuff.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" John said smugly. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nVertigo engulfed him as the world spun around him. Suddenly he found himself at only a quarter of an inch tall. Of course his woman remained at fifty feet - so John unexpectedly found himself at the bottom of a wrinkle - perhaps at the corner of her mouth. Surrounded by a valley of flesh, he slumped to the ground defeated. \"Ok - I give! I'll get off.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSeconds later, he was back to normal - or as normal as things could get in this very strange relationship. He slid down her chin and off her head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBreakfast consisted of more local flora and fauna plucked from natures garden and warmed over the campfire.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Rings of world domination - what the hell would someone want to put something like that together for?\" John asked between bites. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"A different era, different way of thinking, I guess.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe finished off the last of his coconut milk. \"So what do we do when we - I mean you get the whole set?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan looked up from her plate. \"What do you mean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh come on - surely you must have at least entertained the idea, even slightly.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What, you mean capitalizing on my new found God-Like Powers and seizing control of the planet? Why ever would I want to do that? Besides we don't know what the other three rings do. For all we know they might be the Ring of Eternal Turkey Basting, the Ring of Super Powered Taste - useful if a crime ever occurs in my mouth - and the Ring of Pauly Shore removal. On second thought - that last one might not be so bad.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn moved around to her side of the camp-fire. \"But even if the last three rings are a bust, you've certainly got enough to work with. Being any size you want - that doesn't suck you know.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Tell you what - lets wait until we get the rest of the set. Then we'll worry about the future.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was about an hour later when the two set out back to the mainland. On the bridge, John leaned heavily on the wheel looking out over the horizon. His mind was awash with thoughts. \"So I wonder how big you could get?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\" I have no idea. The last three weeks have been a whirlwind, so I've never had a chance to experiment with this thing.\" She pondered the cold metal band and jet black stone on her hand.  \"I mean that we can do a quarter of an inch tall, so you figure that the reverse would be true. A hundred feet? Five hundred? Several miles tall?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's pretty big.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah. . . \"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSadly any further rumination was cast aside when suddenly. . .</span></div></div>",

John returned just a hour later, his arms full of dates and berries. They settled to the sand in front of their makeshift lean-to, underneath a canopy of palm trees. The camp fire brought a meager amount of light to the proceedings. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe salt air was warm and fragrant, filled with the smells of the sea tempered with the lush  jungle behind them. The roll of the waves gently lapping at the shore the only sound for miles.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was, in short, paradise. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nSuddenly the forest around them exploded with activity as a dozen heavily armed (and sexy) female Ninjas clad in black (yet revealing) jumpsuits emerged from the bush. Some descended on ropes from the surrounding trees, while others erupted out of the surf in front of them. Instantly - soundlessly, the enemy agents surrounded the two lovers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMoments later, the very earth beneath their feet began churning. A dozen feet to their right emerged a drilling machine, bursting out of the beach. The might drill on the nose of the craft came to a stop, and the hatch hissed open. Shrouded by steam and dust, a figure appeared at the head of the ramp. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan blinked. \"Brittany? What the hell! We left you in a shoe box in a hotel room a hundred miles from here.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWearing an efficient and functional (yet alluring and sexy) combat jumpsuit, the full sized Brittany Spears strode up to the pair. \"You see - that was simply a drone agent cloned from imperfect DNA. I am, for all intents and purposes - the real McCoy.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How did you find us?\" John stammered out.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh please, do you think that I would be so foolish to not have agents stationed outside the hotel?\" she said with a dismissive wave of her hand. \"After you left, it was a simple matter to follow you. And here we are.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You evil bitch!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I know. But, back to our previous discussion: what will it be? Will you give me the ring or will we be forced to make you eat hot lead?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn pondered for a moment- not at the offer, but at the fact that the mega-pop teen idol just said 'eat hot lead'. Very surreal indeed. He glanced to the two gunmen in the room - if they didn't play this right, things could get ugly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Enough stalling - give us the item.\" Brittany was sounding more and more like a gangster every moment.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was Megan who eventually spoke up. \"Ok, fine - we'll give you the ring.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBrittany nodded in approval. \"Wise girl.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan struggled against the iron grip of the Ninja commando behind her. \"Magilla the Gorilla will have to let go of me first - I cant very well retrieve it, if I cant reach it.\" Ninja Commander Spears nodded curtly, and the agent faded into the shadows with a bow.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan slowly rummaged through her sack, looking for the ring. Eventually she pulled out a small lock box - under the watchful eye of the goon squad.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No tricks now.\" Brittany commanded. The Ninja agents all stood well back from the woman with the ring, knowing that any physical contact would mean their instant shrinkage. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan calmly walked forward, the ring sitting in the palm of her hand. Stopping next to John, she nodded. \"No tricks, just magic.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn the blink of an eye, the two vanished out of sight. The commandos opened fire, but they were too slow. It was if the couple had never been there at all.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Fuck!\" Brittany barked out as the two melted away. Dropping to her hands and knees, she squinted at the sand. \"Seal off the area! They're still here - we just have to find them.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHidden amongst the massive boulders of sand all around them, John hugged his wife. \"Slick move dear. You've bought us a bit more time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe glanced around. For hundreds of miles in either direction stretched nothing but desolate sand as far as the eye could see. Well, that and a handful of several mile tall Ninja commandos and their musician leader. \"Yeah, but only just a bit - eventually someone will find us.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn began laughing at the irony. \"We started out our relationship by trying to make contact with a giant. Now we're desperately dogging being found.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We have to get out of here and go find us some treasure.\" Brittany's titanic face moved closer, eyes rapidly searching for the escaped couple.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll bite - how?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, we could hitch a ride with the villainous musician,\" he said indicating the giant eye directly above him, \"or we could get microscopic on them and wait until they leave. They'll never find us that way.\"</span></div></div>",

The slight flexing of her flesh beneath them causing no end of trouble to their progress. The simple action of standing up and bring her hand to chest level translating as a 8.8 earthquake. It was, simply, a an incredible rush and a quite the thrill.<i>\"I think I could get into this whole 'world domination' thing\"</i> She continued to close her mighty fist around the two lovers.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOf course it didn't occur to her that like Auric Goldfinger or Ernst Stavros Blofeld before her, toying with the hero before killing them would inevitably lead to disaster. All she needed was a white Persian cat with a diamond studded collar to make her downfall complete.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan and John ran as the vast plain of soft springy flesh slowly turned into a valley and then into a tunnel. The walls slowly closed in all around them as they struggled on. The point of light in the distance grew smaller despite them running as hard and as fast as either of them could. They could see a field of golden hair just beyond - if they could make it, they could hide in her heir. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIf they made it.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBoulders of sand came crashing down around them as Brittany moved in for the kill.

Britney, vast and terrible Britney, had somehow escaped, and was running towards them, her huge feet throwing up sand.  Behind her, something so great that it defied comprehension, a kilometres tall girl, walked in pusuit, calmly keeping pace with the tiny singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Britney?  She'll just kill us!'

All we've got to do is contact her, and through her someone big enough to dig!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney was having problems.  Now she had reached the edge of the area that Megan had shrunk, and the end of the small expanse of sand that was still at her scale.  As she reached the normal sized sand, she stumbled over the, to her, rock sized grains and went sprawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, no, no.' she said, raising her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, she saw that, between her spread fingers, stood those two architects of her demise.  If she was to die, at least she's take them with her.  She prepared to crush them, but noticed that they weren't resisting, just standing there.  Another trick?  No, if they were in control of the Ring, they wouldn't risk themselves like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they'd lost control.  They were in a worse position than her.  Treating them to her biggest grin, she closed her hand around them once again, secreting them deep into one of the many hidden pockets of her ninja outfit.  She could deal with them later.  First, she had to get out of this -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world erupted around her.  In her reverie, she had neglected to pay attention to her pursuer.  Fingers were thrusting up from around her, as a whole handful of the world was scooped up by the girl.  Had John and Megan been present, they may have had a sense of deja vu.  As it was, Britney had a thrill of fear as she looked up into that face, wondering what lay in store for her.  All of her thralls were gone now, either carried off by others, or accidently crushed in the scrum.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood alone, her friends having departed.  Her tanned form was dressed in a pink bikini, doubtless sunbathing somewhere further along the beach before the noise of the drill brought her over to investigate.  Britney tried to look beyond the difference in scale, to guess how old this girl was, and what she wanted with her.  It was hard to tell, what with the fact that she had to crane her neck around to see either side of the face.</span></div></div>",

Britney tried to block it out, but it was no use when she was only half an inch tall and held in the woman's hand.  Eventually, though, the laughter ended and the talking began.  This was nearly as bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, what're you doing down there, Brit?'  her rival asked mockingly, jiggling her hand up and down as she spoke to send her rolling around.  'I thought that you knew how to use the Ring, but I guess that you're just inferior to me in that respect too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritney would have answered, with a much more scathing remark to boot, but she wasn't given an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where is it, anyway?  It's obvious that you have it, and since you are so incompetent, it's only right and proper that it should belong to us.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUs?  Britney was caught out for a second, but then realised who she meant.  While she herself had been raised alone by her benefactor, he had not been alone in his desire for the Ring.  He had had a sister, and they were great rivals, almost as great as Britney and Christina.  The sister had taken not one apprentice but four.  They too had worked their way into the music industry, seperately at first but recently coming together in collaboration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sister called herself Missy Elliot these days, and her agents were the four that had collectively been the Moulin Rouge;  Christina, Pink, Li'l Kim and Mya.  And if one of them had been following Britney, it meant that the others couldn't be far behind.  In her present condition, she was hardly in a position to stop them...</span></div></div>",

Having just been rudely awoken from the unconsciousness that Britney's snatching had put them into, they awoke into a world of gods.  Britney was a giantess, yes, but even she was as nothing to these others, others who could balance the two of them on the tip of an eyelash with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them the Ring.\" Britney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan peered up at the smaller titaness in bewilderment.  \"Won't... do  any... good, I'm afraid.\" she gasped.  \"Out of power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there is the Ring of Growth...\" John ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Pink was digging away at the sand, searching for the Ring without pausing for anything - except occassionally to bitch about being the only one digging.  Christina stood by and watched, Britney sitting in the palm of her left hand.  John and Megan, in turn, were in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all over, John.\" Megan wept.  \"When they find it, we're doomed, and so is the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" John offered as comfort.  \"There's always hope, and if I know my villains, they're going to have an argument very soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking quietly, they had little to fear of Britney overhearing them, much less the goddesses that held their giantess captive.  Bitney herself had other plans whiring through her mind.  She could get to the Ring as it was uncovered, before anyone else, if she moved fast enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cry of joy from the hole - some six foot deep now - as Pink unearthed a chest of some sort.  Christina moved closer to get a look at it.  Pink crushed the lock binding it with her bare hands, magically boosted strength helping.  The lid opened, to reveal the Ring of Growth, with its emerald gem and silver filigree design.  Christina smiled in triumph.</span></div></div>",

Her blurry eyes trying to focus on whatever happened to be focused in front of her. As reality regained it's former sharp edge, she realized it was a sea of brown - some kind of leather. It was hard and worn, probably quite some years old.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe realized that she was laying down. Trying to move, her arms betrayed her. Her legs were no better, also on strike. A thousand pins and needles jabbed her all over her body. She closed he eyes again, gathering strength. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWith a willpower previously unknown to man, she managed to lever herself over, and opened her eyes. Filling her field of vision was the red-haired visage of Theresa. Then it hit Megan - Theresa was her size. More importantly, she was Theresa's size.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan was back to normal!\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sat up, the squeak of leather beneath her. She realized that she lay on the couch in the front room of Ray's Occult. The sun shone brightly through the front window, illuminating the area with a warm yellow glow. Sitting across from her were both Anita and Theresa, looking on in interest. In a flash, the macro-cheerleader threw her arms wide and wrapped them around the red-head.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You've been asleep for an hour. We were starting to get worried.\" Anita said, handing her a cup of tea.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Where's John.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Right here.\" Theresa said, pointing to the side of her head. \"He's been pacing up and down my ear canal for this whole time.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What? Why didn't it work on him?\" she demanded, moving into a sitting position. \"It should have worked too.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnita rapped her knuckles on a musty textbook before her. \"I'm trying to figure that out. By all accounts, it should have worked \" she pointed to Megan's left hand. \"Why don't you try it out - make sure it we've got it right.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\" she asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The ring.\" Megan lifted her hand, the ring on her middle finger. \"You should have full and complete control of the Powers of Alkazar.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Right.\" She stood up, looking at the ring. \"What do I do?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"How should I know?\" she said with a shrug. \"You're the master of the ring - you figure it out.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nClosing her eyes, Megan began to think small. How she arrived at what constituted small is left for a philosophy forum, but think she did. A tremor ran through her body, as suddenly the strange tingling sensation overtook her again. . . .\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around -everything was bigger than she was, but not quite as much as she expected. Anita kneeled and moved closer, holding up a ruler behind Megan. She topped out at just above three inches..\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm not as small as I used to be,\" the miniature woman said. \"What happened?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You're the one in control of the ring - you  tell me. You've got full mastery of it's power, remember. Well, more like control - the mastery part you don't seem to have yet.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Full control?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Any one, any thing, any size, for as long as you want - it's all you.\" She shrugged. \"Once you learn how to work the thing, that is.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe took a couple of steps towards the giant redhead. \"I probably should go see John.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTheresa lowered her hand, palm up. Calmly, the reduced cheerleader took a step up into her palm and walked forward. Settling cross-legged into the soft surface beneath  her, Megan tried again with the ring. This time, the magic came easily to her, dropping height and melting away like an ice cube. Theresa brought her hand close to her face to watch the process.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen Megan had returned to her former height of just under half an inch, Theresa curled her fingers and brought her hand next to her ear. Megan jumped into the soft folds of skin, landing safely. Turning to watch the hand disappear from sight, she stood up. Moments later, she walked into the cavernous opening. . . .\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

She was hoping to find a coffee shop or diner to kill a couple of hours in - but she was having no luck. This was not the best part of town. She looked up at the sky - the sun was quickly setting, and dark and heavy clouds were drawing closer. Rain was coming on. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA shiver ran up and down her spine as she walked. She drew her long jacket around her, closing up the front. She subconsciously chalked the shiver up to one of her guests in her ear moving about, or a touch of the night cold. She didn't know that evil eyes were upon her. . . \r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do you think she'll be able to reverse the process?\" Meg said, watching the street go by. The pair had moved to Theresa's outer ear, to afford her some privacy and get some quality time alone. The coming night chill brought the two closer together, as the huddled in a fold on Theresa's ear.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"She sounded like she knew what she was doing - so if anyone can, it'll be her.\" A long silence passed between the two, as they simply held each other.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan, what happens when we get back to normal?\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What do you mean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I mean between us. Over the last couple of days, I've grown closer to you than anybody I've known before - and I don't mean because I was inside you once.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do we go back to normal, you mean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe looked her in the eyes. \"Well, yeah. We've always operated in different circles - you've got a rich family, I've got . . . well, me. We're about as far apart as two people can get.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And this makes a difference how?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn was coming up with a suitable answer when suddenly shouting drowned out the world. There was a violent shaking, and more screaming - then the loudest noise yet, and the world came crashing down around them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yo! She-bitch!\" came the shout behind Theresa. She spun around to see the bald man missing several teeth standing in the middle of the sidewalk. He had tattoos running up and down his arm, and a nasty attitude. She spun back around to see the skinny guy in the leather jacket step out of the shadows.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey momma. Whatcha got, hmm?\" he pulled out a knife, flicking it open. \"How about some money.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe was too scared to talk, meekly offering the purse to the man. He snatched it from her grip and ripped it open. \"Ten FUCKING dollars? That's it, you lousy cunt!\" he shouted, throwing the wad of money to the ground. \"You insult us with that! I said WHERE IS TH' FUCKIN' MONEY!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Tha-tha-that's all I have.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA pain ripped through her gut. She cocked her head to the not-so-distant sound of thunder. <i>The storm must almost be upon us<i>, she thought - but it was simply the tattooed man behind her with the revolver. She collapsed to her knees, and fell to her side.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Aw, shit - what'd you go and do that for!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wasnt I supposta?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Moron! Money first - then gun! Get it right next time, you useless fuck.\" He picked up the fallen purse. \"Well, lets see what she's got.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * * * *</div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ohmygodohmygodohmygod!\" Megan screamed, as the pair hit the ground. The impact knocked them out of the ear and both apart. Moments after landing, John ran over to Meg. \"Oh god - we have to do something!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn watched in anger, fists clenched as he watched the giant man in the leather jacket rummage through Theresa's purse. \"I'm open to suggestions!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan moved around Theresa's head, catching a glimpse of her prone body. She quickly ran back to her companion. \"It looks bad - she needs medical help.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't think that's going to be forthcoming. Just look at the neighborhood.\" He gestured all around him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So what do we do?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't know about you - but I'm going after them.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What?!? Are you crazy? What the hell do you intend to do to them - tie the shoelaces together?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn took a couple of steps closer to the murderers. \"I don't know what I can do - but I can make sure they dont get away.\" He turned to Megan. \"Are you coming?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I . . . I cant\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I didn't expect so.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No - it's not that. I don't want to leave Theresa. If she dies, she doesn't need to die alone.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I understand.\" John brought the micro-cheerleader in close, embracing her. \"Look, if we do this - we may never see each other again.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Nonsense - we've got destiny on our side, remember?\" She kissed him. \"Now get going.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithout another word, John turned to hurry off to catch up to the criminals before him. Megan turned and slowly climbed back into Theresa's body for one last time .  . . \r<br>\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

But that didn't make sense, she said that she'd wanted to be here when - if- anything happened to -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an impact behind you, and you spin to see a mammoth boot.  Then something engulfs you, and all goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken upon your impact with the table.  You push yourself up and see the handkerchief that you had been imprisoned in.  High above you can see the face of your captor, and a chill runs through you.  It's the leather jacketed man that attacked Theresa!  He must have doubled back or something after running off.  Does that mean that he knows where Megan is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only need to look to one side to see the answer.  Your equally diminished cheerleader companion is also getting to her feet.  The embrace that you share upon seeing each other is worth more than any reconciliation speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going for a drink with the boys.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, slurred and yet commanding all at once, is that of Leather Jacket.  You crane your neck upwards, but see that he is not addressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Make sure that nothin' happens to them, okay?  There's money there.  If anything's gone wrong, I'll fuckin' kill you, got it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns and walks off, leaving the (relatively) small room that you are in.  You are still wondering who he was talking to when you are alerted by sound to your right.  You turn, seeing the fingers, nails bright red, grinding out the last embers of a cigarette in a glass ashtray taller than you.  For a moment you have a horrible thought of what it would be like to be that cigarette, pinched cruelly between finger and thumb and twisted this way and that until your spark went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes follow the wrist into the depths of a pink dressing gown, its cuffs and neck decorated with a fluffy trimming.  What little you can see of the layer beneath, you guess that the woman is wearing a black nightdress.  Her face, not as high as the man's since she is sitting down on a couch next to the table, is the focus though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe being an arm's length from you (her arm's length), you don't have to strain quite so hard to see it.  Framed by greasy lengths of blonde hair, the roots being brown, it is made up to a similar degree as the nails.  All the mascarra and lip gloss can't hide the black eye, bruise and split lip that she bears, though.  Presumably her relationship with Leather Jacket isn't the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her left hand is reaching out, and for a moment you fear that she means to kill you in just the manner that you feared.  Then you see the fingers coil around the thirty foot tall glass that lies opposite the ashtray, with you between the two.  As she lifts it up, causing you to marvel at her strength to so easily heft such a monolith, you notice the brown coloured spirit swirling around inside it.  Is she drinking to kill the pain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan tugs at your arm.  'We have to go.' she says, the fear apparant in both her face and voice.  Up until recently, this whole experience had been fun for her.  Now the grim realities of your situation are coming down hard, and she is panicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, Theresa is still out there, probably undiscovered and dying.  But even if you find your way down from this table and out of the house, you're still going to be hard pressed to find the alley again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always try and get this woman to help you.  Surely she bears no love for that man anymore, and would only be to glad to do some good.  On the other hand, she may fear him enough to obey him, and keep you here until he gets backand his plan for you can be put into operation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pulls at you again.

The woman finished her drink, and has now trapped you both beneath the glass.  Looking up, you can make out an impression of her fingers through the concave bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you are hit hard.  You have to get and up keep running to avoid being pushed mercilessly along as she drags the glass along the table towards herself.  She finally lifts it when you are right by the edge, and you see her large green eyes looking directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, ain't you just the prettiest little thing?' she says, nudging Megan with the tip of her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, one day someone will come along and take that beauty from you...'

This was someone's tongue! Those were no rocks - those were the back of Theresa's molars! The events came flooding back to her, and she remembered where she was. They had gotten Theresa to puke them back up, and she must have gotten lodged somewhere.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe rolled over very carefully, trying to move as little as possible. Her hands sunk into Theresa's gum line as she tried to wedge herself clear. It was no good - thousands of pounds of tongue kept her in place. She had to wiggle out the top, instead of pulling herself forward.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd then she was deafened by the loudest noise she had ever heard. Louder than the time her Daddy arranged the Rolling Stones to play at her birthday party. Louder than the family jet - and all Theresa did was talk.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBy the time she had gotten used to the incredible cacophony that accompanied a simple sentence, she had missed most of the conversation. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"To hell with you - and to hell with my sister in law, wherever the fuck she winds up at.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThat didn't sound good. It seems that Theresa was pissed that they had used her body as a playground. Even better - Theresa didn't know where she was. <i>Perhaps I can use this to my advantage.<i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen the entire mouth got turned upside down, as the mammoth woman attempted to dislodge her boyfriend. Fortunately the tongue held her in place. And then - stalemate. She laid there, attempting to figure out how to get out of Theresa's mouth, when a wicked idea occurred to her.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThere was no way to pull this off without the giant knowing where she was at - but there was no way to stop her from going there, if she was fast enough. If Theresa managed to swallow first, or hold her breath just right - or any other of a dozen pitfalls her body incidentally might throw at her, she was dead. If she got what little she remembered of her anatomy wrong, she was dead - but if it worked, it would break the stalemate.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan slowly, carefully wiggled out from under Theresa's tongue.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ah ha!\" the giant said, as Megan got clear and started sprinting for the back of the giant throat. Theresa rolled her tongue and coughed as the tiny tickle made it's way to the back of her throat. She hacks and exhales - sending a gale force storm up her windpipe - but the little woman was just too fast for her.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe leapt to the back of her throat, finding purchase on the slimy red wall of flesh. Megan stole a quick glance back at the opening of the mouth as it parted. A titanic finger the size of an office building entered the mouth and proceeded directly for her. Instead of letting go and falling into her gullet and safety, Meg started climbing. Within seconds, she was out of range of the finger and into the safety of the sinuses. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Come back here, bitch.\" Theresa commanded - but it was no use. Megan was already climbing.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe passage narrowed - the winds increased as Theresa tried to exhale her out. A random though passed through her brain - <i> We've never actually figured out how small we are, but it's gotta be smaller than the original 1/2 of an inch estimate - I'd never be able to fit up here otherwise.</i>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe reached the passage she had been looking for - a small opening high in the nasal passage. She shook her head, unable to remember what it was called, but she DID remember that this pressure equalization mechanism proceeded directly to the inner ear - where it sounded like where John was.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA 50-50 chance. She only hoped that she go the correct passage . . .\r<br>\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

She kicked her legs and twisted for all she was worth, working her way into the small tube. It looked like a undersized sewer, but fleshy and moist. Once past the opening, she barely had enough room to move - but it was enough.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe wriggled along the tunnel through Theresa's head for a little under half an hour. Constant roars of pain reverberated throughout the skull, mixed with constant shaking and shuddering comprised the journey. But finally, she popped out at the end.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBefore her was a conch shape, several small tendons and the tiniest bones in the human body - although they looked quite large to the shrunken cheerleader.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What . . .what are you doing, bitch!\" Theresa managed to gasp out between moans of pain. She couldn't feel her moving any more and was growing concerned.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, shut up you loudmouth.\" She finally shouted.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Meg?\" John's voice penetrated the darkness.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"John? Where are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm over here, by the eardrum.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe tiny cheerleader moved closer to the enormous membrane. On the other side, she could barely make out a human shape. \"Thank god you're all right,\" she said, trying to embrace the figure - only to be thwarted by the drum. Touching the outline on the eardrum would have to be enough to satisfy her for now.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I was so worried about you too. When you didn't come out with me, I thought -\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh please god - I'm going to be sick\" came Theresa's booming, sarcastic voice.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Shut up!\" they both shouted in unison.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, it looks like the balance of power has changed.\" John said.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Fuck you - nothing has changed. I just know where both of you are now.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Megan, do you still have that lighter?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hm? Oh - yeah.\" she bluffed. She had no such device, but Theresa didn't need to know that. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Ah, excellent.\" John turned and addressed the room around him. \"Theresa, please allow me to give you an anatomy lesson. The inner ear is comprised of several key components - but the most important of them is the conch shell looking thing that my 'bitch whore slut of a girlfriend' is standing next too.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah - whatever.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Now, you may or may not know that this conch looking thingy is filled with liquid - to help facilitate the sounds that you are currently hearing - and to maintain your balance. Without it - you wouldn't be able to stand up, much less walk a straight line.\" He turned to his girlfriend. \"Megan, the lighter if you please?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe made a loud 'click-click' sound, right on cue. It may have not sounded realistic - but when you're on the other side of someone's eardrum, EVERYTHING sounds strange.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm sure that a smart girl like yourself has taken basic science and chemistry, haven't you Theresa?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah . . .\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, what happens when you apply heat - such as a lighter, to a liquid - such as the inner ear?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe giantess hesitated, seeing where this was going.  \"The liquid starts to boil?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Exactly!\" he said, patting the wall of Theresa's ear canal. \"Now, I don't know exactly WHAT will happen to you when my 'psycho cunt girlfriend' starts to heat up your inner ear - but it can't be good.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe world shook once again, but considerably less so than before, as Theresa sat down. Megan stumbled into the very inner ear she was holding hostage. She quickly stood up, extracting herself from the delicate mechanism and hoped nobody noticed. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Alright - fine. You win. What do you want me to do?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"First - get us some food. It's been hours since we ate last - and that was just the scraps we managed to scavenge out of your stomach.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Then?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's time to start looking into curing our condition.

Drawing closer, he grabbed on to a fold in the meat, his fingers digging into Theresa. The substance seemed flimsy - yet proved deceptively strong. He motioned for Megan to join him. As she moved closer, he wrapped his arm around her waist.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We better hang on. This is going to be fun.\" She didn't know if he meant that last part literally or sarcastically. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe didn't have time to ponder his words as Theresa went crazy. The wall the two shrunken people clung to suddenly began undulating madly. The liquid in her stomach began heaving and churning as Theresa tried to dislodge whatever was causing this . . . problem. The water level dropped, and then dropped again, leaving the two microscopic people hanging on her stomach wall. Briefly the motion subsided, while Theresa summoned her strength for the final round of porcelain god worship.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe earthquake - um, stomach -quake returned with a vengeance, but quickly faded. The two were dislodged from their perch as Theresa collapsed to the floor, spent. Moments later, the chamber was again in motion, apparently Theresa righting herself. Then a deluge of pure, clean water crashed down upon the two tiny people. After several long moments, the water stopped - with the chamber significantly fuller than before.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan bobbed to the surface. \"Quiet the ride. You don't get that at Disneyland.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nJohn surfaced next to her. \"Yeah, nothing quite compares to being on the inside of a half mile tall female while she pukes her guts out.\" \r<br>\n \r<br>\nMegan rolled over and started swimming, doing slow, lazy laps. \"So, now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You tell me - you're the one who wanted to stay inside Theresa.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe turned and dogpaddled over to her boyfriend. \"Well, we could stay put.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh? Why?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nInstead of replying, Megan turned again and swam away. \"Just think,\" she said, \"nobody knows that we're here - Theresa included.\" She put her ear against the lining of Theresa's stomach. Above the dull throb of the giant heart, she could clearly hear the outside world. She heard the radio in the distance, muffled but distinct. She clearly heard Theresa mumbling to herself about seeing a shrink. Very faintly in the distance she could hear a police siren. She could feel the rocking as the giant unknowingly carried her tiny gastronomic passengers back to bed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I dont follow you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Have you ever had a voyeuristic tendency? A desire to spy on people?\" She reached out and patted Theresa. \"Where she goes, we go. What she does, we're privy too. What she says, we hear. Kinda cool, huh?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We cant stay here for too long.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Why not?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHe juestured around the vast chamber. \"This isn't a camping trip. How will we survive.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We have a constant supply of food and water. We've got pleasant company, we've got entertainment. What more do you want?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't know - It sounds fun, but I don't really see me spending the weekend as an intestinal parasite.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Actually this has been more wishful thinking than planning, since it would all have been in vain had Megan slept with her mouth closed. But this wait, you would simply walk out of here.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Getting out of Megan's mouth is really piece of cake, although you actually slipped while climbing the last slope towards the opening of her lips.

Connected to it is her neck and then her body which disappears and her sheets. Seeing them, you realize that you are beginning to feel cold. Quickly, you lie down on the pillow and try to dry yourself up.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After getting as dry as possible, you consider your options.

Finally, that conversation ends up with your sex lives. Apparently, she is a virgin!

I want to eat you.\" You dont know what to say, and can only spout out one word. \"HUH???\" She looks you in the eyes, and replies \"I want to swallow you. I want you have you inside of my stomach.\" You really dont know what to say. You stammer \"Your... your going to... your going to eat... me?\" She replies in a calm tone, \"No. Not if you dont want to go. I wont force you to do something like that.

She may be massive, but her innocent eyes easily make you agree. \"Yea sure, if you want. Ive been inside of your mouth all day, another few minutes couldnt hurt.\" She grins, and picks you up. She holds her hand up to her face, opens her mouth, and extends her tongue, touching it to the tip of her hand. You step onto her tongue, nervously looking down. You walk across, and pass her massive lips, into the dark, wet, hot cavern of Megan's mouth. Her tongue recedes, and her lips close over you, and you are now in a massive cave of darkness. She has the inside of her mouth open wide, giving you space to move around. You cant see much of anything, it being pure darkness in her mouth. After a few seconds, you decide to let her have what she wants, and lay down across her massive tongue. The huge piece of flesh quivers, Megan reeling in excitement. You feel her tongue as it presses you very lightly against the top of her mouth. A wave of saliva washes over you and disappears down her cavernous throat. She begins to move you around slightly inside her mouth, periodically breathing fresh air in to you. Her tongue is very soft and comfortable, very much like a massive, fleshy waterbed. Finally, the tip of her tongue rises, and you realize she is about to swallow you. The tip touches the top of her mouth, then the middle, as the wave of tongue pushes you toward the back of her mouth. Finally, you arc downwards. A wave of muscles clenches you from all sides, and deposits you into her esophagus. Wave like muscles surround you, and guide you down her slimy, yet somehow comforting, throat. After about 7 seconds, the trip ends, and you are deposited into the depths of Megan's stomach. You land in the churning vat of fluids, and dont even feel a sting. The fluids rise above your head, and you sink to the bottom, touching the floor of her stomach. You rise to the surface, and peddle slightly to keep afloat. Its very swamplike, wet, thick, hot, humid, and sloppy debris washes and floats gently around you, with a \"bloop.....bloop......bloop\" sound. Every once in a while, a fresh wave of saliva pours in from above. Other than that, nothing moves, except for the gentle, wave like motions of her fluids. You start to think to yourself, \"this isnt really that bad...\" when you realize its time to go. She gulped you down, promising to bring you back up shortly.</span></div></div>",

(I'm naming the little brother Timmy.)  It took some work, in less then ideal circumstances, but you to work your way to Timmy's anus and wedge it open.<br>\r\n\tPeering out from your stinky prison; two things come to you.  First:  Timmy is still in the hall, on his hands and knees, with his ass in the air and his pants around his ankles.  Second:  Timmy's sister, Megan, is approaching Timmy from behind, and she looks pissed.<br>\r\n\t\"You illiterate little fucker!\" calls out the fully dressed Morgan.  \"Didn't you read <i>Chapter 3</i>?  I'm supposed to be an only child!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the half naked queer boy replied, \"well you're not anymore bitch! Go some place else.  I'm doing something.\"  With that Timmy shook his ass at Megan and farted a slow, abnormally stinky fart; which did not free you.<br>\r\n\tAfter waving the stink away, Megan lowered her hand to her crotch and started groping herself.  \"Little <b>FUCKER!</b>  I'm going to do something I should have done a long time ago.\"  With that she ripped aside her clothing and revealed the biggest, most impressive cock you have ever seen.  \"This will teach you to <b>fuck up</b> the story with your gay crap!\" (Especially after the creator requested nothing gay) <br>\r\n\tTimmy screamed in horror.  He tried to run, but tripped over his pants.  Trapped in Timmy's rectum, your fate is decided.  Even if you weren't trapped in a little boy's ass, fear of (and perhaps even respect for) Megan's thick, colon ripping cock keeps you paralyzed.  Her urethra is bigger then the opening you're peering from.<br>\r\n\tYou watch as Megan happily plops down on her ass.  Her long flexible legs are parted to make extra room for her cock.  With one hand she reels in her brother, and with the other she lubricates her weapon.  Timmy whaled, \"You can't do this!  You can't!\"  Megan mearly lined up her cock with his anus and giggled.  \"What's the matter Timmy? I thought you liked cocks.\"<br>\r\n\tWith that, Megan slid her cock passed Timmy's anus and deep into his colon.  She then leaned back and pulled her little brother onto her lap.  He screamed and tried to lift off of her long vertical shaft, but to no avail.  Megan laughed playfully at her brother's attempts; pulling him down and bouncing him on her lap.  It continued like this for about a minute.  Megan wasn't normally a 'quick' lover, but she didn't put off ecstasy either.  She grabbed her little brother roughly; making sure her cock was completely inside.  Although she stopped humping her brother her cock continues to massage his insides.  The pulse of Megan's blood caused her cock to grow and shrink, lift and lower like a piston.<br>\r\n\t\"Oh God!\" Megan cried in ecstasy and squeezed her brother so tightly her nails broke skin.  Her gooey she sperm erupted into his rear.  It filled his colon with such force that the contents of Timmy's digestive tract were blasted out his mouth.  Timmy slowly choked and gagged on the river of white flowing out his mouth and nose; while his sister gently moaned, humped, and pushed the last of her sperm up his butt.<br>\r\n\tOf course, you didn't see any of this; having passed out two paragraphs ago; when Megan's freight train of a penis rammed into you.  Instead, you wake up covered in slick white sperm.  Looking around, you see Timmy's face.  His eyes have rolled up into his head and sperm is slowly seeping from is mouth, nose, and tear ducts.  Sperm is everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You try to amuse yourself with the lines of her palm, tracing them with your finger - but the novelty soon wears off. Soon the rocking, gentle motions and warmth lull you to sleep.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe first thing you are aware of is a sliding motion as you are deposited onto her mighty desk. It's a neat room of a young girl - efficient and orderly - and about ten thousand times larger than it should be. You stand amid a pencil holder and some elastic hair bands. To one side is the huge beige wall of a computer tower. The keyboard dwarfs you by a factor of at least double. A lone desk lamp provides illumination.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMegan walks out of her room, heading into the bathroom. She re-emerges a few moments later with a fist full of clothes in hand, and a completely different wardrobe on. Sweats instead of her skirt and so on. She tosses the old clothes on the bed and sits in the chair directly across from you. She leans in close, all the better to hear you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What's your name?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"John. Pleased to meet you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This is going to sound weird - but what were you doing in my mouth?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou run your fingers through your hair, hesitantly. \"Well, you see . . . \"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes?\" you pause. \"I think I deserve an answer - it was my mouth you were hiding in after all.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, there was this ring.\" You hold your fingers apart an inch or two. \"About this big with a black stone in the center and a silver band with engraving. Anyway, when I touched it - BAM! I was this tall. I tried to find the ring, but was scooped up into your drink by the bartender.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou take a couple of steps forward, arms spread open. \"Anyway, I managed to avoid being swallowed by you - \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Pity, that.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"- and here we are.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And here we are.\" She leans in closer, her majestic eyes just a few feet away from you (her scale). \"So now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, I was thinking that you could help me get back to normal.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I mean about us.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, frankly - this is an amazing opportunity that I don't intend to throw away.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What\u2026 what do you mean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'm thinking that - I've always had this fascination for - well, how would you want to go where no man has gone? Under controlled conditions, of course.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Um. . .\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Come on - it'll be exciting. And just think, you'll get to see a side of me that nobody else ever has.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI don't know. What do you mean controlled conditions.\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe pulled a bottle out from under the table, setting it next to you a few feet away. \"This is what they give people to make them throw up when they've accidentally swallowed something they shouldn\u2019t have. You take a quick trip down my throat, hang out inside me for a few minutes - and back up you come. Simple as that.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I don't know. This sounds really dangerous.\"\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Without missing a beat, Megan leans closer to the desk, an mischievous glint in her massive blue eyes. \"Don't worry. It'll be cool - for both of us. Trust me.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou sigh as you look at the giant face looming above you. Clearly she wants you to do it - and you're not in much of a position to do anything about if she forced the issue. Better to do it on your own terms.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk forward.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs you draw near, the massive girl lowers her mouth to the level of the desk and opens. She rolls her tongue out like a perverse red carpet. You near the tip of her tongue - and marvel at it's size. The top of her tongue is at least an arms length above your head. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA light shudder runs through Megan as you touch her - well, light to her. From where you stand it was a 6.2 earthquake. A powerful, good looking, female earthquake. It's kind of like staring down the throat of Godzilla - but without the Japanese military firing rockets all over the place and King Ghidorah swooping in for the kill.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nActually come to think of it, you'd rather have to deal with Ghidorah.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou reach out, grabbing as much of the tongue in each fist as you can, and begin pulling yourself up into her maw. You can see the corners of her mouth turn up in a smile at the anticipation. Banishing all second thoughts, you stride purposely forward into her mouth. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt's an impressive living cavern. White stalactites and stalagmites line the outer edge, while a sheen of liquid covers the red interior walls. A glint of light catches on a puddle forming on the ground. A hot, humid breeze emanates up from the depths -  hot but a mere fraction of what you would expect. It's still enough to blow your hair all over the place. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin a few steps, you are shrouded in darkness - the shadow of her orifice. You can see the inside of her cheeks glistening with her saliva, while puddles of it gather around your feet. You glance down - the flesh doesn't even dimple under your weight.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Damn that's small.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk to the back of Megan's mouth, looking up at the uvula. The knob of flesh dangling from the ceiling was easily three times your size. You reach out and try to touch it - but it's just beyond the reach of your fingertips. Looking over the edge, you see a yawning abyss before you dropping into the distance.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou fall to you knees as she withdraws her tongue - and you - back into her mouth. You turn just in time to see the opening slowly closing. Within seconds, you are plunged into hot, humid darkness - the only sound the roar of her steady breathing. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nA brief moment passes before a powerful suction draws you towards the depths of her body. Suddenly a thousand strong muscles grip you in a vice of steel, as you slide down the tube towards her stomach.  And then - your world is nothing but motion. An intense pressure clamps down on you from all aides. You are engulfed by liquid. You tumble into her throat and down into her stomach. . . \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

Her breathing quickened in anticipation, and she tried not to move.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was a effort worthy of the gods themselves.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs she felt John walk willingly to the back of her mouth, she felt lightheaded. <i>What must be going though his mind right now?</i>. Enough was enough - time for the once in a life time experience. She could feel him moving as she stood up - <i>trying not to fall down my throat on his own? Cool.</i>. Slowly she closed her mouth, waited a beat and then rolled her tongue and swallowed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt was an imperceptible tickle traveling down the length of her neck - she would have never noticed if she had not been paying attention. As it was, the fleeting sensation was barely appreciable.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe lay on her bed, focusing all attention to her stomach. She was desperate to catch a flicker of motion from within her body. It was a ephemeral sensation, but it was there - someone struggling to remain alive inside a massive stomach. Her heart began pounding a mile a minute.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n<i>What must it be like in there - trapped inside a prison of flesh, knowing that within half a hour you'll be nothing more than nutrients floating around in some girl's bloodstream?</i> Knees of rubber, she stood up.

All around you is darkness, the constant sensation of motion - and a heartbeat going a hundred beats normal than it should. The air is thick and acidic. The floor is uneven and slippery.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTrying to stay out of her stomach acids, you move to a wall and begin pounding on Megan for all you are worth. If she is going to swallow you, you might as well give her the best show possible. You squirm, bite, wiggle, jump and hit like a champ. You do have to admit - going where nobody has ever gone before is kind of exciting.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt begins to dawn on you after a while - you have no idea how long she intended to keep you here. Seconds? Minutes? Surely not longer than that. You stop hitting and look around. The acid isn't reaching up where you are at yet, so you have some time. With a bit of climbing - who knows how long you could hold out. Hopefully it wont be that long.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen, the seconds drag on. And on. And on . . .\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou start hitting again, trying to get her attention. \"Hey! HEY! Let me out!\" You suddenly get a bad feeling about this.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA few moments pass. Then a booming voice seems to come from everywhere. \"You must have figured it out by now. I don't - I don't think I'll be letting you out. I just like the way you feel too much.\" A long pause. \"I'm sorry. But think of it this way - you get to join the explorers and adventures of history, as the first person to explore the inside of another human being.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah - I may be the first explorer inside someone else, but I'm not the LAST man to be suckered in by a pretty face.\" You hit her one more time, more out of frustration than for effect. Sensing defeat, you slump to the ground.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Great - now what?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou sit there, resigned. You cant tell what your gigantic captor is doing - she's holding reasonably still for someone who should be getting the power trip of her life right now. What the hell is she up to?\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I hope I MAKE YOU FAT!\" you shout.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nStupid bitch.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou watch as the acid level rises, slowly creeping forward. Then - the churning. The natural motion of the stomach finally propels you forward into the lake.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis is it - the moment of death, where you are reduced to your component chemicals and used for fuel to this girl. You close your eyes, waiting for the all-powerful, horrible pain to overtake your senses. It's a feeling that never comes.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHesitantly, you open one eye. Yeah - you are smack in the middle of her digestive juices. So why isn't she digesting you? You bring you hand out of the muck. All fingers accounted for, no blistering, no scaring - nothing. It appears that something in the shrinking process has rendered you acid proof.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, this is damn useful.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe fear that had gripped you like a vice is lifted from your shoulders. It looks like you get the last laugh after all. You playfully kick off, and start doing laps in Megan's stomach juices. As you float there, you ponder the future.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOption one would be to climb out now. Who knows how much air is in here, and how long it will last. The problem is that Megan will surely notice - and take some kind of action. You could just wind up back in her stomach, or worse. The other option would be wait until tonight, and try and sneak out while she's asleep. It's a little more risk in the short term, but a much safer bet in the long run. And who knows? Perhaps another opportunity will present itself in the meantime.\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

There were little bumps and rows of indented skin.  \"Perfect.  All I need to do is a bit of climbing.\"<br>\r\nHe walked forward and put his foot in a small hole close to the ground and finally started his journey of escaping her stomach.<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of climbing he had reached close to the top.  Since he was hanging onto the cieling he was moving closer to the throat muscle by grasping some big dents he had found.  <br>\r\nHolding on for his dear life he finally shoved his hand into the bottom of her throat.  John pulled the other arm in and decended slowly into the hot, wet flesh that leads to daylight.  \"Almost there.\"  He smiled at the thought of escaping.  Then wondered what Megan would do if she saw him.  \"Well, I doubt she would help me.  Maybe I could bribe her to have her take me back to the bar and help me find the ring.\"  John sighed and decided he would just try and run for it.  So he started up the fleshy throat and reached the tongue about ten minutes later.  \"That wasn't that long.  Now I need to get out without being noticed.  Little did he know that john had already been noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was sitting up waiting for John to come out.  She had felt him from the start and decided that she wanted to play with him a bit more.  &lt;i&gt;I'll play with him the whole night then either leave him in my ass, pussy, stomach or in a jar while I sleep.  Then take him with me to school.&lt;/i&gt;  She smiled and layed down.  Her lips cracked open slightly and she waited for John to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn fell onto her teeth from the sudden change in gravity.  He figured she layed down and was going to sleep.  \"Perfect.  Now I won't get caught,\" he whispered to himself.

He was lifted into the air and held above Megan's beutiful face.  \"What the??  Hey I thought you were asleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE FOOD.  WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST USE YOU FOR SOMETHING ELSE.\"  An evil grin spread across her face and her tone of voice was threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.  Just let me go!\"   You thought to youself as fast as you could about what you were going to do next.  You had two options.  You could either squirm free and make a run for it.  But staying behind and seeing what she has in store for you might not be so bad.  You might end up in her pussy.</span></div></div>",

You should be safe enough - any subtle movement now on your part will just be chalked up to an overactive imagination. If you play your cards right, Megan need never know you aren't dead.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSatisfied on this course of action, you find a fold in her stomach and lay down. You spend the rest of the day listening to the outside world going on around you. You listen to Megan talking - her booming voice is everywhere, and you can her the faint replies from outside.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nEventually, your relaxing visit to the interior of a giant girl is interrupted by a deluge of chewed food - unidentifiable by everyone save the most dedicated scientists. You climb higher, avoiding the mess - and not really interested in eating yourself. Well, not this at any rate.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nFinding a safe place, you watch first hand the digestive process. Within an hour, the food is swept away into Megan's intestines - and it's shortly after that, that your world goes crazy. You tumble to a stop as the shaking and rolling subside. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe was simply lying down.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou check your watch. Just a little past midnight. You quickly calculate some numbers - at least half an hour for her to fall completely asleep, another hour to climb out (it's probably much less - but better to err on the side of caution), a quarter of an hour to navigate through her mouth - and then freedom!\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou watch the tough ring of muscle forming the opening to the stomach, and Megan's reflexive swallows. If anything, this will be the point she notices you are alive the most - as you force your way out of her stomach. The swallows come once every 25 seconds or so. It's going to be a tough climb - but possible. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou maneuver next to the opening, biding your time. Suddenly the pucker opens, and you scramble to stick your arm into the gap. The sphincter closes around your arm - but it's enough. You lever yourself through and into the other side - a moan coming from your gigantic captor. Moments later, you tumble head over heels as she rolls over in her sleep. You grab flesh and cling for all your might.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou wait out the turbulence, you wait until the regular breathing returns. Several swallows threaten to dislodge you from your perch - but you cling with the best of them. Moments later - all is calm.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA swallow passes, and you spring to your feet. You sprint - the best you are able on a slick, uneven, constantly moving floor - counting down the numbers in your head. <i>18. . . 19 . . . 20!</i> - you throw yourself to the ground as the tunnel undulates beneath you. A wave of saliva nearly undoes everything you have accomplished - but you remain firm.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSprint, swallow. Sprint, swallow. You feel as if you are making no progress at all - until you reach the next obstacle. The trap door that directs wind one way and solids (like you) the other. Beyond this is another two hundred feet to freedom. You cling for one more cycle, and then force your way past.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nLittle do you know...\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

You lay down between her slimy folds of warm flesh as your adrenaline falls, right now you are too tired to think about it. Closing your eyes you picture the outside one last time. It seems like your fate is to live inside this blonde cheerleader for the rest of your life... or until she has a change of heart. A jolt sends you sliding further down her stomach, and you spy the entrance to her intestines. For a second you humor another escape attempt, but you dismiss that thought. She is obviously sensitive to what she feels inside of her, amd doing so would only exhaust youm and bring her more pleasure until you make it out and she sends you back on an express train to Megan central.

The gale force winds dislodge you from where you stood, and send you speeding down the flesh tube.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou don't panic - in fact you counted on this part to aid in your journey.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWithin moments, the wind dies down, dropping you to the floor. The esophagus is different now, smaller and tighter. You grab two handfuls of flesh and cling for all you are worth as she inhales again. And then the winds begin in the other direction, catapulting you out of Megan's body and onto the pillow not too far from her nose. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYour escape is complete, and she has no idea that you are still alive and outside her body. \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

It is a subtle sound and the wind that warn you as the cloth he is cleaning the table with is approaching you. As you start running, you realize that he is indeed seeing you, his eyes following your every move. Somehow, you can't bring yourself to believe that he is only trying to pick you up with that cloth.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are no match for his determined moves, of course, but by making a daring jump to the right in the very last second, you escape the cloth.

This time you spot some kind of plastic bag or something off to your right and make a jump for it.

It looks bigger, stronger, and hungrier than you. And you don't like the way its insect eyes are looking at you. You have nothing to fight it with, so where do you run?

Patricia has closed her mouth and the darkness should normally protect you from that terrible sight, but somehow, you are still able to see, although the colors seem somewhat fainter, darker.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, you can't hang on anymore, and with a last, desperate scream, you fall down into the warm darkness of Patricia's throat. Your speed increases as you get deeper and deeper, with nothing there to hang onto, nothing to break your fall. Everything is just a blurr of red, glistening walls passing by.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the path suddenly splits into two. Before you have a chance to react, you are swept into the left one. After a short ride, you land on some spongy, wet surface. There are tiny caverns everywhere, as well as some larger ones. The only exit is above.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You don't have time to take in this beauty, because everything suddenly contracts violently several times. Not knowing what to think of it, you cling to the ground. Another round of quakes and then everything turns quiet. The chamber you are in begins to steadily expand with fresh, humid air rushing into it. Then it begins to shrink, only to begin expanding again. After marvelling at this cycle you realize that you must be inside Patricia's lung! And somehow, your presence has slipped past her, after the initial greeting. This is incredible. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What will you do now, though? WIll you try to carefully explore the lung in hope of finding a safe way to exit, or do you take the risk and try to make Patricia cough you up?</span></div></div>",

Maybe you can wait till she is more sober and then confront her but as you near her she and jack get up and leave. You start yelling every name under the sun at jack. You however dont have to wait long  to see A couple of girls sit down at the bar. As soon as they sit down you notice something really different about them. You cant quite place your finger on it but something is just not right about them. The girl on the left  is a rather short girl. Still gigantic to you but short in comparison to everyone else. SHe probably is only 5'3\" your guessing about 110lbs. She has shoulder length light brown hair and her finger nails are painted red. She has really snobby, preppy kind of look to her. Her friend is is about the same height and weight only she has dirty blonde hair and has a little more of sporty look. You cant quite tell but one of them sets there purse on the table. There purse has a knit look to it. IT has tiny holes in it probably a  1/8 of inch in size. As they are showing the bartender there Id you catch a glimpse of a card pushed up against the side of the purse. At your normal size you wouudlnt be able to see it to easily but at your new size the holes are like tiny windows. ITs a nice feeling to know there is still things you can call tiny. But the card says Jason Senior High School grade 10. Leah Moore.  Thats it, there age, thats the weird thing. The bartender however notices there fake idea. Her friend pounds her fist down on the table. The force of the wind knocks you up into the air. However at athe same moment both girls are turning around and Leah is putting her wallet back in her purse. As you fall you think your going to hit the floor. But then as leah puts the wallet in her purse the downward movement of her hand created just enough suction too suck you into the purse as well.  You crash into some lipstick as the clock strikes 11:45. You stare up at the open purse being zipped shut. You try to make it to little view ports but they are just to small for you to fit through. \"Well we may as well go. I have to be home at midnight anyway.\" You scream and pound against the mesh like purse. \"NOOOOOO, You fucking teenage bitches let me out of here, you cant do this to me. IM a grown man!!!\" You know they cant hear you but it makes you feel better.</span></div></div>",

It would be pointless to resist; you would be crushed by her probing.  So it is that you let her youthful fingers grasp you and drag you out into the light.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe is none too gentle, but as you are you can't notice any extra pain over that you already have.  At least her fingertips are warm and soft, and smell rather nice.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou don't get to take much of a look around the room before you are dragged inexorably towards her face.  While you wouldn't have looked at someone her age twice only a day ago, from your current perspective you have to admit that she is rather attractive.  Her lips, while big enough to eat a house and inexpertly daubed in lipstick, are plump and full; her nose, despite its current dimensional similarity to a two ton truck, is nicely rounded and none too big; her blue eyes manage to sparkle even through the obscene amounts of glitter that she's sprinkled onto her eyelids; her skin is flawless, bereft of freckle or mole.  Youth does have its attractions.  Unfortunately, maturity isn't one of them.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Cool!' she squeals when she finally focuses her eyes on you.  'I found the tooth fairy!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou desperately argue against this hypothesis, but she can't hear you over her own talk, and she denies it herself anyway.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'Course, you can't be the tooth fairy, you're too small to be able to lift a pillow, let alone carry a quarter!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe giggles again, falling backwards onto her bed.  The rush for you is even more extreme than the handbag ride, and you're out of breath by the time that it is over, held against her nose.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHer eyes are closed and she is laughing gently to herself, but she soon recovers, holding you at arm's length above her head while she lies on her back, stretching her legs off the edge of the bed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'I'm sure that you know who you are.' you says slowly. 'But I'm not sure if I care!' she adds cheekily, winking at you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHmmm.</span></div></div>",

You take in the towering fingers and thumbs circling you, and the warmth emanating from both them and the 'floor'.  You notice that Leah is no longer wearing the dress she wore at the bar, now she is ready for bed, wearing a sleveless top and a pair of shorts, both yellow.  From where you're standing, the view isn't too bad.  Another couple of years...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'We're going back to the bar tonight, so I can take you with me to find the ring.'  she tells you.  'Course, you'll owe me for saving your life.  I bet you're evn cuter at actual size...'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe grins cheekily, and moves one of her hands away to open a drawer to her left.  Then she lowers you into it with the other, and you jump off to find youself in her underwear drawer, filled with large white structures that you decide must be Leah's bras and panties.  You look up to see her gentle face smiling down at you, her fingers drumming idly over the edge of the drawer wall.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n'You can sleep here for tonight.'  she whispers, before blowing you a kiss.  'Goodnight!'\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThen she vanishes from view, and you are thrown down into the underwear as the drawer closes, blocking out all light.  Looks like there's nothing to do now but sleep in a large room full of a giantess' delicates.  Things are looking up.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou are woken from a long and dreamless sleep by another earthquake, and the appearance of a growing line of light above you.  You emerge blinking into it, and realise how ravenous you are.  You haven't eaten since lunch yesterday.  Leah appears above you like a goddess descending from heaven.  This morning she is wearing a grey ruched top with 'Gorgeous' sequinned across the front in pink, and bears salvation, like any true goddess.  She deposits a huge saucer next to you, with a pool of water at its centre and a piece of bread crust the size of you balanced on the edge.  You won't be going hungry this morning, and thank Leah while she sits and watches you eat, gigling as you struggle to break bread and almost fall into the water.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

You are smaller than small about half an inch in size. People usually don't notice you, and if they do, they may think you are a bug.

You are quite sure that you can't figure out a cure all by yourself - hell, you don't even know what exactly did this to you (a nice little ring, sure). So you need to contact someone who can help you. Which brings in Jane. She is nice, she is your friend, and she is quite intelligent (you never really understood female intelligence, but your guts tell you that she is an intelligent woman). And she has the advantage of being not even inches away from you at the moment.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now for the problem of how. Currently, your only option would be climbing up her hair and get into her ear. If you shouted loud enough, you might get heard.

Experiencing her small belch from the inside made you realize how incredible it was that you were actually inside this girl; inside this chamber, easily the size of a two car garage from your perspective, yet entirely unnoticeable and tucked away deep inside her body, rarely given much thought by those on the outside. Yet it was your world at the moment. Her entire body was, and no one would know but you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazing as you find it, it's not a particularly comfortable chamber so getting out is still a priority. You trudge the rest of the way through what must have been her supper to the entrance of her esophagus and squeeze it open. At your size it's difficult, but you manage to get it open just enough to force your upper body inside. You drag yourself forward into the tube until you're fully inside. The walls are soft and not terribly tight at your size, so you find it easy to begin crawling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be easier than I thought\" you say, when suddenly a wave of muscle carrying a pool of saliva pushes you back the way you came and out into the stomach. \"Ack, maybe not,\" you mutter coughing up some saliva, \"I'll have to try to get out before she swallows again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make another attempt, but after a couple minutes of crawling she again sends a mass of saliva down her throat, and you along with it. As you begin the third attempt, you only manage to get your upper body inside the esophagus before you hear another dull roar from somewhere in front of you, this one different from the previous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ugh...\" Kara moaned in her sleep; something was upsetting her stomach. She unconsciously gulps again and rubs her hand below her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after the sound, which sounded almost like a moan to you, you were again pushed out of her esophagus.

The muscles along the stomach walls begin pushing the digested food toward Kara\u2019s small intestine. You can see a muscular ring similar to the one at her esophagus expanding and collapsing, drawing the mush into it. Because of how she is laying, everything is flowing down hill making it difficult to stay in one place and not be drawn closer. Finally the stomach contents is shallow enough you\u2019re able to stumble to the other side on all fours as the remainder of the food is pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone in the stomach, you lean back and hear the sounds of Kara\u2019s body. Her thudding heartbeat, steady breaths, and the gurgles of the intestines now working on the new contents, you soon doze off, this time successfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara sits up in her bed and stretches, then rubs her eyes. She turns toward her nightstand, on top of which sits an alarm clock - 10:34 AM. Weekends are nice, she enjoys sleeping in since her classes throughout the week start so early. She hops out of bed and walks toward the bathroom, noticing her roommate had already gotten up. After expelling the contents of her bowels and bladder, she removes her nightshirt - the only clothing she was wearing - and changes into some clothes for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are rudely awakened by the stomach changing positions. You fall down to the new \u201cfloor,\u201d but by the time you get your bearings straight everything is in motion again. Briefly you feel the blood rush from your head as if you were in an elevator as the stomach sends you tumbling back and forth. You can tell she must have woken up. You are able to feel her walking, your prison moves around in rhythm with each step, occasionally being disrupted by a shift as she bends or turns. For a moment things get very wild and you\u2019re tossed around violently, but eventually her movements revert back to sway of her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning sleepy head,\u201d Jane calls to Kara as she walks into the open kitchen/living area of the dorm. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple waffles left if you want to warm them up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara yawns and stretchs again, noticing syrup stained plate on table in front of Jane.</span></div></div>",

The chair you are standing on is very close to the desk, and its back seems to be actually resting against it. In addition, the length of Jane's skirt is forming a slope you can use to easily scale the chair's back. Encouraged by these positive developments, you start climbing. Only a short while later, you reach the upper end. You have been wrong about the desk though. Although it is nearby, the chair and desk don't touch at all. There are still several meters between them. On the other hand, the top of the chair is several meters above the desk's surface, so you just might be able to make it.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hate to trust your good luck, but you don't see any equipment you could use, and climbing down the chair and then up the desk may take too long. You just can't risk losing that much time. Saying your prayers, you run towards the edge and jump. At first, there is just air beneath your feet and it seems as if you wouldn't make it. But then the desk appears and grows bigger and bigger, approaching at neck- breaking speed. Even before your feet touch the ground, you start rolling over, weakly trying to lessen the force of the impact.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>THUD!</b> You collide with the desk. Quickly rolling over, you keep your legs from breaking, but the shock still stuns you, leaving you lying on the desk, staring at the ceiling. You made it! And from the feel of it, you didn't even get injured.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After spending several minutes getting to terms with the fact that you survived, you stand up and start examining your surroundings. Straight forward, beneath the window, you can see some books. Not helpful. Behind you and to your left, there is just the abyss. Not your first choice either. Thus, you start walking along the table. The next thing seems to be a note pad. Bingo! Now for something to write with. This seems more of a problem than you had thought. The table is very clean, and you can't possibly hope to use a normal- sized pen or pencil. Just as you are about to give up all hope, you find some bits and pieces inside the pencil sharpener that you could actually lift and write with.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wasting no more time, you start writing, which means lifting one of the boulders, pressing it onto the ground, shoving it along some invisible line, stepping back to examine the results, and then continue. After two or three hours of hard work, you have finally been able to write: \"Help! I'm shrunk! John\". You are completely exhausted and lie down on the note pad. Who will wake up first, though, Jane or you?</span></div></div>",

A giant eyeball!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, gigantic Jane has awoken first, and she knows you're here.  At first you think to yourself, oh no, she must think I'm some kind of pervert, riding home with her in her clothing.  You think of all the ways women have to protect themselves sexually from scheming guys, and you're just glad she might not think of you as having been that kind of guy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're some kind of pervert,\" says Jane, \"you know that?  What the fuck are you doing in my room?  Are you spying on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Jane, it's not like that,\" you say.  You've only met her a couple of times, but you have to win her over somehow.  \"I shrunk at the bar.  I panicked - it was scary.  Any misplaced hand, or glass, or sideways step could have killed me.  I didn't know - and don't know - how to get myself big again, so I saw you, and knew that I found someone I could trust.  We haven't gotten to know each other as well as I thought, but I always knew, that even as a fraction of a man, you would treat me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane blushed and looked away for a second.  \"Oh John,\" she said, \"you know I always wanted to take you home.  Just not like this,\" she said with a laugh.  Fantastic, you thought, now she's on my side.  \"I can't keep you around here out in the open,\" she said.  \"Sandra's my roommate, you know, and god only knows what she'd do if she found a little man like you.  I'm going to make sure you're all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" continued Jane, \"I promised my other friend Suzanne I would meet her for lunch.  I can't leave you like this,\" she said, as she picked you up and held you in front of her face.  Jane was beautiful, but the face of any giantess would bring terror to a man, at least until she covered your body in a full-on kiss.  \"I think we can make this work,\" says Jane, as she places you into the cleavage side of her right breast.  \"Think you can handle being in my bra?\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Your world is turned upsidedown once again as Jane leans over the toilet.  This is it, Jane is going to throw up and free you. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Finally!\" You scream.  Then your world is turned once again. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hello?  Matt?  Is that you?\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt's Jane!  She heard you from inside her stomach!  Why didn't you think of calling out before?  You have to decide quickly what to do...\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

At your size, it should be absolutely impossible for her to hear you unless you stood right inside her ear. It doesn't make sense. But then again, getting shrunk to such microscopic proportions shouldn't be possible either. Now you have a chance to get into contact with someone who may help you. But what if she doesn't want to help you? Sure, she is a decent person, but how would she take this odd situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your hesitation has made the decision for you. While you are still wondering how to proceed, the walls around you jump inward. You are completely buried in a mass of half- digested food, the pressure crushing you mercilessly. Although you are unharmed, claustrophobic fear devours you. Having lost all sense, you try to struggle, try to free yourself, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, the pressure lessens. For a moment, you realize that you are falling. Then you hit the water and crash through the surface. As you fully regain your senses, you look around. The water dampens the sounds around you, but you still hear Jane's coughing in the distance as she continues vomitting. Freshly thrown up bits of food dive deep around you like depth carges, clouds of lighter material hiding them and trailing away before most of them float back up to the surface. The spectacle is somewhat unreal and also impressive. It reminds you of faded memories of television pictures of lava sinking into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you ponder the now silent scenario, a shadow falls upon you. The realization that it is a piece of toilet paper Jane has used to clean herself with jarrs you back to reality. Swimming away from under the paper, you take a deep breath (not really a pleasant experience) so that you can shout out loudly. Just then, thunder rumbles and the sea you are in becomes a single vortex. Your desperate \"No!\" is drowned by the turmoil as the pipelines devour you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is no defying the current, and everything moves so fast that figuring out where you are going or at least which way is up is impossible. In a rather unlikely accident - or does fate hate you? - you hit your head at something hard. Your head spins even more, but at least the outer world feels more distant. You come to enjoy the beauty of bubbles rushing past you, of a trail of dirt following an uncharted comet. Without noticing, you drift off into the realm of dreams.</span></div></div>",

For a moment you experience the pain and feel yourself falling, but then there is nothing as the darkness of death welcomes you. Your fragmented body mixes into the freshly accumulating saliva in Janes mouth to be swallowed in a subconscious act just as was your execution. It is also the same reflexes that make her tongue clear away what little blood your body has spread over the teeth. Thus, there is no herold left of this incident as Jane dismisses the voice she had heard for a moment into the realm of pink elephants.</span></div></div>",

The walls around you are contracting and you feel like being shot skywards. After the initial boost, your rise becomes a constant movement as you slowly approach the upper bend. As soon as possible, you jump of the mud heap and into the broad pipe. You don't even look back while continuing your odyssee. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is not that much unlike the small intestine; the ground is flatter and its bigger, but it's still just a twisted tunnel. The food stuff is changing, though. While it had been like a mud slide after a day of heavy rain inside the small intestine, its consistency inside the large intestine is much denser. You recall that the large intestine is drawing the water out of the debris, leaving only relatively dry shit behind. And the smell is only too familiar.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, the tunnel takes a plunge downwards. Looking down, you see some shit. Climbing down the pipe is out of the question, but the stuff down there should be soft enough. Wondering how you could put up with this, you jump and prepare yourself for the impact.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>SLOSH!</b> You land softly in the shit and start sinking immediately. You struggle to keep afloat, but there is no way you can escape it. Helplessly, you have to wait as the shit is slowly shoved through the final part of the colon. Suddenly, it starts falling.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>SPLASH!</b> The shit lands in the toilet and breaks into several pieces. Judging from the smell, Jane has already been peeing. At least you are free of the shit again, but climbing out of this toilet will be hard work. This is when Jane starts wiping herself. You grap onto the first sheet of paper that falls in, but it immediately starts drawing water and sinks. As you reach the side of the pool, you see in horror Jane's hand moving to flush the toilet. Will you go down the drain?</span></div></div>",

It's really unbelievable, but looking at that giant tin can over there quickly convinces you. Just what are you going to do? Even if you get to the dorm, or the university, how would you get someone to notice you? And who could possibly help you? You don't really understand what this is yourself; Magic? Super- Science? A bad trip? At least you are still alive, and the deck seems to be shuffled in your favor as you are at least indigestible and able to see in the dark. So what if there was no way to help you? If you had to stay this small forever, what could you do in a world of giants that don't see you? Like Jane who got even so close to you that she ate you. Well, from a voyeuristic point of view, this certainly has potential, but still ... It's just too dangerous. You have to get help ASAP.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After dealing with this inner dialogue, you turn your attention back to your surroundings. Little has changed around you, there is still the filth, the water, the indignation. Wait! There is movement on the other side of the stream. It must be big and furry. Now it lifts its head. A rat! There are only few things you know about rats: (1) there are no single rats, they live in huge packs, (2) they get very big, (3) they eat just about anything, especially when it comes in such a handy size as a shrunken student. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to have noticed you.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly moving onwards so as not to get the attention of the five rats you can see now (and their invisible cousins), you notice some gigantic bar attached to the wall several meters above you. You really are lucky. This must be the ladder towards a manhole. This could be your ticket out of here. Still, you are feeling a bit nervous about the rats. If they caught you while you were scaling the wall ...\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, what will you do? Do you try to climb up to the street, or do you continue to explore the sewers looking for a spot without rats?</span></div></div>",

The crumpled thing you have landed on seems to be a piece of cloth, possibly a hanky. The pillar lying towards the back must be an old pencil.

Speaking of feeling, it is rather warm in here, and the air is also stale.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since there is nothing else for you to do, you are trying your best to evesdrop on her conversations.

Really a dangerous fellow. You feel angry at being so helpless. But Jane is evasive, and just as Fieldings seems to be pushing things too far, you can hear Matt. Matt's a decent guy, and he has been spending some time around Jane lately.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jack Fieldings doesn't sound happy as he grumbles some \"I'll be seeing you\".

Obviously, they are going to his place.

Besides, you don't know when they start moving again.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Actually, they start moving fairly soon after wards. Jane stands up. Then, gravity suddenly turns upside down, making your stomach jump. After returning to normal, gravity suddenly increases and you are pushed into the skirts wall. <b>THUD!</b>The skirt has obviously landed somewhere. Gravity is settling again, and you begin to relax.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can hear Jane and Matt outside going at it, and as you peek out of the pocket, everything is dark. But you are still able to see the general shape of things. The skirt must be lying on a chair or something, as there is a sharp edge down not too far away on the ground. So, will you start exploring Matt's room, or will you wait for the next morning? What will it be?</span></div></div>",

No way. Why has she stopped? Has she noticed you? No, she isn't looking at you but at something above you - the drink!

Unbelievable. But you remain at that place only long enough for her to make sure that your tiny figure is really lying on her finger.

You can't see Jane's room mate, but she may be already sleeping in her bed which lies beyond the expand of the desk. \r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to bed now.

Then Jane lies down and turns off the light wishing you a good night.\r<br>\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the lights go out, you discover that you are still able to see things in the dark.

For what? What, I ask you!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou think for a moment. \"For the most incredible adventure of your life? Damn straight.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk to the edge of the pillow, the drop before you stretching thirty or forty feet. Turning around and looking at the string far above you, you estimate that you've already fallen several hundred feet. \"What the hell was I thinking!\" you bemoan - not knowing that your density plus overall weight would make the fall not all that painful. By all rights you should have ended up a small red splat on the rug.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nCompared to the huge drop, jumping off the pillow should be a piece of cake. You take a couple of long steps and jump for the distance. You sail down, impacting off the floor, bouncing and skidding to a stop. It's a typical dorm rug, short cropped - just enough insulation between your feet and the cold floor to make it bearable - almost.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou glance at your watch - just half past eleven. Jane has been asleep for about fifteen minutes. You figure that she'll sleep for at least six hours. So - that's plenty of time to look around, and three hours to get back to the pillow and get noticed. And that's worst case; a much more forgiving timetable might give you up to eight hours of Jane in slumber-land. In a dark, safe bedroom - what could happen in that eight hours?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nMortals should not ask the universe questions they do not want to know the answers to. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou begin exploring, checking out your immediate surroundings. Closest to you is a pencil that had fallen off the desk and forgotten. It's the size of a football field - or at least feels like it. Beyond that is a couple of hair elastics, perfect for restraining gigantic pony tails. Several long strands of Jane's golden hair remain tangled with the band. You shrug and approach - What the hell, this might make good rope, and there's plenty of it to go around. Tied together, you might have several hundred feet of it - and her hair is much lighter than normal rope. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAfter a few moments coiling, you set out into the night.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou walk along the edge of the bed in silence. The occasional rustle of fabric from far above as the gigantic woman tosses and turns in her sleep - dreaming whatever drama the unfathomable subconscious summons forth. You ponder for a moment - is a 1/4th inch tall man included in those dreams?\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou pass such mundane items such as a discarded beer bottle (you didn't even know Jane DRANK, let alone tossed the empties under her bed), a gigantic Walkman with ear-pieces big enough that you could crawl into them, and a screwdriver. You make your way to the foot of her bed, when movement makes you freeze. Jane is getting up!\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou hold perfectly still as one lone foot descends from the heavens. It slams into the ground about a hundred feet ahead of you and then stops. All is still.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou cautiously approach the mammoth foot. No further movement disturbs the night. Jane must be lying on her stomach, because the foot is sole to the sky, resting on the tips of her toes. You walk around her foot, along the side the little toe occupies - although 'little' is such a subjective term. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou look up - the remainder of Jane's leg would be an easy climb. That would be a sure route to discovery in the morning, if you were to hide again in Jane's ear canal or something. However with all the tossing and turning - you could get squished long before you get there.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOn the other hand, a whole world awaits you under and around her bed. And you do have 5 hours to kill - why waste them in bed?\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

You're sitting on my test.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Arent you even the least bit curious about me?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yeah - but I'm in the middle of the test.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhatever. You stand up and walk to your left just a bit, out of the giantesses' way. Within a few moments later, she speaks to you again.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What's that word?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"What word.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"The word you are standing on.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's 'You'\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"It's me?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No - not 'ME' - 'YOU'\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Huh?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou roll your eyes.

You fell to the ground, sliding into the crease at the spine. She was standing up, and taking you with her. She walked outside the bedroom, through the small dorm living room and out onto the balcony. \"Jane-y doesn't like it when I light up inside.\" She said, sliding the door open.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Uh, light. . . up?\" This didn't sound good. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sat down on the uncomfortable dorm chair, pulling out a large glass pipe - well used. You look to make your break, but at no time does she ever set you down. With deft fingers, she packs the bowl loosely. \"So, you ready to fly?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Do I have a choice in the matter?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe magazine tipped, sending you sliding down the page. [i]Apparently not. . .[/i]\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

The flesh is pressed flat and vaguely white from holding you and the bong.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey - dont do this! I dont wanna be in here!\" you shout. It, of course falls on deaf ears.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe world tips. You look up, you see two giant lips part over the opening you just entered. You see her free hand coming closer to a smaller opening, much closer above your head. Suddenly a bright light comes from that area - the lighter.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNothing can prepare you for what happens next. An extremely hot air strikes you, while the water churns madly. The smoke becomes so thick that you can hardly see. The smell is overpowering - cannabis. You take great mouthfuls of smoke and water are you are and the agitated by the gigantic sucking power.

Not - however, before one last grand finale, an heroic effort to smoke the last of the dregs. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe heat comes back, the wind picks up, the smoke returns. This time - disaster! You find yourself splashed out of the water and into the air - and up the chimney! You shout for Gretchen's attention, but it is of no use. You sail into her mouth and down her windpipe without even a notice.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWell, not quite.

She didn't spare it a second thought, as she examined the bowl. Elvis, as they say, has left the building.

Dead silence. \"Johnny? Where are you?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA panic looked crossed her face! The little man / bong-load was missing. She ran inside, dumping the bong water into a sink.

There was no sign of the man.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe sat down hard in the plush chair to one side of the room, her dope addled brain struggling to sort out the mystery of the missing man.

And as the seconds turn into minutes, you thank all the gods you scoffed at in the past that somehow you are still breathing.  Though you're not breathing very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's what saved you.  You're now so small, you must be using only an incredibly tiny amount of air.  And despite having countless tons of female flesh hanging over your head like Mount Everest, The crack of her ass is probably big enough to accomodate a block of houses proportional to your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, you're not in this spacious \"cave\" right now.  You are bunched up in the fabric of her clothes, in what could only be a wedgie.  You struggle to get free, but have no more success than an ant would struggling to get out from beneath your fingertip.  And then the worse happens: she clenches her butt.  You're not outside, but you immediately see stars swimming before your eyes as the air is crushed out of you in an instant.  In your dazed state you're not sure but you think you can hear your ribs cracking like dried kindling.  Strange, but you don't feel excruciating pain in this moment of death like you thought you would.  You're too stunned by what's happening to feel much of anything but shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the pressure abates.  You would raise your hand to your head in relief, if you could.  But movement is a luxury you don't have at the moment.  As your thoughts clear, you realize all of what happened just now must have only taken a few seconds or so.  Funny how time protracts in times of imminent death.  But then something occurs, something that almost makes you wish she had killed you.  An unearthly loud 'Pffhhht' erupts from just above you, like nothing you've ever heard before.  Your tiny ears are ringing, but that's hardly the worst part.  The sound was novel, but the smell is not.  It's something you've smelled before, but never like this.  You are surrounded by her fart, swimming in her fart, immersed in her fart.  You try to control yourself, but after less than ten seconds you heave your guts.  And the smell isn't improving.  Scrunched between her ass cheeks, the smell is lingering like a horny lover.  You wretch again, but your stomach is empty and so you dry heave.  You choke and gag and convulse.  How can she not feel you, the way your body is wretching so violently?  You must be the most insignificant thing on earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you rise into the air like you're on a Saturn V rocket taking off.  Your caught in her wedgie.  But at least the smell quickly dissipates as fresh air rushes by.  And for several moments you see that your stuck on a vast purple plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a hand appears from nowhere.  Seeing the hand, you tremble.  You realize that you truly are ant-sized.  As it approaches you, you can see that the fingertips are the size of buses.  This giant women has a hand big enough to hold a thousand little men like you.  You're about to know what a bug feels when its being squashed.  Your machismo is crushed, and you scream like an infant as the giant fingers are about to close around your insignificant body.  But they miss you by some fifty feet, and then you free fall into space!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down is terrifying.  Sky-diving without a parachute.  You rush by acres of purple, and then gargantuan tan legs that seem a mile long.  In the last moment of your life you notice she is wearing shiny red platform sandals.  Then you hit the tan plush carpeting at incredible speed.  But at your new size you have so little inertia that you bounce when you hit the carpet, maybe a hundred feet into the air.  A hundred feet, but not as high as the heel of the red sandal.  And you land back in the pile of the carpet, which rises over your head to perhaps three times your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see that the women you have been suffering beneath is a girl you know, a petite (?) latino girl named Alexandra.  This mountain of a girl is only about five feet tall, you recall.  But now she's standing so close that you can't see any higher than her mighty ass, no matter how far you tilt your head back.  You remember her as having a cute ass, but in the last several moments her \"cute\" ass nearly extinguished your life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try getting her attention.  But in this thick carpeting, there's no way she can see you.  Maybe if you climbed the carpet fibers to the top of the pile and waved.  Or maybe she would mistake you for an ant, and the last thing you would see in your life would be the sole of her platform sandal coming down on you like an avalanche, grinding you into the carpet.  What else do you do to an ant you find on your rug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shiny red platforms look unclimbable to you at your new height.  The heel must rise to a height of at least two hundred feet in the back.  But the front shouldn't be so high, you realize.  So you begin jogging through the carpet fibers, making a circuit around her immense foot.  Several times she shifts her foot unconciously, and you have to run away for your life, as an enormous wall of shiny red leather closes in on you at breakneck speeds.  When you finally get around her massive sandal to the end where her toes are, you can see that the climb is still a minimum of fifty feet, and the material is smooth, seamless.  When you are about to lose hope, you notice another giantess walking towards Alexandra.  And hope is born anew.  Coming from a distance as she is, you can make out all of this giantess, or most of her anyway.  You don't know her, haven't ever seen her before.  What catches your attention is that she's CARRYING a pair of slingback sandals in her right hand, and her feet are bare!  You might actually be able to get her attention.  She stops about a thousand feet away, maybe more.  From somewhere at cloud level you hear the girls greet each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO CHLOE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS PARTY?  THEY SURE MADE SURE TO STOCK ENOUGH BOOZE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, I THINK THIS PARTY IS GOING TO LAST UNTIL MORNING, ALEX.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue to chat as you consider what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Max climbs off of Gretchen and stands up. You look around, wondering where Max is now taking you. You look down in horror as you see that he is about to go put his underwear and jeans back on! Any second now, you are going to be crammed into a very tight pair of pants with this enormous dong!<br>\r\nOf course there is another choice: You could decide to risk it and leap to the floor, though in your deminished stature, the fall is ENORMOUS!<br>\r\nNot to mention the fact that Max may turn you into a very small pancake with his foot.<br>\r\nYou decide!</span></div></div>",

They are meant to help keep the story going and to keep it from contradicting itself. Please try to adher to them, but if inspiration leads you some other way, I won't argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese additions are concerning some special physics about the main character: <br>\r\n- He cannot be digested/disolved by acids <br>\r\n- He can see in the dark (little color, though) <br>\r\n- He can be killed by crushing him <br>\r\n- He can't suffocate <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne rule I really need to impose: <br>\r\n- He is not gay <br>\r\nI am sorry about being so rude, but gay stories do less than little for me, and I don't want to have to check through a lot of gay episodes or anything. I don't mind people being gay, but I don't want this story to go in that direction. Thank you for your understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn general, it would be nice if you try to keep the hero alive or at least always offer an escape before writing a death- episode.
