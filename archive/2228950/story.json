He had jumped at the chance to order this amazing item when he saw the advertisement on the internet.<br>\r\nIt was a shrink ray gun. Much like those seen in sci-fi movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this one was a real shrinking ray gun. Supposed to shrink anything or anybody to miniature size in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled it from the package , he marveled at sight. It looked much like a toy gun. It was black and about 6 inches long. The gun was very light. On the side was a digital dial with arrows pointing one up and one down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a precharged battery pack ready to be inserted into the pistol grip. On the side of the pistol was a sticker which read \u201c never point unless you intend to shrink something \u201c. Also was a setting which read \u201c permanent or temporary shrink\u201d. Temporary was for 24 hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the dial to temporary and the size to 25%, Bob looked around the room for something to try it on. Not seeing anything he looked outside. Hanging on the front porch was a bird feeder with birds feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would do. He aimed at a bird feeding and pulled the trigger. Instantly a white narrow beam hit the bird and it began to shrink.<br>\r\nThe bird stopped feeding and before it could fly was reduced in size to that of a dragonfly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Bob....</span></div></div>",

Only one way to find out\u201d<br>\r\nWith that thought Bob decided on a way to lure her into a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of trap does Bob decide?</span></div></div>",

No cars and no one around. She crept around to check doors but all were locked. Finally she decided to jump on the roof. It was about 25 feet high but she managed it easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked around but nothing was amiss, all was quiet. Suddenly she did see a lit inner area of the plant, which could only be seen from the roof.<br>\r\nIt was an arena with several dogs running around, no wait, she looked closer, they were miniature horses!<br>\r\nShe had never seen horses so small. Seeing no one around her curiosity got the best of her and she jumped down to see them closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
