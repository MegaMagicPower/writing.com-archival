Whlie the otter put up a small fight she was soon gagged and bound, as was the young prissy mouse. \"What ave we here, a few lone maids out for a walk?\" said the rather ugly vermin leader, the rest of his gang laughed along with him. \"Lightpaw they got any goods on em?\" \"Aye sir a few gourds of good ol water!\" \"Well 'and them over!\" As the leader was drinking his fill Arevan choose to make his move, hurling the spear with all his might at the vermin leader the spear flew right into the vermins gapeing mouth and right out the other side.

The heavy linen cloak clung tight to his skin, keeping the moisture off of his fur before he started to make his stride.  The lord had only recently come into realization that he was to go to the volcanic mountain, as miles away his father, at that moment, finally had succumb to a sea rat attack on the shore, made successful by the efforts of the Long Patrol, but at heavy losses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint felt the pull to the west, but in his brain rumbled some thoughts.

The yearn for the taste of their blood is strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the wood, He had been tracking a band of vermin for nearly two seasons, getting painfully close to their lair.

Now was the time to assume his position as the new Badger Lord, and if his predecessor had fallen, he had better make haste towards his new home to defend it.  The heavy boar began his westward sprint through Mossflower woods, passing by river and meadow and village without pause, a critter with a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week had passed, and Starglint stood at the edge of the beachfront.  The full moon filled the night sky with its light and the boar crouched behind several tall stones.  Torchlight dotted the beach, and from his vantage point he could see the front entrance of Salamandastron, but there was the issue of the vermin army between himself and his birthright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint continued to creep towards the beach, moving from stone to stone until there was nothing but sand between himself everyone else.  The vermin weren't sending guard patrols except around the volcano, focusing their attention on the inside.  Considering the Long Patrol were never known for getting re-enforcements, the battle tactic was sound, however Starglint smiled, feeling quite the spanner to be plunged into their gears.  The Badger Lord gripped the hilt of his bastard sword, feeling the rough texture bite into his calloused hand.  He had to be careful, he was heavily outnumbered, and they had killed one badger already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint figured he had three options.  The vermin probably are resting after a day of siege, so he could rush into their barracks and take out several of their warriors now, catch them with their breeches 'round their ankles, as it were.  He'd have to be quick, and would have to know when to retreat before he got overwhelmed, but it would catch them by surprise.  He looked over at Salamandastron's front door, figuring he could possibly sneak into the fortress, that way he could rest, arm and armour himself, and bring on the wrath of the Long Patrol by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the enemy camp, he saw a large tent, a yurt, with plenty of guards at the front.  A wicked smile ran across Starglint's face.  He could make his way there and dispatch their boss.  A quick tactic there could turn the tides, or at least cause the enemy to disband and make for the hills.  He liked that idea muchly, but it did have its risks.</span></div></div>",

They'd return, but at least that'd give Starglint time to settle down in the fortress.  The badger's ebon bladed sword was pulled from his back sheath as he stole his way into the encampment.  Several rats and weasels were around a fireplace, drinking up the day's battle, the smell of whiskey strong in the air.  Starglint made a mental note to capture their food holds if possible, he could use a good drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger lord crept up behind the large yurt, carving a slit in the canvas as quietly as he could, checking around him to make sure he wasn't spotted.  His heart was pounding in his chest as he peeked inside.  The yurt was dark aside from candles being held over a table, all the occupants leaning over it, discussing battle plans.  Starglint slowly made the slit wide enough for himself to crawl through, swallowing his breath as to not make a noise.  His ears perked to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't keep attacking at the front, it's too well fortified and the bodies of our slain simply are giving them another wall.\" a scarred weasel muttered, picking his teeth with a stiletto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've looked around this blasted mountain for weeks now, there isn't any other way inside, unless you want to jump into the crater.  Maybe you should do that, Toothrot.\" a fat young rat snarled at the weasel, the latter presumably Toothrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenants, would you both shut up.  Had we some proper siege equipment, we'd be over and done with this already.  What we need is a real idea, something that'll work.\" said an old rat.  By the looks, probably the one in charge, especially considering the tall slab of meat that made for an ermine.  Both of their backs were to him, and it wouldn't be too hard to take out the boss, though, perhaps it would be more prudent to go after his guard.

He called for some guards to take away the dead bodies, he'll have to appoint new captains tomorrow, but for the moment, he had won.  He hefted up the huge ebony bastard sword the badger used, too heavy for him or any of his men to use, but most certainly a trophy befitting such a victory.

A one shot device, but at least it did its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint blinked slightly, feeling very woozy, despite his berserker rage.

Starglint saw the table he was at, and the dead bodies getting moved off, when he realized that wasn't the case, the mighty badger lord was shrunk to the size of a flea!  No, he was the size of a flea's flea!  Whatever sorcery was going on was not pleasing him one bit as he looked around, trying to figure out what to do right now.</span></div></div>",

Get a maid in here! I'm in the mood!\"<br>\r\n Quwelp bowed and backed out the door. Starglint still didn't quite know what to do at his size. However, he was a Badgerlord. He was a warrior, true born. He wasn't going to let his condition stop him from his goal.<br>\r\n  Then, he got an idea, and made way across Thundike's body, up towards his scaly head. Climbing over his cheek, he had to dodge the sea rat's claw a few times. It was obvious that he was itching him. Good. That was just the beginning of Starglint's plan. <br>\r\n  He scurried up to the ear and climbed in. It was full of dirt and wax, so it was slow going, and disgusting. All this time, Thundike was grumbling about was taking Quwelp  so long with the maiden. What maiden wouldn't want him? He licked his lips in anticipation, if only he could stop this blasted itch.<br>\r\n  Inside the sea rat's ear, Starglint had reached his destination, the eardrum. He could see it vibrating, from all of the sounds coming in from around it. Perfect.  Filling his lungs, the badger roared out the largest cry he could. The sea rat yelped in pain and grabbed his ear. Starglint did it again, and the sea rat shook his head in pain. Inside the ear, the badger held on as best he could.. Now for part two.<br>\r\n    Using his sharp claws, Starglint attacked the membrane of the eardrum. He created slashes in it that while, didn't bleed, looked very nasty and painful. Thundike yowled and fell in the floor, rolling in pain. At that moment, Quwelp returned with a not very comely looking rat maiden. They both looked at each other in confusion<br>\r\n  \" 'e havin' one of dem seizures?\" asked the rat maiden.<br>\r\n    \"Dunno.\" replied Quwelp. He tried to approach Thundike, but was afraid to.<br>\r\n Inside Thundike's ear, Starglint continued his assault, shredding the eardrum. There was some blood now, and the badger was sure that the sea rat was deafened in this ear.<br>\r\n   He started to scramble out of the rat's ear, which was difficult, with him rolling around. His claws helped. What to do next, he thought? <br>\r\n Should he<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

M-M'Lord?\" Quwelp approached the now silent Thundike. \"A--are you quite all right, Sir?\"<br>\r\n  Quwelp had the misfortune of approaching from the now deaf side of Thundike. As he neared, Thundike saw him, hissed, and flung one arm out at him, catching him off guard.

Can't see the forest for the trees.  At the same time, the rat maiden had retreated back to the wall, watching the events unfold.

Now that he had shown Thundike what he could do, he would give him an ultimatum.<br>\r\n   \"Thundike!\"<br>\r\n   The searat yelped in pain agian, much to the relief of Quwelp.

Many a trail turned into dead ends, but as of late this band of bandits have been slipping up, and making more mistakes.  They have caught wind of someone looking for them and they've been moving more swiftly, but a fleeting prey is easier to spot than one standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint smiled, seeing a cave in the heart of Mossflower wood.  A few weasel guards are on patrol, with bardiches resting on their shoulders, several more rats and other vermin inside the patrol line, all around the mouth of the cave.  He wasn't sure how many were inside, or how cavernous the underworld would be in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he drew his bastard sword, Efreeti, from its backsheath, getting the weapon at the ready.  The warrior took some time to consider his plan of attack, not wanting to blow this chance after so long in its conception.  A full on attack might be possible at this moment, while they were on their own ground, they did not seem quite prepared as most of the guards were remaining inattentive.  He might have been downwind from the bandits, but a massive, black and white badger is not easy to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint could also wait until nightfall, when most of the prey would be asleep.  Slightly more cowardly in combat, however, considering the numbers, might be smarter to fight such large odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Starglint considered leaving now, and returning with a larger task force.  While it might end up losing the trail of the bandits, but, the cave might be a base of operations, and still be around when he gets back.</span></div></div>",

The dull thud of his skull on the soft peat caused the nearby rats to shriek in alarm.  The weasels pounced towards Starglint, polearms shining in the air, easily blocked by the beserk badger.  The fiery song of Efreeti lashed out, running across the belly of one of the adversaries, opening him up like a Christmas present.  Several rats jumped upon his back, burying their daggers into the badger's shoulders, making him roar in pain.  Starglint quickly undid his cloak, now naked before his enemies, chopping his blade down upon his dropped cloak several times before the contents underneath it stopped squirming and the brown fabric was stained red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint shrugged off several darts and bolts that shrieked into his hide, sprinting to the three crossbowmen near the cave's maw.

Unable to find room to swing his blade, Starglint was forced to drop Efreeti, swinging his fists at the first few rats, knocking them against the walls.  Blood poured out of his body as more nicks and slashes assailed his flesh.  Each motion became harder and heavier for the mighty warrior as he fought on.  The rats scampered out of range each time he tried to punch or grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the warrior felt tired, falling to his bloodied knees, his eyes wide and glassy, breath not coming to his lips.

Soon rats and weasels started to spill out of the cavern, surrounding the badger lord and the clearing.  All with weapons at the ready, menacingly glaring at the huge, bloodied brock.  The forest became eerily quiet, as even the birds and the insects quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut stroke a tall fox, red fur underneath a glistening chain-mail cuirass.  By the looks of his equipment and his stature, this was certainly the leader of the rag tag bunch.  He drew out his weapon, a long, thin shamshir, a weapon from far away, made to carve flesh from bone with swift strokes.  As Starglint was rendered naked in the fight, such a thing wouldn't be too difficult if he landed a blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Edwardo Felanirus, Lord of the Black Fang Clan, and you...\" the fox pointed with his weapon, \"You are the annoying gnat that keeps following us.  I see that you're as fighter as you are a tracker.  However...\" he draws himself into an elegant fighting stance, \"Today you shall meet your end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats were more honourable than Starglint had expected, not rushing in to ambush the badger, but still screaming for his blood, watching the fox and the badger circle one another.  Starglint readied his weapon, however he knew this was going to be a difficult fight.  His own martial training had been self-taught; brutish and aggressive.  Edwardo moved with a grace and elegance that suggested decades of formal training.  The only advantage with Starglint's informal training is that he might surprise the fox, but looking at his opponent, it didn't seem likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwardo made the first move, slashing forward with a practiced step.  Starglint didn't have time to move his blade to block the weapon, resorting to a haphazard dodge, putting him off balanced for a heartbeat, giving Edwardo time to attack again.  With Starglint's blade at the ready defensively, he knocked the thin blade aside, just barely.  The sound of metal striking metal rang in both of the combatant's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint smiled, the sound was unmistakable.  Edwardo's weapon was sharpened to a razor's edge, however that meant every strike that wasn't true, was dulling his blade that much faster.  The Badger Lord went on the defensive.  Keeping one eye on the weapon, and the other on his opponent's eyes, quickly learning his tells as the fox fenced the warrior.  Each blow turned aside with Efreeti meant one step closer to the fox merely fighting with a thin blunt stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warriors circled for an hour and a half.  The crowd cheering on Edwardo, seeing his aggression putting him well in the lead, however in the heavy chain-mail, the fox's speed quickly tired as he felt more and more drained.  The todd, in need to end the fight quickly made a wide, sweeping slash, leaving his whole body open.  Starglint knocked at the sword, sending it spiraling out of the fox's hand, and then slammed the hilt of his weapon into the fox's chest, making him double over onto his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats all were quiet, seeing the duel had ended, and their champion had lost.  The sound of weapons being dropped clattered around Starglint as they knew they were defeated.  Starglint shouldered his heavy weapon, walking around in slow circles around Edwardo.  \"F-Finish me... you've won.\" the todd plead.</span></div></div>",

A few rats and a weasel screamed at the Badger, raising arms but were quickly struck down by the victor.  The rest of the bandits retreated to the woods, having been routed and bested by the warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint grunted, making his way into the cave to see what the bandits had acquired.  The cave was a set of caverns, well suited for a bandit's lair, with rooms for barracks, armoury, prison, and treasury.  The weapons were useless, and the clothing was too small for a badger of his size.  Starglint made his way further into the back of the cave, finding the prison.  There he saw several beasts, mice, hares, hedgehogs, even a sow badger female.  Their throats slit, and judging by their warmth, recently too.  Starglint sighed in pain, knowing he was the one who signed their death warrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treasury was full of glittering things from all over Mossflower.  Gems, coin, jewelry, silks.  The bandits had a large cache of wealth.  Starglint looked over the treasure, taking a small sack of coin and gems, not knowing when the next time he might need to bribe someone, and fashioned himself a red silk cloak from the bolts of silk cloth, joining it with a silver brooch in the shape of an eagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the caves, Starglint found himself at the crossroads once again.  The pull towards Salamandastron was greater even now, his taste of Bloodwrath reminding him of his status as lord.  However, Starglint knew the surrounding villages would benefit from the treasures the bandits had, as well as spreading the news of their demise.  Also he could receive healing for his wounds.</span></div></div>",

The heavy blade of Efreeti slammed into the ground next to the fox tip first, burying half a foot into the earth.  Despite the blood loss in the fight, Starglint found himself getting aroused, possibly from the adrenaline of combat and the euphoria of winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger's heavy hands tore open the fox's breeches, exposing his red rump and his tight ebon pucker.  Starglint knelt behind the fox, pressing his thick tip against the vulpine's opening, slowly easing himself in.  Edwardo gasped and moaned, feeling more than humiliated as he was taken before his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vermin looked in shock as Starglint took their leader's tail, making him his own vixen.  The sound of the chain-mail moved in the rhythm of the badger's sodomy, and with each full thrust, Edwardo let out a soft gasp, feeling the shaft press against his prostate.  The fox's own member sliding out of his sheath, making Starglint smile wide, \"Mmmmm, I see, Ed, you like this.\" he whispered, taking the shaft in his hand and stroked the fox's length, adding to his humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rats and weasels continued to watch in horror, listening to the grunts and moans of the two males.  One by one, each of the former bandits simply left into the woods, shaking their heads in collective defeat.  They didn't get far when they heard Starglint roar out once more in his climax, filling their former leader with his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint huffed tiredly over Edwardo, catching his breath as he was well worn out after both the fight and the sex, pulling out of the fox's tailhole with a loud slurp.  Edwardo blushed and whimpered louder, slowly moving a paw to his own erection, finishing himself off, biting his lower lip as his hand wrapped around his knot, spurting onto the dirt.  He didn't want to admit the pleasure of the event, turning to look at the vanquisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint retrieved and sheathed Efreeti, looking at his cloak and deemed it useless, feeling he'll get a new one once he goes to Salamandastron.  He doesn't take two steps when he hears the fox whimpering, padding closer.  \"M-my lord.  You've bested me in combat, and broken me before my men.  Please... let me join you, and teach me to be as strong as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint blinked, a fox following a badger?  Certainly without precedence.  He knew he had to be careful, not wanting to leave an opening to be stabbed in the back.  However, turning one vermin soul towards the light might be a good test for himself.</span></div></div>",

The fox went to retrieve his blade, covering his rear with his bushy tail before returning, a hopeful look in his eyes.  The badger lord sighed slightly, nodding to himself and to the bandit king.  \"Very well, Edwardo.  From henceforth you shall be warded unto me, your master, Starglint.  I shall learn you in all the methods I can, and in return, I demand that you live a virtuous life from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwardo bowed deeply to his new master, blushing hotly to himself, he had never been beneath anyone since he came of age, and this was a new experience for him.  Both beasts looked about the carnage of the cave entrance, Starglint giving another sigh, \"Our first task shall be to bury your fallen comrades.  Even vermin deserve all the courtesies of the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon was spent tending to the deceased.  Edwardo digging out graves, and Starglint resting the bodies within, covering them, and offering them all final blessing.  Weapons were broken and made into markers, fitting for a warrior's grave for each of them, and as the sun dipped below the tree line, both were exhausted from their duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to sleep within a graveyard, both males ventured an hour south, finding a brook to break camp.  Starglint rested his weapon on a tree and removed his belt, the only bit of clothing he had.  The fox shuck his armour and his tattered trousers, looking at the damage Starglint dealt to them.  The tod was pleased that it would only take some stitching to repair them, and used thread from one pant leg to begin his repairs.  Starglint, though tired, decided to make conversation, \"That's quite a shirt of chain you have, Ed.\" he said, shortening his companion's name, \"Where did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwardo gave a sly grin, putting down his repairs before taking his armoured shirt to the badger.  The fox's dark hand pointing to a shining sun on the shoulder, \"It has gone through my family for generations.  It is the armour of the great fox warlord, Roland the Vulpine.  Far to the east, over the mountains did he reign, over all the lands the dawning sun touched.\" the fox said, with a trembling pride in his voice.  Starglint listened with interest, leaning more against the tree, then letting out a grunt of discomfort as his wounds started to let themselves be known after all the work and combat.  Edwardo nodded to himself, easing the badger from the tree and laid him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint watched as his new squire left him, only to come back a few hours later, arms cradling several bits of plant matter.  He cocked his head as Ed offered him some willow bark.  \"Chew on this.  It shall dull your pain.\"  Starglint did, tasting the chalky residue of the bark as Ed started to clean his wounds with the nearby water, then chewed on the herbs, spitting the salves on his cuts, then started to sew them up with the thread of his other pant leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger winced, feeling worse than when the fox started, but was aware that was the mystery of medicines.  When Edwardo was done, the fox stood up, looking about, \"You sleep tonight, you'll need your rest.  I'll stand watch until sunrise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint looked warily at his new minion, \"What makes me trust that you won't slit my throat in my sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdwardo shrugged, \"Nothing.  However I would think that were I to kill you, I wouldn't have spent so long to fix you up.\"  Starglint nodded, accepting the answer before he closed his eyes.  Sleep rapidly taking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn rose and Edwardo had kept his promise.  He was laying his blade against a whetstone, bringing his weapon to its original lethality.  Starglint slowly rose, feeling his wounds aching, but they seemed well on the mend.  He gathered his sword and his belt, as Edwardo speared some fish for breakfast.  They ate the raw food together, mostly in silence until the fox broke it, \"Where to now, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint leaned to wash his face in the brook, as well as take a drink of water as he thought of his options.  He stood up slowly, getting his bearings before he said:</span></div></div>",

The day passed quickly and they made good time, though would still be days before they arrive.  Starglint and Edwardo broke camp underneath a small cave near the brook.  Edwardo made the fire as Starglint explored the cave, finding nothing inside, and then rested his blade against the earthen wall.  \"I'll take the first watch, I'll wake you up at midnight.\" Edwardo said, looking out of the cave.  Starglint nodded in agreement and they both fished for their supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating a hearty meal, Starglint took his time to sleep, without his cloak, the nights were getting much cooler as he grumbled, clutching onto his body for warmth, grinding his back into the earth.  He managed a few hours of shut eye, but soon his eyes slit open unable to sleep for any longer.  At the mouth of the cave, the badger heard some deep grunting and panting.  He slowly turned his head, and saw Edwardo at the mouth of the cave, highlighted by moonlight as he was stroking his foxhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint paused, grunting quietly to himself, considering his options.</span></div></div>",

At first Edwardo was caught off guard, but soon he relaxed, letting the badger's tongue into the mouth as they kissed.  Both males grunting in their respected needs.  Starglint had never done anything like this until that public act yesterday, but, this was different than that, more passion and need.  He felt Edwardo rub all over his own body, caressing his heavy sheath while the badger continued to masturbate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint pulled from the kiss, panting for air before smiling at the fox, lowering his head slowly as he looked at the penis, throbbing wetly, the tip tapered to a point with his winking urethra dribbling pre, and a scooped out area just above.  Starglint lowered his muzzle, taking in the fox's offering, running his tongue all over the musky length which made the fox coo in bliss.  Starglint couldn't help but blush himself, enjoying the fox's taste as he bobbed his head up and down, reaching to tease the todd's sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint gulped, remembering what he did to the fox that day, and looked up at him, should he?</span></div></div>",

Starglint smiled to himself, turning about and got on his hands and knees, lifting his tiny tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was puzzled for a moment, with all the blood having gone south, then quickly understood what was going on.  He crept to the badger male, putting his thin muzzle between the ample cheeks before lapping at Starglint's star.  The badgerlord trembled in enjoyment, groaning at the rimming as the fox lubed him up.  His toes clentched when the fox's tongue pushed in slightly, kissing him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Edwardo was sure his companion was properly lubed up, he held onto his shaft with one hand, and the badger's tail with the other, slowly pushing his length into the bigger male.  Starglint loosed a low, deep moan, getting topped by the fox, a shaft that certainly felt bigger than it looked.  Both males started to grunt and moan in their sex play, a slower, more gentle motion than what Starglint gave Edwardo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger felt the fox's tip poke and prod against his prostate, making him groan and whimper in pleasure, his length hard and throbbing beneath him when the fox reached around to massage the thick offering between the badger's legs.  The bandit's hips slapped hard against the lord's muscular buttocks as he picked up his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint grunted, feeling something getting bigger, popping in and out of his ring as Edwardo thrusted faster.  It hurt a bit, but he was curious as to what was going on.  He reached to feel what it was when it slammed in hard into his rear.  Starglint whimpered, feeling the bulb grow fatter in his rear before he felt the fox's warm goo splatter into his bowls.  Edwardo yipped into the air, unleashing his seed into the badger's rump before resting against his firm rear, panting hard.  They were tied together and exhausted.  Both slipping into sleep without care of the next watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint awoke the next morning, his rear sore, and Edwardo still atop of him.  The badger blinked awake a bit more, sighing to himself.  Maybe it wouldn't be a good idea to keep the fox along on the trip.</span></div></div>",

His heart pounding in his chest as he looked around the court yard.  Seeing the chapel, and the dormitory building.  Moving to his goal, his footsteps were hushed by the wet grass on his feet.  He was nearly spotted by one of the patrolling guards in the courtyard, but slipped into the building unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint walked with his toes pointed upward, not wanting his large digging claws to make noise on the cobblestone.  His ears perked up, listening for any interior guards, as well as the snoring inside each room.  Three floors he went up until he stopped by one door.  The sound within was loud and even, as Starglint knew what was inside, having a good guess as to what a snoring badger sounded like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quietly opened the door to the badgermum's cell, seeing her sprawled across the bed, sheets pushed onto the floor as she was trying to keep cool in the warm night.  Starglint felt his sheath swell with desire as he stared between her legs, breathing through his nose faster, getting more and more of her fertile pheromones in his nose.  The nun's folds were swollen and dripping in her heat, shining wetly from the moonlight creeping through the window.</span></div></div>",

Starglint raised his hands to defend his face, holding his position a moment before peeking around his arms.  The badger mum blinked, not recognizing the beast in her room, but something told her that she wasn't in danger.  She lowered the impromptu bludgeoning tool, looking at the boar in her room,  \"Who are you, and what do you want?\" she asked in a hushed, quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint nodded, moving to sit on the side of the female's bed, turning his head towards her.  She was soft and round, well fed on the abbey's food, but the labour kept her body toned.  Starglint introduced himself, telling her his name, and his sudden pull towards Salamandastron, meaning only that he was the new Badger Lord, and his father has fallen in battle.  \"However, before I go, I must... prepare my own successor.\" he blushed hotly, looking at the wall opposite the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger mum lowered the vase back onto the nightstand, sitting up proper as she looked at the lord, digesting his words, before her own face went into a blush, \"O-oh... you mean?\" Starglint nodded, coughing into one of his heavy paws.  The sow crossed her legs, running her fingers against each other shyly.  \"I'm, ah, Prudence, by the way.  Ah, a pleasure to meet you, sir Starglint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint nodded back, turning to the nun, taking her hands into his own.  \"I've heard great stories of the Badger Mums of the Abbey, beasts so strong and powerful, even more mighty than the Badger Lords of the West, but...\" Starglint smiled, adding a bit of charm, \"I never realized that they were quite so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrudence blushed even more, unable to quiet a giggle as Starglint leaned to kiss her upon her cheek.  The sow returned with her lips on his, making both hold each other in their desires.  The nun gasped, feeling the male's length prod along her thigh, making her shiver slowly.

Both beasts moaned loudly, clutching each other tightly as Starglint's rod ventured into the female's cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrudence grunted, digging her claws into Starglint's back as his member stretched, and snapped her hymen around his shaft, deflowering the female.  Warm, sticky fluids touched upon her fingertips while Starglint's hips pushed forward with more urgency.  The velvety embrace of Prudence's insides driving his need even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed squeaked and grunted as both of the heavy creatures moved in their lust.

Starglint kept to the shadows, not moving a muscle as he observed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them sat naked by the fire, their clothes hung to dry, still caked in the mud.  Starglint nodded, neither were experienced travelers, or at least not more than road work.  The smell of cooked fish and berries, as well as a potato soup assaulted the warrior's nose, making his empty belly grumble loudly.  Were he not to breed the sow, perhaps he might at least get a meal out of the meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint strode into the campsite proudly, making both jump, startled, but with his entrance being fanfared by the snapping of twigs and the rustle of leaves, they observed the massive, muscular badger entering their campsite.

He would have thought it from traveling were it not for his sister, a relatively plump badger sow, not obese, but with plenty of curves, strong, childbearing hips and ample breasts, as well as a padded rump and soft belly.  Starglint made sure his cloak covered his crotch before sitting down on the ground, greeting them both.  \"Hail, friends.  I'm Starglint, another weary traveler like yourselves.

Patience blushed slightly, crossing her legs slightly, staring at Starglint with a hungry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're in Mossflower wood, about a day's trek from Redwall Abbey to the east.  They would be more than helpful to outfit you with things you need, map and directions.\" Starglint said.  His stomach overpowered his genitals as he moved to eye the food that was prepared.  \"You wouldn't happen to have enough for three?  Iron rations are hard on the teeth after so long.\"  Both Elvon and Patience nodded in approval as Starglint produced a wooden cup to scoop in some of the soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvon looked over the weapon strapped to Starglint's back, \"That's quite a blade you've got there.  Not sure I could heft that with three hands.\" he admitted, blushing.  Starglint chuckled, licking the side of his cup clean of soup before reaching to take off the sword.  Five feet of steel was hoisted over the flames, as ebon as a newborn's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bastard sword Efreeti, named after the fire spirits of a land far, far to the south.  My mother gave it to me before I was sent wandering.  Makes for good... rat control.\" he laughed, resheathing his weapon before downing the rest of his soup.  \"So, Elvon, Patience.  What brings you to Mossflower wood, so haphazardly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience, who had been quiet all this time, finally spoke, \"We've fled from our home because those there don't approve of our relationship.\"  Her voice was sweet, as Starglint rested his hand upon his chin, looking over the sow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

Their tongues mingled in their kiss as Patience smiled up from her blowjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two siblings lead Starglint's heavy, calloused hands to themselves.  His right hand wrapped around Elvon's sheath, feeling the contents starting to swell as his left touched the swollen, heatsoaked folds of Patience, making the sow groan happily, stopping her oral ministrations as she just nuzzled Starglint's thick length.  \"Were we to mate you, Patience... you would have our pups.\"  Starglint whispered, feeling Elvon's penis slide out of its sheath, into Starglint's paw, a long member, but not as thick as the badger lord's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and, I want it.\" Patience whispered, pushing Starglint's fingers deeper into her sex.

Elvon nodded quietly, standing up as the larger boar dropped his cloak, naked before both of the other badgers, his thick offering throbbing in need before him, dripping lewdly onto the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience slowly laid upon her back, looking up at the randy lord she had just met.  Her salt and pepper-furred body had a tuft of brown fur framing her swollen labia, drooling fluid onto her tail and on the ground before Starglint moved on top of her.  His lips finding her own quickly as they began a deep, lustful kiss.  Tongues dancing with each other while his calloused hands worked over her ample breasts.  The badger's length pressed against her folds, dimpling the wet lips, not penetrating just yet as his shaft moved against her clitoris, making the sow tremble below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvon grunted, watching his sister and the new boar kiss and wiggle in their foreplay, himself getting ready for being on top as he knelt behind both of the two, lifting Starglint's tiny tail.  The badger lord grunted as he felt a wet, wide tongue run around his dirty tailhole, wetting and loosening him up before the slimy tip of the appendage slipped through his rear ring.  The sensation making him grind harder before his length slowly penetrated Patience's folds, making both badgers groan in surprise and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sow was tight in her heat, and the wetness made Starglint's shaft spasm randomly.  Jets of preseed mixed with the already omnipresent juices, as a few eager \"scout\" sperm already escaped Starglint's shaft, exploring the female.  Elvon got into position behind Starglint, stroking over his length slowly before pushing it against the lord's virgin tailhole.  The warrior had to grunt in discomfort, holding still inside of Patience as more of that long length was slid into his body.  Almost an eternity was passed before Elvon's hips rested upon Starglint's rump, and the three started their slow dance together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three moved in their combined passion, clutching each other as if they'd all float away if they didn't.  The lewd, wet noises of the shafts pushing and pulling overcame the noise of their grunts.  Both males snorting and huffing louder as Starglint clentched hard on Elvon's shaft inside of his rear.  He pushed hard into Patience, moaning lustfully before his army of seed is unleashed inside of her.  Hundreds of thousands of warriors trying to invade the fortress of her womb as the badger lord clutched hard on the sow, his sow.  Elvon bellowed lowly in his own climax, spurting messily into Starglint's rump, all three of them collapsing on the ground, breathing hard and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatience smiled up at both the males, kissing Starglint, then her brother, \"Mmmmmph, th-that was... very nice.\"  Elvon nodded, still out of breath, and firmly rooted inside of Starglint, keeping his long length deep in his rear.  The badger lord chuckles in his euphoria, enjoying quite a lovely deflowering of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey laid still for awhile, regaining their strength before untangling from each other.  All eager to continue the fun.</span></div></div>",

The three felt their energies coming back to them as both males' shafts throbbed in the firelight.  \"Mmmm, Elvon, think this time I'm going to be inside of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stripe-faced mustalids broke from their cuddling pile as Starglint remained on his back, stroking his wide erection, beckoning Elvon over.  The boar nodded, slowly sitting down on Starglint's lap, feeling the tip start to poke and prod against the male's tailhole.  A few breaths and he sank down onto the Badger Lord's shaft, making both males groan in pleasure.  Patience crawled up afterwards, getting on Elvon's lap, sinking her brother inside.  All three mammals whimpered and wiggled upon one another, Starglint's strong body pushing upwards into Elvon's rectum while Patience's soft weight slid the male back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvon's ass was tight and warm around Starglint's cock, draining the stamina out of the badgerlord, feeling himself needing to cum soon.  Patience moved her head, kissing her brother and the stranger back and forth, feeling the incestuous shaft throb inside of her channel.  Starglint's strong arms wrapped around both of the other lovers, clutching them into a firm hug before loosing a battlecry, filling up Elvon's tailhole with his royal seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvon wasn't far behind and he and Patience clutched one another, feeling his seed mixing in with Starglint's offering, filling the sow to capacity, semen leaking out on top of both Elvon's and Starglint's scrotums.  The three panted together, stroking one another as they came down from their plateaus once more.</span></div></div>",

He held her for Elvon who mounted her once more as they proceeded to sandwich the sow.  Patience's eyes went wide, feeling the badgerlord's shaft slip underneath her tail, pushing open her anus around his length as he slowly started to take the sow from the rear.  Patience trembled a bit more, letting out a low bark as she was taken in both holes.  Her tightness made both males groan and shudder in bliss while they moved within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint trembled a bit more, moving harder inside of Patience, making the sow coo against her brother while Elvon pushed his hips harder and faster into her already soaking sex more and more.  After the amount of mating they all have shared recently, neither he nor Starglint or Patience was very long before they joined one another in their climaxes, letting their voices sing through the Mossflower Wood before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Starglint woke up first, feeling exceptionally relaxed and pleased after his night of lovemaking, reaching to rub both Patience and Elvon before stepping out to relieve himself.  Deep in Patience's womb, it was Elvon's seed that bore her fruit, but the girl that will swell her will still grow to become the next Badger Lady to rule Salamandastron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarglint looked about, wondering if he should slip out alone towards his fortress, or stay with the two other badgers.</span></div></div>",

They are freelance soldiers roaming the area. Scouting Mossflower for all potential threats and opportunities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover, a large male moniter lizard from the far south is the heavy fighter and deals with any problems that arise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea, a vixin with dark red fur is a seer and healer. She is not very loyal but surprisingly is very blunt and honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwix, a male black bat, scoures the night sky. He and Azala make most of the maps that they sell. He veiwed his home a boring and only related to his own echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia, a dark brown female ferret and apprentice mystic. She and Rhea share a \"special\" relationship. She can go through terrain others would deam impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzala, a female red lizard who can run very fast. She hailed from a group of cannibals but fled when it was her turn to be on the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there are two rats. Chelov the Vault, the leader of the group he share his races ruthlessness but is known for his coolness under pressure and guile that surpasses even a hare. He has been known to command hoards but also liked to micromanage especially important tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeire. A tall rat with a youthful build. He is a trusted fresh face hand picked by Chelov to even out the group. He has distinguished himself in his first few missions and now has the opportunity to prove himself. A few higher-ups have wondered if he has the right spirit for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walk toward what they thought was a remote land. Azala and Gaia were sent ahead to get the very first bearings while Twix is busy helping with the maps. Keire walks along and makes small talk with Grover, what with them being the two full time fighters. Most of the discussion is of battles, foes, and weapons. Chelov is alert as always, walking briskly ahead of the group. Suddenly Azala's red form is seen in the distance and everyone can tell by her pace that it's bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squirellzz! Lots and lots of squirrelzz!\" She yells upon her arrival! Chelov looks at her sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are we talking here. A roaming family?\" Azala shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no roam. Town!\" Chelov swears and thinks for a second. The area ahead is a valley and the only way through a seccesion of lakes and cliffs. He begins working out scenarios where they sneak through at night or skirt sides swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright we need to sneak in, steal a boat or two. then make our way through the lake to the east. After, of course we check it out as much as we can before being seen. Azala! None of them saw you did they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one!\" she replies confidantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong scum! I saw you and as soon as my father hears of this, you lot will be hide rugs!\" a female voice is heard from above. Everyone looks up and sees a young squirrelmaid standing on a branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let her escape! Azala after her! Everyone follow me to the clearing. We can catch her there!\" Chelov quickly orders. The lizardess stays on the squirrles tale but can't reach her. Everyone else rushes to the clearing but is dismayed to see her well ahead of azala and making it to the top of a hill. If she made it there. They would be seen and the whole mission comprimised. As she gleefully neared the top, the vermin are surprised to see an arm come from the ground and ensare the fleeing made. She falls flat on her face and is seen struggling. Azala reaches her first and helps subdue her. Keire is confused until Gaia and Azala return with the poor squirrel tight in their grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work ladies. Lets get her back to camp.\" Chelov says and The band is quick to follow. As night falls the squirell is tied to a tree and her arms and legs bound. Grover caresses her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-heh! Cute squirrely made a mistake following us.\" The squirrel remains defiant. She spits in Grover's face. Enraged, he is about to strike her only to be stopped by Chalov. Chalove looks down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grover is right. Your bravado was your undoing! What's your name?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gail! Gail stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do with her?\" Gaia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill her and eat her!\" Grover chimes in. This shocks Keire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a prisoner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet! All of you!\" Chelov demands. The Vault got his name because of his mastery of supply lines \"There will be secondary parties coming soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He spent a couple of hours lost in thought. Occasionally he takes a parchment note and writes a few things down. An educated rat... How charming. Gail thought. Eventually it was time to eat. Chelov scarfs down a quick meal of bread and nuts. He then prepares a similar lunch for his prisoner. She puts on her \"sexy face\" as he approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to eat.\" He says uncaringly. He brings a nut to her mouth. Gail makes a show of licking his fingers as she eats each nut.

He smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have turned around.\" He says, feigning curiosity. Gail looks up and responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been fascinated by vermin. Now that I've finally met one. I want to learn... all that i can.\" She hopes that convinces him. Chelov takes Gail's leash in his hand. He pulls it towards him and she falls over.

Gails closes her eyes and licks about his toes. effectively mimicking her actions with his hands. He takes his time making her lick all over his dirty sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be grateful. Most prisoners don't get cheese with their bread.\" He says jokingly. Gail continues to lick up the bread along with his sweaty paws. Evetually eating the whole slice, peice by peice. Chelov times it so that his feet are perfectly clean when the bread is finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy that?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir. Your feet were delicious.\" She forces herself to say with sincerity. Chelov eyes her paws. He walks around her and grabs one of them. He gives each of them a few licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm not bad. But i have a better use for your paws, girl. Sit down on your rear.\" He does the same and then reveals his hardening member. Gail is still forcing herself to look aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's clear what I want.\" Chelov says. Gail nodds and brings her footpaws up to his member. She positions one on each side. Then begins to rub up and down his large cock. Every once in a while she loses her ruse of arrousal but Chelov ignores it. He wants her to work toward her goal. She plays with his tip, using her toes and once he gets a steady flow of precum. He grabs her head and brings it to his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick!\" he orders. She is forced to lick the pre off of his dick and even has to lick her own feet. After a while he cums hard. All over her face and makes her drink some of it. He then drinks a large portion of the water that was ment for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She lets loose. Chelov looks at the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! how thoughtless of me. Let me replace it.\" He takes his softening member and pees in the cup. giving about an 4/5 pee to water ratio. He finishes by shaking the last few squirts on her. She almost freaks out but maintains control. He brings to chalace to her lips. She drinks the steaming liquid and manages to bring it down. After going this far, she even surprises herself by pooling the last of it in her mouth. She shows it to him before swishing it around. She then swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelov eggs her on by saying that he can now trust her a bit more. </span></div></div>",

This finale remark made Keire wonder why he had ever joined the band, he had been happy enough roaming around the north coast but then again the thought of plunder and warfare had excited the rat to no end so here he was, guarding a young bushtail. As the hours passed the rat began to become restless he had expected his leader to return in an hour or so, but that had not been the case his leader had not returned and he still had to pervent any kind of escape or rescure that was attempted by the prisoner or her kin. \"Excuse me sir, im hungery and thirsty and I cant help but notice all of the food and drink lieing around and I was wondering if I could...\"  \"Have me get you something to eat and drink?\" Said Keire finishing the bushtails sentence. \"And I ain't no sir thats to prissy for me, just call me Keire or any thing that comes to mind.\" Gail ponderd this any thing that came to mind, why would he say that it was too kind of him some kind of trick. \"So your hungery right, well weve got bread and water and some dasmon wine but thats the captins so what would you like?\" Asked the Rat that was being rather kind to her. \"Bread and water sounds great, could I have some now?\" \" I supose so, the captin never said not to feed you.\" After saying this the rat began breaking small chunks of bread of so the prisoner could chew at her own pace along with giveing her small droughts of water. After haveing her fill of the food she began to think about her plan of escape the rat might help her, but what was a rat and a tied up maid who had never risen I paw in anger or combat, to a well armed band of determined vermin? (Meanwhile in the mind of Keire) The bushtail seems nice enough, but then again calling me scumface wasn't nice, but when had he ever expected anyone to be nice to him? It was kill or be killed the toughest and smartest lived while the dumb and weak die. But she couldint be older then 15 seasons why harm a young maid, had she ever harmed a liveing creature? not likely he thought maybe he could escape before the rest got back and see her home safely. But if the rest knew what he had done they would kill him or worse, for some unkown reason he began to think of his child hood and of his mother who had said \"Now Keire im not long for this world, but before I go you have got to promise me you will not ever hurt a another beast, if you must make sure it is in self defence!\" \"But mother I dont understand why tell me this. my farther killed the young and harmless so why cant I?\" \"Dammit keire your better then that you must never harm the innocent do you understand me,dont.....do...it...\" \"Mother are you ok, you look pail let me fecth you some water....\"  But his mother had fallen of a heart attack, soon after he left and began roveing and ended up here.

She reaches the guest quarters where a circus troup has currently set up shop. She enters what she thinks is an empty bedroom and begins to sing louder. She opens the drawer and begins to sort and fold various cloth items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a beutiful song.\" Corflower jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Oh hello Ivy. You startled me!\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I was just enjoying your beutiful singing.\" Ivy comes closer to the maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just sounds so wonderful...\" She continues as her arms reach around Cornflower's neck and rest on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just makes me go all soft in the legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Well.....That's nice...I-I-I'm glad you like my singing.\" Cornflower says uncomfortably. Ivy slowly guides the young mouse to the bed. her paws caress Cornlower's breast. She kisses the mouse then abruptly stops. Allowing the mouse to take everthing in. Wild Ivy then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to continue?\" Cornflower thinks for only a moment then gets up and heads for the door. Ivy pouts and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Mathias is a lucky boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is. But I'm just locking the door.\" Cornflower says and winks at her. Cornflower practically lunges onto Ivy and kisses her deeply. They make out on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what? You're not the only one who can be so forward.\" She says to the circus mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well. I wouldn't expect that from a sweet innocent abbeymouse.\" Corflower scoffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do love this place but sometimes it gets so damn boring.\" Ivy undresses the girl and and then herself. Now naked they begin to tease eachother. Fondling all over and kissing. Lots of kissing. They then start to sixty-nine eachother. Licking eachothers sweet pussies for what feels like forever. Their moaning however does not goe unnoticed. Ivy begins to suck the nectar right out of Cornflowers hole and begins to finger her tailhole. Cornflower nibbles gently around the lips of her pussy. As each of them reach climax. They dont hear a key, then a doorknob turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" They look up to the voice and see...</span></div></div>",

Mathias casually breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cornflower, Ivy...How's it going?\" He asks, completely devoid of character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Thanks.\" they reply in a similar monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-uh you excited for the big feast tonight? This one isn't going to be like the big feasts we have every other night. This ones gonna be different. This ones....gonna have hedgehog pie. Isn't that something?\" He asks as small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy, whose face is still between Cornflower's legs responds as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, yes. That spicy Cheese dish enjoyed by the hedgehogs of peace island. Some of Cornflower's juices get flung off of her face as she talks. Sounds lovely.\" Mathias stretches and exhales loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess I'll go do...some....Redwall things.\" He slowly walks out. Ivy and cornflower look at each other. Ivy begins to shrug off the event and starts to work on Cornflower again but she stops her. Ivy pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Corny. You don't think HE'S gonna go crying foul to the abbot, do you?\" Cornflower frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He'll run to every male in a half day's walk from here. Why I wouldn't be surprised if Cluney the Scourge caught wind of this by the boy himself!\" Ivy chuckles at the thought and then decides that action is the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to shut him up, won't we?\" Ivy begins to tell Cornflower her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later. Mathias is walking down an empty hallway, pondering who to tell first. He doesn't notice it start to get dark and spooky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! The feast is about to start!\" Mathias exclaims as he does an about face right into the butt of Ivy's dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathias wakes up a few minutes later. His head is pounding and his vision takes a few seconds to focus. When he comes to he see Ivy and Cornflower looming over him, grinning. He tries to move but realizes that he is tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey. What's the meaning of this?\" Mathias demands. Cornflower just shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk. You don't really think We'd just let you spread little encounter all over Mossflower now would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathias' eyes widen in fear of what was going to transpire. Ivy and Cornflower rubbed their bare feet against the dusty ground. Teasing him for effect. Matthias' pupiles become pinpoints as he realises what his punishment will entale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna have first go Corny?\" Ivy asks courteously. Cornflower giggles and pulls up a chair. and looks lovingly at her little life-mate. Ironically the \"flower's\" paws are the grubbiest things he's ever seen. Many Rats would be put to shame by the display. the pink hue of her sole sharply contrasting with the black layer of dirt. Mathias looks up at the once prim and proper mouse pleadingly. Cornflower mearly grins devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. Whats the matter? Little mousey thought he could get away with exposing our little girl time? Like we'd would just let it pass. You can't have your cake and eat it too. But...You can lick the icing off.\" And with that, Cornflower slowly lowers her rank feet onto Mathias' face. Mathias feels wholly violated. But He fears that this is just the beggining. Corny's warm dirty feet just rest on his face at first. He holds his breath for about a half minute. Before breathing in and nearly gagging. Cornflower loves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Cornflower. I-I-I wasn't gonna tell anyone! Honest!\" He beggs. Cornflower doesnt beleive him for a second. She begins to move her left footpaw over his mouth. As he feels the filthy flesh against his lips he does all he can to keep them as closed as possible. Ivy intervenes at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now. Be a good boy and take your punishment. If not then I might just include you in my next knive act. And we would want that now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMathias' eyes widen and he slowly relaxes his mouth. Cornflower inserts her toes in the defeated mouse's mouth and rubs her other foot against his cheek. Ivy pulls up a chair opposite of cornflower so they are facing each other with poor Mathias in the center. A pair of feet to each side of him. Ivy's dirty feet begin to molest his nose and forehead and he finds it especially sickening when she wiggles her toes around his soft round ears. Which he pays special attention to when bathing. Mathias can't believe what's happening and begins to feel remorse for his gossipy ways. Surely not the ways of a proud warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornflower and Ivy rub their tired feet all over his face as he just accepts it. Ivy pinches his nose and ears between her toes and Corny rubs her soles against his mouth and lower face. His fur and even the skin under it starting to take in the dirt and sweat. The four feet of the mousemaids transferring their hard labors to this poor males face. Ivy is loving it but Cornflower wants more. She places her left foot on his neck. Slowly applying pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to the male to not put any effort in. I want you to kiss my paws. And you'd better if you know whats good for you.\" Mathias hessitates for only a second before planting a light kiss on her sole. Then another. And so on. Each kiss progressively gets wetter and wetter. Cornflower grins evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. Lick. Lick our feet clean.\" Mathias forces himself to comply and opens his mouth. Before he can even stick his tongue out, he finds four filthy mouse paws fighting for dominance. At first they fight for his attention. But eventually get in a groove and share him. Mathias licks against the ball of Wild Ivy's foot as the the dirt slowly turns into a sour mud for him to swallow down. He isn't allowed a seconds respite from the two girl and licking their feet takes forever. By the time Ivy's feet are a light gray, Cornflower takes her turn again and Mathias is given a fresh pair of overworked abbey-feet. Mathias' eyes water and he lets out a moan. Ivy decides to give the poor boy a break. She takes her feet, which are still dirty but not nearly as much. and begins to stroke Matthias' soft member. The boy shudders and moans into Corny's feet. Ivy grinds her dirty paw into his penis until it hardens and then begins to pump it with both of her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornflower is in heaven getting her nasty feet worshipped by her sweetheart and giggles as his tongue rubs firmly from her heel to between her big and second toe. Mathias, however is getting really sick of the vile taste and worse the dirty, muddy texture in his mouth. Cornflowers feet taste like ranch dressing and pickles. But Ivy's workings are divine! Mathias tries to hump but is limited by his bindings. Eliciting giggles from the two girls. Ivy begins to work his tip with her toes. And the effect starts to really get to him. Instead of distastefully licking against his will he is making out with Cornflower's feet with abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. I think he's starting to like it. Keep it up.\" Corny says to Ivy. Ivy gives the \"OK\" hand-symbol but just as soon, Mathias Blows his load all over her feet. She scoots her chair back to face level snd is about to plant her dirty, cummy, feet on mathias' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Cornflower shouts. Both Mathias and Ivy look at her. Ivy, a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Corny. You had him this whole time.\" Cornflower looks embarrased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it....I was hoping I could try.\" She says, blushing. Ivy is taken aback but quickly smiles and nimbly lifts her feet to Cornflower's face. Cornflower blushes and stares at the dirt and cum. She gulps and then holds Ivy's foot in her hands. She slowly brings her tongue out and sensually licks her lovers cum off of her friends dirty foot. Cornlower's lust is at a boiling point, Ivy reclines and enjoys this surprise, and Mathias enjoys the show from between Cornflowers toes. Cornflower moans and lavishes Ivy's pretty feet and almost with Mathias never got to lick them before her. She plants loving, feminine kisses on her soles and finishes by licking her toes and all the flesh around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy and Cornflower plant there feet on Mathias' face again. Ivy wiggles her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he's learned his lesson, Corny?\"  </span></div></div>",

She gets out of her char and looms over him. Mathias' eyes widen with fear as Ivy produces a small knife from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I cut these ropes, will you be a good boy for us?\" Ivy asks him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am!\" Mathias nods his head furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I wanted to hear.\" Ivy carefully severs Mathias' bondings. Mathias starts to get up but Ivy pushes his chest back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now. I just wanted to let you get a bit more comfortable. We're not done having fun yet. Cornflower licks her lips and gives him a sexy stare. Ivy looks a bit unsure but the two of them walk around to his feet and kneel down. As they each take a paw in their hands Cornflower's arousal radiates stronger and stronger and poor Ivy's grimace looks more and more sour. Like the two maidens. Mathias has no problems with hygene. But his feet are always exposed. Be they in sandals or nothing at all. Both maidens stare at their respective sole and gase upon the black dirt. Mathias' dick begins to harden despite his recent orgasm. Cornflowers salivates so much that she is literally drooling. Ivy gives her a funny look and then gulps. Corny takes a long, slow, wet lick from his heel to his arch. She pauses without removing her tongue from his sole to inhale deeply before dragging her tongue up the his foot and between two toes, finishing the lick. Ivy gasps as Cornflower produces so much spit that the dry dirt of Mathias feet turns to a sweaty mud that fills Corny's mouth and runs down her lips. Cornflower savors the vile substance for a few seconds then gulps the mouthful down. She wipes her mouth with her forearm and sniffs at it. Ivy can't beleive a female anything would enjoy doing such a thing. Corny's eyes fall upon Ivy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Aren't you gonna dig in?\" She askes matter-of-factly. Ivy sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess.\" She says. Clearly disgusted with Cornflower and herself. Her nose wrinkles as she stares at mathias' wiggling toes. Like a dibbun giving away her favorite possesion, Ivy slowly draws her tongue out of her mouth and lets the tip of it brush against his smelly sole. Mathias giggles and Ivy gags. Cornflowe takes Mathias toes out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? woman needs to serve a man just as much as he serves her. But I guess a little circus girl is too imature to know what a relationship is.\" She says, shrugging. Ivy glowers as Cornflower who merely returns to passionatly worshipping the males foot. Ivy winces at each audible slurp but was hurt by what Cornflower said. She musters her willpower and takes hold of his foot once more. Mathias grins at this and soon is enjoying the feel of two soft wet mouse-tongues on the bottoms of his feet. Cornflower is still loving every second of it and Ivy is now at least putting in decent effort. Gagging and moaning aside. Cornflow swallows every drop of the spit and footgrime mud that she produces and is unsurprisingly the first to finish. She looks over at poor Ivy struggling to do a comparable job. Ivy gags at a particularly nasty helping of toejam when she feels Cornflower's hand on her shoulder. Ivy looks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Ivy. Maybe I was wrong about you. Why don't you let me finish up with that foot. There's something else that needs your attention.\" Cornflower points at Mathias' raging erection. Ivy gives Corny a grateful nod and licks her lips. She prowls up to his boner like a panther and frees it from his tunic. Her mouth watering as much as Cornflowers was earlier. Ivy's lips hover over the straining tip of Mathias' mouse tower and she licks againts his slit, scooping up the bit of pre leaking out. She then starts to kiss the shaft of his rod as she inhales his masculine scent. this is much more pleasent to her than his nasty feet. Ivy nuzzles his crotch and plants playful kisses on his scrotum. She avoids his tip for now in order to prolong their little session. With no input from Ivy, Cornflower also stops her passionate licking in favor of a more cozy snuggle again his still dirty sole. Rubbing it against her cheek and sniffing her lover's scent. The scene is suddenly a whole lot more peaceful as Mathias reclines on his back with his head resting on his arms. And with one young maiden's face buried between his thighs and another laying on her back with his foot resting on her face. Just like both of the girls' feet were on his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are all fine with this for a few minutes until Cornflower takes hold of his foot by the ankle and begins to lazily lick the rest of the dirt and sweat away. Ivy takes his dick in her lips like a dog with a bone and bobs her head from side to side. Then Ivy gets up. Mathias is confused at first but Ivy makes it painfully clear what she intends as she straddles his hips with her own. Ivy never intended to suck him off. She was just lubing him up. She grabs his cock in her hand and gives it a nice firm squeeze. She then sets the peices in place and slides on in. The feeling of entering Ivys sweet pussy is incredable and Mathias moans out in delight. Ivy is also loving every second of it and slowly increases the tempo of her riding. Cornflower is having a tough time keeping hold of his foot and sadly gives it up. She looks up at the two bucking, moaning rodents and doesn't feel jelouse of Ivy at all. Cornflower will have a whole lifetime with her sweetheart. Ivy's fate however lies on the road. But Corny does not intend to be completly left out. She crawls over and brings her face straight to the point of action. The joining neither regions of her lover and their friend. Eager to explore more of their tastes, Corny extends her tongue and laps at Mathias' ball. Mathias gasps at this and moans at the feeling. As Ivy's riding becomes more fervent. Cornflower licks all along his groin. Even going so far as to lick down underneath his ball and the crack of his ass. She give a hell of a rimjob for a while until moving up to explore Ivy some more. Corny's tongue glides back along Mathias' scrotum, Up his shaft, and for fleeting moment Ivy can feel a sharp pleasure as Corny's sweet sweet tongue graced her pink ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ivy and Mathias Near their peak Cornflower licks lovingly along her inner thighs and her cute, exposed taint. Finally Corny could sense the big moment. She grabs hold of Ivy's firm ass and dives her tongue right into the little ring! Ivy's scream could shatter glass as all the energy of her orgasms transfers to one hell of a clampdown on the mouse boy's member! He screams and erupts inside of her. The collapse like dominoes in a heap. All breathing hard. Cum dribbles down Wild Ivy's thighs and Cornflower weakly musters the energy to lick it up.</span></div></div>",

She brought her mouth close to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was under the impression that you were on gaurd duty. What are we to do with naughty bunnies. Cornflower. We need to punish this little disgression.\" Cornflower grins and helps ivy tie the poor rabbits feet to the bed. With his arms and legs tied to the bedpost and his mouth gagged, he is helpless as a baby and just how ivy likes her men. Basil struggles until Ivy's paws reach for his belt. She strokes his crotchs as the unfastens his belt and pulls down his pants. Her tongue strokes his member and licks along the flacid shaft.

So what should we do in the meantime?\" Cornflower asks, sliding up to Ivy and running her dainty hands across her chest. Ivy moans. Cornflower lets out a small giggle as she moves in to kiss Ivy. The two start snogging again, tongues sliding into each others mouths. Cornflower lets out a loud groan as she feels Ivy's hands start to caress her wet pussy. Ivy lets out a similar moan, as cornflower does the same. Cornflower squeals as she cums all over Ivy's hand. Ivy brings her hand up to her mouth and licks off a bit, before offering it to Cornflower. Cornflower lets out a low moan as she tastes her own juices. Then Basil walks back in.<br>\r\n\"Well, that was quick!\" Ivy remarks.<br>\r\n\"Champion runner you know!

Basil starts to laugh and moan at the feeling of Cornflower's tongue sliding over his sole, then moans louder as Cornflower starts to suck on his extremely sweaty toes. The taste is horrible, yet strangely Cornflower was enjoying the mixture of cheese and footsweat. Ivy begins to feel left out and decides to see what the fuss is all about. Getting onto all fours behind Cornflower, Ivy takes a sniff of the mouse's feet. They smell quite sweet, which suprises Ivy. Ivy licks Cornflower's sole and sighs, Cornflower's feet taste so sweet. Cornflower starts letting out small moans as she feels Ivy's soft wet tongue sliding over her feet.The three of them are in foot heaven then ivy decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cornflower sucks on Basil's toes as Ivy snuggles against his body. She tells him to bring a few buddies over for some more fun. Basil nods. Too exhausted to talk. The next day Ivy lays on her bed and hears a knock on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" She says sweetly. Basil walks in, blushing. Following him are a female otter, a male badger, and a male mole. Ivy smiles. \"Ohhh a girly otter. I'm surprised. and who else do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This pretty lass is Winifred. The Badger's name is Brock and the mole is Les. We like to play cards and talk about battles....and sometimes play games and whatnot.\" Basil says with a big grin on his face. Winifred approaches Ivy. She runs her dainty finger along Ivy's chest. Getting a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a pretty one, Basil. Let me warm her up.\" Winifred turns to Ivy. She moves her face down to the mouse's crotch. \"Say Cuteypie. How about I warm you up for for my big badger friend over there? Would you like that?\" Winifred asks. Ivy nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that very much.\" The young Otter begins to rub her nose against her slit. Very gently, teasing her. Only until the mouse begins to moan and buck does the otter begin to lick along the gorgeous opening. The males all become hard as they watch. Winifred increases her the speed and passion for only a minute before withdrawing. She points to Brock, sitting on a chair. baring the biggest boner Ivy's ever seen! Ivy's face has a funny mix of arousal and shock. She follows Winifred's gentle tugs and is guided to the badger's embrace. His hulking arms encircle him and he feels her hindquarters. Ivy inhales and takes in the badger's scent. She gives his cock a few licks then he lifts her in the air. He lines slot a with extension b and firmly pulls her down on him. Ivy feels just a little pain as she is stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took the whole thing! Never thought a mouse could pull that off. Winifred says. She lays on her back and calls for the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys. I'm lonely! Keep me company?\" She says playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"with pleasure!\" They say. Basil gets on the bed and aligns himself with her pussy. He slowly enters her as Les presents himself to the otter. She takes him in her mouth and begins to suck him off, hard. Basil thrusts slowly, wanting to make it last. But poor Les really doesn't have a say in the matter as Winifred's tongue dances wildly all over his member. Her slurps audible and wet. Basil bucks hard and steady but poor Les came quick. He breath hard and \"scolds\" the otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that's not fair Winny. You know I can't hold up when you do it so well!\" He says. Winnifred has this planned, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm gonna have to punish you! And since i can't swat you right now. I guess I'll have to make you lick my smelly feet!\" He gets up on the bed and sits by her. Winny opens her mouth as Les rubs his feet in it, on her nose, and all over her face. The sight of the otter licking the mole soles is giving and extra push to the two males as they fuck their partners. Ivy wrinkles her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! you too? What IS the appeal her\" She says between panting. The young mouse is lifted up and down the badgers massive shaft and is really wearing her down. But the tight passage is taking its toll on the massive beast too. Brock gets up and sets Ivy on the ground. This allows him to put his weight into fucking the poor mouse. Ivy screams in pleasure and pain. Her cheek smooshed against the floor. The buildup finally gets to the badger and he stifles a roar. He explodes into her as she implodes on him. The powerful orgasm leaving a lasting affect on both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasil is reaching his limit and Winifred is running out of sweat. Her taste buds savoring the flavor. The rabbit moans and cums hard into her. Ivy gets up and motions Winny to her. She presents her stretched pussy to the otter who gets the hint and licks up all the cum from the mouse's pussy. She swallows some then moves to the badger. He expects a blowjob but she instead goes for his large left foot. She lovingly slurps more dirt and sweat from the the badgers sole as Ivy brings Les to the bed. She proceeds to ride him like she did Basil the day before. As she does, the hare decides to take her ass. Ivy gasps as she is penetrated but enjoys the feeling of being so full. The two beasts take Ivy for all she's worth as Winifred licks between Brock's toes. Enjoying her second helping of toejam. After cleaning his second foot, she looks up. Both Basil and Les cum hard. Winny eats their cum from both of Ivy's hole. Ivy loudly and enthusiastically approves. The five of the rest, getting ready for their next act. Ivy gets up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get the whole feet thing. But I'm not without my...acquired tastes. And after coming so much the four of you must be ready to give a poor mouse something to drink!\" Ivy kneels in front of the badger first and aims his flaccid member towards her mouth. he wastes no time and pees right in it. The circus-mouse moans as she drinks down the bitter golder liquid. Les is next. giving less but a stronger substance. Winnifred is next and is somehere in the middle. Finally Basil takes his turn. He shoots the darkest foulest piss Ivy has ever tasted. She almost gags but takes it under control and drinks every putrid drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sir need to lay off the strawberry cordial!\" She jokingly teases. Basil blushes. They sit and rest for a few minutes but soon hear heavy footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turns and in comes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tMagdeline Stoutpaw was a young otter who has seen better days. Half a month ago. Her tiny beach side home was ransacked without warning by a group of vile corsairs. Her parents, and older siblings fought valiantly. While the eight-year-old Maggy was ordered to hide in the cellar. It was all for naught, as by the time she was dragged out by a burly stoat, her family was nowhere to be seen. She had prayed that they had gotten away safely. But she knew they wouldn't have abandoned her. She could only take solace in the fact that she didn't see any corpses as she was taken from her home. She had then spent a miserable two weeks in the hull of a nasty corsair ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaggy had almost consigned herself to her fate when she was knocked from her tiny cot. It took her a minute to come to her senses and realize that the ship has been rammed. Several of the pirate crew could be heard screaming and swearing. As she got back to her feet, she could hear loud footsteps storming the deck of the ship. It was being boarded. Maggy allowed herself a brief hope that they were otters or other good beasts taking the fight to the vermin pirates. But even at a young age, she knew that was unlikely. Good beasts dont go looking for a fight. This was vermin preying on their own kind. What was probably about an hour felt like an eternity as Maggy listened to the carnage above. Finally, things quieted down. She heard footsteps and voices. One of them was particularly forceful. A captain giving orders, she assumed. Maggy knew it was only a matter of time before they came down below to loot. They would take her to sell, themselves. She thought. A trio of rats made their way down the crude ramp and started to ransack the place. It wasn't long before one of them set eyes upon the young otter and pipped his head. The three rats huddled together briefly before one of them scurried back up. Maggy could hear the rat's footsteps followed by the heavy pounding of boots. The rat returned with rather large fox. The fox was relatively well dressed. It was clear who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"She'd fetch quite the price, Cap'n.\" One of the rats said. The fox nodded.<br>\r\n\t\"Aye. That she would. But we have our own business to tend to. And the cost of feedin' her wouldn't even be worth it. Leave her. Get all the provisions and valuables back to our ship!\" The captain ordered. Not even making eye contact with the little otter. Maggy's blood ran cold. They were just going to leave her to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wait!\" She called out desperately. The captain stopped and turned around to face her.<br>\r\n\t\"Please, don't leave me here!\" She begged. Usually a fruitless endevor with vermin. The fox shrugged and smirked.<br>\r\n\t\"Sorry, lass. We've better things to do than deal in living beasts. You're not worth selling. And if we have no use for you, we're not taking you.\" The captain said calmly. Maggy began to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I-I could work. I can cook, and clean, a-and even sew!\" she said. The captain stroked the scruff of his chin. He motioned to the three rats, and they all huddled together. Conversing quietly. Maggy watched them intently as they whispered. Every few seconds, one of them would look over towards her and giggle.<br>\r\n\t\"Cap'n! She's just a pup!\" One of the rats said in obviously fake protest. A few seconds later, one of the rats went up to the deck while the fox aproached the otter. Maggy didn't like the way he smiled at her. She instinctively backed away as the vermin captain unsheathed a dagger and easily pried off the flimsy lock from her cage. Instead of coming in or pulling her out, he then backed away to a bench against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Alright, girly. You want in on my crew? Come closer and start convincin'!\" He said. The otter nervously aproached the fox. As she took slow deliberate steps, the fox did something strange. He brought his foot over his other thigh and prided his heavy boot from his foot. He then did the other. Even from a few feet away, the stink of his freshly-freed paws hit the poor girl like a brick to the face. Maggy didn't like where this was going, but she took the last few steps until she was right in front of his. The young otter looked at the fox and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Now kneel.\" The fox commanded. Maggy complied. The pirate captain didn't waste any time plopping one of his huge paws right onto her lap. Maggie's mouth scrunched up and she whimpered. His sole took nearly all of her vision. With the heel resting on her lap, his toes reached well above the tip of her scalp. While her eyes got a nice look at the filthy ball of his foot. Not to mention her nose being less than an inch away from it's surface. As she sucked in the stink of his massive paw, Maggie became very scared and very disgusted. The fox didn't say anything for about a minute. Savoring the look on the otter's face as he peeked from behind his foot. Poor Maggie could only sit there in silence as she tried not to gag at the sour stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Grab a hold of my foot. Use both hands, now.\" The fox ordered. Maggy reluctantly complied. getting a grip of the sides of his foot with both paws. her thumbs pressed against his sole. She could feel the warm, most film of sweat on her hands now. gritty from the dirt covering his sole.<br>\r\n\t\"Good girl! Now... Give me paw a kiss.\" He said. Maggy grimaced, but knowing the stakes, she hardly hesitated and planted a quick peck right on his foot. The feeling his dirty sweat on her lips was almost too much to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Again. Harder this time.\" Maggy give his foot another quick kiss, putting a bit more force into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Harder!\" He said. Maggy kissed his foot harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Harder!\" He said. Maggy whimpered and gave an even harder kiss. pressing her lips firmly against the ball of his foot for a full second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Harder, or I'll leave you in that cage!\" He yelled. Maggy yelped and pulled his foot into her face as hard as she could. For a full ten seconds, the little otter smooched the fox's foot. Even opening her mouth a little bit, making the poor thing wince at the little bit of taste that entered her mouth. Finally, the nudged her away. Maggy gasped and breathed heavily. Sucking in the slightly cleaner air, now that his foot was inches away from her face instead of pressed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Now that the formality's out of the way, we can start!\" The fox said cheerfully. Maggy recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wha?\" She said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Alright, girly! I want you to lick my feet totally clean. And I wanna see some gusto! In fact, if my paws aren't completely clean by the time me first mate comes back, we're leaving ya! So get to it!\" The fox said. One look into his eyes told her that he was serious. Maggy immediately grabbed a hold of his foot and started to lap at his foot like her life depended on it. Since it did. The fox watched smugly as the little otter licked as hard and as fast as she could against his nasty sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Don't you spit, now!\" He said. Maggy retched and whimpered. But she forced herself to swallow the cheesy mud in her mouth. His foot was huge to the little girl. But her desperation saw her through as the clean portion of the surface of his sole overtook the dirty area. The fox's toes sapped her of her momentum, though. And she gagged a bit when he started shoving them into her little muzzle. After the poor otter literally chewed a mouthful of toe jam and swallowed it, she got to work on his other foot. The fox put his hand by his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Uh oh! I hear footsteps. Better hurry!\" He said. Maggy whined and licked even faster. The fox enjoyed the firm and rapid licks that the otter pressed onto his nasty footpaw. The captain merely slumped down and relaxed. Savoring the heavenly feeling of a little otter girl's tastebuds furiously scrubbing his grubby soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA few minutes later, the first mate returned with a small book. Right as Magdaline was chomping through her second helping of toe jam. Her scrunched up look of pure disgust was the icing on the cake to the wicked fox. Maggy chewed up the fox's concentrated foot filth until the flavor saturated her saliva and she swallowed the horrid concoction. Maggie looked up at the fox hopefully. He applauded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well done, girly! Now, we only have to discuss the terms of your position. He takes the book from the rat, opens it, and shows it to her. the pages have gridded lines with numbers on them. Some of the boxes appeared to have red \"x\" marks on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Do ya know what this is, Lassie?\" The fox asked. Maggie shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tis a calendar. Educated beasts use it to track the days and the seasons. We're going to use it to mark your... duties. Today is October seventeenth. It doesn't have an x on it, see?\" The fox said, pointing at the current day's box. Maggy nodded. The fox continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Every day that doesn't have an x on it, you will be fed a nice, nutricious breakfast, and a tasty lunch, but for supper, you'll service the feet of a few of us, like you just did to me.\" he said. Maggy's eyes widened and teared up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This column of x's is every monday. Every monday, you will have nothing but our feet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Likewise, one the first mondey, tuesday, and wednesday of every month, you will have nothing but our feet for your meals.\" He said. Maggy's lip began to tremble as the captain continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But on the first sunday to saturday of March, September, and December, you will spend a week eating nothing but the scum from our feet. Finally, you'll spend the entire month of July living off of our smelly soles. Any questions?\" He asked smugly. Maggy was on the verge of colapse. As awful as her future looked, she could endure and hope for rescue. Even the week-long abuses seemed survivable, but a whole month? She'd starve! But Maggy knew she had no choice and hung her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No, sir.\" She said. The fox clapped his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Excellent! Welcome to the crew- Uh...\" The fox said until stopping. He never got her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Maggy, sir.\" The crestfallen little otter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ay! And ye can call me Captain Klauser!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAfter Maggie\u2019s \u201cjob interview\u201d, she was brought aboard Klauser\u2019s ship, the Stormvixen. In the evening light, she could see a surprisingly well made painting of a fox lady posing lewdly. The paint was faded and chipping away. As expected on the hull of a seafaring vessel. The crew probably repainted it frequently. That was about all the time that Maggie had for idle thought as she was hurried along onto the second ship. The crew finished taking anything of value and then her original captors\u2019 ship was dislodged and sent adrift. Their corpses still littered above and below the deck. Good riddance. Maggy thought with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaggy couldn\u2019t shake the uncomfortable feeling of being leered at by the crew. Various rats, weasels, ferrets, stoats, and foxes. All working up a sweat moving and sorting through the goods and valuables that were looted from the other ship. Maggy whined quitely to herself. She was tossed into a slightly nicer brig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaggy took a long time to fall asleep. But it did eventually come to her. And when she woke up, there was a hot bowl of porridge waiting for her. Having been so poorly fed by her original captors, and having fox feet for dinner left Maggie more famished than she realized. She was surprised at how good the food was. Coming from a vermin pirate ship. Or maybe she was just that hungry. Klauser put her to work doing simple tasks. Cleaning and the like. After a few hours, she was given a piece of dried fish and some surprisingly well kept bread. She was scared at first, but the crew mostly kept clear of her. The few that interacted with her greeted her courteously enough or just giggled at her. Maggy didn\u2019t like that. It reminded her of her dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evening drew closer, Maggy had almost finished swabbing the deck. She was lost in thought when she suddenly was shoved off of her feet. She was on her back, and before she could process what had happened to her, a massive paw planted itself on her chest. Maggy gasped hard as the air was squeezed out of her. The grubby paw was attached to the trunk-like leg of a massive, golden stoat. The weight would have been unbearable had he stood on her for any more than a second, but the stoat had stepped on her like she wasn\u2019t even there and then kept walking on his way. He only turned back to give her a wicked, coy smile as she fumed at him. More for tracking a clear set of dirty footprints on her just-cleaned deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNot much later, a rat appeared and summoned her below deck. Maggie gulped and followed the rat down the stairs. She felt a pit in her stomach as the entire crew was sitting at a few tables waiting for her. They cheered at her arrival. She saw five medium-ish tables surrounding a small table. The slightly larger tables each sat about a dozen vermin, while the small one sat four. Next to the small table was another chair with a footstool in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Maggie made it down the stairs, Klauser cheerfully took her by the hand and led her to the chair. As she got closer to the sall table, she recognized the light-furred stoat that stepped on her earlier. The stoat said nothing. He simply got up, stretched and sat down into the chair in front of the stool. He placed his massive footpaws onto the stool and it was obvious that this was Maggie\u2019s dinner for the evening. Or at least part of it. Maggie looked at the soles in terror. They were bigger than Klauser\u2019s. Bigger, and they smelled way worse. She could smell them clearly where she was standing, about five feet away. Maggie wanted to steel her nerves. But she didn\u2019t get much of a chance when Klauser grabbed her by the shoulders and forcefully guided her into a kneeling position at the Stoat\u2019s feet. The little otter didn\u2019t even get a chance to whimper as the pirate captain grabbed the back of her head and forced her nose into the soft, pliable flesh of the stoat\u2019s nasty sole. Maggie\u2019s squeal was drowned out in her own head by the laughter and cat calls directed at her. The burly stoat exhaled slowly in pleasure as the cub\u2019s snout prodded up and down his broad sole. Klauser took his time grinding Maggie\u2019s face into her meal, but finally let go after another couple of minutes. Maggie coughed and tried to catch her breath. Klauser chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, girly. Couldn\u2019t help me-self from having a little fun. Are ye ready for dinner?\u201d He asked with a slightly unsettling, toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yes sir.\u201d Maggie said. Mustering the willpower to remain obedient. Maggy directed her gaze to the mammoth feet in front of her. Her muzzle opened slowly and her tongue made a firm contact with the black skin of the stoat\u2019s paw pad. Her little tongue collected more of the film of grime. Her whole body shuddered at the powerful taste of footsweat from the unwashed vermin. It took her five seconds to firmly lick just as many inches up his massive sole. She then drew the collected filth into her mouth and paused. It tasted so sour and she had to breath in the strong stink of his feet through her nose. Still, the thought of swallowing what was in her mouth was tough to get over. As Maggy\u2019s eyes began to water, Klauser rubbed her back. Maggy swallowed her mouthful of foot grime like it was a spoonful of nasty medicine. The powerful taste remained in her mouth as Maggie breathed heavily. Klauser allowed this for a few seconds before scowling and pressing her face into the foot, once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t lose your nerve now! I\u2019m goin\u2019 outta me\u2019 way to supervise yer first night. But the stank is startin\u2019 to make me feel light in the head!\u201d Klauser said. Maggy whimpered, but she took another firm lick. Her first lick left a line of clean sole where the layer of filth had been erased away. She placed her tongue on his heel, right next to the clean line and licked upwards. Plowing up the scum with her taste buds and doubling the width of the clean spot on his sole. Try as she might, poor Maggie just couldn\u2019t ignore the sharp, cheesy taste saturating her mouth. The little otter looked on with despair at the foot in her face. The stoat\u2019s massive sole had a border down the middle. Half clean, and half filthy. Maggie whimpered and after another six long licks, the stoat\u2019s foot was clean. This meant six more mouthfuls of sweaty filth went down her throat into her stomach. Which began to gently rumble. It rumbled much harder once maggy finished the second foot. As she chewed a rather large mouthful of firm, warm toejam. She gazed upon the stoat\u2019s two clean foot paws. Now glistening with her saliva. Maggie\u2019s face took on a slightly green hue when she was grabbed by the shoulders and led to the small table nearby. The half-delirious little girl passingly heard the word dessert along with a hearty chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKlauser gently pushed the little otter onto the floor. He flipped her on her back and shoved her underneath the table. Maggie could see where this was going and the poor thing was immediately assaulted by four pairs or grimy vermin feet. Maggy spent the rest of the night smothered by the rank paws of two rats, a ferret, and Klauser himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to lick all of em, girly. You\u2019ll be choosing to soon enough! Jus enjoy yerself tonight! Heh-heh.\u201d She heard the captain say. Maggy found her little head completely entombed by the eight smelly feet. All of them grinding against her face and scalp. Tugging at her ears. Twisting against her nose like they were putting out a cigarette. And forcing their toes into her unwilling mouth. Maggy didn\u2019t fight it. And eventually even starting licking at the soles. Deciding that she preferred the filth in her stomach over rubbing against her poor face perpetually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter dinner, there was a particularly lively bout of singing. And her four tormentors took to stomping their feet along with the beat. They took care to not truly hurt her. But she spent a good hour or so being battered and tumbled around the huge footpaws around her. When the singing finally halted. And all the vermin crew members began to turn in. Little maggie was taken to Klauser\u2019s cot. Where her head was placed at his feet. The eight year old otter occasionally coughed up a little bit of foot dirt. But she ultimately slept soundly with two massive fox feet pressed firmly into her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Janus and Adam rubbing into her cheeks and noes. Never harshly in her eyes but sometimes they like to block out her vision with their soles.

She opens her eyes and sees that she's in a wooden room in a ship. She begins to panic. but Janus walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Sunshine!\" He says. He plops down on a crate and splays his toes in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for breakfast!\" He says cheerfully. Moira looks at his dirty paws, toes wiggling. Her mouth starts to water and she almost lets herself at them. But she shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janus! I never went home last night. My father's gonna kill me!\" She says, upset about her situation. But Janus waves his hand and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. We planned that out.You see Your papa and my old man go way back. And after telling him about you in great detail. He said he wouldn't mind telling a white lie to his old chum. He'll just say that we 'ad a wounded dibbun who needed your attention. And no peaceful mossflowerer would turn her head to that.\" Moira's blood runs cold. He told his father. AND his father knew her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you relly told him-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything!\" he cuts her off. \"But don't worry. He always say that theres nothing wrong with a young beast being a little promiscuous.\" Moira can't beleive he'd be so free with his family. She didn't beleive that a friend of her father's would do something like that. Janus slowly inched his foot closer to her face as if to remind her of her chore. Moira sighs and grabs the foot with both hands and brings it to her face. Her mouth is half open as it makes contact with his dirty sole sealing her lips against it so she can make out with his foot before she really works towards cleaning it. Inside her mouth, her tongue dances over the flesh she has currently adjacent to her lips. Janus moans as he feels her tongue brush aside the dirt and glide firmly againt his smelly footpaw. Moira's eyes are closed as she enjoys the kinky pleasure she receives from this act. She plants several kisses. slowly moving from one side of his foot to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY JANUS! Skipper says come down for breakfast and bring your friend.\" Moira's eyes shoot open in shock as she sees a young, lean otter boy looking at Janus. The boy's gaze quickly fall upon the hog'maid whose lips are locked against his brother's foot. His eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah. It's true!? Wow I can't beleive anyone would actually like Smelly otter feet!. Hey do you actual-OWWW!\" Janus throws a small apple at his little brother's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Apollo, Jeez.\" He says in an annoyed tone. Moira is blushing furiously. Janus grins and quickly gets to his feet. effectivly negating most of Moira's work. He looks down at the embarassed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's eat.\" He grabs Moira's arm and drags her down to a large main room. There are a couple dozen otters sitting at tables, all loudly eating and talking. A lot of them look up at Moira and judging by their leers and grins, they've been told everything. Some of the females look at her with disgust. Others pity. Others still look at her with the same amused desire as the males. Janus drags her to a couple of emply seats. Moira, face beet-red. scans the small table and notices Scott and Adam, little Apollo, A pair of females who seem about Janus' age, a tall male, and an older male otter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must me Moira! You were the size of this loaf of bread the last time I saw you.\" He says with a huge grin. Moira, whose face feels like its on fire from the emarassment. She sits down and Janus fixes her a plate of a sort of fish and vegatable stir fry. It is very spicy and Moira found herself drinking a ton of water. Janus' father laughes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha. Good thinking girl. You'll need your mouth wet when you do all of our paws. Moira nearly chokes. Janus chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I forgot to mention. Skipper only agreed to cover for you if you licked the paws of our entire clan. I told him you would of course.\" He says, beaming. Moira glares at him but she feels her neck burn and realizes that all eyes are upon her. Skipper bellows again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be mad. Hell.\" He lifts up his large dirty paws and places them right on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't knock em til you try em.\" Moira's stomach is in a knot. Every otter looking to see if she'll actually lick his feet. Moira gulps but then thinks of her angry father. She feels a pang of guilt about making them worry and realises that this is the best option. And the older otter was kind of handsome. She takes another look at his grimy soles. The black pads are pretty dirty and seem moist from the sweat accumulated from the previous nights sleep. The pads look soft and she can practically feel the warmth eminating from them. Moira is unsure if her arrousal is stronger than her pride but once again the thought of her upset family pushes her forward and she slowly places her hands on the skippers feet. Still resting on the rest of her stir fry. The sauce was already tangy and vinigary so Moira thinks that it will compliment his soles well. Skipper wiggles his webbed toes impatiantly. Moira sighs to herself and brings her face to his right foot. She draws a long sloppy lick from his heel to his toes and is met with cheers along with a few gags.Although part of her is still disgusted she continues to lick the skipper's large smelly sole. With each lick the dirt coats her tongue and she has to salivate some to swallow it and continue. Skipper merely reclines and enjoys the sensation of his proud old friend's pretty daughter worshiping his filthy feet. As he looks down at the young girl slurp along the ball of his foot. He wishes he could tell the old bastard all about it. But he would never break a promise. (unlike his son) So he merly enjoys the feeling of her moist tongue. He begins to giggle as her tongue pushes againts the webbing of his toes. Cleaning them out better than they've been in a long time. Moira gives his right foot a parting kiss and switches to the left. His left foot has been planted flat onto her food and unlike his other, which was on the back of its heel. So this large meaty footpaw has been basting in the sauce and has softened up some as a result. Moira grabs hold of the foot and places her small nose on the crevace of his sole. She inhales as she licks. Vingary sauce, footsweat, and dirt gives it a very unique flavor. She decides that she likes it and passionatly licks the old otters foot. After another helping of toejam she exhales and finishes. Skipper, who enjoyed that very much wiggled his toes and got up. He scans the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright who's next?\" He shouts out and is meet with a thunderous cheer. Moira know that this was gonna be a long day. The Tall otter does an action dive from his seat to the next while all of the other form a semi-circle. around them. All wanting a veiw. One of the otters groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Bill come on. The poor thing is going to faint. When was the last time you took a bath anyway?\" The tall otter, Bill grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh Tuesday...Last tuesday.\" He chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get my turn before she passes out.\" Bill shrugs and places his feet on the plate. The smell hits poor moira like a sack of bricks. Bills feet are about the size of Skippers but a little longer. Moira reaches out to grab hold of his foot. The young flesh is soft but also much dirtier do to the hard work and battle training he does. Underneath the layer of grime she knows his feet must produce sweat at an accelerated pace. Although Moira grown to enjoy her task. These nasty feet are way too much. Moira whimpers and closes her eyes. the tip of her tongue barely scrapes againts his toes and she recoils back. Moira coughs. But recomposes herself. A lot of the otters giggle and make sport of it. Moira scowls and thinks of her father. Her shaking head draws close to Bill's feet and She inhales. Trying to get used to his powerful feet. The strong odor brings tears to her eyes but slowly the powerful scent fills her lungs and intoxicates her. Her scrunched frown becomes a silly grin and her second lick comes much easier. Bill's feet have a thick layer of sweaty grime and unlike the other she actually feels fuller as she worships his nasty feet. each time she licks an area for the firts time it's like licking the icing off of a cake. She swishes the foot frosting around her mouth each time and even chews at the muck. But when this icing is all in her belly, she's still not done. His actual soles still have heavily set in sweat and dirt and it takes some hard, dedicated licking to get them clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the table comes much easier after Bill's ghastly dogs. Janus places his soles in the plate and she can see the spot where she licked earlier is lighter and less dirty. Moira treats his feet with extra special care. Afterward Scott and Adam take extra time rubbing their feet into her food. She worships their saucy feet one by one and The two girls decide that they want in. They make her lie on the floor and take her face at the same time. Moira must lick and sniff four pretty otter feet and they are very dominant with her. Finally Apollo sits on the table and like all of the others rubs his feet into her stir fry. He smiles at her and blushes cutely. His young feet have a slight scent and less dirt but just enough to satisfy her. Plus they are just so soft and cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so poor Moira finishes just one of the several tables. Skipper calls for Artemis, an otter girl about the same size as Apollo. They must be twins, she thinks. She is pulled up by a pair of male otters to the next table and is placed on her back on the table. She is nervouse but very turned on as they pull up her skirt and begin to poke their noses around.She feels them sniff around at her crotch and her feet. Another male otter races his feet above her face and her tongue sticks out as far as it can go to meet them before they are planted on her face. The three otters at her feet and pussy lick around just a bit to get things wet for their big cocks. She gasps into a dirty paw as she is penetrated and she feels a cock rubbing against each of her dirty paws. Moira lavishes the otters smelly masculine feet. The sensation of getting fucked and licking feet begining to overwhelm her. The otter at her pussy fucks her hard and fast and before Moira realizes it she cums and screams into the foot. Another Male quickly takes her place at her pussy and as she finishes up with her current pair of feet. She looks over to the first table. Moira's eyes go wide at what she sees. Little Apollo is bent over the table getting fucked by Scott into Adam's feet. His little rump making the huge cock dissapear.He moans into the smelly foot of his older brother. And if that wasn't shocking enough The cute little Artemis is impaled on the Skippers cock. Moira can see the outline of his cock in her tummy. Janus takes advantage of her bobbing body and fucks the little girl's feet. This veiw renews Moira's arrousal and She worships several Otters and gets fucked by many more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day passed Moira figures that shes licked about three quarters of their feet. The scene had gone from a family breakfast to humiliating a young hedge'maid to a full out orgy. Moira, Artemis, and Apollo are placed on their hands and knees. They are like an assembly line of sex each taking males from behind while doing different things in the front. At first it was structured. Moira licks more feet. The cute boy Apollo sucks several males and females of. and poor Artemis is stuck giving them real releif. Moira's eyes widen once again as the preteen girl opens up and happily drinks a stream of piss from an older males flacid cock. And so for a while it continues like that. Moira keeps up with the feet but cant take her eyes off of the little girl taking several bladderfuls. She moans and blushes and smiles at her contributers. As the piss fills her mouth she swirls her tongue around and swallows contently. But eventually the unspoken rules become ignored and they switch around. Artemis happily licks the last few unclean feet. Her soft cheeks blushing even redder than before as she is given her first meal of footsweat. Aparently she's been a little cumdumpster and toilet for some time now but feet are something new. Moira feels odd about introducing a new fetish to such a youg girl. But her veiw is cut off by a waist and the rigid cock in front of it. After Her large footy meal this sweaty cock is like an odd dessert and she sucks him vigorously. Apollo gets a muzzleful of piss. He doesn't seem to enjoy it very much but keeps at it. This again goes on for a while. Artemis is loving this new kink and practically gobbles up any foot grime she can get her hands on. But poor Apollo starts to gag so they switch again. And the orgy ends with Apollo tasting Bill's feet, which have already gotten real sweaty again. His little hole taking Janus. Artemis expertly sucks off a male while taking one in each hole. Moira is fed a bladderful of piss which she chokes out when the Skipper penetrates her. His huge cock strechtes her wide and she can't imagine how artemis could handle it. Moira's moans are now gargled into more streams of urine. As the group loses stream and all of the feet have been worshiped clean. piss was all that was left and all three of the little subs were getting hosed while still getting huge mouthfuls of it. Full bellies forced to take just that little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
