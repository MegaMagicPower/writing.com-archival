It moves on all fours, is coated in blue flames, and has large flaming bat wings on it\u2019s back.\u201d She quickly utters before smiling at you. \u201cBang on, right? And I know you\u2019re going to ask how, so I\u2019ll say it simply. I can read thoughts and envisioned ideas like you can read a book. And....\u201d She cracks a warring smile, and her tone takes on a kind, yet warning vibe. \u201cIt\u2019s best not to question how exactly me or my master work. What we can do can\u2019t really be comprehended fully by mortal brains. It\u2019d make you go crazy, and well, you\u2019ll need all your wits about you where you\u2019re going.\u201d Fair, but......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy AM I a girl, though?\u201d You question, honestly confused at why you\u2019re now a female. Wait, where you a female before, though....? If you weren\u2019t then, you definitely are one now. Flare\u2019s expression changes slightly, and her cheeks take on a embarrassed tingle of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell....my master was a tiiiiny bit too late in taking you from the crash. He intended to pull you before you hit the ground, but his timing was off and.....well, your old body got badly messed up to the point where if he hadn\u2019t taken your soul and stuck it within a new body, you would have died. And this body was the only one he wasn\u2019t using.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the reason you\u2019re a girl is that this was the only spare body the Crimson Dragon had.......speaking of your new body, it\u2019s starting to feel less off.

Did I have a bad life or something?\u201d You inquire. \u201cWas I a subject of mass bullying? Dad or Mom beat me at a young age? Just unlucky?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare shook her head. \u201cNo, you had a good life, for what you lived. It\u2019s just...you can\u2019t go back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. Yeah. That. The whole \u2018my plane got shot down and the crash landing was fatal\u2019 thing. You do your best to put the thoughts of your past life at the back of your mind....for now, at least. Meanwhile, Flare snaps her fingers, and a Duel Monsters card forms in mid air, which she catches. \u201cHere you go.\u201d she says as she hands it you, revealing it to be Blue Flame Whirlwind Dragon. You take the card from her, and once you do, you feel a great power surge from it. \u201cThis card is as much a Signer Dragon as the other six are. That includes it being alive.....or rather, him. Take good care of him!\u201d Flare says, enthused. She goes to snap her fingers again, but suddenly, a powerful, urgent voice sounds out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLARE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlare stops suddenly and looks at furthest wall away from her. \u201cYes, master?\u201d she speaks just as the the face of the Crimson Dragon appears, projected onto the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI AM AFRAID THAT THE SITUATION HAS ESCALATED. THE NASCA LINES ARE FAILING FAST AND MORE EARTHBOUND IMMORTALS ARE ESCAPING.<br>\r\nWE MUST TAKE DRASTIC MEASURES. GIVE OUR GUEST \u2018THEM\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThem, master? Are you sure?\u201d Flare asks, suddenly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI AM SURE. HE WAS A FIGHTER PILOT IN HIS PAST LIFE, ALONG WITH A EXCELLENT DUELIST FOR THE TIME HE PLAYED. HE CAN HANDLE THE PREADTORS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d As Flare says that, the projection of the Crimson Dragon\u2019s face vanishes, and part of the wall slides up to reveal a sharp, jetlike Duel Disk, and a YuGiOh Deck. She motions for you to stand up and go get them. You get up, stumble due to your centre of gravity being off due to your new....missiles, and then carefully make your way over to the Duel Disk and deck. Once you get to them, you equip the Duel Disk, and picks up the deck and sift through the cards. Some of them are familiar, but most of them are new, mainly the monsters, a fair chunk of them jets that transform into super robots. Most notably, some of them have different colours then the browns, purple and white you know. Three are black, two are green, and one- a Stealth Bomber that transforms into a powerful, sleek super robot(it reminds you of Megatron, but he\u2019s a Tank...or a gun....)- is blue with eight arrows surrounding the card art, three of them coloured in red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen most of the cards before.....!\u201d You say, stunned. Flare responds rather seriously. \u201cThis deck holds the Preadtors. They were a fleet of powerful, cruel, transforming living super robots that attacked planets for fun. My master fought them in a fierce space fight, and beat them, sealing them away in those Duel Monster Cards as punishment. And the reason we\u2019re giving them to you? Well, we need their power, and my master thinks you can use them. Now....\u201d</span></div></div>",
