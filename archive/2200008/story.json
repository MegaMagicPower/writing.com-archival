What is this a fan-fic? <br>\r\nQuick rules:<br>\r\nKeep chapters brief to allow for quick reading before a choice, but not so short that it takes them out of the story.  1-3 paragraphs are Ideal.<br>\r\nDon\u2019t turn this into a sexual or fetish adventure, there\u2019s plenty of those interactives up and this is meant to be a break from that.<br>\r\nRomance is okay, but don\u2019t have Game Sonic pursue any relationships.<br>\r\nNever give only one option, atleast provide a \u201cSomething else\u201d option and try to use as many options as your account let\u2019s you use.<br>\r\nPlease don\u2019t write any sonic characters you aren\u2019t familiar with, it\u2019ll take fans out of it if Fleetway Sonic talks in nothing but British slang or if Bunnie Rabbot has no accent.<br>\r\nThat being said, your free to write someone if you think the story gave you a good idea of their personality.</td>",
