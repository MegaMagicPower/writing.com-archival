The two men sat on the porch looking at the grey horizon.  \u201cSo how long do you think the hills will burn?\u201d Mike asked as he leaned back in his chair and sipped at his beer. \u201cI mean there really can be that much up there to burn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake stretched his legs and glanced at the Hollywood hills. \u201cIt\u2019s been two days now, and it does not look like it has any plans to slow down, it can\u2019t be natural, it has not spread beyond the hills into the outlying areas.\u201d He replied casually<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMan, I tell you I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been three days since everything when crazy.\u201d Mike said as he continued to sip at his beer with his right hand and stroked the grip of the shotgun in his lap with his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake nodded as he too unconsciously reached for the gun sitting on the small table next to him. \u201cYou still think it was the second comin\u2019 and all that shit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat else could it have been man.\u201d Mike exclaimed \u201cso many people just up and disappearing in a beam of light, and all the kids too, then the fires in the hills and the freak lightnin\u2019 storms. Makes a man wonder what he done wrong that he was left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake smiled and shook his head, \u201cI have no such wonderings, I never bought into any of that religious crap, and all I ever believed in was what I could see with my own eyes, or could be proven by scientific explanation. I have to say I am beginnin\u2019 to believe now, that fire aren\u2019t natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMike stood and walked to the edge of the porch, staring into the haze in the distance. \u201cHey, Jake isn\u2019t the Old Man Jefferies girl? I thought all the kids disappeared, what the hell is that tart doing still around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake looked in the direction his friend was pointing. \u201cYup that\u2019s her, cute little thing, always has been, and the girl\u2019s with her have to be her from little gang, looks like Tammy Winston and Julie Carter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMike shook his head, \u201cBut they is just kids, can\u2019t be any older than thirteen. What the hell are kids doing here, I aint seen no kids since this all began.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake shrugged, \u201cIf it was rapture, they did something bad that caused them to be left behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two men watched as the three girls ran down the street, all three were still in their school uniforms, thogh tattered and torn in places, and the smallest of the three kept looking behind her and yelling for the other two to run faster. Jake stood up to stand next to Mike as Mike set down his beer and gripped his shotgun in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomthin\u2019 is chasin\u2019 them, you planin\u2019 on being a hero and saving them young fillies?\u201d Jake asked as he picked up his pistol. <br>\r\n\tMike nodded. \u201cIt would be the gentlemanly thing to do, they is just kids after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSince when have we been gentlemanly, I don\u2019t recall you being very gentlemanly as you was doing that girl\u2019s mother last week.\u201d <br>\r\nJake chuckled. \u201cThen again I was not very gentlemanly either, Old Man Jefferies always had a hot wife. \u201cI say we see if we can save the young fillies and see how grateful they is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJake, they are just kids, man you is one sick mother\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake gave his neighbor an evil grin. \u201cKids who got themselves left behind and appear to be in great need of a hero, besides their aint no law no more, no law but what we can make. I did not see you too caught up when you shot that young man last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMike continued to look down the street as the young girls ran towards them. He brought up his gun as shadowy shapes began to form in the haze behind the girls. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t no kid, he had to be at least nineteen and besides he was steelin\u2019 our food stuffs and threatened me with a knife, stupid gang bangers bringin\u2019 a knife to a gun fight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their cries were cut short as the first shadowy shape took the form of a man in his thirties wearing obvious gang colors, and Mike\u2019s shotgun rang out into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot \u2018im,\u201d Mike exclaimed as he watched the gang member fall to the ground and the girls dive for cover. \u201cOne less piece of shit polluting the neighborhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe other shapes immediately began to fan out in the haze, taking cover behind anything they could in the silent suburb. \u201cGirls get your cute asses over \u2018er \u2018for one of them pieces of shit gets ahold of ya.\u201d Mike yelled as he and Jake took cover behind the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the girls got closer Jake got a better look at them, they were definitely the three girls he thought they were, Jill Jefferies, Tammy Winston and Julie carter. All three students at St. Agnes\u2019s junior high where he used to work as a janitor. He remembered these three quite well, queens of the school, total bitches who treated anyone not in their click like shit. He was the butt of their jokes on several occasions. Their uniforms were defiantly tattered, The youngest of the three barley had a skirt left and no buttons left on her blouse. \u201cMan, Mike let them have \u2018em these three bitches aint worth our time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease, don\u2019t send us back out there, you don\u2019t know what it is like, they got Amy and Jennifer last night and one of the bastards shot Fran when they found us this morning. He said if they wasn\u2019t getting us no one was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJake sneered at the girls as they crawled across the lawn, Mike was very much correct the oldest two Jill and Tammy were thirteen and Jullie was a a grade lower, the new addition to the gang, he was not sure how old the other girls mentioned were but he was sure they were not much older. \u201cFine,\u201d Jake replied as another shot from Mike\u2019s shotgun echoed in the night. \u201cBut you little tarts better show some gratitude, if we is goin\u2019 to be riskin\u2019 our hides to save ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three girls nodded as they ran onto the porch. \u201cWhat type of gratitude\u2026\u201d Julie the smallest of the three as she hunkered behind the wicker chair that Jake had been sitting in earlier. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have no care for what they done to deserve being here, but they is just kids, so lay off.\u201d Make growled as another shot rang in the night.<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine.\u201d Jake grumbled as he aimed at the closest shadow and fired. The thug went down in a heap.<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think that\u2019s the last of \u2018em,\u201d Mike said as he lowered his gun and looked towards the retreating shapes. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it a few then I\u2019ll go check the bodies for valuables.

Jake ... yelled Mike.... don't even think of ....BANG .... Jake turns back around and see's Mike fall over and Jake shoots the last dying thug finishing him off.<br>\r\nAs Jake runs over to Mike he see's Mike has already died so Jake takes what they had gathered up and headed back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls had seen what had happened but they did not know Jake knew the last one was still alive .... Jake tells the girls that tomorrow we have to move somewhere more secure and that they all needed to get some rest tonight.<br>\r\nThe girls all agreed and Jake then says that he needs someone to help him get calmed down before he can fall asleep with a grin, all the girls knows what he means and the youngest girl looks over to the other girls and simply shakes her head ...yes.</span></div></div>",
