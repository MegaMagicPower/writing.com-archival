            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Brian Hawkins; I\u2019m 13 years old and I live with my parents and my 7-year-old sister Mackenzie.  I have a small group of friends; my next-door neighbor Eric plus our mutual friends Carrie Sullivan and her twin brother Collin.  The four of us have known each other since Kindergarten and were damn near inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I telling you this?  Because something happened to me just before I was to start 8th grade; something I can\u2019t quite explain. I was out in the woods behind my house, playing hide and seek with Mackenzie when I suddenly blacked out.  When I regained consciousness, I thought that only a short time had passed.  I returned home, after not finding Mackenzie, to discover that 6 years had in fact passed and everyone had thought I was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes next is the story of how I attempt to rebuild my life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>March 16th, 2013</b><br>\r\nIt was a nice sunny Saturday afternoon; I was home with my sister while our parents were at work.  I was sitting in my room playing Dead Space 3 when Mackenzie came running in.  I swear if it wasn\u2019t for her ponytail, Mackenzie could have easily passed for a boy.  At 7 years old, she wore almost exclusively boy's clothing; I only saw her wear dresses on special occasions.  She and her best friend Emily, who was my friend Eric\u2019s little sister, were the definition of tomboys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in front of the TV, looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cCome on Brian, let\u2019s go outside and play hide and seek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally I would have jumped at the chance to go outside; but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t go outside today.  Pausing the game, I looked at Mackenzie and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mac; I\u2019m not really feeling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d grabbing my arm, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s finally stopped raining, and mom says I can\u2019t go in the woods without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough to realize that Mackenzie wasn\u2019t going to let this go.  With a sigh, I turned off the console and said, \u201cOkay fine; we\u2019ll go play some hide and seek in the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to follow Mackenzie as she ran down the stairs, only to stop in my tracks when I heard my cell phone ringing.  Going over to my desk, I saw that it was Eric calling me.  He\u2019d spent the summer with his aunt and uncle; his parents and Emily had flown out to get him yesterday.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much; we\u2019re just waiting for our connecting flight, should be home in a few hours.\u201d Taking a breath, Eric said, \u201cAre you going to be free tonight?  There\u2019s something kind of important I need to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you can\u2019t tell me over the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m heading outside to play hide and seek with Mackenzie, but I\u2019ll be free tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour had passed since Mackenzie and I started playing hide and seek.  We were taking turns being the seeker; it was currently Mackenzie\u2019s turn to search for me.  She had just started counting and I was running to find a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching, I found a small rock outcropping I could hide behind.  I sat behind the outcropping for a few moments, listening as Mackenzie tried her best to find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was watching some birds fly around overhead when I was suddenly overcome by an unbearably loud noise.  I tried covering my ears in an attempt to drown it out, but it didn\u2019t work.  I started feeling a little light-headed; the next thing I knew, I blacked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I must\u2019ve been unconscious for a few hours; because when I finally woke up, I noticed the sun was just about to set.  I knew there were coyotes in the woods, so I decided it was probably best to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d spent a lot of time in the woods over the years, so I was able to make my way back to the house as the daylight faded.  It wasn\u2019t long before I got back to the house; walking up to the back door, I found that it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made my way around to the front of the house, I noticed Mom walking down the stairs carrying a hamper full of laundry.  Coming around the front of the house, I was surprised to find the front door closed and the porch light off.  Having left my house key on my desk, I knocked on the door to get my mom\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute went by before I saw my mom walking out of the laundry room.  She looked out the side window and the expression on her face was as if she\u2019d seen a ghost.  Opening the door, she stepped out on the porch and knelt down in front of me.  \u201cB-Brian?  Is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit I wasn\u2019t expecting this; in fact, I had been fairly certain mom was going to yell at me.  Looking at her, confused, I said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s me, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pulled me in for a hug; squeezing me hard enough that I had trouble breathing.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cThis can\u2019t be real, I-I must be dreaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking away from Mom, I looked at her and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on my face, Mom said, \u201cHow is it possible that you haven\u2019t aged?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could ask what was going on, I was interrupted by Mackenzie\u2019s voice coming from upstairs.  \u201cMom, when\u2019s dinner going to be ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mom\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t confusing enough, I was certainly confused when I saw an older Mackenzie come around the corner.  I could tell it was her from her face; but other than that, there was nothing of the 7-year-old I saw a few hours earlier.  Her dark blonde hair was now brown and down past her shoulders, she was at least a foot taller than before, plus she had breasts and a figure to boot.  My 7-year-old sister, as impossible as it seemed, was now a teenage girl.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMackenzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie took one look at me before turning her attention back to her phone.  That was until, a fraction of a second later, she realized who she was looking at.  Dropping her phone on the floor, she looked at me and said, \u201cBrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew what was happening, Mackenzie ran down the stairs and hugged me.  I did my best to break away from the hug; disturbed by the thought of Mackenzie\u2019s breasts.  Taking a step back, I looked at Mom and Mackenzie.  \u201cCan someone please explain to me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d gesturing to Mackenzie, I said, \u201cI\u2019m gone for a few hours and suddenly Mackenzie\u2019s a teenager?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few hours?\u201d looking at me, Mom said, \u201cBrian, you\u2019ve been missing for over 6 years.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had to sit down after that bombshell.  Walking into the family room, Mackenzie and Mom coming in after me, I sat down on the couch.  \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019ve been missing for 6 years?\u201d turning to Mackenzie, sitting next to me on the couch, I said, \u201cThe last thing I remember was playing hide and seek with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last time anyone saw you.\u201d Pausing, Mackenzie said, \u201cAfter I couldn\u2019t find you, I ran back to the house to call Mom and Dad.  They called the police and we started looking everywhere for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe spent weeks looking for you, but never found any trace of where you might\u2019ve ended up.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cEveryone started to speculate that perhaps a wild animal had gotten you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I tried to process everything that I\u2019d been told, I turned to Mackenzie and said, \u201cWait, if it\u2019s been 6 years; then you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI turned 13 last month.\u201d Sighing, Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cIt seems we\u2019re the same age now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to process the fact that my formerly 7-year-old sister and I were basically the same age now.  It was only then that I realized that neither mom nor Mackenzie had mentioned dad.  Looking around, I saw no sign of him anywhere.  \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Mackenzie shared a pained look with each other.  Turning to me, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Brian, but your father passed away 3 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was diagnosed with cancer a few months after you disappeared.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cThe doctors gave him 6 months, but he held on for almost 3 years.  I guess he held out hope that you\u2019d come back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Only a few hours had gone by for me; but for everyone else, it had been over 6 years.  Not only was my kid sister now the same age as me, but my dad was dead as well.  Getting up, I said, \u201cI-I need to get some air.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure it was a good idea for me to leave, but Mom and Mackenzie didn\u2019t stop me.  I walked out the front door and started walking towards the park at the end of the street.  I was walking in front of Eric\u2019s house when I suddenly heard a car horn followed by screeching brakes. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, kid; I almost hit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning in the direction of the voice, I saw a young woman in her late teens staring at me from the driver\u2019s seat.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had expected the woman to simply acknowledge me and continue pulling into Eric\u2019s driveway, but she didn\u2019t do so.  Instead, she backed out into the street and parked along the curb.  I watched as she stepped out of the car; revealing herself to be a rather attractive woman \u2013 wearing a moderately revealing dress and boots.  As she walked towards me, I realized there was something familiar about her but I couldn\u2019t quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping right in front of me, she looked me over and said, \u201cBrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly this woman knew me from 6 years earlier, but I couldn\u2019t quite place her.  She was pulling into Eric\u2019s driveway, so he probably knew her.  It was only then that I realized there weren\u2019t any lights on inside the house.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the 3rd time in less than 30 minutes, I suddenly found myself being hugged.  After a moment the woman looked at me and said, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her question, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, I guess some explanation is in order.\u201d Looking at me, moving a stray hair from her eyes, the woman said, \u201cYou used to know me as Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d stunned, I looked at her and said, \u201cBut you\u2019re a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember, right before you disappeared, how I said there was something I needed to tell you?\u201d gesturing to her body, the woman said, \u201cWell <i>this</i> is what I needed to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything became too much for me to handle at that point; I promptly fainted and fell to the ground.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully that wasn\u2019t the case; as I found myself back in the family room with Mackenzie, Mom and \u2018Eric\u2019 standing over me.  No one was looking at me, so they didn\u2019t realize I was awake yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it possible that he hasn\u2019t aged a day in 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea, Erica.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that he\u2019s alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to get their attention, I said, \u201cWhy does my head hurt so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them turned to look at me; with Mom saying, \u201cYou fainted in front of Erica\u2019s house; she brought you back here.\u201d  <br>\r\nTurning to Mackenzie, Mom said, \u201cGo get your brother an ice pack; while I get him something for the headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mom and Mackenzie left the room, I managed to sit up and look at Eric...rather Erica.  Now that I knew who she was, I could still see some of Eric in her.  Other than that, she was entirely female now \u2013 her breasts were slightly larger than Mom and Mackenzie\u2019s, she appeared to have a pretty decent figure as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to me, she said, \u201cI guess you probably have some questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember how I spent the summer before 8th grade out in California with my Mom\u2019s sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was there to have my hormone treatments.\u201d Looking at me, Erica said, \u201cI had planned to come out to you when I came home, but that was until I found out you were missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea that Erica was trans; she certainly did a good job of passing herself off as a boy.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cHow did the kids at school take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few of them bullied me, but most were understanding.\u201d Chuckling, Erica said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many boys started flirting with me after my boobs came in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica then proceeded to explain how, in high school, she joined the cheer squad and discovered a passion for fashion design.  Her parents had scheduled her final surgery for the week after she graduated High School; after which she started attending the local college in the fashion program.   Looking at her, I said, \u201cHow did Carrie and Collin take it when you came out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They both took it pretty well; Carrie liked having another girl in the group, while Collin protected me from the bullies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think they\u2019ll react when they find out I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Mackenzie walked back into the room at that point; as they handed me an ice pack and pills, Erica said, \u201cI called them while you were still unconscious; they should be here in about 10 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone thought it best that I hide in the bathroom when Carrie and Collin got here; I guess they figured it would be easier that way.  The downstairs bathroom was down the hall from the door, so I could hear when they came in.  The first voice I heard was <br>\r\nCollin\u2019s, although it was deeper than I remembered.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Erica?  Why\u2019d you tell us to come here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a development in Brian\u2019s disappearance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d shocked, Carrie said, \u201cDid they finally find his body or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Pausing, Erica said, \u201cBut it\u2019s something big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that it was my cue to come out of the bathroom.  I opened the door and walked into the family room; seeing a taller Collin standing next to a very pregnant Carrie.  Neither of them saw me standing in the doorway, so I said, \u201cHey guys.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The Carrie I knew was kind of bookish and socially awkward; if she hadn\u2019t hung out with Collin, Erica and me, I don\u2019t think she would have had any friends.  So to see that she was suddenly pregnant came as a shock to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin was different as well; the last time I saw him he\u2019d been somewhat chubby, not fat but definitely on the chubby side.  He was now almost 6 feet tall and thin; a far cry from what he used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them walked over and looked at me, which was no mean feat since they were now taller than me.  Collin took one look at me before turning to my Mom.  \u201cThis is some kind of joke, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assure you, Collin; this isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d Gesturing to me, Mom said, \u201cAs strange as it sounds, that really is Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s that even possible?\u201d gesturing to me, Collin said, \u201cHe\u2019s been missing for 6 years but he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s aged at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking the same questions that we\u2019ve already asked.\u201d Looking at me, Erica said, \u201cFor now why can\u2019t we just be glad that our friend is back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we know it\u2019s really him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Carrie, I realized she needed some more convincing that I was who I said I was.  \u201cWhen we were in 7th grade, you kissed me in the boy\u2019s locker room after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie brought a hand up to her mouth and started hyperventilating. Collin and Erica had to grab her to make sure she didn\u2019t fall.  Once she regained the ability to speak, Carrie took one look at Collin and said, \u201cThat\u2019s definitely Brian.\u201d Blushing, she said, \u201cI never told anyone about that kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Collin; he came over and hugged me, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s great to have you back, kiddo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little confused about the kiddo remark, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it.  As Carrie placed a hand on my shoulder, I was just glad to have my friends back; even if they were now 6 years older than I was.  \u201cYou guys feel like catching me up on everything I\u2019ve missed the last 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.\u201d Smiling, Carrie said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got plenty of questions for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and Mom quietly excused themselves while the four of us made our way to the couch.  \u201cI sure do.\u201d  As I sat down next to Carrie, I looked at her and said, \u201cFor starters, how about you tell me how you got pregnant?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Everything was going great until I woke up in bed with my clothes in a pile on the floor.  Next thing I know, I\u2019m wondering when I was going to get my next period.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was shocked to hear that.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Putting my hand on hers, I said, \u201cI wish I could have been there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had Erica and Collin to help me through this.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cNow I\u2019m not even scared about it; I\u2019m just looking forward to seeing this little boy or girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by all this.  For me, only a few hours had passed, but for everyone else, it had been 6 years.  My best friend had gotten a sex change and another friend was pregnant.  That left Collin and why he\u2019d changed.  Turning my attention to him, I said, \u201cYou used to be on the chubby side, man; what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing as drastic as Carrie\u2019s story, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Taking a breath, Collin said, \u201cI fell in love, and wanted to make myself better for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cCan I meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Walking over to Collin, Erica kissed him and said, \u201cYou already have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot certainly had changed in just 6 years, and that was just with my friends.  Looking at me, Carrie said, \u201cAre we all caught up, kiddo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Again with the kiddo.</i>  \u201cI\u2019ve probably missed so many video games and movies.\u201d Looking around, I said, \u201cPerhaps you guys can help me catch up with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment I said that I swear I noticed a look of hesitation on Carrie and Collin\u2019s faces.  \u201cI\u2019m sure we can work something out, Brian; but you\u2019ve got to remember that we\u2019re in college now.\u201d  Looking at me, Collin said, \u201cWe can\u2019t just drop everything and play video games like when we were your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was saddened to hear that; because I remembered Collin would always find an excuse to play video games.  Turning to Erica, I said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a light course load this semester, but I\u2019ve got an internship at a local fashion house.\u201d Seeing the dejected look on my face, she said, \u201cBut I promise I\u2019ll make time to hang out with you; like old times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first moment I realized how much things had really changed.  My friends were no longer the people I remembered; they\u2019d grown up while I still remained the same age.  Before I could say anything, Mom walked into the room and said, \u201cI think that\u2019s enough for one evening; I\u2019m sure Brian is exhausted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the cue for everyone to leave; as they all stood up and walked towards the door.  I followed them to the door and said my goodbyes.  After they said their goodbyes, the three of them left.  I watched as Collin and Erica kissed before going their separate ways; Erica went to her house while Collin left with Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood in the doorway for a few minutes; until Mackenzie came up next to me and said, \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was weird.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cThey\u2019re not the same people I remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix years is a long time, Brian.\u201d Sighing, Mackenzie said, \u201cEven I\u2019m not the same person I was 6 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a <i>long</i> day tomorrow.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Mom reassured me that my collection of video games and movies had been kept, along with most of my books and posters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t upset by the fact that most of my clothes had been donated.  That was, however, until I realized I had to wear a pair of Mackenzie\u2019s pajamas to bed.  I was sitting on her bed watching as she rummaged through her dresser to find the least embarrassing pajamas she had.  This gave me a chance to look around her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed was that her little league trophies were gone from her shelf; replaced with about a half a dozen cheerleading competition ribbons.  There was a photo of Mackenzie wearing her cheer outfit inside a school gym \u2013 I had to admit that she looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that came the typical items you\u2019d find in a teenage girl\u2019s room; an assortment of makeup on her dresser, a closet full of dresses and pants, and a wall covered in posters of boys.  I noticed two framed photos on her nightstand; one was of the two of us, taken a few months before I disappeared, while the other was of her and another girl on the front porch wearing dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, I thought the other girl looked familiar.  Turning to Mackenzie, gesturing to the photo, I said, \u201cIs that other girl Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d seeing what I was pointing at, Mackenzie said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Emily and me last year; right before our Spring Formal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my attention back to the photo, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Emily looked rather attractive in the photo.  I tried to get that thought out of my head; after all, the last time I saw her, Emily was a 7-year-old girl.  Try as I might, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was definitely an attractive girl now.  Walking back to the bed, I sat down and said, \u201cHow\u2019s it coming finding me a pair of pajamas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie turned around and handed me a pair of pink pajama pants and a pink top.  Seeing the horrified expression on my face, she said, \u201cHey it\u2019s either this or you wear one of my nighties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bad enough I had to borrow pajamas from my sister, I didn\u2019t want to resort to wearing one of her nighties.  Grabbing the pajamas, I looked at her and said, \u201cNot a word of this to anyone, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I guess I should\u2019ve expected her to chuckle when she saw me.  \u201cYou look really cute in pink, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly beats the alternative, Mac.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cThankfully this is just for tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had assured me that tomorrow we\u2019d go get my stuff out of storage, but first, we\u2019d have to go to the police.  That was sure to be an interesting experience; convincing them that I was really who I claimed to be.  No doubt they\u2019d have questions as to why I hadn\u2019t aged a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mom came upstairs; seeing us standing there, she said, \u201cKids, it\u2019s time for bed; brush your teeth.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cBrian, there\u2019s an unopened toothbrush in the closet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie and I obliged and walked back into the bathroom.  We brushed our teeth in silence for a moment until Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cJust ask your question already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you looking at me; so just ask your question already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie was right; I had been looking at her, but not in a perverted way.  I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that the teenage girl standing next to me was the same 7-year-old tomboy I\u2019d seen only a few hours ago.  \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cYou used to be such a tomboy; now your room is full of makeup, dresses, and pictures of boys.  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom and Dad became more protective of me after you disappeared; they didn\u2019t let me out of their sight for months.\u201d Sighing, Mackenzie said, \u201cI didn\u2019t really think much of it; because, frankly, I thought I deserved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m the whole reason you were out there in the woods, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been so pushy, you wouldn\u2019t have disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell Mackenzie was having a hard time with everything.  I took one look at her and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for what happened to me, Mac.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWho\u2019s to say I wouldn\u2019t have disappeared from my bedroom or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell myself.\u201d Sighing, Mackenzie said, \u201cBut regardless, here you are; we\u2019re both the same age now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to steer the subject back to where it was supposed to be, I said, \u201cSo how did Mom and Dad being protective of you make you no longer a tomboy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed something to do; especially since the house was the only place Mom and Dad weren\u2019t watching me like a hawk.\u201d <br>\r\nLeaning against the counter, Mackenzie said, \u201cEventually Mom decided to buy me a Barbie doll and some accessories.  From there I moved to Disney Princess and cute singers.  Once I started Junior High, I got introduced to cheerleading; my athletic background made me a natural.  I guess you can say the rest is history.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished brushing my teeth a moment later.  Putting my toothbrush down, I turned to Mackenzie and said, \u201cWhatever the reason, I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me; it took a long time for me to come to terms with you disappearing.\u201d Hugging me, Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019m just really glad you\u2019re back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m back too.\u201d Hugging Mackenzie, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to leave you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not!\u201d chuckling, Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cGod forbid you were to disappear again and come back when I\u2019m in my twenties.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just wasn\u2019t expecting things to change as much as they had.  A formerly empty lot down the road had been turned into an apartment complex and the movie theater had gotten bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we entered the downtown area, I turned to look at Mackenzie; only to find her making a weird face.  \u201cWhat are you doing, Mac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, I\u2019m taking a selfie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your tone, young lady.\u201d From the front seat, Mom said, \u201cBrian doesn\u2019t know what selfies are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right; they became popular after you disappeared.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cBasically you just use your phone to take a photo of yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie leaned over so I could look at the photos on her phone; most of them were either selfies of herself or photos with her, Emily or who I figured was Cameron.  One thing I noticed about a few of the photos was that Mackenzie looked like she had a dog snout or anime eyes.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s with all those weird pictures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re called Snapchat filters; they\u2019re used to add funny things to the photos.\u201d  Mackenzie leaned over and took a photo of the two of us.  Handing me the phone, she said, \u201cHere, have a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the phone, I saw a photo of the two of us where our faces had been swapped.  I was still coming to terms with Mackenzie being a teenager, so it was a little disturbing to see my face on her body.  \u201cThat\u2019s what you do with your phone all day?\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cSeems kind of childish to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Taking her phone back, scoffing, Mackenzie, \u201cGive it some time; you\u2019ll probably be doing it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom continued driving, I found myself wondering what happened to my little sister.  She\u2019d gone from being a happy and energetic kid to a seemingly sullen teenager.  I hoped that would improve now that I was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Bradshaw, of the Missing Persons Unit, had been assigned to my case a few weeks after I\u2019d vanished.  Naturally, my Mom went straight to him after we arrived at the Station.  As you\u2019d expect, he had trouble believing what we were telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth, Detective; I was playing hide and seek with my little sister.  Suddenly there was this weird noise and I blacked out.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI went home as soon as I woke up; only to find that six years had gone by for everyone but me.  But I'm here now, so you can take me off your list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me telling you something, whoever you are.\u201d Looking at me from behind his desk, Bradshaw said, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 15 years; every time a missing person came through those doors they had a detailed description of their abductors.   <br>\r\nNone of them - not a single one - walked in looking like not a day had passed since they went missing. So you'll pardon me if I'm the tiniest bit skeptical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was frustrating that he didn\u2019t believe me, but I could understand Det. Bradshaw\u2019s skepticism.  Sighing, I said, \u201cI wish there was a way to prove I\u2019m telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do,\" sitting on a couch behind me, Mackenzie said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been walking around with it this whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, I looked at Mackenzie said, \u201cHuh?  What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Police have your prints and DNA on file; Detective Bradshaw thought it would be useful if we ever found you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to look at Det. Bradshaw, who sighed and said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take your prints and you can spit into a test tube.\u201d Pausing, he said, \u201cThat\u2019ll tell us, once and for all, who you really are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited with Det. Bradshaw for almost an hour before another officer delivered a file to his desk.  We all watched as he studied them for a few minutes; without saying a word.  Getting impatient, Mom said, \u201cWell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand it, but the prints and DNA are a 100% perfect match.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cI don't know why you aren't any older than when you turned up missing, but the science says you're Brian Hawkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could\u2019ve told you that.</i>  Looking at him, I said, \u201cSo what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you do what I did when I found my wife in bed with another man.\u201d Sighing, he said, \u201cYou turn around and hope you never have to come back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cAren\u2019t you curious to know why he hasn\u2019t aged a day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am very curious, Ms. Hawkins.\u201d Taking a breath, Det. Bradshaw said, \u201cBut where your brother was, and how he came back, aren\u2019t for me to investigate.  As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ve been found.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After leaving the Police Station, Mom took us to the mall.  Mom must\u2019ve spent close to $300 on clothes for me; but I guess that\u2019s par for the course when you\u2019ve been missing for 6 years.  The next stop after that was the storage unit to get all my things.  Let me tell you something; it\u2019s pretty humbling to find that all your worldly possessions can fit inside a 3x5 unit with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got back to the house just after 2:00, pulling into the driveway to find two people sitting on the front steps.  As we got closer, I realized one of them was Emily and the other was the boy in Mackenzie\u2019s pictures.  Parking the car, Mom looked at me and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this now if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine; let\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all got out of the car at the same time, but Mackenzie and Mom stayed back while I walked up to the steps.  Emily was the first to approach me; walking up to me, she placed her hand on my face.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, I looked at her and said, \u201cHi Emily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had, of course, seen photos of her from Mackenzie\u2019s room, but they didn\u2019t prepare me for the real thing.  The Emily I knew 6 years ago could have easily passed herself off as a boy, but that was no longer the case now.  She was a little taller than Mackenzie now, only about 3 inches shorter than me; her brown hair had gotten darker.  Her breasts were a little on the small size, but that would likely change.  It felt wrong to think of her that way, but I couldn\u2019t help but find her attractive now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even prepare myself, she wrapped her arms around me and gave me a big hug.  As I returned the hug, between tears of joy, Emily said, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it when Erica told me you were back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you can tell, I\u2019m really back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and I had an almost sibling-like relationship before I disappeared; so I\u2019d imagine she was pretty upset when it happened.  Breaking the hug, Emily wiped tears from her eyes and looked at me.  \u201cBut how haven\u2019t you aged at all?\u201d with a bewildered look, Emily said, \u201cI mean we\u2019re practically the same age now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as confused as you are, believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging me again, Emily said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever leave again, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try not to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Mom and Mackenzie came over to join us; followed by the still unidentified boy.  While Emily started talking with Mom and Mackenzie, the boy walked over to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m Cameron Hardy; it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his hand, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Cameron.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stood outside the house for a few minutes until Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we bring Brian\u2019s things up to his room; then I\u2019ll bring drive you guys to the movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Ms. Hawkins, my folks said they would drive.\u201d Looking at me, Emily said, \u201cI think they want to see Brian in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Deep down I suspected I knew what was happening, but I didn\u2019t want to admit it on a conscious level.  <i>Was I attracted to Emily?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to suspect that Emily was dealing with a similar issue because, as she climbed off of me, she started to blush.  Before either of us could say anything, the parents of the young boy came over to express their sincere apologies.  Getting to my feet, helping Emily to her feet as well, I said, \u201cNo problem, we\u2019re okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron and Mackenzie came back our way, having finally noticed we weren\u2019t following them.

I was in the middle of putting my shoes on when Mac walked into the room.  \u201cCameron just texted me; said he\u2019s looking forward to you coming over, and that I should give you his number for when you have a phone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the paper with Cameron\u2019s number on it, I looked at her and got the sense that something was bothering her.  \u201cIs something on your mind, Mac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, there is.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cWhy are you hanging out with my friend without me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cYou were the one that suggested I hang out with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019m not sure I like that idea.\u201d Sighing, her face starting to turn red, Mac said, \u201cCameron and Emily are my only friends; now I have to share them with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken aback by Mac\u2019s remarks.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac\u2026I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think it was easy for me to make friends after you disappeared?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201c<i>Everybody</i> knew that you were gone because of me! Everybody!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to tell her that no one blamed her, but it was clear she wouldn\u2019t listen.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac, that\u2019s not true; no one blames you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, I could see it in their eyes.  They knew I didn\u2019t deserve anyone, especially after Dad died.\u201d Collapsing on my bed, Mac said, \u201cMom tried to help, but she didn\u2019t really understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMac, I think you\u2019re overreacting a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Mac\u2019s face turned from sadness to rage.  Staring at me, she said, \u201cImagine how I felt when you came back, and you\u2019re all \u2018Hi, you want to be my friend?\u2019\u201d tears starting to flow, Mac said, \u201cI need all the friends I\u2019ve got; go make your own friends if it\u2019s so damn easy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood silently at the foot of my bed while Mac composed herself.  I tried to console her but she shoved my hand aside.  As she got up and left my room, I found myself thinking \u2013 if me hanging out with Cameron did <i>that</i> To her, I worried about how she\u2019d react when I told her about my feelings for Emily.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of something that was, in all likelihood, a one-time occurrence.  So while Mackenzie went over to Emily\u2019s house to hang out by the pool, Mom drove me a few miles away to Cameron\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we drove past the Middle School, Mom said, \u201cI have an appointment with the school district on Monday; to see if I can get you back into school.\u201d  Turning to me, as we came to a stoplight, Mom said, \u201cI suppose the three of us will have to sit down and figure out a plan for when people ask where you\u2019ve been or why you haven\u2019t aged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was hesitant to ask this, based on my earlier conversation with Mac, but I felt I had to anyway.  \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll have a problem putting me in as many classes as possible with Mac and the others?\u201d sighing, I said, \u201cBeing back in school will be hard enough; I\u2019d rather do it with people I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why that will be a problem.\u201d Turning onto a quiet street, Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m sure your sister and the others will be more than happy to help you adjust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I kind of doubt that.</i> \u201cI hope so, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we came to a stop in front of what I could only assume was Cameron\u2019s house, Mom said, \u201cI spoke with Cameron\u2019s mother last night; she understands that you may not want to discuss what happened, but be prepared if she asks you a few questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Getting out of the car, I said, \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up the walk and knocked on the door.  It wasn\u2019t long before an attractive looking woman in her mid-30s answered the door.  \u201cHello Brian, I\u2019m Cameron\u2019s mother.\u201d Opening the door, she said, \u201cCome on inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waving goodbye to Mom, I walked inside the house.  Looking at Mrs. Hardy, I said, \u201cThank you for letting me come over, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of person would I be if I said no?\u201d with a sincere smile, Mrs. Hardy said, \u201cCameron\u2019s upstairs in his room; you can head on up if you\u2019d like, it\u2019s down the hall on the right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way upstairs as Mrs. Hardy went down the hall.  Arriving outside Cameron\u2019s room, I peeked inside to find him playing a game with some headphones on.  While I went to get his attention, I saw that his room was full of action figures, movie posters and a bookshelf full of comics.  <i>Mac was right, Cameron and I definitely share the same interests.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up behind him, I tapped Cameron on the shoulder; leading to him jumping in shock.  Turning to look at me, he said, \u201cOh hey, Brian; I didn\u2019t know you were here yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if I startled you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Chuckling, Cameron said, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you how to play this game.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking at Cameron, I said, \u201cWhat changed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had my 8th birthday about 2 months after I moved here; I invited my entire 2nd-grade class.\u201d Taking a breath, Cameron said, <br>\r\n\u201cOut of 15 people, Mackenzie and Emily were the only ones who came.  That\u2019s when I knew they genuinely wanted to be my friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment I decided to bring up my earlier conversation with Mac.

Should I try to find my own friends and not latch on to Mac\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Mac\u2019s being a tad unreasonable here; although I\u2019d never say that to her face.\u201d Sighing, Cameron said, \u201cYour friends from 6 years ago are all in college; and, no offense, you really have nothing in common with kids your own age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t see a problem with me hanging out with you and Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d with a chuckle, Cameron said, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just glad there\u2019s finally another boy in the group.  I\u2019d go crazy if they made me listen to another One Direction album.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I should take just things slowly; I mean, I\u2019ve been back for 2 days and I\u2019ve already disrupted Mac\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I would suggest.\u201d Grabbing his controller, Cameron said, \u201cI would also suggest talking with Emily; see how she feels about you hanging out with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s such a good idea at this point.</i>  \u201cI suppose I could do that too.\u201d Grabbing my controller, I said, \u201cSo what are we going to play now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

But other than that, I haven\u2019t really had any issues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mom waited in line, Detective Bradshaw pulled me aside.  Looking at me, a serious look on his face, he said, \u201cHow are things with your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings could be better.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cShe snapped at me this morning because I was going to hang out with a friend of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s had a rough few years, Brian; first with your disappearance and then your dad dying.\u201d Placing a reassuring hand on my shoulder, he said, \u201cI suggest you give her space; let her adjust to having you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked over at that point.  Looking at us, she said, \u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were talking about sports.\u201d Casting a quick glance at me, Bradshaw looked at Mom and said, \u201cI hope it\u2019s not out of line or anything; but I remember you saying, a few years ago, that Brian enjoyed baseball.  I happen to have some tickets to a Minor League game this weekend; would it be alright if I took him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cDoes that sound okay to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it was a little weird; I barely knew Bradshaw.  But I hadn\u2019t been to a baseball game in years, so who was I to pass up the opportunity.  With a smile, I nodded and said, \u201cSure, I\u2019d love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Chuckling, Bradshaw said, \u201cThe game\u2019s at noon, so I\u2019ll come to pick you up around 10:30.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Closing the door, she walked over and sat next to me, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning, Brian; I-I was totally out of line.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t totally out of line, Mac.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cMy being back has affected everyone; I can understand why you responded the way you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just; Emily and Cameron are my only friends, I guess I didn\u2019t want to share them with you.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cBut that\u2019s not true; I want them to be your friends too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Chuckling, Mac said, \u201cEmily always thought of you as a big brother, and Cameron has a lot of your interests.  If you to hang out with them, who am I to stop you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly considered telling Mac about my nascent feelings for Emily, but quickly decided now wasn\u2019t the best time.  So instead, I decided to ask about something I noticed last night.  \u201cIs there something going on between you and Cameron?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I noticed the faintest hint of Mac blushing.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust some things I noticed last night; how you made an effort to be close to him, how you blushed whenever you bumped into each other.\u201d  Taking a breath, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s got feelings for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe does!\u201d Mac\u2019s face turned beet red, clearly, she said that louder than she\u2019d wanted.  Lowering her voice, Mac said, \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the confirmation I needed; there was something definitely brewing between Mac and Cameron.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cHe kept asking me about you today; what stuff you liked or didn\u2019t like, your favorite foods, etc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What did you tell him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told him my information was a little out of date; since I\u2019m still getting to know the 13-year-old you.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cBut I told him to just be himself, and something will happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on Mac\u2019s face when I stopped talking; the biggest one I\u2019d seen since I came back.

One police officer came in with a guy in handcuffs. \"Caught a guy shoplifting.\" flatly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him off with a warning.\" Serious, the police captain said. \"We need all hands on this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer was taken back. \"Sir...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police captain, Jaune Hawk, was a tall middle-aged man with the build of a professional weight lifter. He had crew-cut black hair and brown eyes. \"I said let him off with a warning!\" Sternly, he barked. \"We have no time for petty shit right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer, Gary Grant was a twenty-some rookie cop with short brown hair and blue eyes. He was a no-nonsense police officer and saw Jaune as the same. After the man was let off with a stern warning, Gary walked back to Jaune. \"What happened that has you so rattled, sir?\" Worried, he demanded. \"It has to be big to let a criminal go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man you brought in is a known kleptomaniac.\" Frowning, Jaune replied. \"He needs therapy, not prison time.\" He then motioned Gary to follow him. \"At approximately three AM, a loud disturbance was reported in the suburbs. It shook windows and set off car alarms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\" Curious, Gary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune shook his head. \"We don't know.\" Serious, he replied. \"What we do know is that two people who were reported missing six years ago suddenly reappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean we found their bodies...\" Wincing, Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Jaune shook his head. \"No, they showed up alive... and have not aged a day since their disappearance.\" Darkly, he said. \"We found three smoldering impact sites in the woods on the edge of the suburbs, about a hundred yards from each other, which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There might be another missing person who just reappeared.\" Rattled, Gary finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune nodded. \"This is why we need all hands on deck.\" Serious, he said. \"Once is happenstance, two is a coincidence but three is a pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to do, chief?\" Shaken, Gary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune pointed to a map of the area. \"I need you and your partner, Hank Franks to go door to door in this neighborhood and find that missing person.\" He then whispered. \"We need to get a lid on this before we have a panic on our hands and we find ourselves hip-deep in a government cover-up quagmire.\"</span></div></div>",

I really don't feel well.\" Misery in my voice, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to me, pale. \"I'm taking you to the emergency room.\" Firmly, she said. \"I'm not taking the risk of losing you twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Mackenzie and I were piled into the car with Carrie, Collin and Erica tagging along in another car. My sister sat with me in the back seat, holding a damp cold cloth against my head at mom's request as she rushed us to the hospital. \"It's going to be okay, Brian.\" Trying to comfort me, Mackenzie said. \"You likely have a stress headache due to all this craziness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not answer. It was beginning to hurt to even think. Upon reaching the hospital, Mackenzie and our friends ushered me to a seat. Mom hurried to the reception desk and told the nurse the crazy story of how I just appeared after being missing for six years. To all of our surprise, the nurse looked at me wide eyed then turned to her phone. \"A third missing person has arrived.\" Firmly, she said. \"His mother just brought him in with the same symptoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\" Surprised, mom asked. \"Third person?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse nodded. \"Your son is the third person to come in here with the same story and same cruel pounding headache.\" Serious, she said. \"We will take him in immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a hospital band was placed around my wrist and I was rushed into an emergency room where a team of doctors began to run several tests on me at once. To say i was scared and confused would be an understatement. \"Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, sweetie.\" Taking my hand, mom said. \"I won't let anyone hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's showing the same vitals as the other two.\" Whispering, one doctor said to another. \"There is no way it can be a coincidence, it has to be some kind of pattern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with my son?\" Worried, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor in charge sighed. He was of average height and build with short black hair and green eyes. \"I'm Dr. Watts, chief physician.\" Serious, he said. \"We are running some tests on him now so please be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard those doctors say my vitals are the same as the other two.\" Wincing, I said. \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to wait for the test results to be certain.\" Serious, Dr. Watts said. \"Until I am, i cannot compare him to other patients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dr Watts walked away while other doctors continued to run seemingly endless teats on me...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He has not a single scar anywhere from his bad fall back when he was ten years old. It is as if he were never injured in his entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's jaw dropped as did mine. I did have a bad fall when I was ten years old. The family and I were rock climbing up a beginner's slope when I lost my footing and my safety rope broke. I fell over twenty feet to the rocky ground. Two broken ribs and a broken arm.... They did eventually heal but I did get a collection of scares from the deep cuts I suffered from. I looked at my arm and, sure enough, the scars were no longer there. \"What does this mean, doctor?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, we are all way over our heads on this one.\" Serious, Dr. Watts said. He turned to mom. \"We are admitting your son for further tests and observation. There are many questions we cannot answer, among them is why he has not aged a second from the day he had vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are more tests going to tell you?\" Worried, mom demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Watts shook his head. \"You do not understand.\" Serious, he said. \"We have called in the brightest minds in the medical field from all over the world.
