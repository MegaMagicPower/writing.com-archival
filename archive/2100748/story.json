It's almost enough to make you feel BAD for yourself. But then your RELENTLESS OPTIMISM overrides any such compulsions. It also helps that you have AMAZING PSIONIC POWERS. But it's mostly the optimism. Your blood is a fetching shade of NONE OF ANYONE'S BUSINESS thank you very much. Also, you are a MUTANT. Your body is remarkably TINY, small enough to rest comfortably in the confines of a normal Troll's crushing fist. Despite your size, you are possessed of truly ABSURD levels of DURABILITY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    13lessing or curse, you try your GOSH-DARNDEST to stay positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Normally, a freak such as yourself would be CULLED, however, the IMPERIAL DRONES seem to not notice you. Or perhaps to them you seem to be some kind of LUSUS. Either way, you've managed to be a total leech, contributing nothing yet suckling on the teat of Troll society for your entire life.

Too bad your hive is frequently, to the point of suspicion, ruthlessly demolished by two other Trolls. They seem to be playing some sort of game, and no matter where you relocate it seems your hive is always in a position that is somehow vital to one's victory over the other. You don't hold it against them, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You would, of course, love to play such a dangerous game, and would surely enjoy the rewards thereof, but despite your apparent appeal as a game piece to be captured, being a player in such intrigue is evidently beyond you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tToday is not so different from many other days and though you try to enjoy some calm downtime, the materials which comprise your hive crack and crumble. A powerful, mighty foot comes crashing down, destroying your walls and pinning you to the cold floor beneath an even colder gaze. As you look up to meet this gaze, you recognize the face of today's winner of the search.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it was a tight squeeze, but it wasn't near as bad as being squashed between her ass and the unforgiving rock you found yourself on earlier. In fact, with how soft those seemingly massive mounds of gray were, as well as knowing you were between a pair of frankly incredible rumble spheres, some part of your body was even telling you to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were pretty thankful that there wasn't too far to go back to shore, as it was a little worrying to not even be able to move or wiggle around between the admittedly-amazing breasts, as well as having to deal with them jiggling around you with every stroke of Feferi's arms. Despite being concerned about potentially slipping out of her cleavage as a result, those fears quickly turned out to be unfounded, as your world shifted around quite a bit with the Heiress reaching the shore and climbing back up onto the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterwards, you finally saw a bit of light again as your potential captress (?) parted that considerable cleavage and reached in to scoop you up into her hand again, the feeling of seemingly gigantic gray digits wrapping around your body becoming something you were getting used to far more quickly than you'd prefer.

There is a clanging sound and an increased pressure that follows, as the resident of the hive tramples your already impacted form beneath the metal door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You have a little time to contemplate your agony before the door swings back up, carrying your mashed up body with it. But not all the way. You are flung off the door in the middle of its arc, sending you sailing through the air towards the troll you had meant to meet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    This little bit of fortune, appropriately enough, does you little good, as you are only cogent enough to grasp at whatever hanholds you pray exist at the end of your trajectory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    *WHUMPFT*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You dare to open your eyes just in time to spot the allure of a plush rump. And just in time to smash your face into its shapely spinal crevice. Your rear-first introduction doesn't go unnoticed, but you cling for DEAR HOLY LIFE HOO 13OY. Thusly, your ride's turnabout reveals nothing visible as you swing round like a piece of gaudy jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That Was Bizzarre,\" came a high, sultry voice, wondering what that impact upon her butt could have been.</span></div></div>",

You did most of the physical building, especially considering that it was an actual physical requirement for reasons tautologically paradoxic. The true genius, though you still credit yourself with being at least a pretty smart part of things, was your long-distance friendpal. Your interplanetary pen-palacious xeno-buddy. Your bosom-bestie, your pale-amour, your... oh, you get the idea already. Point is, she's got the smarts to make sure the software side of things is PLUM-DANDY, 13UCKO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In terms of judgment, however, you were sure to have the lion's share. In that you were sure to claim the first bits and gorge yourself until satisfied, leaving only what morsels you deigned not to eat. Meaning that there had better be plenty of the good stuff to go 'round or else poor decisions would rule the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It's too bad your partner in extended metaphors happened to be one to imbibe soporifics. The number three predator of good judgement, just after lions and teen hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As such, you arrive pretty much naked. With only your horns and hands to hide your shame-bulge. You looked up at your inebriated compatriot, hoping your bright head-protrusions might distract from this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You weren't sure if that was the case or not, as she immediately reached for you and lifted you in her hand, which happened to cover most of you. It also gave you a feeling of disquiet as she thumbed your naked front-side and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"omg ur so sooooft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"except these thorny bits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"*horny*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"hehehe horny bits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"ive got those too ya kno\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Before you get a chance to introduce yourself (along with a few of the finer bits of Troll culture regarding modesty) she tries standing up and fails miserably. Apparently, she had placed her portion of the dual apparatus on the ground and directly below a number of glasses on a table or desk. Most of them were empty, but of course, the one you fall into as your supple form is squeezed tightly out of her flailing grip like some kind of cartoon banana shot from a very real and deadly trebuche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You splash right in some pink drink as if with expert aim and attempt to raise yourself out of the soporific fluid, but the sides are too far apart to brace yourself against and too steep to clamber higher up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And then she regains her balance, and reaches instinctively for the only full <br>\r\nglass, bringing the edge to her lips without thinking as she scanned the room for your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"oh man im so sorry lil frend\" she says, unsure where you laned and addressing the seemingly empty room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"hey can u liek\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"say somth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"or is this sum kinda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"accident test\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"*ancient\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"do I have to find u b4 were buds is that the law-code of the horny grayliens?\" she asks, still not noticing you right under her nose.</span></div></div>",

You're really not sure where your long-distance pal resides, exactly, but you're sure it's a doozy of a distance! What's remarkable about this distance, beyond its stupefying magnitude, is how often you have observed this far-off friend emitting Trollisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    For every cultural gaff she committed, there was a boy howdy. Each bizarre movie title was accompanied by a shucks buster. As often as she mentioned a strained, simplified, single-quadrant romantic theory, she lets loose a tarnation. You simply had to know more about this linguistic migration!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Your excitement would have gotten you in some real trouble if it weren't for the very excellent technology available to your friend. She was apparently some sort of heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The journey was smooth and pleasant, and quickly juxtaposed by the terrible tumble you take once it was complete. In your haste you forgot that you lack all necessary skills involved in this endeavor and the result was a completely inaccurate jaunt. You reached out for some kind of handhold. Your voice didn't come out, obviously due to your intense levels of bravery and not at all because the wind being viscerally wrest from within your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Where in blazes is it?\" She demanded, not noticing that you had caught yourself on the lip of her loose shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"This would be a lot easier if I had been informed of what was being sent, dang it!\" She stomped her foot, shaking her body a little and you a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She seemed to notice your wild flailings and desperate pleas because she looked down at that moment and you lost your second wind to her breathtaking hugeness. She seemed equally taken aback and stepped backwards, as if it might somehow prove your stature to be merely an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"JUMPING JEHOSHAPHAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She lost balance at the realization that a tiny person was perched against her bosom, twisted her ankle andbegan to fall over. Your eyes tremble in fear as the behemoth you were clinging to toppled forward, inescapably careening into your weak squishy form.

Subtle for the owner of these travel stalks, yet hardly conducive to your tiny upright posture. You tumble about as your footing betrays you, but you manage to get a look at the big jerk rocking the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most trolls, she is at least ten times larger than you.
