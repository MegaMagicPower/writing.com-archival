            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an unusually bustling night at Beacon Academy. Normally students would be relaxing in their dorms either sleeping or studying but this night was a special occasion. The school has decided to put on something of a show for their students. A little treat to help boost the young adults morale and for this night they were going to be treated to a very special show. Tonight the students of Beacon Academy will be enjoying a Hypnosis Show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents and teachers alike all cram into the Auditorium. The seats were completely filled as students all patiently waited for the show to begin. Teams like JNPR and CFVY speak amongst themselves and speculate on what my happen in the show. Staff like Glynda try to make sure none of students are causing any trouble as she scans the room from the side, and even special guest from other academies  like Winter Schnee stand at the back not really expecting much but is happy to take a quick break. Although one group seems to be mysteriously absent in all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the audience quiets down as they notice the lights dim. All eyes turn to the stage to the giant red curtain that still covers it. A loud voice calls forth from the auditorium speakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentleman of Beacon Academy, I welcome you to a night of fun, fantasy, laughter, and scandal. I am your humble host 'The Hypnotist' and I welcome you to my hypnosis spectacular!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curtains lift to reveal a well dressed man in a top hat standing in front of four girls seated in ar row. the audience appluases and he bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank all but I'm not here alone tonight with me are four gorgeous volunteers that were pre selected to be our lucky victims. Give it up for Beacons own TEAM RWBY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotist steps aside revealing its in fact the four members of the titular team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow I didn't expect everyone to be here for this. I'm getting kind of nervous.\" On the left most seat was the leader of the team, Ruby Rose, who waves back at the audience nervously with a slight blush and a very warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please this is nothing, you should have seen some of the crowds I used to attract when I sung. Those were the days.\" On the second chair to the left was the white haired heiress herself, Weiss Schnee, who was giving a polite hand wave but based on her expression she wasn't really excited to participate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well let's just get this over with. Sooner we get this done the sooner we can get our extra credit.\" In the third seat was the dark and mysterious member of the party, Blake Belladonna, who did not wave and was clearly uncomfortable with all the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on be like that. This is gonna be a ton of fun I can feel it! Cheer up Blake we got a whole room eager to see your smile.\" On the last seat was the blonde bombshell and sister to Ruby, Yang Xiao Long, who playfully elbowed her faunus neighbor before waving triumphantly towards the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the crowd simmers down and the hypnotist comes forward once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you to our lovely volunteers for participating in my show tonight. I have a very exciting show planned for both them and all of you my loving audience. I have so many things planned I may not have time to actually show all of it in one show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolsters towards the audience, it's very clear that The Hypnotist loves to put on a show just in his voice and presentation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just to give you an Idea....\" leaning in towards the audience with a mischievous grin the hypnotist whispers as if he was telling the audience a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an endless supply of props, multiple induction methods, some special SURPRISE guest, and a bottomless wardrobe filled with some fun and some very revealing outfits. Trust me when I say we are going to have a lot of fun with Team RWBY here believe me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team hears all of this of course and they all look towards each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's j-just joking right haha...\" Ruby offers a very nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He better be. I won't be made a fool of so easily.\" Weiss crosses her arms in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this gut talking about?\"  Blake raises an eyebrow curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax guys, like he can actually make us do that.' Yang simply smiles and rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist hears the doubts and concerns and his already large grin grows a little larger and he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have no idea the secrets I have under my sleeves, the powers and tools at my disposal, and the plans I have in store for each individual girl. I am a showman and I always put on the best show. It could be hilarious, sexy, humiliating or all of the above. I always leave my audience want ing more. Whether these girls believe it or not, or whether they like it or not, by the end of the night everyone on this stage will be at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns back to the girls with his large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then that leaves one more question that needs to be answered! <b>How and who will I be hypnotizing first!\"</b> He yells out almost startling the group. He points at them dramatically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime almost freezes as the girls worry and look back and forth between each other and the hypnotist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for either one of them to speak up or him to pick one randomly, but the hypnotist is not a patient man as Someone will be hypnotized here and now and that person will be....</span></div></div>",

Something seems fishy about all of this.\" Weiss asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... It's like Yang said earlier might as well make the most of our time here right? Besides what's the worse that can happen really?\" She shrugs as she turns back to the Hypnotist who comes up to the young huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you for volunteering my dear. Ruby was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ruby Rose sir ready to do... whatever you need me to do for your show.\" While unsure what this all will entail Ruby does her best to keep a positive outlook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby I am happy to tell you that you won't regret your decision. Perhaps your example will encourage your peers to not be so hesitant. If you can stand up and follow me please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby offers her team one final smile before rising from her chair and following the man to the center front of the stage facing towards the audience. She somewhat nervously fidgets as now all eyes are on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be nervous, We are all friends here, well maybe not all. Why don't you tell us a bit more about yourself Ruby?\" Patting her on the back the hypnotist encourages Ruby to speak to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I umm.. My name is Ruby Rose as some of you may or uhh may not know... I'm a student at Beacon you know this academy and I well just really want to become a really great huntress. I-is that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than perfect Ruby. We are going to have a really fun time here to night all you have to do is put on a big smile and follow my lead got it?\" The hypnotist encourages Ruby which she appreciates and nods back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I can do that no problem. Sorry if I seem nervous I just a bit unsure what to expect with this show and all. Truth be told I don't know anything about hypnosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you don't well it's actually rather simple really. here allow me to explain it to you really quick.\" The Hypnotist suddenly swings in front of Ruby, facing her and putting his back to the audience as he stands between the 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypnosis is an act of inducing a state of pure relaxation that makes the recipient extremely open to suggestions.\" While the hypnotist explains this to Ruby he points his finger toward her face, circling it slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I.. um what are you doing?\" She looks towards the finger confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... just remember what I said earlier, put on a big smile and follow my instructions.\" He offers her  grin as he just keeps circling his finger in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby offers back a small and anxious smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah okay but I mean what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Ruby can question any further a subtle but strong Aura started emitting from his body. So subtle that only people close enough could notice, and Ruby definitely noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as that energy appeared Ruby's eyes became magnetically locked onto the tip of his finger, her body freezes up and the only thing that was moving was her eyes as they perfectly match the circling motion of the Hypnotist's finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put on a big smile and follow my instructions....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha...What are you doing to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat no one was aware of was the Hypnotist's secret. That he doesn't just hypnotize people normally but had a semblance with the ability to put people into a obedient trance. He has been abusing it to put people under hypnosis for his show easily and Ruby was getting the brunt of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... just relax Ruby, I'm just doing what I was brought here to do. You're being hypnotized but I wouldn't worry about it. You are doing great so far. Just remember what I told you to do put on a big smile-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And follow your instructions...\" Ruby whispers out, surprised at what she said as if it was an automatic response. The edges of her mouth raising into a small smile as her mind slowly blurs over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you are getting it. That's right just follow my circling finger. In your mind find a colorful spiraling forming in your mind. It's so inviting and makes you feel so good you can't help but just give in...\" The Hypnotist spoke in a quiet hushed tone directly into Ruby's left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby found it harder and harder to think, much less resist. She nods along and just goes along with what she's being told. Imagining the colorful spiral in her mind, unaware that same colorful spiral starts to appear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it...It's so pretty...It's so nice to watch...It's so nice to just give in....\" Ruby parroted back, no longer able to speak for herself but just be lead along by the hypnotist. That smile on her face growing more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Ruby, in a moment I'm going to count from 1-3 and when I reach 3 you will fully succumb to trance.You'll be compelled to obey any and all instructions no matter what. You understand don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I understand...\" Ruby nods happily. Her smile was growing larger and more goofy looking, her eyes were wide open and unblinking with that hypnotic spiral her eye completely engulfing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect, then without further ado... 1-2-3!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*PING*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's mind and body simultaneously click into face. her face frozen in that goofy large wide eyed smile. looking straight ahead towards the hypnotist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCELLENT! Ladies and gentleman I apologies for the silence but I have just hypnotized my first volunteer of the night! Give it up to our lovely entranced Ruby Rose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypnotist turns to the audience and reveals the entranced Ruby to the Audience. A few people already laughing at her stupid looking expression while everyone else applauds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stands awkwardly, her arms hanging limp to her sides, body slightly slouched forward, as she stands smiling towards audience she's currently oblivious to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Ruby why don't you tell the nice people in the audience about the state of mind you are in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hypnotist, I am completely and utterly hypnotized. I have no will of my own, the feeling I have is the overwhelming happiness I fave when I obey you.\" Ruby says so easily with a dreamy tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl and by the way for the rest of the show while you are in a trance you will only refer to me as master okay?\" He wraps an arm around her shoulder and gives a smirk towards the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master. whatever you say.\" She responds with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's such a team player, give her another round of applause, but you know talk is cheap, why don't we give everyone a demonstration Ruby? What shall we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

The Master, comment, she might just be playing along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely under,\u201d The Hypnotist assured them. \u201cDo you have any ideas what you would like to see her do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAct like a chicken!\u201d Yang shouted at once, earning some chuckles from the Hypnotist and the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the chicken act! Everyone suggests that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive her triggers?\u201d Blake suggested. \u201cYou can say something and she\u2019s react subconsciously, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how those work. I take it you\u2019ve been to a hypnosis show before?\u201d Blake nodded at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake her act like someone else?\u201d Weiss suggested with a shrug. \u201cI guess that would be funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll great ideas that will be used throughout the show!\u201d The hypnotist stood up and let the tranced Ruby just sit there so he could address the audience. \u201cDon\u2019t worry ladies and gentlemen. I didn\u2019t forget about you. I plan to have a few situations where I\u2019ll be asking for suggestions. Of course, the big ideas will be saved for the second half. That\u2019s the finale after all. A good show requires build up. Along with how hypnosis works. You can\u2019t get someone who just went under to do something crazy. Their conscious mind would fight against the subconscious. So we start off slow, let the deepness of the trance build up, and have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience clapped and cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Ruby.\u201d This time, the hypnotist addressed her directly. \u201cCan you still hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Hypnotist.\u201d Ruby replied in the same monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, now I want you to lean back in your chair and close your eyes.\u201d Ruby did as he suggested. \u201cI want you to imagine you\u2019re all alone on the beach. It\u2019s a beautiful hot summer\u2019s day. You\u2019re lying on a blanket, enjoying the sun over your body.\u201d Ruby stretched out a bit and smiled. \u201cYou enjoy your day at the beach, don\u2019t you Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice\u2026\u201d Ruby murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hot out though. You can feel the heat and your sweating. That\u2019s only natural as it\u2019s the middle of summer.\u201d Ruby began to look uncomfortable, pulling at her collar and sleeves to bare more skin. Her friends were snickering a little. Even though they knew that they would be next, it was still funny. Keeping them conscious was a way for them to relax by seeing their friend go under. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, next to you is a nice frosty glass of your favorite drink with a straw. Go ahead and take a sip to cool yourself off.\u201d Ruby reached to the empty space to her right and grabbed a \u2018glass\u2019 before bringing it up close to her mouth. Her lips tightened like she was sucking on a straw. \u201cWhat kind of drink is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilk!\u201d Ruby said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd burst out laughing, including her friends. Even the hypnotist couldn\u2019t resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you\u2019re cooled off, you should probably put sun screen on. You don\u2019t want to burn.\u201d Ruby set down the \u2018glass\u2019 and picked up a \u2018bottle\u2019 of sunscreen. She acted like she squirted some into her hand and began to rub it on her arms and legs. \u201cThere you go. Once you finish, you can go back to sunbathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want to go\u2026 swimming\u2026\u201d Ruby murmured, sounding like she was about to doze off. Everyone began to laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, maybe another time, Ruby. For now, when I count to three and say Wake, you will wake up, remembering everything you just did. However, whenever I say Sleep, you will immediately fall back into this state of relaxation. Nod if you understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first trigger I\u2019ll be using on everyone.\u201d The Hypnotist was address the rest of Team RWBY along with the audience. \u201cThis saves time in the long run, as I don\u2019t have to keep putting them under every time I switch to someone else. This way, they can be awake and see the show too.\u201d He turned back to Ruby. \u201c1-2-3- Wake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sat up and looked around. Her face grew red as everyone stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you like your trip?\u201d The Hypnotist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 actually saw myself on the beach and\u2026 it was nice.\u201d Ruby admitted shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d he smiled at her. \u201cAll you had to do was relax and enjoy yourself. Now, let\u2019s give you a chance to watch one of your friends go under.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eyeing up the cute blonde who appeared to be giving him an arrogant smirk in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang was it? Correct me if I'm wrong but did you say that I wouldn't be able to actually hypnotize any of you girls?\" He walks up to her and crosses his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang laughs it off and shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't going to say anything but if you are going to put me on the spot like that then yeah, I don't think you can hypnotize anyone, especially me or my team.\" She looks back up at the hypnotist with a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome \"Oooohhhs\" can be heard scattered in the audience. Yang herself leans back in her chair confident that she won't be hypnotized here tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge? If so I will be more than happy to prove you wrong in front of everyone here tonight. I will be hypnotizing you whether you like it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can certainly try buddy. I wouldn't be up here if I didn't at least want to give you a shot. Besides I like a little challenge myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do you? Well then if you are giving me 1 shot then I might as well pull out my big guns... literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Hypnotist pulls out from his coat pocket what appears to be some sort of toy sci fi laser gun covered in various blinking lights, nobs, and switches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA I'm sorry but what is that? Is that supposed to be a gun? It looks more like a toy.\" Yang couldn't help but burst out laughing at the mere sight of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes this is a gun, a very special gun. This little beauty is my original creation, my <b>Hypnosis Gun</b>. I've been working on it for some Time and wasn't intending to use it during this show but for you my darling Yang I'm going to make an exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off I'm not your darling and second if you think you could hypnotize me with that electric pea shooter of yours then you are crazier than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't think it I know it. This bad boy is the culmination of years of research and hypnotic knowledge. It has a ton of different features and settings that are able to mesmerize and entrance its targets and onlookers alike, but in this instance I think we are just going to start off with the normal setting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe points the 'gun' right towards Yang who simply scoffs unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you are going to do with that? Going to blind me with your little laser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you'll find out, any last words before you go under?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I got one, this is ridiculous Im l-\" Yang was in the middle of getting up when the Hypnotist fired the gun at Yang. Hypnotic waves emit from the muzzle and bombard Yang's body and mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Yang's body stiffens as she sits up on her seat perfectly straight. Her eyes glazing over as she stares up at the gun, becoming glassy and vacant. her jaw falls open slighlty and hangs there leaving Yang with a permanent expression of surprise and confusion on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Yang I didn't catch that. What are you trying to say?\" He jokingly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duuuuuuhhhh...\" She drones on in response. The hypnotic power of the Hypnosis Gun too great to resist, leaving Yang an empty headed doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it seems you are struggling with your words Yang, you are suffering stage fright? I believe you were going to tell me that you believe hypnosis is very real and that you can't wait to be hypnotized right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Hypnosis is real. It's so real. The most real thing ever. I can't wait to hypnotize me tonight. I've wanted to do this so long. This will be amazing.\" Yang responds with a monotone droll. Eyes partially open as she stares longingly towards the <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this everyone is the power of hypnosis. Give our mindless friend Yang a round of applause!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience clap at the display of power shown. Yang was clearly under his power was an amusing sight to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the audience response, The Hypnotist takes his finger off the trigger and pulls back his gun from Yang. With the hypnotic waves gone her mind soon returns to her. She shakes her head and looks around confused as all eyes were suddenly on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Why is everyone staring at me?\" She asks, genuinely unaware of being hypnotized mere seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it my dear. After all the shows only begun and we can have a lot more to do. Now then let's get this show really going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hypnotic blaster in hand, he looks back towards Yang and smiles. As he prepares his next big move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm creating this series for the hypnosis fans like myself who want to have some fun, humorous, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">and somewhat risqu\u00e9</span> fun with our favorite group of huntress'. My main hope for this story is to share and create a hypnosis/Mind control story focused mainly on the hypnosis aspect such as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>Triggers, Post Hypnotic suggestions, commands, altering personalities, messing with peoples memories, mindless trance, have them believe they are something funny like animals</i>. and things of a similar nature<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand less on straight up sex. I hope there are others who enjoy these types of things as and will enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>RULES:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <b>No</b> Violence, BDSM, Death, Vore, Scat, defecation, pregnancy, and M/M.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n- <b>No Sex</b>. (Sexual content like stripping, suggestive dancing, and kissing are okay but please avoid any actual sexually explicit acts.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please try to make your story additions long or substantial. Avoid writing small chapters unless it's a choice chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Always leave and \"Other\" or \"Something Else\" option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you end a branching story please leave an option for someone to continue it just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese Rules are subject to change, please sure to review them before adding any additions to the story.</td>",
