Standing 5'7 and 150 pounds with brown hair and eyes. She loves food. That over full feeling is /almost/ orgasmic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven: Jennifer's husband. He likes curvier women. 6 feet tall and muscular. Does he want her to gain weight or is he enthralled with society's rules on weight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: also 27. He went to high school with Jennifer but they were never friends. In recent years they've struck up an emotionally intimate online friendship. It isn't physical, in fact they haven't seen each other in person since high school. He is an FA and has places a spark of curiosity in Jennifer. </span></div></div>",

Jennifer smoothed her thick brown hair in the mirror and brushed the bread crumbs from sandwich making from her plain white sundress, \"Alright! Out the door, you'll miss the bus!\" Jake, Jennifer and Steven's five year old son protested, \"We've got time! I wanna play with my toys some more!\" Yanking Jake back into the path for the bus, Frank, the level headed eight year old, put him back on track, \"Wait till we get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus doors open for the two children to enter a vehicle brimming with adolescent chaos. Jennifer leans against the door frame as she watched the school bus drive down the friendly neighborhood street. She shakes her her head, \"I miss those carefree days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven walked down the gesturing towards the fabric across his neck, \"Honey. I can't exactly-\" Her slender fingers took the tie, contorting it until it formed a simple Kelvin knot, \"Every morning with you, Steven,\" she giggled going for a kiss. Her husband quickly turned away, grabbing the keys on the coffee table, \"Sorry, sorry. I'm really late.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but don't forget your-\" And he's already out the door. Steven's car quickly backs out of the driveway and down the same friendly neighborhood street the bus traveled, \"I swear he makes more time for work and the gym than he does me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the morning chaos, the only thing occupying Jennifer's attention throughout the day was to scroll through FaceSpace for hours on end. If it weren't so damn entertaining she'd actually make time for hobbies or doing something productive. Instead her eyes would be glued to videos posted on the social media website talking about food, creating the latest and greatest recipes. Her friend, Sam had brought these to her attention, tagging her in these videos constantly. Then the two would discuss the cuisine over private messaging constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sighed, a video of a place specializing in making buckets full of cookies with milk to go along with it made her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I oughta do something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will exactly happen in Jennifer's day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tapped the ribbon with her thumb and a few moments later a message from her friend Sam appeared on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: you wouldn't believe what I had for breakfast! Four waffles drenched in syrup, half a package of bacon, a huge glass of chocolate milk and six donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer: that sounds amazing! You must be stuffed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: I'm so stuffed. It feels amazing. You just have to try it sometime. Eating until you're big and swollen feels so amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer: I believe you! I have the house to myself today. Maybe I'll have an old fashioned pig out ;) oink oink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: you'll love it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an image appeared on her screen of what was obviously Sam's very distended belly. He wasn't fat by any means but if he'd been a woman she'd have though pregnant in that pic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer: that's impressive! Ok that's it! I'm going to do it! Any recommendations for a beginner binge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam: go to a buffet. No one judges you at a buffet ;) in fact if you want I could meet up with you so that you wouldn't be eating alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer bit her lip as she considered how to respond. What would husband say if he learned she'd met up with another man while he was at work. He'd be pissed. That's for sure. But Sam was such a good friend and it would be awkward to stuff herself by herself. And Steven hadn't exactly been attentive to her lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer: sounds good! Just tell me when and where!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was starting to rumble with anticipation. She ran her hands over her slim body from her big boobs to her round hips. This was going to be good.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meet me at Pizzaz in twenty minutes. Be sure to bring your appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer ended her last message with a pig emoji. Fast stepping to the mirror, she made sure her appearance was in order. Yep, everything looks the same as it was minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short drive into town brought Jennifer to Pizzaz Pizzeria. An upscale pizza buffet that was both adult and kid friendly. Across the street she saw Sam's car, already parked, \"He must be inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne step into the buffet lobby sent Jennifer's mouth watering. The scent of freshly baked pizza made her stomach rumble. \"Yo. Jen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer turned around to see Sam who had a friendly smile on his face. Sam wasn't bad in the looks department. He's basically a 7 compared to Steven. Yet he's been earning himself a place closer since he's been showing how caring and attentive he can be. However he is a little too scrawny for her tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sam stepped from the chair in the corner, Jennifer caught an eyeful of his still distended stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Sam! You're still full?\", Sam nodded his head, \"I helped myself to a few bear claws after I sent you the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I t-touch it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam nodded once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne index finger poked the firm surface of Sam's stomach. Jennifer took it back with glee, \"OMG! You're really full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began a short conversation that got cut short by the impatient teenage cashier, \"Table for two?\" He said with a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier handed them both standard sized cups that were so large in diameter that Jennifer needed both hands to hold it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet came with downright wacky combinations for pizza toppings. From plain and simple cheese and pepperoni to Macaroni and cheese and fried clams trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sam and Jennifer headed to the buffet. Much to her surprise, Sam still piled his plate full of pizza. In fact he carried multiple plates. Jennifer, one to be competitive, didn't want to seem weak in his eyes. She upped his game by grabbing herself four plates and too piling those up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 3 plates of pizza and two cup fills of cherry cola, Jennifer had hit her limit. She leaned back in her chair holding her taut stomach. It distended and pushed on the front of her sundress, leaving a bulged impression, \"I don't think I can take one more bite,\" she delivered over dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I said bring your appetite. It's still in there somewhere,\" said Sam getting up from the table toward the buffet. Seconds later he comes back with your plates rippling with pizza and cinnamon sticks, \"Sam, you're crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who's crazy for giving into their limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer scoffed, she sucked in a bit of air and sat back up. It took much mental preparation to finish the rest of what Sam brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last slice of pizza lifted into the air by Sam's hand. He brought it forth to Jennifer's lips. She took bite after bite, each on bigger than the last, until the last remains were pushed into her lips. She kicked her full lips and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer slightly wiggled her hips and curled her toes. There was something about being stuffed to the limit that made her feel...orgasmic. She couldn't explain it. Clearly she needed to snap out of it when she bit her lip in ecstasy, \"Uhh, yeah I'm okay. Stomach is just tight and all,\" she said poking her overly distended gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her permission, Sam poked it too. She restrained from letting out any sort of moan, \"Woah. You. Are. Stuffed!\" He said with excitement lingering in his voice. He fished around in his pants pocket and produced two pills. He popped one for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam slides the other pill over to Jennifer. It's colorless and oval in shape like most pills, \"It's a digestion enhancer. After taking this you'll be starving in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugged his shoulders as if it were no big deal, \"You can find it at any drugstore really. It's called Hungerall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. That's a weird name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer thought this through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, the day is still young. She'd hate to retire so early on account of her fullness. This pill seemed like a solution to keep the fun going. Even Sam looked like he was greatly enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't just end the fun could she?</span></div></div>",
