Instead, the town is being ravaged by forces beyond human comprehension and the whole area is slowly becoming a battleground between the living and the dead. Now you must choose someone to guide through the piling snow and pouring blood, someone who can solve the mystery of this otherworldly terror... or at least escape with their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you follow into the unfolding nightmare?</span></div></div>",

It looked almost like one of those quaint little towns you'd see on the back of a postcard. Almost. Streaks and puddles of deep red crimson clashed with the otherwise serene landscape, the primary evidence of the slaughter that had occurred over the last twenty four hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie let out a sigh and closed the curtain as a trio of three pale figures passed by a neighboring house in search of victims. \"Those things have been up and walking around since yesterday. Thank god Maggie is in another state...\" he mumbled to himself as he gripped his police-issued handgun in a holster on his belt. \"Its been a day now, the news has to have some explanation of what is going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way downstairs to his small living room Richie cast a quick glance at his barricaded front door to make sure it still held. He wasn't sure if any of those things knew he was in here, but job experience told him it was very unwise to take chances in a life and death situation like this. After turning down the volume he switched on his small flat screen tv and tuned in to the local news channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in his late fifties was giving a report on the local area and how there had been many disappearances in the last twenty four hours, yet nothing he said seemed to acknowledge the plague of walking dead that had arisen. Either things hadn't spread too far outside the town or the reporter didn't have the slightest clue about what was really going on. This wasn't too surprising given how far Glitterice was from the rest of civilization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie turned off the tv and looked out his living room window. The snow was still flurrying outside just as it had been since the day before and the ground now looked to have accumulated a good seven or eight inches. A pale figure stirred next to a parked car covered in snow and Richie quickly stepped away to avoid any unneeded attention. He hated sitting here on his ass and waiting for the government to come in and fix the situation, which could take several days even in the best circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a cop for god's sake, I should be out there helping people.\" Richie said to himself as he shut off the tv and headed back upstairs. He sat down on his bed and look around at the supplies he had gathered up that morning sitting on the dresser next to his bed and on a nearby table. The thought of waiting here for help wasn't so bad compared to that of heading out into a snowstorm filled with the undead, but Richie was restless from hearing the screams and chaos of the night before...</span></div></div>",

Before leaving he took the time to hide a few emergency supply stashes in case of looters and made sure everything was locked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter also making sure the coast was clear Richie slowly opened his front door and began carefully walking down his driveway. The bushes and abandoned vehicles made excellent spots for an ambush, something that kept him on his guard as he stepped out onto the snow covered sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead was a large overturned semi with its back trailer door stuck half open due to some sort of jam. In the cargo hold were several stacked boxes of food such as canned goods and cereal. Most of the packages looked untouched, but a few were torn open in places and a large red smear of blood had frozen over the side of one of the containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie was just about to investigate when he noticed a wrecked police cruiser from his department crashed into someone's yard about 50 feet further down the street. The cracked windshield and bloodstains made it clear that whoever had been inside was dead, though there might still be some supplies inside it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance an echo of moans began softly blowing through the trees...</span></div></div>",

With his gun drawn he tried pulling the back door the rest of the way open, but it wouldn't budge any further than it already was. With a sigh Richie picked up a few miniature boxes of cereal and put them away in case he needed a snack later. Afterwards he headed up front to check where the driver should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the sight of a blood coated door window told him all he needed to know about the unfortunate person who had been transporting the truck. \"Wonder if there is anything up here that might be useful?\" Richie whispered to himself as he hopped up and swung open the door. At least it wasn't locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA putrid smell hit Richie in the face as the image of a dead man slumped against the seat filled his vision. A trail of blood leading from a gash on the top of his head to the side of the door gave Richie all the info he needed on how the trucker perished. Just as Richie moved over to open the dash box the man stirred and let out a soft groan. Startled, Richie pulled himself back as the man opened his eyes and stared at Richie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the name of god...?\" Richie whispered in a horrified tone as the glowing green light of the truckers once hazel eyes focused on him. Before he could react the man lunged and bit into Richie's arm with a mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. With a pained scream Richie instinctively pulled the trigger on his gun and fired a round through the Infectors neck that pierced the opposite door window and caused a fresh spray of blood to splatter over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath Richie stumble out onto the snowy road with a thud, his gun dropping and landing just under the bottom of the semi. His eyes widened in fear when he realized his whole body was going numb as the zombie trucker climbed out to finish him. Richie prayed for a quick death as the thing got to its feet, but was surprised when it just stood over him, still leaking blood through its neck hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Richie passed out his last confused thoughts where of the world that had existed just a few days ago. A snowy little town where the most exciting things to happen were usually just a flat tire or a disorderly drunk. As the minutes passed after his heart stopped beating the Infector lurched off in search of more prey to add to the growing hordes of undead. When Richie's eyes finally opened again they were filled with a hateful red light and a lust for carnage. After climbing to his feet he too left in search of fresh victims.</span></div></div>",

Pulling open the passenger side door, Richie found a small portable radio sitting in the front passenger seat.  \"I might be able to use this.\" Richie thought as he picked it up.  When he switched it on, nothing happened.  Opening the battery compartment, he found it was empty.  \"Figures.\" Richie sighed, rolling his eyes as he slipped the radio into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around to the back of the cruiser, he lifted the trunk lid to find it was loaded with police equipment.  It had several bulletproof vests, some SWAT tactical armor, a few pistols and submachine guns, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a riot shield.  Rich put away his handgun and started sorting through everything.  \"This might be useful later on.\" Richie said to himself as he slipped a bulletproof vest over his sweater and put on the tactical armor.  Putting the weapons into his duffel bag, Richie slung the bag over his shoulder and looked around at the street.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could check any of the surrounding houses for survivors, investigate the overturned truck nearby, or head back to his house.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Richie knew that as a cop his primary mission was to help people and now that he had plenty of gear there was no reason for him to attempt to avoid danger if it meant saving innocent lives. With his riot shield ready to bat aside any threat he came across Richie moved down the street quickly looking for any signs of life in the nearby houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings looked pretty grim with several homes broken into or boarded up, many had doors that swung gently in the frigid breeze as snow piled inside or open windows that were cracked from unknown damages. Any house that wasn't broken open was locked up tight, especially on the ground floor and few had dared to leave any sort of lighting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie let out a sigh when he received no answer after knocking on the front door of a large house with boarded up windows and a single lamp on in an upstairs bedroom. \"Either no one is home, or they don't want to talk to me.\" he said solemnly as he walked back down the driveway and continued moving up the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to pass by an intersection and move onto the next block a small utility van sped down the opposite sidewalk and swerved sharply around a mailbox onto the next street. Just as soon as it had appeared it vanished again into the thick snowfall as the driver desperately tried to escape the monsters that had risen in Glitterice. Richie leaned onto a bent stop sign for support as he listened to the van disappear into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he already crossed the street its unlikely the driver would have seen him in time (or simply not care if he did) and would have run him over. \"Damn, its getting more dangerous out here by the minute...\" Richie gasped as his breathing slowly returned to normal. \"I can't just keep going on like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a fresh choir of moans and roars began closing in, no doubt drawn in by the sound of the speeding van...</span></div></div>",

Normally, he would be more concerned with getting out of there but as chance would have it he noticed a pair of keys still in the ignition of a a small purple van. \"Shit, does this belong to someone or...?\" he began to wonder as the moans drew closer. He looked up at the nearby houses, no lights on and at least two doors broken wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it, whoever owned this is long gone or dead.\" Richie said as he smashed in the driver side window and unlocked the door. He turned the keys and held his breath as the van slowly hummed to life. \"Thank god, it still works.\" he whispered as he pulled away from the sidewalk and began cruising down the road. The fuel meter told him he had half a tank of gas left, enough to get out of town or at least check a few places in the nearby area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie rubbed his head a bit as he pulled onto the driveway of an abandoned house and tried to think for a moment. Unfortunately, the peace and quiet was short lived as a growl echoed from the back seat. He turned around just in time to see a young girl in a pink coat lunge forward and bite into his right arm. \"FUCK!\" Richie shouted in surprise and anger as he brought the little girl forward with his free hand and threw her against the cracked windshield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force wasn't strong enough to send her out onto the hood, but still powerful enough to shatter the center of the windshield and send glass flying all over the dashboard. \"Jesus Christ...\" Richie gasped as the little girl let go of his arm and tried to grab his face. Thinking quickly he held her at bay with his foot as he unbuckled his belt and opened the door. After tumbling outside into the cold he then struggled to his feet as the little girl spilled out of the van behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were a deep red and fresh blood poured from a wound she had received a short time before. She looked to be only about seven or eight and aside from a missing boot, the blood, her eyes and a pale face appeared to be a completely normal child. She opened her mouth to snarl as a trail of crimson poured down her lip. \"I'm sorry.\" Richie said as he pulled his nightstick from his belt. The girl stumbled forward only to catch a powerful blow that knocked her to the ground and sent several teeth flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up with a broken jaw as he brought the nightstick down on her head a second time. He swore that he heard her skull crack, though she was still trying to move forward. \"I'm sorry...\" Richie said once again as he delivered another blow. The little girl twitched a bit as her head split open before finally falling silent in the snow. Richie dropped his nightstick and fell backwards onto the cold ground as he watched a miniature ocean of blood flood the footprints he made in the snow around the little zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few minutes to collect himself Richie picked up his nightstick and climbed back into the van. Upon checking the back seat he noticed a blood stained blanket along with a few dolls and other toys. \"She must have been hurt out there...and her parents left her in the van while they went to get help or something...Jesus...\" he muttered as he began to sweep the broken glass on the dashboard to the floor. Then he noticed a small red mark on his arm...right where the little girl had bitten him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh fuck...\" Richie whispered as he pulled back the torn cloth to see five tiny little red tooth marks on his bare arm. At least two had broken the skin and were bleeding slightly. He immediately fell back in his seat as the full weight of the horror washed over him. This was just like in those movies and comics he had read where getting bitten or scratched by the undead turned you into one. Deep down he wasn't sure if the same rules applied here, but it was a very unnerving thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it, I'll just have to keep an eye on it for now...I can't waste any more time worrying. There are still people out there who I can save, even if I don't make it...\" he said as he started the van back up. Not sure how much time he had left Richie did know one thing: he was going to help as many people as he could, even if he didn't make it out of this alive. The only question is...where will he start?\"</span></div></div>",

The wound on his arm was now disinfected and bandaged even though it still stung like a motherfucker. \"Hopefully, the pain is just from the adrenaline wearing off.\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a large white building came into view as he rounded a corner past a house that had \"NO ENTRY\" spray painted across the garage door in big blue letters. \"There's the church.\" Richie said as he pulled into the surprisingly full parking lot and stepped out onto the sidewalk in front of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie pulled out his handgun and checked its ammo before tucking it away out of sight. \"Last thing I wanna do is start a fight in a church, but I wouldn't even go inside a friends house unarmed in this type of situation.\" he said quietly as he looked around for zombies. Amazingly enough, the coast was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess even the undead don't like going to church. Maybe my luck is changing.\" he chuckled to himself as he walked through the flurry of falling snowflakes. It was hard to keep a positive attitude after everything he had witnessed so far, but the sight of a few lights through the boarded up windows made Richie feel a calm like he hadn't since this whole ugly mess began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a light tap on the door he announced his presence and waited patiently for the response. After about a minute the door swung open so suddenly that it nearly startled Richie into pulling his gun. Before him stood a middle aged woman in jeans and a thick sweater. Aside from some unkempt hair she wasn't bad to look at and she seemed welcoming enough with her faint smile upon seeing Richie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello officer, I'm really glad to see you.\" she said warmly as she stepped back to let him in. \"Please, do you have any news from the outside? Is this thing almost over?\" She seemed a little nervous, but friendly enough given the circumstances. \"I'm afraid I don't ma'am, whatever this is seems to be spreading like a plague. Of all the houses I checked before coming here nobody responded. Either everyone is dead or hiding out hoping this thing blows over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" the woman replied solemnly as her face sank a little. \"I figured I expected as much but...\" she trailed off as a lean man in overalls and a red and white baseball cap walked up and offered Richie his hand. \"Sorry to interrupt ya, officer. I'm sure you're here to help, but everyone is a little on edge right now. Could I ask you to follow me please?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She nodded her head and waved as Richie walked off. \"See you later, officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the hat rubbed his head as he led Richie past the pews where families and friends were huddled together, about thirty people in total, all whispering or sobbing as they discussed their current situation. \"Sorry for the rude welcome.\" the man in the hat suddenly speaks up as he passes a pair of children coloring on the floor. \"Most of us have lost people here, either to those things outside or to the weather and nobody wants to head out there and look for missing survivors. I'm Stan, by the way, the woman you met at the door is Juliana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie sighs as he looks around at the sad scene before him. \"I can say its pretty bad out there, I don't blame you all for huddling together in here.

After you.\" Stan replied as he gestured for Richie to go ahead with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie walked inside a darkened hallway as Stan followed behind him and flipped on a light switch. \"We try to conserve power by keeping any unnecessary lights off. Plus we don't want to draw too many of those things over here, one of our guys had to smash in the skull of some poor high schooler who wandered into the parking lot with a snow shovel the other night. Still talks about how it nearly took his damn leg off with its claws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I've run into a few myself...is he okay?\" Richie asked as Stan escorted him down the narrow hall and around the corner. \"Yeah, we go out in pairs when we need to head outside so he had some backup. Still, hell of a thing for a man to have to do.\" Richie just shook his head as memories of the little girl came back. \"No kidding.\" he said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, officer.\" Stan said as he turned the knob on a door at the end of the hall and pulled it open. \"Boss, you have a new visitor.\" Inside the room was an older man sitting behind a large wooden desk which had his crumpled shirt laying on top of it. Next to him was a pretty blonde girl in her twenties, completely nude from head to toe, leaning on his arm and rubbing her hand across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it, I told you people to knock before entering! What is it that you don't understand about that?\" the man groaned as he pushed the woman aside and put his shirt back on. He looked to be in his fifties or sixties and had a thick goatee and mustache along with a balding head and graying hair. He looked over both Richie and Stan with a sour look on his face as the woman walked over to a chair where her clothes were sitting and began to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the interruption sir, but this can't wait. The new guy is a cop and he might be able to help us.\" Stan replied as he walked inside and pulled out a chair to sit on while gesturing for Richie to do the same. \"Have a seat then, we can talk over cigars and brandy.\" the man said as he pulled a bottle out of the desk along with a few glasses. \"So new guy, what do you think of the place?\"</span></div></div>",

Sighing with relief, he sat down on the couch and laid his duffel bag on the coffee table.  He then pulled out the radio he'd grabbed, walked into the kitchen retrieved a battery from one of the drawers, slid it into the battery compartment of the radio, and flipped it on.  \"Hello.\" he said into the radio's mic \"Is there anyone out there that's still alive.\".  All Richie got was static.  \"Blizzard must be messing with the reception.\" he thought \"I'll try again later.\".  Richie went back into the living room, sat back down on the couch, and began prepping his weapons.  After half an hour,</span></div></div>",

It was hard to see with the lights out, but her guess was that it was a little past noon or maybe a little before. Her son Tyson was still sleeping upstairs in his room, soundly despite the terror of the previous day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie had picked him up early from school and they had stopped at a local supermarket when a man in a bloody shirt attacked a family next to her and ripped the mother's throat out when she tried to shield her children from him. In the chaos that followed she quickly scooped up her son and ran to the car before the entire store began to riot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home they had passed a few nightmarish sights and sounds, but arrived safely just as the snow began to pick up and coat their yard in a fresh blanket of white. The rest of that day had been spent trying to console her son and keeping an eye on the news for any clue as to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, whatever had happened, be it a terrorist attack or some sort of pandemic, wasn't widespread enough to get more than a mention on a local channel that advised residents to stay indoors amid rioting and attacks in the street. Allie had tried phoning friends and relatives to see what was going on, but no one had a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only positive to this situation was that the power was still on in most suburbs and that the cold weather helped deter whatever was walking around outside from finding them.

Startled by the noise Allie grabbed a kitchen knife off of the counter and headed over to see what the commotion was. The door had no windows so Allie had no way of knowing what lurked on the other side, which made her very nervous. \"Hello, is anyone there?\" she asked loudly as she readied herself to turn the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god, please... I need help...\" came the soft reply as whoever was outside leaned on the side of the house for support. \"Hang on.\" Allie replied quickly as she slowly pulled the door open. Standing outside on her front porch was a delivery man with a thick coat covering his brown uniform. His truck was parked across the street and it looked like a nasty wound was bleeding through the cloth on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, did one of those things get you?\" Allie asked worriedly as she stepped out onto the porch to get a better look. The snow was cold on her bare feet, but she hardly noticed as the man groaned and pulled away a bloody hand to show her the injury. Bite marks had broken the skin on his right shoulder deep enough to draw blood and tear away a good chunk of the cloth from the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks a lot worse than it probably is...\" the man says as he forces a weak smile. \"Do you have a first aid kit or some bandages I can have?\" Allie frowned and took a step back, ready to slam the door closed if he tried anything. \"I don't know... you could have an infection or anything... I've seen movies like this. People who get bit or scratched turn into more of whatever is attacking the town... you could become one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Allie's surprise the man lets out a gentle laugh. \"I've seen my share of zombie flicks as well, hell, these things probably are some form of undead... but I already got scratched yesterday trying to get back to my neighborhood.\" At this point the man rolls up his sleeve to show her a few small scratch marks on his left wrist. \"These things are dangerous, but whatever is causing this ain't a virus... please, can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie grips her knife tightly and tries to think, what should she do...?</span></div></div>",

Without warning she then pressed a small cloth with disinfectant onto Jared's shoulder and held it in place. Best to get the painful part out of the way as soon as possible. Jared let out a muffled groan and squirmed a bit, but managed to keep his composure as Allie began to fix up his bite and wrap some clean bandages around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is my chance to ask him a few questions.\" Allie thought to herself. \"But what should I ask about...?\"</span></div></div>",

Everything had happened so fast, a normal day turned into a nightmare as dead bodies began to rise and prey on the living. Each fresh corpse soon returned to a state of unlife as well, creating more and more undead until they started to overrun the entire town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie turned away from the gruesome scene and decided to head back downstairs to see how the others were doing. All in all, there were just under a dozen people taking refuge at the bowling alley. Alley and her son, Tyson, a family of five who had introduced themselves as the Jordans, a young father and son known as Tim and Jamie, and a few loners named Cher and Aaron. Some had been here since the night before while the others came by earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had plenty of food thanks to the snack bar and the front doors were secured and barricaded enough to deter any threats, though some of the adults had begun to get nervous. Many of the people here had young children and knew that they couldn't stay trapped forever, especially with the backup generator at only half power already. The kids all seemed fairly content at least, playing free games and eating junk food without worrying about school seemed like a pretty good deal to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Allie, how are you holding up?\" came a voice off to the side at one of the tables. It was Tim, who was eating a burger and fries alongside his son Jamie, who was enjoying a shake and pizza. Allie forced herself to smile as she took a nearby seat and polished off the last of her wine. \"I'm not gonna lie, I've been better. I'm just glad everyone is okay.\" she replied as she looked over at Tyson, who was bowling against a kid from the Jordan family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly, at least.\" Tim replied solemnly as he looked down at his wedding ring. \"My wife and two of the older Jordan kids are still out there in that mess.\" He sighed as Allie put a hand on his shoulder. \"I'm sure they're fine, they're probably just stuck holed up somewhere like us. I'm sure things will get sorted soon and then we can all go home.\" she replied, trying to keep his spirits up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim smiled as Allie got up to go check on her son. \"I sure hope so, thanks.\" With that Allie walked over to the other parents and watched as the kids continued their game. Allie was glad that things had stabilized a bit after the insanity of the past few hours, but she knew it couldn't last. If they were to survive they couldn't just wait around for someone to come along and save them. The police and the army could still be days or even weeks away from rescuing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie knew the others were thinking the same thing... the question is, what were they going to do?</span></div></div>",

He had made the shack himself from wood he had gathered a few years back, but he was no carpenter and constantly had to repair and maintain it, especially around this time of year when the temperatures dropped. Honestly, the fact that he hadn't frozen to death yet was a minor miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened to the fire sizzle and pop along with the groans of the things that were walking about outside. Despite the isolation of his makeshift house several uninvited guests had shown up late last night and up until about an hour ago. They were slow and weak, nothing compared to a man like Hanson, but their numbers seemed to grow as the day wore on. At the rate they seemed to multiply it would only be another day or two before he got overrun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson gripped a small hatchet in his hand and pulled back the thick blanket he had set over the doorway of his small home. He saw two of the small ones off in the field about 50-70 yards away stumbling by just under the tree line in front of the local forest. They wouldn't see him, but Hanson didn't like letting in more cold air than he needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he turned over a log on his tiny campfire and went through his backpack. He still had some snack food, two flashlights, spare batteries, a multi-tool and his small collection of loaned library books, due back in just under two weeks. He knew if this kept up he'd have to leave soon, but hiking to town in the cold was dangerous, even if it was only a mile or two away. He took a moment to consider his options as he looked over his hatchet in the dim glow of the fire.</span></div></div>",

He decided to stash most of his supplies away in case of emergency and to make sure he had plenty of room in his backpack so he removed everything except for one of the flashlights, some spare batteries, his multi-tool and a bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking one last minute to look around and make sure his meager possessions were secure he headed out into the cool chill of the afternoon air. It was snowing heavily, making it hard to see things in the distance aside from a few lights from distant houses. Hanson didn't want to stay out in the cold longer than he had to and was quick to begin his short hike into town. The snow was several inches deep, but his thick boots helped keep his feet from getting numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Hanson had seen his fair share of extreme conditions in his younger years and wasn't unnerved by the potential blizzard brewing around the town. What made him uneasy was the otherworldly chill in the air. Hanson had a strong gut feeling for when things were going to shit... and right now it told him things were going straight to FUBAR even with the walking corpses roaming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes the road leading into town came into view beyond the patch of bushes lining the ditch. On the other side of the road was a forest so thick with snow build-up it looked like someone had poured mashed potatoes all over the treetops. Hanson was cautious, even though he wanted to get to town as quick as possible. After all the shit he had seen the past few days he wouldn't be surprised to see a damn yeti pushing through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly enough, Hanson made it to the outer edge of town without incident and slowed his pace only slightly as several houses began passing him by on either side. Some still had their lights on, but most were dark and a few were even boarded up. For a moment Hanson considered checking on them to see if anyone might be willing to let him inside for a while and explain what the hell was going on. It would be nice to have some shelter, but in a situation like this there was no telling how people might react...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanson didn't like the idea of relying on others, but he knew when cooperation and teamwork was needed and today was definitely the beginning of one of those times. Once things got worse he knew it would be better to be part of group rather than try to go alone. After all, those undead monsters seemed to be multiplying by the hour and it wouldn't be long before they outnumbered the humans ten to one... if they didn't already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson walked up the snow covered driveway of a small house on the edge of the woods. This was one of the few places to still have a vehicle in the yard so it probably also had the best chance of still having someone inside. When he reached the door he knocked gently enough so that someone could hear him without sounding too aggressive like a burgler or home invader. When no answer came he turned to leave before hearing something stir inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson stood his ground and readied himself to swing his hatchet if a threat lurked behind that door when it opened. The footsteps stopped right in front of the door and then everything fell silent for a few seconds. Just as Hanson was about to knock again a soft voice shaking with fear came from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-hello? Is anyone there?\" It was barely audible through the door and Hanson tried to speak up when he answered. \"Yes, ma'am. I'm from a ways down the road and could use some shelter. Most people call me Hanson, may I come in?\" A longer silence followed as he leaned in close to make sure he didn't miss the reply. \"It's awfully cold out here.\" he added as he took a quick look around the front yard to make sure it was still clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door opened slightly as a small woman peeked through the gap. \"Hanson? I know you... my husband has seen you hunting in the woods around here. You live in that shack up the road.\" she replied as she looked him over. Hanson tried his best to look nonthreatening as he lowered his scarf to show her his whole face. \"Alright, you can come in for now. Be warned my husband is in the other room cleaning his guns, so don't cause any trouble.\" she says meekly as she opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" Hanson replied as he walked into the small little house. The living room in front of him was like most you'd see in any home, a tv was broadcasting from the local news station and an inviting leather sofa was occupied by a couple of young boys reading comic books next to a young woman in an orange hunting cap. \"Must be her kids.\" Hanson thought to himself as he wiped the snow off his feet and left his boots near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me.\" The woman instructed. \"You'll need to talk with my husband.\" Hanson nodded and followed her into a small room with various hunting supplies decorating the walls and table. Aside from a few gun racks and mounted deer heads the room was fairly basic with a single small window overlooking the front yard. \"Honey, we have a visitor.\" the woman called as she gently knocked on the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send them on it, I'm not busy.\" came the reply as the man turned to face them. \"Happy to meet ya, stranger.\" he says cheerfully as he extends his hand. He was a fairly skinny man, but with a lot of bulk and a somewhat muscular frame. In addition to a flat top haircut he had short mustache and a cigar clenched between his teeth. Hanson smiled as he shook the man's hand and introduced himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanson batted aside a young faun with half of its neck torn out as it lunged towards him. \"This way Randal, I think I see the path up ahead!\" he called out to a man in a green outfit and brown jacket as he stomped the dead deer's brains in. \"I'm coming, just keep an eye out!\" came the reply as Randal smashed the butt of his hunting rifle against the skull of a stray raccoon with its guts torn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only been a day at the most, but the undead creatures infesting the nature preserved seemed to grow thicker by the hour. Hanson hadn't even intended to come here, but when he witnessed a stray dog getting run over by a car on his way home he decided he had to stop and help. To his surprise the creature immediately got up as if nothing was wrong and attacked him and the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Hanson thought that it had become hysterical from the pain and lashed out in confusion, but after it tried to bite his hand he noticed a deep fang wound on its neck as well as its glowing red eyes. Reasoning that it couldn't be saved he put the dog out of its misery with a single stomp to the head. After that he joined the driver when he drove to the nearby nature preserve to report what had happened and show them the carcass in hopes of finding out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the preserve was in the middle of its own crisis as several wild animals had suddenly begun to attack anything that dared to enter their domain, leaving the nearby campgrounds in a state of panic as park rangers scrambled to control the disaster before it could spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson and the driver ran into Randal at the main station as he was preparing to head out and check on his buddies who had gotten cut off from the radio shortly beforehand. It was there that the full weight of the situation hit them as a bear covered in bloody wounds attacked the driver when he stepped outside to take a piss before the trio left. Randal managed to put the bear down with a few shotgun slugs to the head, but the driver passed away from his wounds shortly afterwards...and reanimated minutes later while the two men were bringing him back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson and Randal managed to avoid getting hurt, but the driver departed the same way as the bear had, leaving the two men to head out alone. The event had shaken Randal, but he hid it well as they made contact with a group of campers hiding in their RVs about three miles from the nearby ranger station. It was late and starting to snow very heavily when they arrived so the two ended up spending the night there to rest and recuperate from the nightmarish events of the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning arrived with a fresh layer of snow and a continued flurry of small while flakes drifting down from the heavens. Taking the park truck back to the station would be impossible in the current conditions so Hanson proposed leaving the campers most of the guns and supplies while they set out on foot. Randal agreed with the plan and the two men set out on their journey to the ranger station to contact help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was roughly three hours ago and now that noon approached with even more ice and frost the whole situation began to look more and more hopeless. It was too late to just turn back now though, as Randal had found a path onto the hiking trail that would lead them right to the ranger station and cliffside overlook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not far now, just be careful. We're going uphill and this snow is making it hard to walk.\" Randal says as he catches up to Hanson near the base of a large tree. \"How is your handgun holding out?\" Hanson popped the clip and took a look at it before putting it back in. \"Nine bullets in the mag, two more full clips after this one. Yourself?\" Randal checked his own gun and let out a sigh. \"I've got four shots. Maybe I should have taken an extra box of bullets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson paused for a moment and put a hand over his forehead as he scanned the clearing up ahead. Through the thick flurry of snowflakes he could make out a small brown building with a tall thin tower next to it. \"I think we found the station.\" Hanson mumbles as he looks around to make sure the coast is clear. \"Thank god.\" Randal replies as he wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. \"Let's hurry and get inside before this weather gets any worse.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aside from a tiny table and chair there wasn't much to the place. About the only decorations were a torn rug on the floor and a small dream catcher mounted on the wall just above one of the cracked windows. What immediately caught Hanson's attention wasn't any of that though, but a small radio that was sitting atop the table next to a box of rifle bullets...smashed by a blunt object of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch...\" Hanson muttered as he picked up a fragment of the broken radio and tossed it on the floor. \"Someone did this deliberately...they must not want anyone to know what happened here.\" He shook his head and grabbed the box of bullets. \"At least Randal will some extra rounds for his gun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving Hanson stepped outside the small watchtower and moved over to the side of the railing overlooking the cliff below him. It was hard to see more than 1000 feet with the bad weather and trees in the way, but one thing Randal had remembered to bring was a couple pairs of binoculars. Hanson grabbed his pair and took a quick look around at the surrounding area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hillside to the east was too steep to worry about, but some movement caught Hanson's eye near the forest below him. On the far edge of the lower trail a large horde of zombies was slowly making its way up towards the ranger station and would likely arrive within half an hour. \"Oh shit.\" Hanson cursed as he looked around for a way to cut them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he was about to give up hope he spied a worn wooden bridge connecting the trail over a long drop about 100 feet below him. If he could collapse that bridge before they reached him they would likely fall to their deaths trying to get across. \"I just need to find some sort of fire or explosive.\" Hanson noted as he put the binoculars away and began climbing down the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud scream rang out as a shot fired inside the ranger station...Randal was in some serious trouble. \"Fuck!\" Hanson shouted as he jumped past the last few steps to the ground. \"They probably have what I need to drop the bridge in storage, but Randal's in the main building! If I stop to help those monsters might make it across the bridge!\" Without wasting another second Hanson broke into a sprint as Randal let out another scream and fired a second shot out of his rifle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt hated the idea of going outside alone, but if he didn't get out of here soon he'd likely find himself snowed in with a mob of frozen corpses. Even if he didn't run out of supplies he doubted he'd be able to fend off a large group of zombies by himself, especially ones like the thing he had seen through his window. It had been hard to see from his motel room but the large flying undead had picked up another zombie and carried it off somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf monsters like that were out there hidden in the blizzard covering Glitterice what chance did he have to survive, even with some kind of support? Matt zipped up his coat as he walked over to the window and pulled back the curtain to get a good look at the outside. The snow was still falling, but most of the walking corpses were walking down the road towards something that caught their attention behind a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt figured now was the best chance he'd have with them distracted and grabbed a knife before walking out into the cold. \"Fuck my life.\" he groaned as he looked over at a gap torn out of the railing where someone or something had fallen down into the parking lot. At least he now knew what that loud thump he heard the other night was. He peered down at the smashed roof of a car that had frozen streaks of blood trailing off into the snow. Great, whoever died was probably still out there wondering around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new resolve to get done as quickly as possible Matt walked over to the neighboring door and opened the knob with his knife at the ready. The inside was shrouded in darkness, but that was quickly fixed by him flicking on the nearby lightswitch. Hopefully the power would hold out for at least another day or two. Without some sort of heating unit survivors would have to rely on making fires to stay warm... if there were even any other survivors left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes looking around it became clear that whoever had been here before left in a hurry when this shit first went down and that they took everything of value with them. There wasn't even a single bar of soap in the bathroom. With a sigh Matt headed back out into the freezing air to check on the next motel room. Empty as well except for a bottle of ketchup and some condiment packets from the local diner. Better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another empty room Matt came to a door covered in a thin layer of frost. An uneasy feeling swept over him as he tried to peek in through the motel window, but it was froze over as well. \"I know its cold out, but unless some motherfucker set off a liquid nitrogen blast inside this place it shouldn't be froze over like this.\" he noted as he tried turning the knob on the door. It creaked and groaned as it turned in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt didn't like this, but there were only two other rooms left to search on this floor before he'd have to make his way downstairs and he had very little to show for his efforts so far. He needed to find some more supplies, but his gut told him something was dangerous about this room. After a moment of thinking he decided to...</span></div></div>",

Though his hoodie and jeans kept him warm, it was still very cold.  Tucking his revolver into his jeans, he walked towards the faculty parking lot, which was where the college staff parked their vehicles.  After searching among the vehicles that had been abandoned, Matt stumbled upon a police cruiser that was sitting near the parking lot entrance.  He figured it may have been left behind when the police were responding to the initial outbreak.  Matt walked up to the police car and found it was unlocked.  He slid into the drivers seat and shut the door.  After rubbing his hand to warm them up, Matt started to look around the police cars interior.  Luckily, he found that the keys were still in the ignition.  He started the police car, put it in gear and drove out of the parking lot and onto the main road.  As he drove through the streets of Glitterice, Matt could see that the undead outbreak had clearly overrun the entire town.

Contrary to the stores small size, the place seemed to carry everything a gun nut could ask for, from old hunting rifles to military grade weapons and everything else.  Throwing his old revolver aside, Matt found a duffel bag and began loading it up with everything he could find.  He grabbed several pistols, a couple of assault rifles, several submachine guns and a few shotguns plus enough ammunition for each.  He also gathered some hunting knives and a few bulletproof vests.  After putting on one of the vests and hiding it underneath his shirt and sweater, he pulled out a 45. caliber pistol, chambered it and tucked it into his pants.

The day before Matt had stopped by to spend some of the money he had gotten from a few shady dealings to buy some new clothes and supplies before leaving town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, heavy snowfall wasn't the only delay he'd experience during his time in this small town. The dead had risen just the day before and by 9:00 pm the whole building was on lockdown with most of its shoppers still inside. Many people had forced or snuck their way out, but several others remained to secure the doors and windows to prevent the horrors walking outside from getting easy access to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside Matt, Leo and Janice were about twenty other people holed up on the second floor in a large Italian restaurant. They had plenty of food and water to last for weeks, though some people were getting restless after being forced to spend the night there. Matt was fairly indifferent to the whole situation, he had stayed at better places for sure, but also worse places. Such was life on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here, give me a boost.\" Leo said as he climbed onto a washing machine and grabbed ahold of a table leg for balance. With a small shove Matt and Janice got him high enough to see out the windows above the piled furniture and junk. It was about an hour past noon and the parking lot outside was a flurry of snowflakes above a thick blanket of white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we got about 3-5 inches.\" Leo said as he climbed back down. \"Some of those undead fucks are still walking around too, I counted about a dozen hanging around the doors.\" Matt frowned at the prospect of being snowed in here for days while those things multiplied outside. He wasn't afraid for his safety, though he certainly didn't want to spend weeks here while he waited for help to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?

We got supplies here within reach, yeah, but what about the supplies we might not have access to tomorrow or the next day? We can always grab some shit from the store right next door to us, but if that fucking weather and undead plague keep up we might be stuck here for more than just a few days or weeks.

Janice didn't say a word, but the look on her face told Matt that she knew he was right. \"We need to move soon, today might be our last clear day for a while and it'll be dark in just seven or eight more hours.\" Matt finished as the group began riding up the escalator to the second floor of the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived back at the restaurant where the other survivors were Matt began to go over his plan to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There had been seven volunteers in all, but Meg and Sven were told by Matt to stay behind with the few extra guns and make sure the mall was defended. The other five, Luke, Neil, Lucy, Jerry and Roberta were to join Matt on his hunt for supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was the only one with any combat experience, having served as a member of the Army Rangers for years before being discharged with quite a few medals, including a Silver Star. Despite his skill as a soldier he was a friendly man in his late thirties with shoulder length brown hair and a blue bandanna wrapped around his forehead. His weapon was an M16 he had brought from home along with a few spare magazines of ammo. He also had his trusty Bowie knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil was a smart man, as well as the second youngest member of the team besides Matt. He works as a freelancer programmer and knows a few back doors in security systems that could come in handy. His weapon was a simple hunting rifle someone had brought from home along with an almost empty box of bullets. Just as well, as Neil wasn't a particularly good shot. He also carried a crowbar as his melee weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was a local girl who grew up on a farm outside of town and loved nothing more than going on hunting and fishing trips with her daddy. Only nineteen years old, but a pretty good shot with her dad's crossbow. Her short light brown hair was tied into a small ponytail under her camo baseball cap and her sunglasses gave her a measure of style over the other members of the group. Her emergency weapon was a small claw hammer with her initials carved into the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry was a big man who was half Jamaican and half German and was on his way to a business meeting in Alaska when he got stranded here. He was fairly quiet, but at six and a half feet tall nobody bothered him about this or his taste in sweater vests. He carried a riot shotgun the group had managed to recover the night before as well as a golf club he had picked from a sports store in the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta was a somewhat overweight woman, which made it easy for her to surprise people with her speed. She had been given two handguns of slightly different models the group had managed to gather up just a few hours prior. Luckily, they both took the same caliber of bullet so it mattered little. Her back up weapon was a utility machete looted from a store in the mall, which was lightweight enough to give Roberta a serious edge over her slow moving foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt himself carried an uzi the group had looted from the back of a car the night before along with a single spare clip. That and a nice aluminum baseball bat. Matt wasn't a huge sports nut, but baseball was something he had greatly enjoyed playing in his youth with the neighbor kids when he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, each member of the group wore some SWAT armor that had been recovered from a van the previous night during the rioting in the parking lot. All except for Neil and Roberta, who wore Kevlar vests and sports pads on their elbows and knees along with bicycle helmets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's our ride boys and girls.\" Matt said as he held up a pair of keys in his hand and pointed to...</span></div></div>",

The others nodded as they climbed inside and Luke took his spot in the passenger seat up front. Matt tapped the side of the truck twice and called everyone inside over to a small hole about the size of a baseball that had been punctured into the side earlier. \"Everybody got enough air and sunshine in there?\" he asked as someone walked over to the side wall. A small feminine hand gave him a thumbs up to a few laughs from the inside and Matt headed towards the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be a bumpy ride folks, try to stay quiet when we hit the road. We don't know what we'll find out here.\" With that Matt climbed into the driver seat and fired up the engines. Luke rested his right arm on the open window, his gun sitting at his side in the space between him and Matt. \"Roll up that window when we get out on the road, is the safety on that thing on?\" Matt asked as he gestured to the assault rifle pointed at the truck roof. Luke nodded and rolled up the window as the semi began cruising out of the parking garage past several other abandoned vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead an old man with unkempt hair as pale as the snow was stumbling around on a broken leg with about three inches of bone jutting out at the base of the knee. Wordlessly Matt brought up his uzi and and put a few rounds into the zombie's cheek and forehead through his rolled down window. \"Nice shootin' there, even I would probably have trouble landing a shot like that from this distance.\" Luke said as he watched the dead old man disappear under the front hood of the semi as it passed. \"Thanks.\" Matt mumbled in return as he made a turn onto the road leading up to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes the crew were making their way down the main road leading to the town as various houses and barns passed by on either side of the road, all surround by barren trees and piling snow. \"I'm gonna stop us up at the gas station on the edge of town. From there we can plan out how we're going to do this and refill the tank on this thing.\" Matt said as a cow missing half of its left side began moving towards the truck only to get tangled in a barbed wire fence as the semi passed over a short hill. \"Damn, think I'm gonna swear off beef after today.\" Luke joked as he looked out his window at a collapsed house with corpses walking near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you...\" Matt said disgustedly as he squinted through the falling snow at a building coming up on the right side of the road. \"We're almost there. Get ready in case we have to do some clean up.\" A lone zombie in a floral print dress stalked the service area as if it were waiting for a car to pull in and refuel and pick it up any second. Aside from a bullet hole in her dress and left lung the young woman was in pretty good shape, perhaps it had not even been a few hours since her untimely demise. \"You see that?\" Matt said quietly as he slowed down to pull up in front of the gas station. Luke nodded and took the safety off his M16. \"She's been shot.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna gas us up and scope the place out. If you hear gunshots come help me out, if you hear me scream then put the pull the fuck out of here and get your ass back on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Luke replied as he moved his hand to to the door, ready to join Matt as soon as he requested it. \"No need to risk all our lives on this shit right? Just keep an eye out and get down if you see someone coming, most folks might be content to leave us alone but there are some real assholes out there.\" Matt responded as he gently closed the door and passed in front of the truck on his way inside the gas station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zombie woman in the dress began stumbling towards him but it was a simple matter for Matt to knock her to the ground and smash her head in with a nearby rock. \"Not clean or pretty, but it gets the job done. Good thing she was such a skinny little bitch.\" Matt noted as he dropped the rock and headed towards the front doors of the gas station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front windows were cracked, but with no visible blood and the door seemed to be undamaged. After a quick pass around the building Matt headed back over to the pumps and began to fuel the semi. Luke opened the door to stretch his legs a bit and walked over to where the tank was to monitor it. \"Outside's clear?\" he asked as Matt looked over at the main entrance. \"Yeah, I'm gonna check the inside, see if we can grab some snacks and shit to bring back. Open the back door and let our crew get some fresh air while were stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke nodded his head and flicked the safety back on his assault rifle. \"Alright, I'll shut if off once we have enough. We leave in what, twenty minutes?\" Matt flashed him a quick thumbs up on his way back to the front door and took a deep breath as he quietly slid it open. He couldn't quite figure it out, but something about this place didn't feel right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh what is that smell?\" he groaned as he headed over to the front counter. \"Did one of those things die in here or something?\" After a quick glance at the area behind the cash register he moved over to the aisles of snacks and other little travel essentials. It seemed like the smell grew stronger the closer he got to the back freezers. \"I've got a fucked up feeling about this...\" he whispered silently to himself as he kept is uzi pointed in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, even the nastiest zombie couldn't compare to the sight that awaited him, a sight he had seen firsthand before. The image of pure unfiltered human cruelty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, lined up against the back freezers were roughly a dozen human corpses. The oldest was a man in his sixties, the youngest, a five year old girl. Some had multiple bullet wounds on their limbs and torsos, others had stab wounds from some kind of bladed object like a knife or cleaver. All of them had a single bullet wound to the forehead and looked to have begun the process of decay about a day ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first few seconds Matt merely stared in shock as painful memories flooded back to him. Thoughts of his brother, his family, his friends, the life he had before...the cop that took everything away from him... For nearly a minute the only sounds were the buzzing of flies and Matt's own heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god.\" a voice rang out behind him, snapping him back to reality. Matt wordlessly turned to see Neil standing behind him, holding his hunting rifle with shaking hands as he looked over the scene of the massacre. \"Who...why...?\" he choked out as he took a few steps back. Matt only stared down at his own weapon as his clear head returned. \"I don't know.\" he answered. \"But we need to get the fuck out of here now. Grab whatever you fuckin' can from the shelves and meet us outside in a minute, we're leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil muttered out some form of reply but it was immediately cut off by a sound in the distance...of approaching motorcycles. \"No...fuck... fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!!\" Matt cursed as Neil turned to the direction the noise was approaching from. There didn't seem to be many of them, but if they had guns that sure as hell wouldn't matter...what should Matt do?</span></div></div>",

It was still a few hours before noon but Lilly didn't want to get caught up in traffic with the weather acting the way it was and decided to get her shopping done now before the entire town had the same idea. After zipping up her jacket and putting on her leather boots she grabbed her keys off the tiny kitchen counter and locked up her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should really plan my next road trip to Hawaii or somewhere sunny.\" she chuckled to herself as she carefully walked down the ice covered steps leading to the ground floor. \"Ugh, would it kill those lazy bastards to salt these steps before someone breaks her neck?\" she groaned after almost sliding onto her butt near the bottom step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flakes were starching to flurry a bit, but an inch of snow wasn't going to keep a biker like Black Lilly off the road. Lilith walked over to her motorcycle and was just about to hop on when a young man in overalls and a bloodied white t-shirt stumbled out from behind a dumpster near the side of the building. \"Holy shit kid, are you okay?\" Lilith called as the boy looked up with a pale white face and glowing red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck..?\" Lilith gasped in horror as the boy staggered along, his frozen flesh cracking and popping gently with every step. When the walking corpse got close enough to strike Lilith backed away and drew a switchblade from her jeans pocket. \"Stay the fuck back, I don't want to hurt you!\" she yelled desperately as the kid lurched forward and took a swing with his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith easy dodged the attack and jammed the knife into the zombie's frostbitten lung. \"Oh god, what did I do?!\" she gasped in horror as the frozen undead coughed up a thin red line of unfrozen blood. In a panic she swung a sharp right hook into the boy's face and knocked a few teeth loose, which cracked apart as they fell to the ground. To Lilith's horror the creature barely let out a grunt as it fell on its ass and drooled a broken tooth out onto its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you?!\" Lilith screamed in a rage as she abandoned her bike and began to back away towards the stairs. The zombie licked the air through its mashed teeth and began to sit up. Lilith stumbled onto the ground just as the newly born Chiller stood back up and continued closing in on her.</span></div></div>",

Before he could react Lilly pulled the tiny blade free and jammed it into the boy's eye socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter choking out a few groaning noises the body fell silent and didn't move. \"There, Jesus. What the hell happened to you?\" Lilith asked as she pulled the switchblade free again and felt a cold shiver run through her body. In all the excitement she hadn't noticed how cold she felt all of a sudden, but now that her life wasn't in danger the chilly air surrounding her felt like it was blowing through her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fuck, why did it get so damn cold all of a sudden?\" she whispered as she began to shiver. She looked down at the frozen corpse and then to her switchblade, which had a fresh layer of red tinted frost on it. \"Did this thing sap the warmth from me or something?\" Lilith wondered as she headed back to her motel room to think and warm up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to her room she felt the coldness around her slowly fade away as she sat down on the crappy motel couch and flicked on the tv to see if the news had anything to say about whatever the hell was going on. Unfortunately, the only thing that appeared on the screen was a haze of static. With a scowl Lilith turned off the useless hunk of garbage and opened up another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I gonna do?\" she wondered as she looked out the small motel window at the silent snowy town outside.</span></div></div>",

The night before she had been drinking when she ran into a small group of bikers passing through and started a fight with them. They had been way too smashed to remember most of what happened, let alone who won, but after another round of drinks they had quickly become buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another dozen or so and we'll be done.\" a tall man in his late 40s called as he slammed a barstool over the head of a bloody teenager. \"Shit Mike, there might be a dozen more just down the fucking street!\" a younger man with a mustache called as he kicked a skinny man into the jukebox and stomped his mangled face in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Dan, we got this. Besides, our new friend here has killed more than either of us.\" Mike replied as he gave a quick nod towards Lilith. The large wave of zombies that had stirred them from their hungover sleep had been at least thirty strong when it first arrived. Now it was down to about half a dozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you shut the hell up.\" a man named Eddie suddenly called as he threw a knife into the chest of a fat man who had just entered the bar behind a crawling woman who was missing her lower half. \"Shit, Eddie. It took you five minutes to get the closet open?\" Mike asked as he kicked one of the last zombies over to Lilith so she could put it down with her board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry boss, me and Ming had trouble getting the damn thing unjammed. There weren't any weapons inside anyway, Ming's still checking it out though.\" Eddie replied as he fist-bumped his buddy Dan and admired the carnage the trio had left in their wake. \"Shit, you guys do all this by yourselves?\" He asked as Lilith crushed the skull of the last corpse to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Lilly for this mess, she really kicked some ass.\" Mike said with a laugh as he gave Lilith a high five. \"I figure somebody has to take care of you pussies.\" Lilith said with a smirk as she threw the board to the ground and shivered a little. \"That closet have any coats in it? This wind is fuckin' cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless one of those boxes has some.\" Eddie said with a shrug. \"We need to leave soon anyway, as much as I love a drink this whole place is exposed to the elements... and worse.\" The others were silent a moment as Mike poured himself a beer and leaned against the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Eddie. No way we can defend this place with a busted door like that.\" he finally said as he took a long drink from his glass of beer. \"Look at that fuckin' snow coming down, if the zombies don't get us that cold damn sure will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan frowned as he grabbed a beer for himself. \"Where the hell will we go? There must be hundreds of those things all over the whole goddamn town.\" Mike shook his head and looked out the doorway. \"I ain't got a clue, but we need to find somewhere else. If we wait here another day or two we might get snowed in, and I don't think we could live off of the alcohol until help arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If help arrives.\" Eddie said grimly. \"I'm gonna go check on Ming, what do you think Lil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith took a seat at one of the few intact barstools and lit up a cigarette. \"I like Mike's idea, but maybe staying here for now is the right answer... give me a minute to think.\"</span></div></div>",

A long trail of blood, guts and dead bodies ran from the sidewalk all the way up to right in front of the barstool she was currently sitting at. To be honest, neither option sounded all that great to her, but if the group didn't decide what to do soon they might lose their chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Dan asked impatiently as he folded his arms and took a seat across from Lilith. Just as Lilith opened her mouth to reply a scream echoed from near the back of the building. \"Oh shit, Ming!\" Eddie yelled as he rushed towards the back with Mike right behind him. \"Fuck, not more of this bullshit!\" Dan grumbled as he hopped to his feet and followed behind them. Lilith just let out an annoyed sigh as she sat up and headed back just behind Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman in her late twenties was screaming in fear as an elderly man with a bloody mouth and ragged white hair tried desperately to rip her throat out. Her switchblade had fallen out of sight behind the boxes in the closent when she had gotten jumped and now she was only seconds away from death as the ghoul closed in on her terrified face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of her, you bastard!\" Eddie screamed as he lunged at the man and tackled him to the wall in one quick motion. Ming fell to the ground as he delivered a sharp right hook to the zombie's screeching face. Blood and teeth painted the wall as Mike reached down to help Ming up just as Dan and Lilith arrived on the scene.

She had fled the town earlier in the day when walking corpses began attacking everything in sight and had managed to meet up with some local thugs who were looting a small camping and sports supply store. They seemed like cool enough people so Lilith helped them score some new gear and intended to ride out this little disaster as a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they got separated when Lilith made a trip to the clothing section to grab a thicker coat and a small horde of the things stormed in through the front door. The others did a good job fighting them off but Lilly had been forced to flee out the back before a stray group pinned her in the corner next to the tents and blankets. After a few close calls running from them down the street she came across a minivan with the front door wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a fresh corpse and a pair of keys in the ignition, just what she need to make a getaway. She bashed the corpse with a bat she had taken from supply store as it began to reanimate and climbed inside. Just as she cleared the border on the edge of town a mangled corpse she had missed in the heavy snowfall popped a tire and nearly sent her crashing into a ditch. Pissed off, cold and vengeful Lilly stormed out of the wrecked vehicle and noticed a nearby sign directing her to a nature preserve a few miles deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cursing up a storm she headed off down the trail with her bat at the ready in search of a park ranger or anyone else who could explain just what the hell was going on. The trip was peaceful for the first hour or so until a zombie deer with a ripped out throat attacked her and forced her off the trail. She ultimately managed to kill it with minimal injuries, but the path was nowhere to be found. Thus, she found herself in her current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came to a small river she noticed a bridge further down the hillside behind a thick bunch of snow-covered trees. \"Finally, now maybe I can get back on track.\" Lilith grumbled as she made her way down to the bridge, only to find that most of the center had collapsed and floated further downstream. \"Fuck my fucking life.\" Lilith cursed as she looked over the damage. A few thin supports looked sturdy enough to hold her weight, but it would be risky to cross over using them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith rubbed her head as she tried to figure out what to do.</span></div></div>",

Now the trilogy will complete with The Five Forgotten 3. What evil is behind the vile darkness that claimed so many lives in the last two zombie outbreaks? The way forward may yet be made clear, but for now, on the streets of Glitterice, a cold and eerie darkness begins to fall. It has been only a single day since the madness started, the killing, the blood, the horror beyond measure. It is now four weeks after the Rustone incident and chilly November has just arrived in Glitterice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe survivors<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie Westwood/ Age: 24 Ht: 5'11 Profession: Police Officer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Richie is a young man with blue eyes and short dark brown hair as well as a short goatee. When not dressed in his uniform he often wears sweaters or coats due to the cool weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: The son of a criminal mother and police officer father he had quite an unusual upbringing. He parents were mostly kind, but both suffered from problems from before he was born. His mother had been a drug dealer who got hooked on heroin and his father was one of the local police departments finest officers as well as a workaholic. After they had gotten together and his mother kicked her drug habit they married and soon after had Richie. Unfortunately, his father was critically injured in a shootout and died in the hospital when his mother was seven months pregnant with her second child. His sister Maggie was born healthy just like her brother, though the birth resulted in his mothers death. Richie was only eleven years old at the time. His adult life has been much kinder though, and he still keeps in touch with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Friendly and professional, but also with a ruthless streak. He believes in justice, though he isn't afraid of getting his hands dirty to protect innocents and won't hesitate to kill violent criminals to save others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie DeWitt/ Age: 29 Ht: 5'7 Profession: Photographer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Allie has short light brown hair that she sometimes ties into a small ponytail. She isn't overweight, though she isn't skinny either. Due to the cold weather she mostly wears jeans and a coat, but is also fond of wearing designer jackets when the weather permits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Allie is a brave and adventurous woman who was recently divorced from her husband Andrew after her young daughter was killed by a drunk driver on the way home from preschool. Despite agreeing that her husband wasn't at fault and did everything he could to save poor Brie the couple got divorced just a year ago after celebrating her son's 6th birthday. The entire family has been strained, though shared custody of their remaining child (Tyson) has helped them recover. Allie does her best to remain cheerful and friendly, but struggles to hide the true sorrow that she feels every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: The traumatic events of her past have affected her more than she lets on, but she is polite and respectful most of the time. She doesn't have an especially bad temper but has been know to lose control when angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Hanson/ Age: 42 Ht: 6'1 Profession: Scavenger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Due to always wearing a large coat, scarf and hat all that is really known is that he has green eyes, long messy brown hair and a small scar near the bridge of his nose. He also wears thick boots and gloves to keep the cold out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: No one knows how he became homeless and most people tend to keep their distance. Despite being avoided he never causes any trouble and stays out of everyones way. Rumor has it that he is a retired special forces agent or mafia hitman, but this is all just speculation. He owns a small shack near a trailer park roughly a mile outside of town. On most days he can be seen hunting and scavenging in the nearby woods for food and firewood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: He isn't particularly friendly, but isn't mean either, even after he's had a few drinks. He'll talk to you if you ask him a question or offer him supplies, but mostly keeps to himself and avoids unnecessary interactions with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt/ Age: 20 Ht: 6'2 Profession: Former Drug Dealer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Tall and skinny with short curly black hair and thick glasses. Most of the time he just wears a plain white shirt and tattered jeans, but the cold weather makes him wear a thick hoodie and pants any time he goes outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Matt is a reasonably friendly guy despite his rough childhood and shady past. When he was young he was forced into a gang to protect his friends and family and resorted to selling drugs to make money. Despite dropping out of school he strived to learn as much as he could about his favorite subjects, especially chemistry, biology and history. When he was only sixteen years old he witnessed his younger brother get gunned down by a racist cop for carrying a bag of weed and slit his throat in a moment of fury. In a panic at what had happened he ran away from home and hit the road, never looking back at the life he had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Nice enough to his friends and family, but slow to trust new people and extremely pragmatic. He dislikes confrontations, but will not hesitate to end someone threatening him or someone he cares about. The one thing he will not stand for is someone badmouthing his loved ones, especially those who have died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith \"Black Lilly\" Schnider/ Age: 33 Ht: 5'10 Profession: Biker Leader<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: With a leather jacket, shaved head and more tattoos than a maximum security prison Lilly is hard to miss in a crowd. She has a lot of piercings in a lot of different places, but doesn't wear much jewelry aside from earrings and bracelets. Sometimes she'll also grow her hair out into a ponytail and dye it purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Lilly was always a bit of a problem child, constantly getting bad grades, picking fights and extorting money from the other kids. She rarely got in serious trouble, but wouldn't hesitate to beat the living shit out of someone who crossed her. After barely passing high school she tried her hand at three years in college, but was too busy drinking and experimenting to pass most her classes. It was here she discovered a talent for painting and even had a steady job for a year or two selling her pictures. Eventually she got bored of making an honest living and joined up with an all-female biker gang know as The Crimson Sirens where she met her best Friend Drew. After a falling out with the leader of The Crimson Sirens Lilly left with Drew and even took a few members of the gang with her. From there she formed The Apocalypse Garden biker gang which now consists of over 100 members. Currently she is riding all across American, Mexico and Canada on a solo journey of self-discovery while Drew and her younger brother Don manage her gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Friendly one minute, rude and crude the next. Lilly isn't an amoral person and can even be nice, but has problems with authority and won't hesitate to commit immoral actions for what she sees as the greater good. She can be selfish, but will ultimately help others when the chips are down. The two things she hates the most are rules (besides her own) and the drug trade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitterice Town<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a large town in Canada about thirty miles from the American border Glitterice has seen plenty of tourism despite its isolation out in the wilderness of the surrounding forests and mountain range. Hunting, fishing and hiking are popular with the older townsfolk but what has teenagers in town excited is the opening of a brand new mall on the hillside on just outside of the town. Aside from that the town didn't have many attractions aside from the local national park, bowling alley, public library and college. One thing Glitterice is especially famous for are the many fine restaurants scattered across town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe areas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChurches<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the zombies were revived with dark magic they cannot cross holy ground. This means that any church the survivors come to will protect them from any and all types of zombie. Zombies cannot enter churches by themselves but can be knocked/pulled/pushed into one. If this happens they will be unable to move and lose any power they have until they exit (their eyes will still glow red while inside). Many churches all over the city have been fortified to offer more protection and often contain useful items that the survivors may find helpful like food or ammo. Some people have even left behind maps and signs that give directions to nearby safe areas. The universal symbol for a safe area is a triangle with a cross inside it and will also often have an arrow under it or above it pointing in the direction of the safe room. Keep in mind that while most other survivors are more then happy to let others inside there may be a few selfish or insane survivors who will deny entry to others and possibly even attack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon-holy safe locations<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral areas have been fortified to protect against zombies with varying success. Because these areas lack the holy protection given by churches they can be destroyed by zombies. Many of these places are damaged but still standing while others have been wiped out completely. Like churches, many of these locations have useful items left behind by other survivors and may not be all that friendly to newcomers. The symbol for this type of safe area is a circle inside a triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-supply locations<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany survivors discard excess supplies once they find improvements or are unable to carry any more. While a lot of these supplies end up being thrown on the ground or abandoned in hard to reach locations some people are kind enough to leave extra supplies in places were other survivors are likely to find them. These places are simply known as Re-supply locations. They range in size and scope from a few cases of bullets and a bottle of water in an empty trash can to a small garages worth of weapons, food, and medical aid. Important to note is that re-supply locations are NOT SAFE AREAS and in most cases survivors are just as vulnerable to attack as any other time. They are marked with a large R in a circle to let people know what they are. If one of these locations is cleaned out it is common courtesy to cross out the R symbol so no one will waste their time checking it for supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies are humans that were brought back to life with dark magic. Since they were revived with sorcery getting bitten, scratched, or injured by them DOES NOT turn you into one. However anyone who is killed by one DOES turn into one of them. They come in 2 types: normal and special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal: This type of zombie has 3 levels depending on how strong they are. When a person is killed they turn into a level one zombie (unless they become a special zombie). They level up by killing living creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel One: This level of zombie looks like a normal human except for its glowing red eyes. It moves slowly and has only half of the strength of a normal human. It can be killed with a headshot, a shot to the heart, or by burning it to death. Rarity:*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel Two: This level is as fast and strong as an adult human and has sharp clawlike fingernails along with pointed teeth. It is also more violent then a level one. This level can not be killed by fire or a shot to the heart like a level one. Rarity:**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel Three: This level is extremly deadly. It looks like a monsterous human with glowing red eyes and a pentagram symbol on its forehead. Instead of fingers this level has long razor like claws that can cut through metal easily. This level also has several 2 inch long fangs in its mouth (which it can open twice as wide as a human). Its only weak point is its pentagram mark on its head. Beware, this level is extremly violent and has the strength of three adult humans. It is also vary fast. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial: This type has no levels, instead each type has a different ability. Only about 1 in 15 people who are killed become a special zombie (Any animals killed become Beasts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStalker: As its name implies, it hunts living creatures ruthlessly and will not stop until it has killed its prey. This type makes little noise and will ambush its prey. It looks similar to a level two zombie, but it is twice as fast and its claws and teeth are a little longer. It is vary good at jumping, climping, and swinging through trees and other such things. It can also crawl on walls and ceilings thanks to its claws. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimic: A mimic is the only zombie that doesn't have glowing red eyes...because it tries to disguise itself as a living human. It can walk or run and even perfectly immitate human speech. While they may seem human, there are several things that can give them away: A mimic can survive wounds that wound kill a normal human (If someone walks up to you missing half of their face or with most of their blood gone and ask for help, they are a mimic.), mimics don't have heartbeats, mimics will try to lead living humans into dangerous situations or to other zombies, and mimics are often found in small groups while pretending to be survivors. So when ever you find survivors in something like a sealed room with no food or water and they have been there a long time, they are mimics. A mimics weakspot is its upper torso, a headshot will only slow them down. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampire: A vampire is a zombie who gets its name from its habit of drinking the blood of any living human it finds. It can run as fast as a normal human and is a little stronger then a normal human. It is easily spoted in a group as it has large fangs and is always deathly pale, but otherwise looks human. It can be easily killed with a headshot, a shot to the heart, or burning to death.<br>\r\nRarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimmer: The swimmer is the only type of zombie that can swim, but it can also walk on dry land. It has webbed hands and feet. It also has a large fin on its back. Its mouth is twice as wide as a humans and is full of long razor sharp teeth. This zombie will often wait for humans to come across rivers, ponds, or even swiming pools and shoot them in the face with non-fatal blinding ink. The ink is easily wiped off but the effects remain for about a minute. This undead is best killed while on dry land as they are somewhat slow while moving on dry land. They almost always appear in groups of 2-5 and only appear near water. Rarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeathtouch: A deathtouch is perhaps the most deadly type of zombie that can be found, it is also the most rare. The walk slowly and are not very strong, but are very dangerous. A deathtouch is easily spotted as it is surroundings by a deep red mist. This mist is highly toxic and coming into contact with it can be fatal. Fourtunately the mist only extends about 3 feet from the zombies body. The zombies body itself is red like the mist and simply touching it is almost instantly fatal as its entire body is filled with a deadly virus. Deathtouches have no weakpoints, the only way to stop them is reduceing them to paste, which is very difficult as their skin is twice as strong as a normal humans and they can't be killed by fire. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare: These are probaly one of the most fearsome types of zombie. They have the very eerie ability of absorbing all manner of illumination within a 30 foot radius. This veil of shadows remains over their corpses after they die, so no one knows what they really look like. Things like flash lights or even floodlights are useless agenst them as they absorb the light itself. All that is known about them is that they are vaugely humanoid, they have two legs and a head, but they have four arms instead of two. They also seem to have the strength and speed of an average human. The only things that are visible in their shroud of night is their 4 glowing red eyes. They are often identified right away as they look like large black clouds moving slowly over fields and streets. They often also allow other zombies to hide themselves in their black veil which makes it an extremely dangerous type to encounter, especially alone. (The other zombies eyes don't glow in the shadows like the nightmare's do.) Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrier: These zombies look more like giant monsterous bats than humans. It has six human-like arms (but no legs) that it uses to carry other zombies (except sumo) to locations that they couldn't normally reach. They have two pairs of wings and stand between 8-10 feet tall. They can be killed with a headshot and its wings are very weak and can be easily burned or shot off. If it loses its wings it will crawl along the ground and claw and bite at any living humans it sees. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast: The name beast refers to all the animals that were zombiefied by the event that took place 5 days ago. These animals are all fast moving and ruthless. Birds that once sang happily outside windows now swarm and peck to death anything left alive. Deer that once avoided humans will now hunt them down and gore them to death. Fish that would just swim in the rivers and ponds now rip apart anything near them (except Swimmers). All zombie animals have glowing red eyes and can be killed with a headshot. Rarity:*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigger: A digger will find one spot it likes and remain there. It digs holes to hide in with its huge claws. It grabs people and will drag them underground. It can be killed with a headshot, but rarely sticks its head above ground. Its claws are razor sharp and can easily cut through metal. Diggers can also shoot tentacles from its mouth to snare prey. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlimer: The slimer is a nasty zombie named for its 3 different slime abilites. The first is the red slime attack. Red slime is acidic and can melt steel. The second is the blue slime attack. Blue slime is sticky and doesn't wash off with water, it wears off after about 5 minutes. Finally, there is the purple slime attack. Purple slime is highly flamable and will burst into flames in hot areas. It may also explode. The slimer moves slowly, but can spit slime up to 50 feet away. Slimers usually have slime dripping from their mouths. One headshot is all it takes to kill them, but their corpse will dissolve into a random type of slime. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfector: The Infector is a really nasty zombie that carries a powerful virus in its fangs. One bite will transform a survivor into one of the undead in a matter of seconds. Survivors that are transformed this way have a 50% greater chance of becoming a special zombie than if they were killed by the zombies in another way. Dispite also having sharp claws, they are not poisonous and seem to be a last resort if the Infector is unable to bite its prey. Killing an Infector is as easy as killing any level 2 zombie so long as the survivour avoids being bitten. Oddly, an Infectors eyes glow a bright sickly green instead of red like the other zombies which makes it somewhat easier to spot in a crowd. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawler: An aggressive zombie with large mutated arms that excels at beating survivors to death. Due to its massive upper body strength it can easily climb up the sides of buildings and cliffs, along with being able to throw objects with moderate accuracy. Despite its impressive physical attributes it can easily be kill with a headshot or burning to death. While fairly unintelligent it does have enough sense to use its massive arms as shields when under attack, making it somewhat hard to kill with low-caliber weapons. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoodoo: The deadly Voodoo zombie is passive, but also one of the most dangerous specials a survivour can encounter. Just as its name implies, whatever anyone does to it they suffer themselves. Even worse is the fact that there is no way to tell a Voodoo from a normal level one zombie unless you harm it. Luckily, whenever one is in the area survivors will feel occasional sharp pains that intensify slightly as it draws closer. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiller: Pale corpses covered in a thin layer of supernaturally cold frost. They die as easily as level 1 zombies and move extremely slowly, but are a deadly threat nonetheless. Their skin saps warmth and can reduce a normal persons body temperature by over 10 degrees per minute in close contact. They also have an aura of sheer coldness around them that suppresses nearby sources of heat. If enough are able to gather together they can even extinguish large fires and heating units. They are easily identified by a soft cracking sound when they move along with the cold fog of their lifeless breath. Rarity***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHealer: A strange zombie that glows with a faint red aura in darkness. It normally walks, but can run as fast as a level two zombie and can even perform advanced acrobatics and maneuvers that other zombies can't. It rarely attacks directly, but its ability is one of the most powerful of any undead seen before. Using a sinister light focused around its hands it has the ability to restore damaged flesh and heal the wounds of other zombies. Given enough time it can even revive the dead if the corpse hasn't been burned or reduced to paste. They naturally target stronger zombies and are extremely clever compared to their brethren, though they can still be lured into traps. If their head is destroyed while attempting to heal it causing a bizarre chain reaction that destroys all undead within 10-15 feet in an eruption of light. Zombies killed this way cannot be revived and are permanently destroyed, even if their head is left intact. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant: A massive zombie created from the fusion of several other zombies. They come in many shapes and sizes, from animalistic hybrids to shapeless masses of twisting flesh and limbs. Each of these zombies has a core located somewhere within their body that must be destroyed to kill it. These cores range in size from a few inches to over a foot long and can often absorb several bullets before ceasing to function. In the more humanoid Giants their central \"nerve core\" is most likely to be located in the head or chest. Cores glow with red light even in the smallest Giants which make them eas targets once exposed. Despite this, these zombies are better left avoided as they have access to all of the abilities of whatever undead they are made from. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomb: An extremely rare zombie that actively avoids and hides from survivors and will immediately flee if spotted by them. They have pale pinkish skin and glowing pink eyes. Their bodies are slightly bloated around their belly and a soft pink light can be seen within. If they are killed a special pink organ that somewhat resembles a heart can be removed from their stomach area. This heart organ will beat softly as it is held and increase its beat the more injured the survivor becomes. If a survivor holding a Womb's \"heart\" is critically wounded or killed the strange organ will rupture and coat them in a thick slimy pink fluid. This fluid will mend their wounds, restart their heart and even boost their strength for the next 5 minutes. The heart cannot revive those who have been dead for longer than ten minutes and will not affect zombies. Once a heart is removed it will expire after exactly 3 days and melt into pink goo. Wombs can be a great prize if killed and are physically frail (fire and headshots will kill them, their flesh is very weak and easily torn by blades or blunt objects), but Wombs are not completely defenseless and will yell loudly if attacked or followed. They can be easily identified by their soft crying and whimpering. A Womb is always female. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCage: A Cage is a brutish bloated zombie that typically stands at least 6 or 7 feet tall. It has strong muscles, incredibly dense bones and few weak points. Most melee weapons and small firearms won't scratch it, yet it is one of the only zombies who will leave survivors alone unless provoked. Cages will most often find a single spot they like and remain there, only attacking if survivors get too close or hit it first. Its only vulnerable spot is its brain, which is protected by an extra thick skull. What makes Cages appealing targets is their habit of seeking out and devouring useful items such as ammo, explosives, medical supplies and even keys and access cards! They somehow have a way of knowing what items are of value to humans and will even raid camps and outposts if left unguarded. Most annoyingly, they will often deliberately target resupply locations to deprived needy survivors from looting their goods. When killed a Cages chest will become weak and easily torn open with a knife or pulling out its ribs, which is where it stores the items it takes. The chest can be penetrated by heavy weapons such as assault rifles and grenades, but that risks damaging the goods and may drive the Cage into a psychotic berserker state. As the bones in its neck are sometimes weak enough to quickly cut through with chainsaws or broadswords without harming the supplies inside decapitation may be the best way to hunt them, though they are extremely rare. A Cage is always male. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You can not introduce any new zombies of your own, please use the ones listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Keep in mind the story begins 1 day after the zombies appeared, the survivors all start out alone in a location were they have managed to find shelter. There are no other people alive (except for the few other survivors that might be found later).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep this realistic, nothing cartoonish or stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Survivors MAY die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Cursing, violence, gore, adult content/situations, and nudity is fine. In fact most of those things are expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Sex is allowed with a few conditions:<br>\r\na. No sex with underage characters.<br>\r\nb. No sex when there is the danger of a zombie attack.<br>\r\nc. This is a zombie story, not a porn story, if chapters start focusing too much on sex they will be deleted or edited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. All the characters live in the same town so they may meet and join up with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Finally, characters are not allow leaving the area unless they are rescued somehow, and they can't be rescued before chapter 20.<br>\r\n</td>",
