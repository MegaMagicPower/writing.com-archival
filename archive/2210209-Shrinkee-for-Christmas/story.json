Emily smiles widely down at the woman, she had to admit that she looked beautiful. long blonde hair and a curvy figure. Emily smiles and reaches in curling her fingers around the woman. Emily giggles a bit when she picks her up as she feels that she\u2019s only about eight inches tall. The woman looks up at Emily with a whimper and covers her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Emily asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman doesn't answer, she just flinches and palms her ears hard. Emily realises that the room must be too loud for her as her family is all talking over each other and some are yelling. Emily stands up and takes the tiny woman back to her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the noise.\" Emily apologies and places the woman on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" She whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sits down on the chair in front of the tiny woman and smiles just marvelling at her new girl. The girl smiles and blushes a bit as the teen girl's eyes travel over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess I'm your Shrinkee?\" The woman smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I'm Emily.\" She smiles and holds out her hand to introduce herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany.\" She smiles softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.\" Emily smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Brittany giggles and blushes. \"You're very pretty too,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Brittany.\" Emily coos. \"You're so sweet,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily leans in and kisses Brittany's tiny face, she blushes and lightly kisses back making Emily giggle and blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask how old you are?\" Brittany asks nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fourteen,\" Emily says. \"But I'm fifteen in January, how old are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm twenty five.\" Brittany says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Emily gasps. \"I never thought I would get a older woman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Brittany giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean you are that old,\" Emily laughs. \"I was meaning that you are older than me that's all, when I saw the Shrinkee box I thought I was going to get someone my age or a year older that's all, I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Brittany laughs a little. \"I was only teasing. So what's your status for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Emily asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Status, what is it you want from me?\" Brittany asks. \"Every Shrinkee gets a status form their new owner, it can be anything from pet to girlfriend, toy or just nothing if you wanted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to just keep you as nothing,\" Emily says, \"You are special to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Brittany blushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you know so much about Shrinkees?\" Emily asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"isn't it obvious enough?\" Brittany giggles pointing down at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\" Emily laughs. \"I mean how do you know so much about the Shrinkee system?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been there for a couple of years,\" Brittany says. \"I'ver over heard so many conversations and read some of the books the company leaves lying around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Emily says. \"I f I makes you any better I know you'll be so much happier with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'm sure I will be.\" Brittany smiles and blushes. \"So what's your status for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sits back and takes a good long think. What status does she want to give Brittany?</span></div></div>",
