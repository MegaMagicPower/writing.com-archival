Tyler couldn't remember what happened, all he could tell is that he was sailing on vacation in uncharted waters and there was this storm an....\"ahh my head\", Tyler put his hand on forehead and down there was little blood on it, he must of hit his head pretty hard. He turned on his back and laid on the shore for a couple of minutes, when gained enough strength he stood up and look around. On the right of him there ware these large rock's that stretched to the forest to the beach, like it was blocking you'r path to the other side. To left of you, what looked liked an endless shoreline. To the front of you was the deep tropical forest. \"This place doesn't look so bad\" Tyler thought, that's when he heard a large \"ROAR\" in the distance\"what the hell was that?\" whatever it was it sounded big and large,<br>\r\nhe heard it again but this time it sounded closer, he needed to hide, tyler ran and hid between two of the large rock's. When the creature got closer a large shadow appeared, Tyler's eyes widen't in complete shock it was ? <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You recognize the monster as the \"Nargacuga\" a wyvern from one of your favorite the video games \"Monster hunter\", as you examine him more, he looked slightly more humanoid his body shape was slim a little athletic, between his legs was his sheath and balls, the 200 foot tall giant Narga started to look around and sniff the air as you stayed hidden. As you watched him for at least a minute, you saw the giant Narga turn the other direction and start walking away, as he did so you saw the view of his tail swaying from side to side as he walked, but what got most of your attention was his impressively large rear. You couldn't help but blush as you watch his glutes jiggle with each step he took as he walked further away, \"damn he's thicc\" you blurted out, you thought about following him, but was it a good idea to chase after a giant beast like that?. there's was no telling what the Nargacuga could of done to you if he spotted you, you could stay and explore the rest of the island or you could follow after the Nargacuga, after a little time of thought you decide. </span></div></div>",
