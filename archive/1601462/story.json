A patient he was supposed to operate on had gone missing, a little girl with stomach cancer. He thought she was simply afraid, like any child would be, and ran off to hide somewhere. Sadly she was found a short time later in another patients room covered in blood and with glowing red eyes. She had ripped the tounge out of an elderly man, causing him to drown in his own blood. When the nurse who had found her screamed she jumped onto her and used her new claws to tear off her face. Soon after the nurse got back up and joined the little girl in her violent killing spree. After an hour had passed 80% of the patients and 67% of the hospital staff were dead or zombiefied. Five days after this incident Gary Wilson was the only one known to have survived...so far. Gary had made it through most of the hospital without being killed by sheer luck, and was almost to the car garage. Once there he could get in his car and drive the hell away from this place. He knew that the zombies had spread to the outside, but there may also be other survivers out there who need his help. Gary hoped that with enough people they could all escape the city and maybe find help on the outside. Gary opened the doors that led to the hallway with the elevator at the end. He slowly made his way down the hall, holding a bloody scalpel in his left hand. It wasn't much, but in a docters hands it could be deadly. Just as he made it to the elevator a zombie appeared from around the corner. It was a young woman whose clothes were tattered and bloodstained. She moved slowly towards Gary, limping a bit as if her left leg was broken. \"Good thing its only a level 1.\" Gary said as she moved closer. He quickly ran towards her and prepaired to strike. Unfortunately, just seconds before his scalpel made contact, she let out a loud wail. \"Oh fuck!\" Gary screamed as the scalpel pirced her right eye. \"A siren!\" No sooner had her body falled to the ground then at least half a dozen zombies appeared in the doorway behind him and in the hallway off to his side. Gary...</span></div></div>",

The zombies slowly made their way towards the elevator and Gary with their hellish red eyes glowing and their arms outstretched. \"Damn it, hurry up!\" Gary yelled as he shoved an approaching zombie away. The elevator was making too much noise and soon every zombie within earshot would be making its way over here. Two of the nearby zombies grabed Gary and tried to pull him to the ground, but as they were only level 1 he was able to overpower them and managed to stab one in the chest with his scalpel and knocked both of them to the floor. As the zombies were begining to get back up and surround the unarmed docter the elevator arrived with a ding sound. Gary quickly got inside and closed the doors as the zombies reached out and tried to grab him one last time as he disappeared behind the doors. \"Shit...that was too close...\" Gary gasped as he leaned agenst the elevators wall. The breif trip to the next floor allowed him to catch his breath, but he would have to get out of here before he could rest. Once again the doors to the elevator opened and Gary walked out into the hallway that led to the car garage. The hallway was empty and all of the doors were closed. \"They must all be trying to get into the elevator on the floor I was just on.\" Gary said to himself. \"I guess all that noise was a good thing.\" He followed the hallway around a corner and made it down the second part of the hallway without incident. His luck finally ran out when he turned around the final corner and was met with the stare of 3 zombies. The first two were just level 1, but the third was a level 2. They all noticed him before he had the chace to retreat and began moving towards him. He could outrun the level one's easily, but the level two was coming at him too fast for him to escape from it. The door to the car garage is just behind them, all Gary has to do now is find a way past them.</span></div></div>",

Soon, the two weaker level one zombies reached the struggling duo and pulled Gary to the floor. Before he could even push them away he found himself laying in a puddle of his own blood as the heart in his torn open chest slowly stopped beating.</span></div></div>",

The level 2 zombie's claws barely scratched his legs as he landed in the doorway of the room. He quickly got to his feet and pushed the door closed just as the zombie made another strike. Its hand was caught in the door with its razor-sharp claws just a few inches away from Gary's face. The door remained firmly shut as the level two struggled to push it open from outside, but Gary knew as soon as the two level one's reached them they would easily overpower him and get in. He had about a minute to find a weapon to defend himself with. He looked around the room for anything that he could use. On the ground 3 feet away was a bloody pipe that must have been torn from somewhere in the building and used to fight the undead before he had gotten here. It wasn't very large and might not be effective against a level two, but it was all Gary could see. Gary let go of the door and quickly grabbed the pipe. The level 2 entered the room and charged at him as he swung the metal pipe as hard as he could towards its face. It was over before Gary could even tell what had happened. The level 2's claws had sunk deep into his left shoulder, but he had scored a killing blow with his pipe. The zombie was bleeding onto its arm from a large wound on its forehead, the only thing keeping it from falling to the floor was its grip on its would-be prey. Gary pulled the claws from his shoulder and grabbed the spot where he had been struck. The injury itself was fairly small, but deep. His own blood began running down his shoulder and onto his arm. Outside Gary could hear the remaining level one zombies draw closer...</span></div></div>",

After he had secured the door he walked over towards a cabinet leaning over a counter with a sink. \"I hope this what I think it is...\" He said to himself as he opened it. Just as he suspected there were some bandages and rubbing alcohol on the bottom shelf. He could hardly believe his luck... not only had he found a reliable weapon, but also had the good fortune to take refuge in a doctors office not unlike his own. He took off his coat and applied the rubbing alcohol to the wound. It wouldn't stop bleeding right away, but at least it wouldn't become infected. He wrapped the wound carefully and put his coat back on just as the level one's outside began banging on the door. He had finish dressing his wound just in time. He put the bandages and the rubbing alcohol into his pockets and picked up his pipe. He threw the door open and made short work of the level one's, they never even saw him coming. After leaving his foes smashed bodies to decorate the hallway he walked onwards towards the parking garage. He braced himself for whatever was behind the door in front of him and opened it. He had indeed reached his destination, yet something was wrong. Upon checking a nearby sign he found out just what he had overlooked. He was on level 1-D. His car had been parked on level 2-D, one level up. \"Dammit...\" He cursed as he took another quick look around. The were few cars on this level and, even better, no zombies. He could just walk out the main entrance to his right and continue on foot... or head to his left and try to get to his car.</span></div></div>",

If many of those things were upstairs he would be ripped to pieces before he could even get to his car. He walked out of the hospital without looking back and stepped out onto the sidewalk. Amazingly, there were no zombies in sight, strange considering that the hospital had been full of them. \"They must be grouping together somewhere...\" Gary said aloud. \"Or, maybe they're starting to die out.\" He noted as he looked down the abandoned streets in front of him. Either way, Gary wasn't accomplishing anything just standing there. He walked down the sidewalk slowly and kept an eye out for any movement. When he got to the end of the street he was on he could see where all the zombies had gone. Up ahead there had been a large car wreck that cut off one of the roads, further down it past most of the wreckage was a school bus that was laying on its side. A mob of the undead were surrounding it like a group of metalheads at a rock concert with their favorite band playing. Gary wondered why as he ducked behind a car and tried to sneak by unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was out of the zombies line of sight and able to continue on he stopped dead in his tracks. A woman screamed in fear and horror... along with what sounded like a young child. The sound had come from the direction of the bus. \"Of course.\" Gary whispered. \"There must be people in there.\" He walked back and peered out from behind the wall. The zombies were still swarming around the outside and Gary swore he saw someone move inside one of the windows. \"Shit...\" Gary groaned as he counted up the number of zombies he'd have to face to get to them. \"...18, 19, 20, ...\" 21 in all, 5 were level two and one looked like a Vampire. Soon they'd be able to get inside, Gary needed to act as soon as possible. He couldn't sneak up on them, they were far away enough that even if he used cover they would notice him before he could get to the trapped people and overwhelm him. Trying to come up with ideas Gary heard the woman scream again, this time slightly louder... </span></div></div>",

For a moment he considered throwing his pipe through the window of a nearby building and climbing over the wrecked vehicles to get to them, but soon came up with a better plan. On the ground next to a turned over Ford was a sizable chuck of broken concrete that would serve as an excellent nose maker. Gary picked it up and tossed it with all his might over the heads of the zombies and was pleased to see it crash through the window of a grocery store a little further down that same street. The level 2's and the Vampire quickly moved to investigate the noise while the lowly level 1's began shambling along behind them. As soon as he was sure all their attention was focused on the store, Gary quickly climbed over the impressive wreckage and silently made his way over to the bus. To his surprise, the door flew open and a young woman climbed out along with her young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gary could say anything she silently gestured for him to follow her into the nearby building behind the bus. He nodded in agreement and opened the door for his two new companions as he looked over at the store one final time. The zombies were still distracted and didn't even notice the doctor and their prey vanish from sight. The inside of the building was fairly dark with no power and few windows to let in sunlight. Luckily, the young woman, who introduced herself as Courtney, had a working flashlight. She explained that she and her son Robert had taken refuge in the bus while running from the undead two days ago, only to find it surround when they attempted to leave. \"Thank god you came along mister, I was so scared... and my poor son has been through so much... He... lost his daddy on the day this whole thing started, my husband Keith sacrificed himself so we could get away...\" Gary felt a sharp pain in his chest when he heard this. \"What a devoted father, he must have truly cared for his family. Please... accept my condolences, I've lost quite a few people myself. In fact... I may be the only doctor left alive in this whole city thanks to what those monsters did to the hospital...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... a doctor?\" The woman asked as she wiped a few tears from her eyes. \"Yes, and I'd be glad to help you and anyone else who needs my aid. After all, its my sworn duty.\" Gary said with a smile. \"So lets get through this together, as long as I'm here I'll heal you both to the best of my medical ability if the need arises.\" The woman smiled as she opened a door that led to a room with a boarded up window. \"Thank you, we're both okay now, just a few scratches. We'll make it through this, right Robert?\" The boy didn't say a word, but nodded his head slowly in confirmation. \"Why did you come to this room in particular?\" Gary asked as he looked around the heavily damaged room, of which the only notable quality was the large R in a circle spray painted on one of the walls. Courtney lowered her head a bit in embarrassment and mumbled a bit as she spoke. \"Well... this may seem silly, but... this guy I met told me about how survivors were marking places as re-supply spots... See, people who can't carry any more stuff leave it behind and some of them mark the location for other people to find... at least that's what the man told me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary had a little trouble buying this idea, just who did they expect to find all of their stuff if they left it in places like this? \"How exactly did you know to come to this one room? I didn't see anything outside to tip you off...\" He asked as he opened a dresser sitting just below the R symbol. \"W-well, the guy seemed to be telling the truth... and he gave me this...\" She pulled out a crumpled sheet of notebook paper that crudely mapped the surrounding area with several spots marked with brief instructions next to them. Sure enough, this apartment building was marked with the words \"Room seven\" scribbled under it in blue ink. Gary let out a sigh as he closed the empty dresser drawer and handed the piece of paper back to Courtney. \"You... really think people would be so selfless?\" She was silent for a moment before replying in a firm tone: \"I do.\" Impressed by her faith in humanity Gary helped her and her son search the room for anything of value. When they were finally done they had obtained...</span></div></div>",

Are we really just gonna leave it here?\" Robert groaned as Gary, without even bothering to turn around simply shook his head in confirmation. \"Yes, along with two of the extra clips, other people will need it and...\" He stood back up and turned to Courtney as he sat the box on a nearby table. \"I'm sure your mother wouldn't want a kid your age handling a gun, right?\" Courtney smiled. \"No, but I appreciate him wanting to help.\" She replied as she took back the shield while Gary handed Robert the bag with the few extra clips that they'd take with them. \"Aw man, I gotta carry our stuff too...?\" Robert groaned again as he crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sweetie.

Courtney moved Robert in front of her and told him to follow Gary while she made sure no zombies snuck up behind them. \"No matter what, follow the doctor, okay?\" She said as Gary quickly shattered the broken window as quietly as possible. \"Now let's move, hurry!\" With that the trio moved out into the alley and began walking behind several buildings as they kept an eye out for zombies. Fortunately, nothing had heard them leave the room and they made it to the next street without incident. There were four zombies in front of a nearby car and a fifth and sixth zombie standing outside a movie theater further up the road. \"Slow down, some of them are up ahead...\" Gary whispered as he took aim with his guns. By the time the zombies noticed the survivors presence half of them were already dead and the rest soon followed. When it was clear Gary gestured for his companions to stay put for a minute while he scouted the area. When he returned a short time later he told them about all of the stores and restaurants he had seen. After going over each place he found the trio decided to...</span></div></div>",

After his two compainions were in Gary took one last look around before closing the door and following them inside. There was a little blood on the windows and a few of them were broken, but the bushes ouside obscured most of the interrior, which would hopefully allow them to enjoy an uninterroupted meal. \"Can you cook?\" Gary asked Courtney as she and Robert sat down at a table. \"Of course... can't you doctor?\" She replied with a small laugh. \"Ha... no, my wife's the chef... the last time I tried cooking I nearly caused a fire...\" Gary said with a weak laugh. He paused for a moment when he thought of his wife, whom he still didn't know was alright. For all he knew she could be face down in some ditch with blood running down... he quickly pushed the thought from his mind. \"Your wife, doctor... is she... do you know if she's okay...?\" Courtney asked when she noticed him lingering on the mention of his wife. \"I'm not sure... God, I hope she is...\" Gary said as his voiced quivered a bit. \"Oh, I, I'm so sorry...! Please, I shouldn't have said anything...!\" Courtney said as her voice rose a bit louder then she meant it too. \"Its okay... I'm sure she's fine...\" Gary replied as he took a seat opposite from Courtney and Robert. \"I... I guess I better get cooking...\" Courtney said as she excused herself to the kitchen. Gary sat his guns on the table and looked out the window. He couldn't see much of the street past the bushes, but it was still clear... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed before Courtney returned carrying a tray with a frown on her face. \"The power... its out here too. We'll either have to eat our food cold or move to somewhere else.\" She said as she sat the tray she was carrying down on the table. \"There's plenty of water, but not much food other then bun's and condiments...\" Gary sighed as he took one of the waters and had a good long sip. The last time he had had a drink was at one of the hospitals water fountains and if this young woman was to be believed both her and her child must have gone days without water. \"Boy, that sure is refreshing...\" Gary said as he sat his empty cup back down on the table. \"You poor folks must be partched after your ordeal with the bus...\" Robert simply mumbled as he sat his first cup down and began drinking his second. \"Not too fast dear, I know you're thirsty, but I don't want you throwing up.\" Courtney said as she took a sip from her own water. \"So, um, doctor... what should we do... my poor baby hasn't had anything to eat since we were forced to leave our home... and that was days ago...\" Gary took another look out at the still empty streets before turning back to Courtney. \"I saw a few places that probably still have food when we cleared the street... not too far from here is...\"</span></div></div>",

He had been on the 4th floor and was now making his way to the 2nd, from there he could enter the car garage through a shortcut and hopefully avoid most of the zombies still there. Along his desent he ran into one zombie...a small child who he simply shoved aside as he ran. He reached floor 2 in only a few minutes and looked out the windows on the doors that led to more hallways. There were only 2 zombies out there, but one was a vampire. \"Good thing I'm not going that way.\" Gary said as he turned around and opened the door to the car garage. This door didn't have any windows so Gary had to be ready to act fast. He had decided that if there was a large horde of them he'd go back to the doors that led to the second floor and figure another way out. As the door swung open Gary immediately surveyed his surroundings. There were several zombies scattered about along with a small group in the far corner. As far as Gary could tell they were all level ones. He spied his car two rows down with only one zombie, a fat man who was about thirty (and much too small to be a sumo), standing near it. Just as he was about to act one of the zombies spotted him and began moving towards him. What should he do?</span></div></div>",

Gary went out of his way to run down what zombies he could without risking damaging his car, and couldn't help but feel satisfied as he heard their bones snap and break as he drove. He was almost to the bridge that crossed the river that ran through the city when he was forced to stop. The entire road in front of him was blocked by huge chunks of steel and debris from nearby buildings. There was no way to go around it ether, if he wanted to cross the bridge and get to his home he would have to get out and walk. Gary reached under his seat and grabed the gun that he kept there and stepped out of his car. He took a quick look around to check for zombies. There were none nearby, but he knew it was only a matter of time before they showed up. As he walked towards the blockade in front of the bridge he checked his gun, six shots, he would be safe for now. The pile of the destroyed buildings was far larger up close and looked quite strange. It appered as if...something...had ripped the buildings apart. Gary decided that he better be quick in getting home. He climbed over the pile fairly easily and could now continue across the bridge. Just as he was about to move on, however, he saw a store up ahead that sold guns and ammo.

Once inside he called out to see if anyone else was there. No answer. \"Guess they won't mind if I take anything then.\" Gary said as he moved past the empty shelves. \"Well, if there's anything left to take that is...\" He walked over to the counter and looked down at the glass display case. There was a hunting rifle laying beneath the broken glass that was covered with a little blood. Gary picked it up and checked it for ammo. It was empty. Gary decided to take it anyway in case he came across some ammo. As he slowly walked behind the counter he was met with the sight of a man laying face down in a puddle of his own blood. His head was reduced to hamburger his limbs were twisted in odd shapes. \"Christ...\" Gary said as he bent down to check the body. The man had some keys in his back pocket. \"These must be for the store.\" Gary said as he took them. He tried to open the cash register with them. The first two keys did nothing, but the third opened it. Inside was several 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollar bills along with hundreds of coins. Gary didn't care about the money, but was both happy and surprised to find 2 shotgun shells hidden under the money. Gary put both the shells in his back pocket and looked up to see a level one zombie outside staring at him. He decided to shoot the zombie with his handgun. All it took was one bullet and the level one fell to the ground with a hole in his head above the left eye.

He turned the knob on the door and was surprised to find it wasn't locked. He opened the door and walked into the small room, making sure to close the door behind him. Inside there were a few more shelves laying on their sides on the floor, a few boxes strung all over the room, and a metal door that must lead outside. Gary wasted no time checking the many boxes and looking behind the shelves. He found 3 more bullets for his handgun, a bullet for his hunting rifle, 4 more shotgun shells, and a few extra bullets for other types of guns Gary didn't know about. He pocketed all the bullets except for the ones for his handgun, he loaded one into the gun and put the remaing two in his front shirt pocket for easy access. He also loaded his one hunting rifle bullet in the gun so it would be ready. \"I guess one shot for this thing is better then no shots. I'll just have to make sure I don't waste it.\" Carrying his hunting rifle in one hand and his handgun in the other made opening the door more difficult, but Gary managed to open it. He was just about to climb back out the front window when he came face to face with not one, not two, but three zombies! Two of them were just level ones, but the third had red goo dripping from its mouth. The goo was too off color to be blood, not that Gary had time to notice as he quickly closed the door as one of the level ones reached out to grab him. Gary thought he was safe for the moment, sadly this wasn't the case. The door began to dissolve as a hole appeared in its center and slowly started to grow larger. Gary watched in horror as the Slimer spit another blob of red goo on the door causing the hole to grow larger and revealing the corpse of the level one that had been standing too close to the door. Its entire head and part of its arm had been completey melted off, its headless torso driping some of the red slime into the display case where it had fallen.

The blob hit the wall behind him and started to eat away at it just as easily as it had the door. Gary knew the door wouldn't how much longer, he would have to finish off the Slimer now before it got another shot off. He rushed over to the door and gave it a sharp kick. The weakened structure broke into two halves as it was launched outward. The Slimer spat another blob just as one half of the door made contact with its face, resulting in an explosion of red as the Slimer's own face began to melt and ooze away. Gary took this chance to finally put a bullet in the thing's now rapidly decaying head. It fell to the floor with a thud and didn't get back up. Gary stepped through the doorway and quickly surveyed his surroundings, trying to locate the remaining level one. His eyes soon met with its remains laying on the other side of the store, a bullet from one of his earlier shots buryed deep within its brain under the spot where its eye used to be. With all three zombies dead Gary finally had a moment to catch his breath and reload his gun. \"I've got five shots left for this thing...\" Gary said as he put the last round into his gun. \"But I've also got a hunting rifle now, and its still got a shot left. I guess all in all, this little detour was worth it. Now I better get back to the bridge.\" Gary walked past the freshly dead bodies back over to the window where he had come in. Just as he was about to climb back out he heard a noise behind him. Gary quickly spun back around and raised his gun to the air. Just as he was about to fire and waste more precious ammo he happened to glance down. The corpse of the Slimer was now a deep purple color and begining to dissolve. \"What in the hell...?\" Was all Gary could manage to mutter as the slain foe was reduced to a large puddle in a matter of seconds.

Had gotten too close to the purple goo, that it exploded, taking out a large crowd of zombies. Sadly, Lenny with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary smirked. He had no knowledge about any type of explosives what so ever, but this could be put to good use if stored the right way. Quickly scanning around the room, Gary found 5 small containers and a pack of matches. Returning to the slime, he scooped in as much slime into the 5 containers, and placed them around his belt. If he came across a huge horde of zombies, he could just easily light one of the containers on fire with a match and throw it at them. A good improvised bomb. He only had five though, so they only be used in desperate need until he can find more goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully supplied with a hunting rifle and a few containers of slime, Gary was ready to climb over the window.

He quickly lit it and was just about to throw it when the Beast dog pounced at him. Not expecting it to have greater speed then the human zombies, it managed to catch Gary completely off-guard. He fell to the ground, but was still able to fling his now active bomb at the rest of the approching horde. He could now use both of his free hands to hold it back and keep it from biting him, but would be defenceless if any of the other zombies survived the explosion. A few seconds passed... followed a loud boom. Bits of debris and body parts flew by, some still on fire. Fortunately, this new sound caught the attention of the zombie German Shepperd just long enough for Gary to grab his nearby handgun and put a hole in the things head. It went limp and was pushed aside as Gary got up and picked up his hunting rifle. \"Four shots left...\" He gasped as he made his way to the window yet again. It was finally over, he was finally about to walk out of here and start making his way home. Only he wasn't. Just as Gary began climbing out the window a sharp piece of wood caught him in the shoulder and knocked him out onto the street. \"Fuck...\" He quickly picked himself off the ground and looked back inside the gunstore. His fight wasn't over, he had one opponet left. Inside glaring back at him was the level 3, minus about half its flesh. \"Jesus Christ... what the holy fuck ARE you...?\" Gary gasped as he took a few steps back and put a hand on his now bleeding shoulder. The level 3 was still able to move, but just barely and very slowly. As it walked towards the living human it opened its mouth in a grotesque smile. It was almost too horrifying to look at, Gary couldn't believe that this thing had once been a person. Many of its organs fell out of its nearly skeletal body as it moved closer, not that it cared, its own wounds meant nothing, it only goal was to exterminate the living at any cost. Gary was about to run when he noticed the small glowing pentagram on its forehead. \"Some kind of weakspot...?\" He thought to himself. He laid his handgun on the ground and used both his hands to aim the hunting rifle. \"I hope I'm right...\" As soon as Gary had a sure shot he fired his one and only bullet at his shambling foe. The hit connected full-force and exited out the back of the level 3's skull. For a moment the zombie stood motionless... before falling over dead. Gary took a minute to catch his breath, pick up his handgun, and continue on towards the bridge. When he got there he noticed something off to the side of was a sign that stated that there was a church on the otherside of the bridge and that some of the cars along the way were re-supply locations marked by an R in a circle. Up head there was indeed a minivan with such a symbol on its front hood. Should Gary check it out?</span></div></div>",

After that, he might as well say his prayers. By the looks of it, he'll be stuck in this hell-hole for much longer then that. The smartest thing to do at the moment was check the cars for possible supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned each car, looking for any sort of defense or weapon. Within at least every car was a gun or 2. Sadly most of them were oversized or overly damaged to be used against zombies. They would just slow him down while being chased by some rapid level twos, or weigh him down during a stalker ambush attack. One car held a duffle bag filled with food, a first aid kit, and a uzi. It was light enough to move around with. This was a keeper. That and a shotgun was mainly what he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way to the church, Gary spotted a minivan in the corner of his eye. It didn't hold any guns, any supplies, nothing.Inside was all vacant besides the old blood-stains on the seat. On the windshield though was a letter, with a stuffed Teddy bear next to it. Curious, Gary walked over to the car and grabbed the note. A picture of a 5 year old boy holding that same exact Teddy bear. On the note it just said \"Please bring him back\" in bold red pen. He looked at the picture. A small innocent little child, holding a tiny stuff bear. Gary he felt a small tug at his heart. He always wanted children with his wife, Shelly, but . . . He just had some problems preventing so. He folded the note and stuffed it into his pocket. He then grabbed the bear. Through the cold endless nights, the bear still stayed warm. As if that one bear held everyone's hope. That boy was out there, he knew it. And Gary was going to find him and everyone else. He stuffed this bear into his duffle bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looting all the re-supply cars, Gary took view of his current surroundings.  From a faraway view, he could see  his house, un-touched and not all damaged. There was a possibility his wife was still safe inside. Simply, he could just take a 8 minute walk over there, talk to Shelly, and hope that she\u2019ll be ok with helping him search for survivors. Yet again, the journey over there would be extremely dangerous. Level ones, twos, threes, sirens, vampires,  diggers, beast, any zombie could just come out of nowhere and eat his brains out. Its probably best to just  hope she\u2019s fine for now and come back to his house once he\u2019s more protected. The church might be the best place to rest a bit.

The cracking sound was enough to alarm a group of 5  level twos that were trailing behind him. He heard a loud ear-splitting screech and fast moving footsteps chasing after him. Gary began to freak out and run even faster. He didn\u2019t have the time to light any of his slime containers or pull out one of his guns. His survival now depended on his legs. And after at least 3 leg transplants, he wasn't the best runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!\u201d he muttered to himself, now running for his life. Quickly turning his head around to the zombies, he noticed they were but just a few yards away from him, outstretching there long sharp claws, aimed right at his back. A foot or 2 more, one of them would be able to leap right at him and tackle him down. What had use to be average human being was now a crazed savage hunter, and Gary was the prey.  Fortunately, the church was located more so uphill, so it made it harder for the zombies to catch up. Unfortunately, so was it hard for Gary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstantly was Gary tripping over his own feet, only to quickly get back up before the zombies took they\u2019re opportunity. Sweat ran down his face, his eyes still trained on the Church. He was getting so much more closer to safety. Dodging stray cars and jumping over random bulks of debris, he ran towards the entrance. Gritting his teeth, he tried to endure the lingering ache in his lower thighs and kept running like hell towards the church entrance. (Ironic, no?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were about as ready to give out. His old weary vision turned blurry. As Gary reach more flat ground, he was already tired and out of breath from climbing up the rather steep hill. By now, he was only 10 feet away from the entrance of the church. He gave out a meek grin. Unconsciously  though,  he was starting slow his pace down. He already easily forgotten how much his life was in danger. The level twos seeing this as an advantage made a sudden lunge towards him with a vicious amount of force, bringing him down to the ground. Gary let out painful yelp as his face collided with the ground floor. Stings of agony went up his back from their digging claws. The church entrance was just a foot away. A foot more and he could of lived. There was nothing he could do. If death was to come, then death he would accept. He closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after closing his eyes, he heard someone yell out, \u201cBack off you ugly bastards!\u201d and 5 guns shots. There was a chorus of shrieks and then sound of falling bodies. Gary would of opened his eyes to see who his savior was, but at the time, he was too weak and tired to do so.  He felt someone walk over to him and sigh. After doing so, he was picked up and propped up against someone, being guided into the church. By then, he was already asleep.</span></div></div>",

You were brought inside and had your wounds treated as best as we could manage so we took your weapons as a sort of payment.\" The girl held out her hand and offered to help Gary up. \"You're also welcome to breakfast when its ready, and if you want, I could show you around and explain the rules.\" Gary was upset at hearing that everything he had scavenged was taken, but decided that he'd worry about that later, right now he was hungry and tired from the previous day. He took her hand and got to his feet. \"I'm Betty, by the way.\" The girl said. \"Nice to meet you.\" Gary smiled and introduced himself as well. \"I'm Gary, I was a doctor at the hospital from across the bridge.\" Upon hearing this Betty gave him a surprised and excited look. \"A doctor?! Really?! We've needed a doctor since we lost West 3 days ago!\" Gary couldn't believe his ears, it appeared he now had a bargaining chip he could use to get his stuff back. Then again, they DID save his life and give him shelter, maybe doing things their way was the better option... What should he do?</span></div></div>",

Good. We've needed one for days. I'm Rob, the guy who's in charge here. Follow all the rules and we'll get along just fine.\" Gary shook the larger mans hand asked him just what the rules were. Rob let go of his hand and his expression turned serious. \"There are only three rules, but breaking any of them will result in a severe penalty. One, you give what you can and take what you need. Two, no harming anyone else and no fighting. Three, you do what I say, when I say. No questions asked. Do we understand one another?\" Gary nodded his head in confirmation. \"I see then, in that case welcome. I'm sure I be able to find you something do in a little while, but for now you need to eat. Breakfast will be ready shortly.\" Gary thanked the man and took a seat near the front of the church. The past few days had been so hectic and unbelievable and he hadn't had much time to stop and catch his breath. He had so many questions he wanted answered. Was his wife okay? Where did the zombies come from? Will this ever end? He was so deep in thought that he barely noticed the hot bowl of oatmeal that had been placed on his lap. \"Eat up.\" A familiar voice said. Gary looked over to see Betty sitting next to him. \"Here you go.\" She said as she handed him a spoon. Gary took it and looked down at his food. It was nice to finally have a hot meal again. \"Thanks.\" He said as he took the first bite of food he'd had in days.</span></div></div>",

It had been long enough that he had seen his home and he desperately wanted see Shelly, dead or not. Maybe they're even somethings that he could pick up while there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his house, ignoring his chances of being attacked. He urged on towards, seemingly not hearing the stalking footsteps of possibly not just one being. The low growls that were not all human. He didn't notice the path of burning steps trailing his path. Nor the wavering red eyes that focused on his every little move. Worry came over Gary. Despite the feeling of terrible danger, he didn't bother to look around. His mind was just playing tricks on him. After days of fighting off zombie hordes, it's the only thing he can think about. The sounds were just his imagination . . . Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary just moved on, focusing his thoughts on his wife. It was extremely hard to do while with the lurking feeling of something horrible was about to happen. Perhaps Gary was just being paranoid, thinking every coming second was a zombie attack. Yet again-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediatly stopped in his tracks. His hands traced over to the shotgun he had hung over himself, gripping it tightly, prepared for whatever was ahead. He quickly turned around towards the noises, pointing his gun at it's direction. Nothing. There was just nothing. The moon was still high up shining down. Trees waved around in the nature reserve right next to him. At that was really there was the long winding road and a gray fog. He turned around, giving out a sigh. Was he getting so old that he was thinking of imaginary zombies? All that was there was fog. Was fog really all that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts had paused. \"Wait.\" he thought to himself. \"Fog. There wasn't any fog before.\" The mechanics in his brain started to work together before coming to a big realization. \"OH SHI-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could turn around again, a vampire had lunge towards him, knocking him down. Out of the cloud, some level 2s, a stalker, and a pyro had emerged out of complete nothing. He could swear that underneath the veil of shawdows, he could see a pair of four glowing eyes smiling wickedly at him. It was a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary had to quickly react. He faced towards the vampire on top of him, preparing to bite his neck. He kicked it off, since it was surprisingly light. He scramble back up, his mind still jumbled at what to do. Looking up, some level 2s were running towards him. His hands found the shotgun, barely being able to hold it up right due to the sweat on his hands.\u00a0As\u00a0one them came to close, Gary just automatically took a good hard swipe at it's head, completely braining the zombie and killing it. He was able to shoot out the other level 2s. Just barely in arms reach. After all the level 2s were dead, he searched around for the vampire. He spotted coming towards him, with a stalker by it's side, getting read to make another lunge. As the 2 killers ran towards him, he looked down at the zombies that lay before him. They were highly flammable. Without a second to spare, Gary had taken out a lighted match, and dropped it on the corpse and dodged out of the way. The two predators were already in mid-air before they could realize that there was a ring of fire. The hot flames had caught on to there skin, progressively burning it off. They howled in agonized pain, running around in madness, not being able to shake it off. Gary heard the screeches of other zombies within the cloud, running away from the scene, no longer having the desire to kill. Gary watched as fire engulfed the area, leaving the burnt bodies dead on the ground. It was a sick image, but he couldn't help but feel a bit satisfied at his work. But there seemed to be something else missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom orange burning flames, a figure still walked towards him. A pyro, immune to fire, had mixed in with the fire and was still fully alive. Gary would smacked himself in the face if he wasn't terrified. It didn't seem to at all lunge, run, or attack him. It just walked towards him, not even really wanting to kill him. The evil smile on it's face, however, told otherwise.\u00a0Gary pointed his shotgun at it, not knowing what else to do. Bullets aren't enough to take it down. He just hoped it wouldn't come closer.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it didn't. It just stood there tilting it's head at Gary. After a few seconds, it had turned it's head towards the sky, shouting out giberish that he couldn't at all undertand. Gary still stood, now confused. He still got the feeling that it wasn't all for good intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pyro looked back down at Gary, it's grin mocking and rather smug. It turned around, walking into the fire and dissapearing into the night, leaving Gary even more confused then before. Was he just spared? He didn't understand what the hell just went down. He kept his gun in the duffle bag and just went back to walking off. Then suddenly, he heard the flapping off wings. The next moment, he had been carried 30ft up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, pyro's buddy the carrier had come to play.</span></div></div>",

When the carrier reached an altitude of about 200 feet it stopped moving up and changed direction. It was flying back towards the bridge Gary had just come from. \"What?! No!\" Gary shouted when he realized this. \"I'm so close to home! My wife...!\" Before the Carrier could get any closer to its destination Gary began to struggle causing it to veer off course and fall lower. Gary still had his shotgun in his hand, but the Carrier had it gripped with one of its own hands, preventing Gary from aiming it. As the two wrestled in the sky they came to the front gate of the nature preserve... and past it as each tried to gain the upper hand. Finally, Gary had an idea to turn the tide in his favor, it would be risky, but it was his only hope. He let go of the shotgun and quickly opened the duffle bag still around his shoulders just wide enough to grab something from the inside. It was the uzi he had picked up earlier, and it was fully loaded. Before the Carrier could tell what was going on, it had one of its front wings severed by a stream of bullets that seemed to come out of nowhere. The monster thrashed about as it tried to stay in the air, only to collide into a tree and and plummet downwards. By this point the Carrier was dead and Gary was holding on for dear life as branch after branch snapped under him on his way down. He was soon thrust off of the tree after the Carrier rolled off a large branch and began falling much faster towards the ground... Gary said a quick prayer in his head and braced himself for impact on the hard earth below. The very next thing Gary felt wasn't the ground, however, it was much softer and far more cold. The Carrier he was still holding onto had managed to land right in the creek that passed by the tree they had hit. Gary felt his whole body shake as it made contact with the water. It hurt like hell, but thankfully, the corpse of the dead zombie absorbed most of the impact from the fall. The force of hitting the water briefly submerged Gary and quick brought him back to full alertness. He let go of his fallen enemy and stood up. The creek was only about waist-deep and quite muddy, but Gary couldn't have cared less. Even if it had been raw sewage, it had saved his life and he was grateful for that. He took a deep breath of the chilly night air and reloaded his uzi. He looked around and saw that the banks of the creek were too steep to climb back up safely. A little farther upstream was a small stone bridge with a metal ladder attached and beyond that Gary could make out some sort of small building, possibly a ranger station. The opposite direction seemed to lead to a lake or pond as the creek grew wider as it went on. It was also downstream which would make moving a little easier as the water would be flowing with him. Which way sounds better?</span></div></div>",

The flowing water slowed him down quite a bit, but he was still able to make decent progress while keeping an eye out for danger. When he finally got to the bridge and was about to climb out of the numbing water he caught sight of something glowing up ahead, just under the bridge. Several red orbs seemed to be moving through the water towards him. Gary knew immediately that they were zombies, yet, they were also unlike any other zombie he'd encountered before. They were obviously swimming in the water, something Gary had thought was impossible as any other zombie that had tried sank like a rock. As they got closer Gary could make out their small forms from the shadows they cast in the moonlit water. They were smaller then most humans and were vaguely frog-like. Once they drew close Gary opened fire and killed two instantly, their bodies floating to the surface like rag dolls. Not wanting to waste any ammo he allowed them to swim up to him before shooting. His plan seemed to be working well, they apparently lacked a ranged attack and were only a danger if got a chance to latch onto him with their teeth, a chance he wouldn't give them. After about a minute of one-sided combat only two Swimmers were left. \"Come and get some, you freaking fish people!\" Gary shouted as they submerged themselves in what Gary thought was an attempt to hide. What he didn't know was that this was all just part of their plan. One of them surfaced a mere 5 feet away from him and shot something into his face. Taken by surprise, Gary fired his gun wildly and heard one of his shots connect with flesh, now only one swimmer was left. He opened his eyes only to find everything was pitched black, no moonlight, no creek, not even the gun in his hands. He had been rendered blind by the last Swimmers suicide attack. Struggling to remain calm, Gary listened desperately for the remaining zombie. He could hear water splashing, the wind blowing, and the sounds of the flowing creek, but couldn't tell where his final attacker was. He would have to make a guess when the Swimmer decided to attack and try to hit it with the ammo he had left. He heard loud splashing moving towards him from behind... closer... closer... this was it... Gary spun around just as the Swimmer leaped out of the water to take a bite out of his face and opened fire. He heard 4 shots ring out before the gun went silent. He was out of ammo. The last zombie collided with Gary's chest and knocked him under the water, his eyesight returning just in time to see the night sky disappear under the murky depths of what would surely be his watery grave. Something amazing had happened though. The Swimmer didn't bite Gary, not only that, it was dead! Its body began floating off of him and up towards the surface, allowing Gary to resurface himself and catch his breath. It seemed one of his last 4 bullets had caught the bastard right between the eyes as it made its last jump. The Swimmers were all dead, Gary had survived his encounter with this new type of zombie and would hopefully live to see another day. He put his uzi back into his duffel bag and climbed the ladder onto the bridge. It was nice to finally be out of the water, but Gary had no time to enjoy his momentary success. He had a new decision to make... travel down the the path to his left towards the building he saw earlier OR take the right path towards the front gate.</span></div></div>",

Gary began walking down the narrow dirt trail slowly and carefully as it was hard to see in the dark. The fact that his clothes were soaking wet, freezing cold, and clinging uncomfortably to his skin didn't help either. Nevertheless, he didn't gripe or make any snide comments. He was going to get to that building come hell or high water, and seeing as he'd already dealt with the water, hell was all that was left. It seemed he had a little luck left, though, as he didn't encounter a single Beast on his way there. The building had been a little closer then Gary had though, but it was indeed a ranger station like he predicted. There was a jeep out front with blood all over the front and on the tires, but the keys weren't in the ignition. Gary did find a machete in the front seat though, so that was something. \"People really should lock their doors.\" He said as he swung the blade a few times in front of him. \"Guess I better see what we have inside there.\" He opened the door to the ranger station (which also wasn't locked) and stepped inside. The lights were out and he could barely see, but he could make out the shape of a flashlight sitting on a nearby desk. He picked it up and switched it on. A soft white beam of light immediately illuminated the small room he was in, it wasn't much, but it helped. Gary was about to explore the rest of the room when he thought he heard something move around outside. Should he go check it out?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just to be careful Gary shone his light out the nearby window to see if anything was moving. After a minute of searching the dense foliage and finding nothing he decided to step outside. He opened and closed the door slowly and kept his machete poised to attack. He tried to listen for sounds of movement, but the only noise came from the nearby creek he had climbed out of. He walked around to the other side of the ranger station and looked over the thick weeds and bushes. Nothing was here but him. It began to rain softly as he walked back around to the main door. Gary felt more then a little unnerved now. He KNEW he had heard something out here. He shook his head as he came back around to the front of the building, feeling he had wasted valuable time on a wild goose chase. As it turned out he was wrong, very wrong. As soon as he got back to the door he noticed something laying on the ground next to the jeep. It was covered in mud and seemed to be crawling along the ground slowly. Gary was careful to keep a safe distance as he walked over to it. \"Hello...?\" He called out over the rain, which seemed to be picking up. The thing crawled a little closer and dropped to the ground unable to keep moving. It appeared to pose no threat so Gary got close enough to shine his flashlight on it. It took only a moment for Gary to realize it was a human, or at least what was left of one. It was one of the parks many rangers, a young man in his early 20's. The poor guy was bleeding so bad that his wounds were actually starting to cover up the mud that covered him from head to toe. Gary knelt down beside him and pushed him over onto his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis front side looked no better, it even took Gary a few seconds to notice that he had blonde hair, what with the bloody grime covering it. The man probably should have been dead at that point, so it came as quite a surprise when he actually spoke. \"T-they are heading towards t-the city.\" He moaned. \"Y-you have to get o-out of here.\" He struggled to raise his hand to grab Gary's shoulder. \"Escape...\" The man coughed up some blood as he tried to keep talking, making his next few words non-understandable. \"Easy!\" Gary said as he tried to comfort the dying man. \"You don't want to make it any worse than it is.\" He knew there was nothing he could do, but couldn't bring himself to tell him how bad it looked. The man let out a weak laugh as he took his hand off Gary's shoulder. \"I k-know I'm done f-for. I was ambushed and b-barely escaped. D-don't follow the p-path t-that leads towards the city, t-they are...\" The man fell silent. Upon checking his pulse Gary confirmed that he had died of blood loss. \"Shit...\" He whispered as he wiped the mud from the rangers ID badge that had fallen out of his pocket. It was hard to see, but he was able to read the name written on it. \"Robert B. Clarke.\" He read aloud. \"I'm sorry I couldn't save you...\" With that Gary put the ID back into the mans pocket and drug his body back up to the door of the ranger station and disappeared inside for a few minutes. He emerged a short time later with a new handgun (fully load which he had found sitting on a desk) and a thick blanket. He wrapped Robert up and drug him inside and laid him next to a table. Before leaving and heading back out into the growing storm he grabbed a piece of paper from a clipboard and wrote on it. He laid it on the table next to Roberts corpse and Left. It simply read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two spare handguns in the drawer of the desk next to the bulletin board. I don't mind if you take them, but please pay your respects to Robert B. Clarke, the man wrapped in the blanket. He was trying to help his fellow survivors even as he lay dying. May he rest in peace.\"</span></div></div>",

Too bad he hadn't gotten as much use out of the flashlight before it died. Oh well, at least he could sort of tell where he was going. After over an hour of walking Gary finally began to grow tired, but pushed himself to keep going despite his injuries and the freezing rain. He was going to get out of here and see his wife again, he had to. The early hours of the morning came and went as he moved along the trail almost aimlessly. The sun had risen, but the storm did not let up, giving Gary just enough light to see a few feet in front of him. The way things were going he almost expected it to start snowing. \"Heh, I don't think I'd be surprised if hell itself had frozen over by now.\" He said softly to himself. Just when his legs were about to give out from walking all morning he came to a chain-link fence covered in vines and weeds. He had finally found his way out of the preserve. Gary had a bit of trouble getting over it, but with the help of some of the vines, made it over without hurting himself. He walked a little further and soon came to a road on the edge of the forest he had been hiking through. He hopped over the flooded ditch in front of it and looked both ways. The heavy rain masked both directions and he was too tired to wait for it to stop. If he didn't find somewhere to rest soon he'd surely pass out...</span></div></div>",

Ten short minutes pasted with the howling wind kicking up rain into Gary's face and the thunderous sounds of the storm deafening his ears. He was about to give up hope when he caught sight of a building up ahead. A road with a sidewalk on both sides connected to the main road up ahead, apparently leading to a small grouping of houses on the edge of the city. Gary walked down the sidewalk slowly, glad to get his soggy shoes out of the flooded street. He looked around lazily as he moved, his weary, sleep-deprived eyes barely registering anything of interest as he moved by the houses. Many of the buildings looked fairly aged, even the street lamps seemed old fashioned. The only modern thing Gary could see was a large building up ahead that he didn't have time to explore at the moment. He didn't even bother reading the large sign that overlooked it as he searched for a place to rest. At least half of the houses had boarded up windows and doors, most of the other half were ether broken in to or outright destroyed by a combination of zombie attacks and the weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary saw one house that had its door hanging off its hinges that was barely damaged and had few broken windows. The inside was plenty damp from the storm, but looked warm and inviting enough to rest in. Gary smiled as he moved aside the door and walked inside. No dead bodies, no zombies, and the downstairs lights still worked. This had been a good decision. Gary walked by the countless pictures of old farmhouses and green, wide open fields with a feeling of homesickness. This house was much like his and he had been so close to getting home... he wondered if Shelly was okay. He pushed the thought out of his mind as he ascended the stairs. The upstairs was much like the downstairs, oddly sweet smelling and full of old rustic pictures of times long past. He opened the door to a bedroom and was pleased to find no bodies (dead OR alive) and an unbroken window. He took off his wet coat and shoes and sat his bag of supplies on a nearby chair. His undershirt and pants were still wet, but by this point Gary was too tired to care. He got in bed and pulled the covers over his head as he listened to the sound of the pouring rain outside.

It was afternoon and no zombies seemed to be wandering outside the cold, wet street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched around the house to get a axe which was for emergency events. He got out of the house and walked along the burned street. Many cars were crashed and dead bodies were lying on the cars. Gary picked up a pistol and looked at it. \"No... useless crap.\" He threw it on the ground. A zombie shuffled towards him when it heard the noise. He threw the axe and it landed at the zombie's brain. Blood flew out like a miniature fountain and it fell. He picked the axe back up and decided to search for stuff at the supermarket he had seen earlier.</span></div></div>",

He walked to the back of the store first to check out the pharmacy. Even if all he had was a slight cold he wanted to stay prepared. He took a few small bottles of medicine from the back shelves and put them into his bag, which was starting to get full. \"Only a little room left...\" Gary said as he left the pharmacy. He took out the uzi he had gotten the previous day at the bridge and set it on a shelf behind some cans of beans. \"I have no use for this if its out of ammo, maybe it can help someone else.\" Gary took the labels off a few cans of beans so that they made a large R shape on the shelf. After a few minutes of looting Gary had enough food and water to last a couple of days. He didn't want to spend too much time here, lest he give the zombies a chance to surround him. Gary thought about leaving with what he had when he noticed that the door to the storage room in the back was open. Since he hadn't seen many zombies outside he decided it couldn't hurt to at least check it out. He slung his duffel bag over his arm and walked inside careful to avoid trapping himself in a corner in case any zombies were there. The shelves were all lined with cardboard boxes of various shapes and sizes, some of which were laying opened and and empty on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that stood out was a large gun case sitting in the back of the room. Upon opening it Gary found a high grade military sniper rifle. Gary took it carefully out of its case and checked the scope, it worked perfectly. The only downside was that there wasn't any more ammo for it laying around... once it was used up that was it. Plus it was too big to fit in his bag... he would have to leave something else behind if he took it. Just as Gary was about to come to a decision a lone figure came walking into the back room without Gary noticing. The figure quickly drew a knife and began sneaking up on him... closer... closer... A sharp cold piece of metal had found its way to Gary's throat, the slightest movement would slice open his neck. Once Gary had noticed this he stopped moving and waited to hear what his capturer had to say. \"Good, you seem smart enough not to try anything stupid. So, tell me, just why did you come in here and what do you think you are doing with my sniper rifle?\" Gary thought for a moment about lying, there's no way this psycho would believe everything that had happened to him in the past 24 hours... but could he make up something believable? \"Well...?\" The figure asked again as they pressed the knife a little harder against Gary's bare neck. A single drop of blood fell to his shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Gary quickly held the sniper rifle in his hands and blasted it's head off. It looks like he had turned into a zombie, judging from the wounds on his chest. Gary decided to hold the rifle instead of putting it in his bag. It may make getting around a bit more difficult, but this way he could take it with him. He quickly walked out just in time to see three zombies getting shot by someone, they fell and Gary looked. He ran towards him but a large growl  echoed and a large zombie grabbed him. Gary stared with horror as blood splattered on the a nearby wall and the road. Gary went back inside the store and used the back door and ran for his life towards a lighthouse off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lighthouse was still flashing lights. It seemed that it was operated by someone as shadows kept moving at the glass panel. Gary knocked on the door and looked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened and he entered. He closed the door and locked it, then went up the stairs. At the top a sniper and a person who was operating the lighthouse was there. \"Who are you?\" Asked the sniper as he fired a round into a zombie. The blood could be heard splattering. \"I'm Gary, I'm a doctor.\" Gary replied. The person operating the lighthouse told him everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey used this lighthouse to attract boats to rescue them or signal helicopters. Many people had tried to use boats to escape the zombies in the large lake nearby. Too bad they didn't know about Swimmers yet, otherwise they may have reconsidered their options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary soon heard a large bang on the door down stairs. He and the unknowed person barricaded the staircase. The survivors soon..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on, we should get back up top and help him.\" The two made their way back up the stairs and Matt greeted Kevin as they walked over to the outer railing. \"We got the bottom secured, no way out... but no way in either.\" Kevin nodded and handed him a spare hunting rifle and pointed out towards the lake. \"We got at least one survivor out there, trapped on a boat like the others we found.\" Gary and Matt looked out over the treetops out towards the lake where, sure enough, a large boat sat motionless on the water. \"How do you know if anyone is still alive on it?\" Gary asked as he sat his duffel bag down on a nearby fold-up chair. \"During the storm earlier I saw someone jump overboard. Since then I've been checking it once every half hour or so. Just ten minutes ago I saw a woman looking through a glass window on a door. She had some blood or something on her shirt, but she was still alive. She must have locked herself inside the ship a few days ago. If we don't do something soon she'll probably die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary walked back over to look at the boat again. It was fairly large, enough to hold several people on board. \"Maybe she isn't alone.\" Gary said as he looked through the scope of his sniper rifle. \"That ship could easily carry a dozen people or more. For all we know there could be several more lives at stake then we know of.\" He zoomed in as much as the gun's scope would allow. The door to the room where the woman had been seen looked sturdy, but there were several Swimmers on the upper deck. Gary knew they were waiting for anyone inside desperate or panicked enough to rush out and become easy prey. \"We'd better do something soon.\" Gary said as he lowered his sniper rifle and turned towards his 2 new companions. \"Any ideas?\" The two looked at each other and nodded. \"I got one.\" Kevin said as he reloaded his own sniper rifle. \"One of us is gonna have to go out there while the other two provide support from here. There's a jetski parked in the boathouse down by the dock. The keys were there when I checked it a few days ago, but I don't know how much gas it has. Whoever goes might end up stuck out there... or worse, stranded in the middle of the lake alone and helpless.\" The men looked at each other before turning to get another look at the boat, it wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. \"Sounds good...\" Gary said uneasily. \"But how do we decide who goes?\"</span></div></div>",

After all, he had no prior sniping experience and nobody wanted to get shot in the head. Once he was well supplied the barrier downstairs was moved aside just long enough to allow him to get out and begin his rescue mission. \"As soon as we get the barricade back up we'll head up top and give you some covering fire if you need it. Good luck!\" Matt called as he closed the door. Gary took a deep breath and began walking down towards the docks. He would have to be careful, he couldn't run from anything as the ground was a slippery mix of mud and dirty water from the rain. His feet made sloshing noises as he stepped in puddle after puddle, all of them much deeper then they looked. Gary looked up past the trees towards the sky for a moment to get his mind off the wet ground and his waterlogged shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still somewhat cloudy, but the sun was out now and even in the shade of the trees its light kept things warm. \"At least I don't have to do this in a storm...\" Gary said with a cough. It seemed his cold was starting to come back. After a short while he came to the docks and was glad to see the boathouse was empty upon entering and the jetski still had its keys. He put the handgun he had out back into his duffel bag, it seemed there was no use for it... at least not yet. He got onto the jetski and turned the keys, it hummed to life and Gary rode slowly out of the boathouse. He had never been on a jetski before and was careful not to do anything that might tip it over. To his relief he came to the boat in less then a minute and wouldn't have to drive any longer. He turned the keys back and shut it off once he had gotten to the side of the ship. As quietly as possible he stood up and climbed onto the deck of the boat. He took a quick glance around and couldn't believe his luck, there were no Swimmers on this side of the boat! Gary took advantage of this by...</span></div></div>",

Experience had shown Gary they could be crafty and underestimating them was a bad idea. He walked silently over to the door with the window and looked inside. There was a woman sitting up against the wall sobbing, her shirt indeed covered with blood that must have belonged to someone else, no human could survive losing that much blood. Along with the woman there was a small girl sitting below the window on the other side of the room who looked to be about ten years old. The rest of the inside was obscured by the short narrow hallway that connected the room to the door. Just as Gary was about to tap on the glass to get their attention the little girl noticed him. They stared at each other for a few seconds before the girl got up and ran over to let him in. \"Huh, what is it?\" Came another young voice, this one a boy's. Gary opened the unlocked door and quickly got inside before closing it back and locking it. \"Hello sweetie, who else is here with you?\" Gary asked as he followed the girl into the room. It looked really nice in here, everything from sizable paintings to little models of ships and such lined the place as if it was trying to show off. Even with the bloodstains, Gary doubted anyone he knew would decline spending a night on this boat. He was so caught up admiring the furnishings, he almost didn't notice the young boy and teenage looking girl who were staring at him with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear me mister?\" The little girl said as she tugged at his sleeve. \"That's Timmy, by brother and the older girl is Amber, who's my cousin.\" Gary snapped back to reality and realized he was being rude. \"Oh, hello, its a pleasure to meet you both.\" He said as he turned to the woman sitting against the wall. She seemed as if she didn't even notice him come in. \"Er, who's this?\" He asked as he walked over to her. \"That's mommy.\" The little girl and boy said together. \"She's been sad since our sister died....\" The little girl added. Gary felt another wave of sadness wash over him when he heard these words. \"My god... I'm... I'm so sorry.\" The little girl bowed her head. \"Her name was Lily, she was only two years old.\" The woman's head shot up upon hearing the name of her lost child, a look of utter rage upon her face. \"They took her... THOSE FUCKING BASTARDS KILLED MY BABY!!!!! WHY?!!!!! SHE WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD!!!!!\" A fresh stream of tears began flowing down her face. \"They took her... its not fair... first my husband, now my youngest daughter... Damn them! DAMN THEM!!!!!\" She buried her face in her knees and refused to talk anymore. Gary felt a tear slide down his cheek. He had never had children of his own, but was sure he had an idea of the pain it caused when they were gone. He silently prayed he never had to endure the same torture. \"Hey mister, why are you crying...?\" The little girl asked when she noticed his watery eyes and reddened face. \"It nothing... I have a slight cold.\" He replied as he wiped his eyes on his shirt sleeve. \"By the way... I never got your name did I?\" The little girl smiled at finally being asked her name. \"I'd thought you'd never ask! Its Clare, nice name isn't it?!\" She shouted happily. \"Its a lovely name.\" Gary said as he patted her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... I'm sure you know why I'm here. I've got some spare handguns and ammo in my bag here, courtesy of some new friends. Once I've cleared out the Swimmers we can get to the engine room and start this thing. Then we'll head for the lighthouse.\" The two children and the older girl looked at him in surprise and confusion. \"Swimmers?\" Timmy asked. \"What are those?\" Gary was himself surprised they didn't know what he was talking about. \"Those things that look like some kind of messed up fish creature. Those are Swimmers... at least that's what I call them.\" He reached into his bag and pulled out a handgun along with some ammo. \"Here, Amber.\" The older girl took the gun and looked it over. \"It this thing... real?\" Gary nodded. \"You're the the second oldest person here and you seem responsible enough, so I need you watch over the children while I clear the deck. Once all the zombies are dead I can start this thing up and we'll all get out of here.\" The little girl crossed her arms and the little boy made an angry face. \"Hey we arn't children!\" He said angrily. \"Okay then,,,\" Gary said as he walked back towards the door. \"You're kids, and good kids do what they are told. You don't wanna be bad do you?\" Both shook their heads. \"We'll be good mister, please save us!\" They said together. \"Don't worry, I intend to.\" Gary said as he put a hand on the door. Just as he was about to leave, however, Amber came running over to him. He took his hand off the knob and turned back around. \"Yes...? Is there anything you wanted to tell me before I left?\"</span></div></div>",

I had to kill a few of them myself when they... came back.\" Gary though she was about to cry, but her face didn't change as she spoke. There was even a small hint of anger in her voice. \"If you think I'm unprepared to kill someone, don't be. I've done it before to protect the family I have left and I'll be glad do it again if you'll let me.\" Gary took a moment to consider the things she had said. He could use some help, but didn't want to expose a teenage girl to any more danger then he had to. Even if she seemed like she could handle herself. \"If you go with me... who will watch your cousins?\" He asked in an attempt to dissuade her from joining him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" A voice came from behind them. It was soft, yet firm. The woman who had spent the past few days slumped in the corner crying herself silly over the tragedy she had experienced, was standing. Her hair covered her face, but Gary could feel her gaze as if nothing was in the way. \"I'll protect them... those things won't hurt my children, never again.\" Gary was about to speak, only to find himself biting his tongue. He could tell she wouldn't change her mind so he didn't bother arguing any further. \"Guess you're coming with me.\" Gary said as he walked past Amber over to the children's mother. \"Here, I've only got one handgun left. Keep the safety on unless they get in.\" He said as he handed her a small silver gun he had pulled out of his duffel bag. \"You know how to use it, right?\" She nodded and took the gun with shaking hands. \"Please, please get my children out of here...\" She said as she turned and walked over to sit down with her last two children next to the wall. \"We will, aunt Susan!\" Amber called from the hallway. \"Come on, doctor! We got a boat to reclaim.\" Gary smiled and joined her back at the door. \"You are a really brave girl.\" He said as he unlocked the door. \"They say it runs in my family.\" She replied as she gave the door a slight push to open it quietly. \"Alright, here we go!\" Gary called as he ran outside and motioned for Amber to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool afternoon breeze blew through the air and brushed the leaves on the trees into a frenzy. In the distance something could be heard shambling along the shoreline. A low moan escaped its lips. Gary took a deep breath as he moved down the deck and peeked around the corner. One Swimmer with an injured arm. He could take it by surprise and then kill the ones on the other side while Amber went in the opposite direction and begin hitting them from that side. A pincer attack, their only escape would be into the chilly water below. Once they had secured the ground level, they could both storm the upper deck and reclaim the entire boat. After that was done they would drive it to the shore and get to the lighthouse. It was a good plan. Gary held out his hand to motion for Amber to stop and turned to face her. \"I'll go around this side of the ship and began my attack.\" He whispered just loud enough for her to hear him. \"You go around the other side and cut off their escape. That way they'll have to retreat back into the water or be shot. Once we clear the lower deck we can move on to the upper deck and start this thing up.\" Amber gave a slight nod to show she understood and sprinted backwards towards the other end of the ship. When she began shooting Gary would make his move on this side. In less then a minute a noise came from Amber's side of the ship, it was the sound of...</span></div></div>",

It didn't even let out a groan as it fell over and was kicked off the edge of the ship by Gary as he ran past it. Just when he turned to face the rest of them he was almost hit by a blot of ink, but dodged right before it connected. \"Not this time.\" He called out as he blew half of the things face away. Other then the two he had just killed, there were four Swimmers left. Gary aimed for the one closest to him, but didn't pull the trigger fast enough. It fell on its side as blood ran down from its forehead and off the side of the boat. \"Sorry doc, did you want that one?\" Amber called as she pointed the gun at another Swimmer that was running toward her. \"Damn, you sure can shoot!\" Gary called cheerfully as he severed the right ear from a Swimmer that had its back turned 8 feet in front of him. His second shoot put an end to it just as it turned around. \"Man, these things seemed so scary before, but now that we're armed they might as well be fish in a barrel.\" Amber said with a laugh. \"I can't believe they gave us so much trouble before.\" Gary reloaded his gun as she killed the last Swimmer with 2 shots to the head. \"I wouldn't underestimate them if I were you...\" Gary said as he took an extra chip out of his bag and threw it to amber. \"They almost killed me before, and that was just a small group.\" Amber reloaded her gun and followed Gary as he walked up the five steps that led to the upper deck. \"Yeah yeah, I promise I'll be careful.\" She replied in an almost sarcastic tone. \"Let's just hurry up and get out of here before we have to deal with more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary didn't like her attitude, but couldn't blame her. She was young and still had a lot to learn. He fired off a shot at the lone Swimmer on the upper deck, only to hit the window behind it. \"Here, I got it.\" Amber called as she fired a shot from her own gun. The Swimmer slumped over, dead. \"You really can shoot...\" Gary said as he walked past the body and opened the door to the small room that stood before them, careful to avoid stepping on the broken pieces of glass. \"Careful...\" He called as Amber began to follow him inside. He stopped when he noticed something sitting on the floor under the ships dashboard. It was the decaying body of the captain laying in a puddle of his own blood, his throat ripped out and his head crushed. \"Stop!\" Gary called before Amber could get any closer. \"What?\" She asked in an annoyed tone. Gary shook his head as he looked over the grisly scene. There were the keys still in the ignition, at least. \"Go back and keep watch while I start this thing up.\" Gary said in an upset tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber seemed to notice that he was hiding something and was about to ask him if anything was wrong when he turned around and scooted her out the door. \"Hey what is it?\" She asked as he took the duffel bag off of his shoulder and handed it to her. \"There's plenty of extra ammo in that. Shout if you see anything.\" He said hastily as he closed the door back. Amber was about to ask again if anything was wrong, but knew she probably wouldn't get an answer. She simply sighed and walked back over to the stairs with the duffel bag over her shoulder. \"Don't let us down, doctor...\" She whispered as she looked from the lake to the shoreline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance she noticed something moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary started up the boat and began driving it towards the shore near the lighthouse. The jetski he had used to get here was pushed aside and made a scrapping sound as it was knocked under the the water for a brief moment. The boat was moving. Not fast or smoothly, but it was moving none the less. They would all be safe soon if this thing held out for just a few more minutes. Gary was about to call out to Amber as they moved along slowly, only to hear her call to him from the outside. \"What is it?\" He called back as he kept his eyes focused on the shoreline ahead.</span></div></div>",

No matter what!\" She called over the sound of the slamming door. They were a little closer by the time he got outside, but Gary knew exactly what they were, he had dealt with one only a day before. There were about two dozen of them, not counting the other zombies they carried, along with a small swarm of birds. Gary made sure both of the handguns he had were fully loaded and took the first shot when they got close enough. A Pyro was caught in the head and ignited its entire body as it went limp. The Fire quickly spread to the Carrier holding it and burned away its wings as it let out a death cry. Both bodies hit the water with a loud splash that was barely heard over the roar of giant wings and moaning corpses. Gary hadn't even put a dent in their assault and they were drawing closer by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Gary called as he fired off a few more shots, only managing to kill or wound 3 zombies. They fell silently as their friends let out a chorus of growls that echoed through the trees as they moved in close, ready to kill the lone doctor. Gary only got off 4 more shots before he heard the click of an empty gun. He was out of ammo. Quickly he dug two more clips from the duffel bag he had taken back from Amber. He was halfway reloaded when the ones in the front finally reached the ship. Three Carriers, a Stalker, a level two, and a Siren loomed overhead for a moment before making a dive at him. He raise his guns just as they went for the kill, he was too late. They would strike him down before he could get a single shot off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Gary's immense surprise, they flew past him... into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" He gasped as he turned towards the shore. It was hard to make out, but two figures could be seen atop the lighthouse. It appeared Gary's new friends had finally gotten a good shot at the bastards and took them out. \"Thank you!\" Gary called out in relief as he raised his guns to air, knowing that his allies had no chance of hearing him. \"Now help me get these people out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fired as the rest of the swarm descended upon the boat. Two Carriers were hit and fell into the water along with the undead that they carried. The rest flew around the boat in circles, each trying to catch Gary off guard. He struggled futility to kept up with them, but soon the Carriers began flying away... empty handed. \"Damn it... goddamn it! Where are they?!\" Gary cursed as he backed up against the door. Almost on cue, two Slimers appeared from opposite sides of the boat and launched blue goo at him as they made a run for the stairs that would get them to the upper deck. \"Oh, no you don't!\" Gary taunted as he ran to the stairs and cut them off. He fired as soon as the first one turned around the corner and took part of its head off. The second, however, got off a sticky blast right as Gary shot. The blue gunk stuck to Gary's left arm and attached to the side of the boat when he leaned on it. \"Shit, what is this...\" He asked in an annoyed tone. \"I'm stuck to the wall!\" Both of the Slimer corpses dissolved into more blue slime that flowed over his feet as the rest of the horde prepared to finish off the trapped doctor...</span></div></div>",

Gary tried yelling louder, but was soon cut off as a level one zombie bit into his ankle. He turned around just in time to see a small mob surrounding him. Gary raised his guns and fired franticly at his attackers, only killing two of them before running out of ammo. The gun clicked on an empty chamber as the remaining corpses began tearing him apart. The last thought to pass through his head was a cruel reminder of what he had said only minutes ago. \"Don't stop.

If he could defend himself until they got to dry land Amber could come back out and help him finish the remaining zombies. He struggled to reload both of his guns with his arm stuck against the wall, but managed to dig the clips out of his bag and put them in the firearms  just in time. A group of level one zombies appeared off to the size and began shambling towards him. He aimed carefully with his free hand and took them all down with only one shot each. \"So far, so good...\" He mumbled as he waited for more to reveal themselves. A growl sounded on the opposite side of the boat and a large black cloud could be seen over the top of the railing on the upper deck. \"Oh god... what now?\" Gary groaned as it rounded the corner and made its way over to the stairs. Darkness enveloped him and his vision disappeared into a void of black. Deep within the inky shadows there was the sound of movement, something shambling and something crawling. Gary's breathing grew heavier as his foes approached slowly, hidden from sight. \"Damn it, show yourself!\" Gary yelled in desperation. There was a brief moment of silence and the moving resumed. Finally, four crimson red eyes appeared out of the darkness from the left side of the lower deck. They moved closer until they were only a few feet from Gary. Whatever they belonged to growled and snarled as if to say \"KILL HIM.\" The sound of movement filled the air once again as Gary began shooting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nightmare was hit instantly and was killed, but its corpse remained, providing an eerie veil to camouflage the remaining undead. Two... SOMETHINGS ran around the corner and growled as they struck at Gary. One was killed by a lucky shot and fell over dead before it could reach him, but the other one was more successful in its attack. A set of claws that felt like razor blades sliced through the side of Gary's right leg. There was a scream and the sound of metal colliding with flesh as Gary pistol whipped the monster right in the side of the head. It let out a groan and fell to the floor, twitching a bit before going limp. Gary clutched his slashed open leg and tried to assess the damage. Quite a bit of blood, possibly a broken bone or two, yet no major ruptured blood vessels. It was a treatable wound, but needed care immediately. Gary tried to pull his arm from the wall and was surprised to feel the slime give about an inch or two. He tried pulling a little harder, but barely made any more progress. \"Not quite yet...\" He said as he panted. He held up both  of his guns in preparation for any more zombies and listened for sounds of movement...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything remained silent. The zombies were either all dead or regrouping somewhere else. Either way, at least Gary now had time to tend to his leg and get the others off of the boat. He pulled his arm free of the wall with one last tug and pulled his feet out of the dissolving goo around his ankles. \"Finally gone...\" He stammered as he limped back towards his comrade who was now docking the ship next to the boathouse. The darkness around him disappeared all at once and the bright sunlight stung his eyes when he first regained his sight. He squinted and knocked on the door as he grabbed hold of his injured leg, which was still bleeding. \"Its me, Gary. Hurry up and open the door...\" It took her a moment, but the cheerful teenager soon greeted him with a hug. \"Thank you doctor.\" She said as tears began to form in her eyes. \"You protected us, just like you said.\" Gary smiled back weakly and almost fell over as Amber helped set him down on the floor inside. \"One of those things cut my leg, I'll have to treat it while you get your aunt and cousins to the lighthouse up the hill. My friends will take care of you there, now hurry.\" Amber nodded and bent over to kiss him on the cheek as he dug out the first aid kit that he had brought with him out of his duffel bag. Once he had what he need he gave the bag back to Amber along with one of his guns. \"Go ahead, I'll follow as soon as I fix myself up. Be careful climbing down the stairs, one of those things somehow made everything dark.\" Gary called as she closed the door, leaving him alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary struggled to stand up after getting his wounded cleaned and bandaged. It seemed the zombie had inflicted major damage to the muscle tissue, which, on top of everything else, could leave him with a limp for the rest of his life. Even if he got it treated at a hospital with the best medical equipment, that was probably the best possibility, the worst would be losing the leg due to improper treatment. \"Oh well, no use worrying about that now.\" Gary groaned as he finally got to his feet. \"I did... the best I could with... what I had...\" A few beads of sweat rolled down his face as he slowly made his way over to the door. He had about had it, if he didn't get some rest soon he'd be of no use during another zombie attack. He stumbled outside and grabbed onto the railing of the ship to help support himself. As he steadied himself he happened to look up towards the other survivors who were making their way up the hill with Amber in the lead. \"Good, they're all still okay...\" Gary said as he walked back into the darkness towards the lower deck. Once he was back in the light he walked around the side of the boat and carefully dropped down onto the dock with his good leg. He was about to resume walking when he heard a scream come from further up the hill. It sounded like Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! What now?!\" Gary shouted as he sprinted down the dock as fast as his nearly crippled leg allowed. It stung and ached as he forced it to carry him through the puddles of mud and water that coated the weeds and grass, but he was determined to reach his companions. \"Please be okay... please be okay... PLEASE be okay...\" He stuttered as he huffed and coughed. It wasn't long before he heard another scream, this time a child's. \"NO!\" He yelled as he pushed aside a tree branch. He stopped only when the other survivors came into view in the clearing ahead. Both the children were standing next to each other near their mother who was slumped in the grass as she shook uncontrollably. Amber was laying in the grass about four yards in front of them with a man in a white robe standing over her. The man had shoulder-length blond hair and two sets of white angelic wings sticking out of his back. Wasting no time Gary ran forward and revealed himself.</span></div></div>",

Gary slowed and came to a stop just in front of the children and their mother. \"What... the fuck... did you do to her...?!\" Gary wheezed as he pointed a lone finger at Amber's unconscious form laying in the grass next him. \"Oh her? Hee hee, the poor girl tried to shoot me, but I was a little quick for her...\" The man chucked. \"By the way, I'm Ishmael, number 2748 of the 5000 brotherhood members sent to this city. My ability is that of the holy falcon. I can fly and...\" As he said this his hands began sharpening into massive talons. \"I can easily cut through steel.\" He finished as he looked into the eyes of the horrified doctor. Gary almost dropped his gun in shock, but his tight grip ensured that he held onto it. \"Y-you have powers?! There are 5000 others like you?!\" He stuttered as Ishmael began smiling again, a horrible smile that didn't carry a hint of malice or hatred. That's why it was so horrifying, it was a genuinely friendly smile coming from a man who had just knocked a teenage girl unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Each member of our little order has powers, you normal humans have no hope of facing us. Why not just accept your deaths and die with dignity?\" Ishmael spoke in a disturbingly calm tone. One of the children began crying when he raise his hand up in the sunlight for everyone to get a good look. The sun shone of of it as Ishmael twitched and shook his fingers around. \"You needn't be afraid little one, I'll be sure to send your mommy and relatives along with you, you can all be together again in death.\" Upon hearing this Gary could take no more. He raised his gun and fired two shots at the bastard. A stunned silence then filled the air as Gary dropped his gun to the ground. Ishmael had caught both bullets between his talons and effortlessly shredded them into tiny pieces. \"Don't worry, good doctor.\" He said with a sneer. \"I'll send you away along with your companions... just as soon as I decide who to kill first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth children were now crying as the demented man tried to make up his mind of who would be his next victim. \"Oh I know!\" He said in an unnervingly cheerful tone. \"I'll flip a coin. That way god can decide who he wants to meet first.\" He smiled as he dug around in a pocket beneath the outer part of his robe. \"Oh goodie, I have a spare coin!\" He said as he raised his hand to show a small silver coin between his thin claw-like fingers. \"So, who'll be heads and who'll be tails?\" He called in an enthusiastic voice, as if he expected them to answer. \"C'mon... Fine then, I'll decide.\" His smile grew wider as he looked from the kids and their mother to the doctor who was struggling just to stay standing before him. \"Alright children, you get to be tails, doctor, you're heads.\" He flipped the coin and watched as it fell to the ground. Gary tried to think of something, anything he could do as the deranged man walked over to the ground to see the result of the toss. \"Oh, looks like its...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll send the children off shortly after I deal with you.\" Gary took a step back and tried to stall for time. \"Wait, why are y-\" He was cut off as the taller man grabbed him carefully in his talons and effortlessly held him over his head. Now both children were crying even harder as they held onto their mother. \"Looks like you're half-dead already. Our pets must have done a real number on you.\" Ishmael said as Gary thrashed about futilely. \"Easy now, I don't want you to accidentally slice open your neck before I get a chance to kill you. After all, I rarely get the chance to finish anyone myself.\" He said with a chuckle. \"Let's see, I could just slice your neck or cut off your air and be done with it, but that's far too easy. I like to be creative, each life I take must be elegantly destroyed in the most expressive way possible. A life taken by a bullet has no beauty to it at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was close to passing out when Ishmael finally loosened his grip a little and let the doctor draw in a fresh breath. \"I know...\" Ishmael said as he looked over Gary's shoulder. In less then a second both men were airborne, but that didn't last long as they landed next to two trees growing about two feet apart from each other. \"What are... you...\" Gary said weakly as he was dropped to the ground. His whole body hurt now, not just his leg anymore and it was clear he wouldn't be running away. \"Did you know I can regenerate?\" Ishmael said as he casually ripped one of his finger talons off. \"Well, to a minor extent, full regeneration eludes me... not that I need it. No one on this earth has ever so much as come close to damaging my perfect form.\" Gary winced as a fresh talon began growing in place of the one that had been removed. With a swift motion the new talon was removed as well, only to have a third begin growing in its place. \"My... my god...\" Gary moaned as he was lifted once again into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Gary felt was a pain far worse then anything he had experienced in his life. His left hand was stuck to one of the two trees by the talon, which was slowly being driven into the palm of his hand. His screams of pain and horror did nothing to stop the cruel man as he drove the second talon deep into the bark of the second tree with Gary's right hand in between. A small trickle of blood ran down his hands and he finally fell silent as the shock overwhelmed him. Somehow, in spite of all of this, he managed to stay conscious. \"Are you a believer in Christ? If you are I'm sure you can appreciate the irony of this situation.\" Ishmael taunted as he began laughing again...</span></div></div>",

Ishmael returned one of his hands to its human form and punched Gary in the side of the jaw, causing a single tooth to fly out and disappear somewhere in the grass. Gary fell silent as blood began pouring out from his mouth and onto his shirt. \"Why are you still resisting?\" Ishmael taunted as he held Gary's head up and looked into his eyes. \"Give up, you're going to bleed to death here.\" Gary opened his mouth to reply, but no words came out, the pain was so bad it was a struggle just to remain conscious. Gary coughed and spit blood on Ishmael's shoes, it was all he could do. This, as it turned out was not a very smart move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIshmael delivered another sharp blow to Gary's jaw and caused a stream of fresh blood to start pouring out. \"You got blood on my shoes.\" He said in that eerily calm voice of his. \"Fuck bleeding to death, I'm going to reach down your throat and tear your heart out.\" Gary's head snapped back up and he tried once again to get free, still to no avail. \"I already told you. You're going to die here.\" Ishmael said calmly and his hand grew into talons again. \"No!\" Gary yelled as Ishmael lowered his claw over the doctors face with a smile. \"This is it doctor... say goodb-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree gunshots echoed through the trees and red lines began running down Ishmael's robes. \"What?\" He groaned as he took his hand off Gary's face and turned around to see his attacker. It was Susan, who was standing in front of her children with a look of utter fury on her face. She pulled the trigger again, only to have it click on an empty chamber. \"That... was... for my child you son of a bitch... my child...\" Tears began rolling down her eyes as Ishmael rose one again into the air, seemingly unharmed by the bullets imbedded in his torso. In a flash he was upon her and struck her to the ground with a single blow. \"You little bitch, I'll kill both your children and make you watch!\" As he said this there wasn't even a hint of regret or remorse in his voice. \"NO!\" Susan screamed as she returned to her feet and smacked Ishmael across the side of the face. His head was knocked back a bit and for a moment it looked like she may have actually hurt him. Sadly, that moment was all too brief and quickly forgotten as Ishmael demonstrated the depths of his cruelty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words. There was complete silence as he plunged his talons deep into her stomach and lifted her into the air. Even the smile on his face had disappeared by this point. \"Susan! SUSAN!\" Gary yelled desperately as he struggled to get himself free. \"Put her down you bastard!\" Ishmael ignored him and once again returned one of his hands to normal. \"You got blood all over my robe.\" He said in an enraged tone to the dying woman. \"Allow me to pay you back for that.\" To the horror of Gary and the two children he began pelting her body with several vicious punches. \"Cry now, I want to hear you beg me to stop.\" The blows grew sharper and more painful as the monster began to lose his patience. \"Beg me to stop you little whore! Come on! Just say stop and I'll slit your throat and put an end to it.\" Susan simply coughed up some blood and looked into the man's eyes without even the slightest hint of fear in her own. With the last of her strength she punched him as hard as she could in the jaw. He let out a grunt and fell to the ground, dropping her in the process. \"That... was for my child...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pool of blood began forming around her as she lay on the ground unresponsive. Her children rushed over to her and tried to wake her, begging her to open her eyes as Ishmael began getting back to his feet. \"Damn her, I'll have pay her back for that too by-\" Gary interrupted him just as he was about to finish with a talon to the back. \"How's it feel to get stabbed with your own weapon?!\" Gary asked as he shoved the man to the ground for a final time. YOU?!\" Ishmael choked as Gary towered over him. \"You said you could regenerate?! Let me see you regenerate from this!\" Gary yelled furiously as he plunged Ishmael's other talon deep into his left eye. There was a prolonged scream and the body of the demon in the white robes collapsed into dust. Gary fell to the ground with a weak smile and looked up at his hands. The holes where he had been stabbed were leaking blood all down his arms. \"Guess its... over...\" He said as the forest around him faded from view and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In less then 5 hours they would be out of this hellhole and safe with the countless other rescued survivors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first four hours went by very slowly as Gary rested and Matt and Kevin kept watch for any approaching zombies. They had already shot 4 level ones and a level two by the time Gary woke up a second time with just an hour to go before the chopper was set to arrive. Both men had decided to keep secret about what they had discovered inside the lighthouse for the time being as they didn't want to cause any unwanted stress in the already strung out group. \"So, we gonna tell em' about what we found down in the basement of this place when we get rescued?\" Kevin asked as he blew away the head of a Digger that had finally decided to stick its head out of its hole about 70 yards away. \"Yeah, we'll also have to show them the things we found on that white robe they had with them.\" Matt replied as he looked out over the lake. \"By the way, how much time until that chopper we radioed shows up?\" Kevin checked his watch while reloading his gun. \"Let's see, its almost 7:00 p.m. so I'd say half an hour, give or take.\" Matt looked down at his own gun and once again out at the lake. \"I still can't believe its almost over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kevin left the door open so he could hear his friend and began moving towards the bottom of the lighthouse where the doctor and the other survivors were waiting. \"Hey, you're awake again. How do you feel?\" He called when he noticed Gary sitting up in his bed talking with Amber. \"Oh, well my leg and hands still hurt like hell and I feel a bit lightheaded, but I think I'll make it. You must have taken good care of me while I was out, I'm impressed.\" Kevin smiled as he sat down on the floor next to Amber. \"Well actually... Matt and Amber here did most of the patching up, first aid really isn't my specialty.\" Gary grinned as he turned back towards Amber. \"Wow, so you can handle a gun like a pro and helped fix me up? I wish I was that skilled at your age, all I could do as a teenager was play a decent game of chess.\" He said with a laugh as Amber began to frown. \"Yeah... I just wish I could've done more... maybe if I hadn't passed out...\" She trailed off without finishing and Gary put a bandaged hand on her shoulder. \"You did all you could, same with the rest of us, we couldn't save everybody, but we did the best we could and soon we'll all be out of here. Safe and sound with a bright new day waiting for us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber began tearing up again and gave the doctor a hug. \"Thank you... all of you... thank you for helping us...\" Kevin couldn't help but smile when he heard her kind words and began feeling good again for the first time in days. The group of survivors began talking with one another like they were all old friends and discussed the things they would do once they had escaped. Unfortunately, as soon as the mood began improving dramatically the cold reality of their situation was thrust abruptly back into their faces. Matt began screaming at the top of his voice about an incoming horde of zombies. Kevin quickly jumped to his feet and joined back up with his friend to see what they were up against. \"It doesn't look good...\" Matt groaned as he pointed in the direction of the city off in the distance. It was hard to see beneath the sea of green leaves and tree branches, but an unmistakable gathering of zombies had formed and was moving straight for them. \"Quick, hold them off as long as you can while me and the others reinforce the downstairs!\" Kevin yelled as he rushed back down the stairs to warn the others of the danger. The helicopter could show up at any minute now... and so could a thousand pairs of burning red eyes looking for a victim...</span></div></div>",

Help me with this door, doctor, and you children need to head upstairs with Matt.\" Gary slowly got up out of his bed and stood up with his aching hands and leg. \"Shit, this hurts...\" He groaned as he stumbled over to where Kevin was and helped him cover the door with whatever they were able to. \"What about the windows?\" Gary asked as he shoved a chair towards the door. \"There's no need to worry about them, no zombie could fit through in one piece.\" Kevin replied as they finished their work and headed back upstairs just as the growls began echoing outside joining with the sound of gunfire from the survivors up top. \"Come on doctor, we have to hurry, rescue will be here any minute.\" Kevin called as they made their way up the stairs. \"I know, we made it this far, what's a few more minutes?\" Gary replied with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings looked pretty grim up on top of the lighthouse, but it was an awe inspiring sight to see each and every other survivor wielding a gun and blowing away the undead one bullet at a time. \"Gary and Kevin are here!\" One of the children called as they blew the jaw off a level 2 making a run for the lighthouse's front door. \"Here!\" Matt called as he tossed the arriving survivors their weapons. \"No time for chit-chat, just start shooting! We need to thin their number as much as we can before they reach the door!\" Gary took the handgun and ammo he was given and began loading it with a bit of difficulty in his weakened state. \"Shit, you gotta be faster, they're almost here!\" Matt yelled as Gary finally managed to load his gun. \"Right, I'll try to be quicker!\" Gary yelled back and began shooting. Unfortunately, his aim was off due to his bandaged hands and he only got two kills with his first clip. The rest were misses. \"Damn it, I can't get a good shot!\" Gary shouted as he attempted to loaded his second clip into the gun.

They fired as if the world had gone into slow motion. A zombies forehead burst open below and red liquid exploded from the wound like bits of confetti. Everything was almost frozen in a haze of doubt as the survivors continued with their almost hopeless struggle. It was at that moment Gary knew what he needed to do. He took a deep breath and the world resumed its normal pace. Several shots rang out in tune with the banging on the door below. Gary sat his gun down and with all the fury of a madman tore off the bandages binding his hands. The blood stained white ribbons unwraveled to the ground as the doctor grimmaced in pain. His hands were scabbed over and still coated with dried blood from wounds sustained just hours before. Gary forced his hands to move, to clench into fists so that he may visibly display his inner rage. Three fingers refused to budge, but the rest obeyed the command given to them and curled into a ball. Gary took another deep breath as pain shot through his arm and picked up his gun. He was just about to head downstairs when one of the survivors noticed he was no longer fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, what are you doing...\" Amber asked with a hint of fear in her voice. Her eyes fell on the doctors hands when he turned around and she had to surpress the urge to yell. Instead her voice was calm when she spoke, although the fear never left it. \"Your bandages... doctor what are...\" She bit her lip when the realization hit her. \"No! NO! You can't-\" Gary silenced her with the sound of his own voice, which resonated with conviction and stern resolution. \"I have to. I'm an old man and you're just kids. You must live... even if I have to die.\" Tears flowed down Ambers face as she tried to protest. \"I... I'll come too! Those bastards killed my family! Let me-\" \"No. I'm doing this alone. Goodbye.\" Gary turned away to hide his own tears as he tightened his grip on his gun. Everyone else keep firing into the horde as the doctor parted with them and headed back downstairs. They pretended they didn't hear the words exchanged... although their faces made it clear what they were feeling. A thunderous roar in the distance punctuated the doctors exit. The helicopter was finally in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye doc...\" Matt wispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a hell of a guy...\" Kevin muttered as he fired another shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you doctor...\" The children said queitly in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Amber said sorrowfully as she wiped the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chair fell to the floor just as Gary reached the bottom of the stairs. The door was busted and the barricade was slowly being pushed aside. \"Guess thats it then...\" Gary said as he made sure his gun was loaded. \"I came close Shelly... I came real close...\" He turned his attention back on the rotten arms reaching for him from the outside and took one final breath as the undead finally bypassed the survivors final defense. \"All right you murdering bastards...\" Gary called over the roar of the ghastly crowd advancing on him. \"Come and get it.\"</span></div></div>",

Another zombie, a skinny woman, then jumped onto Gary and almost knocked him over. Luckily, he kept his balance as he took a few steps back. The woman shrieked and tried to gash Gary with her claws, but something in his hand stopped her. \"A level 2, huh? You bitches don't go down easy...\" Gary smirked as he drove the broken chair leg he held into her eye as he shovered her off. \"Yet you DO go down...\" The doctor finished as he began backing up the stairs. He drew both of his guns and fired at the zombies trying to get back on their feet as well as the ones moving around them. With both his hands free the doctors shots were much more accurate, even if every jolt of the guns in his hands sent painful shocks up his arm. A Slimer in a torn ski mask opened his mouth to take a shot at Gary, only to have half his head blown away with 2 rounds right to the face. The thing's body collasped into burning acidic goo just as Gary popped off his last shot into the chest of an elderly man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat Gary took the two spare clips he had been given and reloaded both guns in only a few seconds. More undead were pouring through the growing hole where the door had been, but the staircase was narrow and only allowed a few to engage him at a time. Plus, the rumbling of the chopper sounded just overhead, meaning it was about to pick up his friends. \"I just might make it out of this yet...\" Gary called hopefully as he pistol whipped a Stalker that jumped at him across the face and over the rail. Knowing that he was almost out of time Gary fired his remaining shots in rapid session to stem the tide of approaching zombies. Five of the seven shots connected, four of which were in the head. More dead zombies collasped on their friends which allowed Gary a 5-10 second head start to make it back up top before they caught up with him. He was already halfway there, but was tired and weak from his brief struggle against the horde. Right before he made it topside a level 2 managed to grab his ankle and almost pulled him down. Almost. A swift kick to the face made it release its grip and fall backwards as the doctor make a break for the reascue helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooftop was now empty except for Kevin, who was climbing aboard the helicopter which was flying a few feet above the roof as it slowly pulled away from the lighthouse. \"Holy shit, the bastard made it!\" Matt shouted in excitment when he noticed Gary sprinting towards them. \"Hurry doctor, we're leaving!\" Amber called from her seat as the chopper pulled away. A dozen zombies appeared behind the doctor as he closed in on his escape. A Siren screamed somewhere below them, which sounded as if it was the battle cry of the damned as they captured one last soul to add to their unholy army. Gary closed his eyes and jumped from the edge of the lighthouse just as a festering hand tried to close around his ankle. A stiff breeze blew through his clothes as his body soared towards his salvation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't enough.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe doctor felt his leg brush against something metal as his body lost altitude and knew this was it. He had come so far... lost so much... and this was the end. He would die upon impact with the ground and the zombies would dispose of his remains. But he was still satisfied. He had lived a good life thus far... and cutting it short to save others was a price he had been willing to pay since the begining. A smile crossed his lips as he opened his eyes to see his friends faces once last time. The sky returned to his vision immediately with the ground below it, yet the helicopter and his friends were nowhere to be found. Only the blue and green of the trees and sky greeted him... then he noticed a tugging sensation in his left arm. \"Jesus Christ, he's heavy! Pull!\" Kevin called as he and Matt tightened their grip on the good doctor. Gary looked up at them as Amber grabbed his other hand and helped pull him up. Gary literaly couldn't believe his good luck. With one final pull he was safely inside the helicopter as it sped away from the doomed city and all it had claimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled Gary's eyes once again as he looked from the forest passing by below to the lighthouse and lake fading into the distance to all of his comrades equaly joyful faces. \"Looks like... you saved me this time...\" Gary said as a now sobbing Amber hugged him as tightly as she was phisically able. \"You crazy son of a bitch... I thought we had lost you...\" The doctor rubbed his sore eyes and grinned like he has just won the lottery. \"I thought the same thing...\" He replied as he patted her on the back. \"You really are something...\" Matt said as he wiped the sweat from his brow. \"Yeah, fuckin' crazy!\" Kevin interjected as he rubbed his eyes. \"I think I'll take a rest now...\" Gary said with a yawn. \"Wake me when we get there...\" And with that the doctor passed out and fell into the most peaceful sleep he'd had in days.</span></div></div>",

Many people were lost to the hordes of undead, but one group rescued by a local doctor had some startling discoveries to share. Beneath a lighthouse near a lake just outside the city limits was a meeting chamber for members of the brotherhood. Found there were strange runes and relics along with personal information on some of the members. Also recovered was a robe worn by a man named Ishmael who was killed in battle by the doctor. He was a very cruel member of the brotherhood with many strange abilities and connections within their organization. Upon death, the survivors claimed he turned to dust and were unable to present investigators with a body. These facts along with statements from a few other survivors imply that the organization and its undead army are supernatural in some way, although hard evidence has yet to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess then two weeks after all survivors were rescued the U.S. military exterminated the last zombie some 20 miles outside the city and peace is slowly, but surely, returning. The government is keeping quiet about what exactly happened or where the Brotherhood is now, yet they assure reporters that there is no long a valid threat. The total death toll is well over 10,000 with several people still unaccounted for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, less then a week after his ordeal Gary got a phone call from police... they had found the body of one Shelly Wilson murdered in cold blood several miles from her house. The funeral was quiet and brief, only close friends and family showed up. It was raining hard that day, yet it couldn't hide the tears of her grieving husband. She was buried in a humble grave under a large oak tree in her home town next to a plot reserved for Gary when he once again joins her. In the end, Gary was able to retire at age 65 and spent the rest of his days fishing, golfing, and enjoying life with his friends. He passed away peacefully in his sleep one cold March morning after returning from a vacation. He was 82 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and her cousins stayed with family for a while after their escape from Bitterwood. After that Amber went to collage and got a degree in fine arts. The children took a while to get over all that had happened, but after years of therapy and treatment they were able to grow into happy, healthy, fully-functional adults. They, along with their older cousin, still talk to and visit the brave men who saved their lives that day from time to time. Likewise, both Matt and Kevin still keep in touch with their new friends. After all that had happened, after countless tears were shed, this small group of survivors managed to get a happy ending out of one of the worst disasters in history. They all made it out of hell and never looked back...</span></div></div>",

During this time many great heros sacrificed their lives to save and protect the innocent. One of which was the doctor Gary Wilson, who defended a mother, her children, and her niece from not only the zombies, but an insane member of the brotherhood. The doctor may have lost his life in the struggle, but his sacrifice allowed his two allies to find and rescue the two children and their cousin, although their mother was too far gone to be saved and was buried in the family tomb in Bitterwood National cemetery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Matt were able to reveal a secret passage in the lighthouse they that had turned into their base that led to a secret underground chamber filled with brotherhood experiments and tools. This, along with the robes and identification of Ishmael, a brotherhood agent, allowed the government to locate several other such locations and put an end to the zombies before they could spread far beyond the city. Both men were awarded medals for their accomplishments and heroism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary's body was buried next to his wife Shelly, who lost her life soon after the undead first appeared. Amber, Timmy, and Clare stayed with Matt until Amber was old enough to take care of them by herself, as they had no other living relatives. When all was said and done life slowly returned to normal and all the remaining survivors managed to live full lives despite the ordeal they had been through.

He then checked his fuel gauge to see how much gas he had left. Enough to get a few miles away from the hospital, but not enough to leave the city. Gary could make one more stop at either his home or his friend Roy's place. He really wanted to get home, but knew there no point as his wife had either escaped or...got caught by the zombies. Gary made a sharp turn around a corner and knocked a beast (a zombiefied dog) into a nearby metal pole, killing it. By the time he got to the appartments where his friend lived the entire front of his car was dyed red and had bits of zombies all over it. Gary parked his car in the parking lot in front of the 2 story building, grabed his gun, and stepped out. There were two zombies upstairs, a level 1 and a level 2, along with another level 1 leaning agenst the wall downstairs. No sooner had Gary stepped onto the sidewalk then the level 2 zombie started to run down the nearby stairs to greet him. His gun had 6 shots and he wanted to save them, but knew he couldn't avoid geting around the level 2. He waited for it to get a little closer and unloaded 2 shots into it, which brought it down for a second, but then it started to get back up. Gary took careful aim and finished it off with one more shot. The other two zombies had noticed him by now and were slowly moving closer. What does Gary do?</span></div></div>",

He tightened his grip on his scalpel and dashed forwards, effortlessly killing the slow moving fiend by driving the makeshift weapon deep into its heart. The zombie's now lifeless corpse began to stumble over, but but Gary managed to grab ahold of it and carry it with him as he ducked behind a row of cars. He sat the body down gently next to a blue Mitsubishi and listened to the sound of the shuffling feet and sad moans that filled the air around him. They didn't stop moving aimlessly about, yet after a few minutes it became apparent that the other zombies hadn't seen him dispatch their shambling brother. It seemed Gary's quick thinking had saved him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort to get the scalpel back out of the the zombie he had stabbed, but it soon came out... broken with the tip still embedded in the flesh of his fallen foe. \"Shit...\" Gary whispered as he quietly tossed the now useless piece of metal away. He was now completely defenseless, one false move would easily seal his demise. In an instant Gary's plan of escape became purely stealth based. He was too exhausted, under-equipped, and just plain old to deal with this many undead at once in direct combat. After deciding that it would be best to move quick to minimalize the chance of being discovered, he began walking down the row of cars he was in and into the next one. By paying attention to the directions the noises came from, he was able to avoid the zombies and get to his car. Just as he was about to enter, however, he caught a glimpse of the entrance to the floor below him. It was empty from what he could see and from there Gary could leave the hospital on foot. \"Driving a car would be fairly impractical with 90% of the streets crowded with wrecked and abandoned vehicles... hmmm... On the other hand there may be countless zombies just out of sight below me...\" The moans picked up again and Gary could tell it was only a matter of time before they found him. He had to make a decision... now.</span></div></div>",

He had drank his last bottle of water over a day ago when he had decided to take refuge in the subway tunnels under the city. It had been five days since it happened, and he still couldn't believe it. The dead were walking. This wasn't a movie or a game or a book, the dead were really walking, and killing. Gary could still remember that day it all started as if it had only happened mere hours ago. He had been driving to work when someone stumbled out in front of his car, a young police officer no older then 25. There was no chance for Gary to react... the car turned the officer into a human frisbee and sent him flying into a fire hydrant. In a panic Gary got out to see if there was anything he could do while some of the people nearby called 911. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer decided not to wait for Gary to come over, however, and grabbed a woman who had gotten a little too close to him. The woman screamed as he belched out a thick red goo onto her and himself as well. By the time rescue workers were there all that was left of the woman was a bloody corroded corpse laying in the street, but that was the least of their worries. By then the Slimer had killed itself with its own dripping acid slime and had dissolved into a new blue slime that had managed to trap a few unlucky people while they attempted to flee. They were easily finished off by the more powerful zombies while they were stuck and helpless. What had been a simple traffic accident soon escalated into a riot. Gary had managed to stay with a large group of people and got away from the growing assault, but as the zombies began appearing in greater number the groups started to disband, it would soon be everyone for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days after the incident on Cherry street Gary's group was down to 4 people. Then 3. Then 2. On the third day Gary's final ally was killed by a Deathtouch while he and Gary were raiding bottles of water from a supermarket. Of course, Gary managed to escape and enter the nearby subway station. Two days of wandering in the darkness aimlessly and getting lost later and here we are. Tired from walking Gary sat down on the cold ground and rested. After an hour of sitting in solitude he got back up and continued onward. Just as he was about to give up hope that he would never see the light of day again... he saw something up ahead. Something BRIGHT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the pace a little and soon found the lights source. He had made it to a subway station that still had its lights on, it wasn't daylight, but it was good enough. After taking a moment to adjust his eyes to the sudden surge of brightness, Gary looked around at his surroundings. Up ahead of him was an overturned subway car and beyond that the tunnel was lit, which meant that the power was still on up ahead. Gary climbed up off of the subway tracks and onto the stations platform in search of a sign that might let him know where he is. After finding a sign next to the ticket window he read the name aloud. \"Marigold Station.\" What luck! Marigold station was just 2 miles from his house, if he could get out of here he could go home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon he was once again breathing fresh air and basking in the warm sun. It was a bittersweet welcome to be back on the surface though, as the landscape before him showed. Cars were driven onto the sidewalk, fires were burning freely, and more then a few corpses lined the empty streets. Gary felt as if he were on another planet, everything was so different then it had been just a few days before. Gary looked around at the wrecked city that stood before him. Had everyone else been killed? Was he the only survivor left? He tried not to think up any answers to those questions. As he walked along he noticed the road up ahead was blocked by a damaged police car. Gary could have easily walked around it, but felt he needed to investigate it. On the front hood he noticed an R in a circle that looked as if it had been spray painted on. It was certainly odd, yet it also gave Gary hope that someone else might still be alive out there. Gary opened the front door only to have a severed head roll out onto the street. He would have screamed had he not been so shocked. Just as he was about to move on he noticed something shining in the back seat. Careful not to disturb any more mangled body parts Gary reached back and grabbed it. What he now held in his hand was a brand new hand gun. After looking it over Gary was sure it wasn't standard police issue, someone must have left it here. Feeling a little more optimistic Gary put the gun into his pocket and continued walking home. After five more minutes had passed he came to the road that lead to his street, he was almost home! Unfortunately, a wrecked semi was laying across the road. What now?</span></div></div>",

At this point he'd be thankful just to have a drink or a weapon, even a small switchblade would make him feel a little better about heading back outside. As he walked over to the booth he heard some flies buzzing and immediately felt sick to his stomach when he noticed a splatter of blood on the interior of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he peered over the counter he came face to face with what had once been a desperate man who was now a near headless corpse. Half of his face had been taken off from a point blank blast of buckshot from a small hunting shotgun sprawled across his lap. The model was fairly old and worn judging by the wear and tear on the stock and the barrel was sawn off to make for a bigger spread. It was no long range weapon, but it would shred anything that got within ten feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Gary tore off a bit of cloth from his undershirt and used it to make a makeshift face mask to protect his nose from the smell as he walked around to the door of the booth on the other side. It was locked from the inside, but that mattered very little when the window was completely shattered. After reaching in and springing the door open Gary found himself standing over the mangled corpse of what had once been another survivor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy wasn't dressed like a first responder or soldier, just some random person in a jacket and jeans who had found some gear before getting cornered or losing the will to live. On a shelf next to him was a small box of shells for the gun, mostly empty but with a few left inside along with a roll of dollar bills, which were now worthless. Aside from the cash the guy also had a small canteen with maybe an once or two of water left in it and some personal items like a wallet and keychain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for the gun and the drink friend.\" Gary whispered sadly as he popped the lid off the canteen and downed the liquid inside, which turned out to be fruit punch... not water like Gary had hoped. Oh well, it should keep him hydrated at least, though the fruity aftertaste would be a bit annoying. After loading the shotgun Gary took a quick stock of his remaining shells as he put them into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn total he had six more shots after he expended the one he had already loaded into the chamber. The shotgun was a single-shot model, but that would help conserve ammo at least. Gary would just have to be smart about when to pull the trigger and pick his fights carefully. At any rate, he was feeling much better now and could finally head back above ground to see what the damage was. With a deep breath he walked out of the ticket booth and began ascending the stairs that would bring him back up to street level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things had gone from bad to worse while he was gone... very worse. The streets were littered with blood and gore that was splattered across abandoned cars and vans and several dead bodies were twitching and crawling about. Some were just torsos with gnawed limbs, others were little more than mangled heads rendered immobile after losing their arms and body and a few... were still up and walking around with large chunks torn out of their flesh. It was pure hell on earth, the stuff of nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merciful god...\" Gary mumbled as he began walking out of the subway station and down the street. As he was about to round the corner a group of people with glowing red eyes stumbled out from behind an overturned semi truck and began closing in on him. There were less than half a dozen of them blocking his way but there was no way around them, if Gary wanted to continue forwards he'd have to either fight them or find another way past them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?</span></div></div>",

Say, what's your name?\" Gary asked. \"Shannon Hawking.\" She replied. \"Good name, I'm Gary.\" He said. Shannon looked through the window and fired at some zombies with her sniper rifle. Gary found a pistol and used it against the zombies at the second floor of the shooting range. Firing and reloading. Suddenly, out of nowhere...a slimer reached the floor Gary was in. Drawing out his shotgun, he fired at the slimer. It fell down and Gary let out a sigh. By the time it was midnight Gary and Shannon had defeated all of the horrible beasts. Gary, still feeling hungry, took a bite out of a plastic wraped sandwich that was left in the shooting range. </span></div></div>",

The fact that it was a cool September afternoon did nothing to lessen the impact of what the doctor saw outside. Underneath the sunlight flowing in from the broken windows overhead were the bodies of those who were unable to escape the horde of undead, along with more blood then Gary had ever seen on any operating table. \"H-how is it... out there...?\" Shelly asked, afraid of what the answer might be. \"Its not pretty, but I don't see anything moving other then the fountain outside. Hell, maybe this whole thing is over...\" He replied as he walked back over to his wife. \"You really think we can make it...?\" Shelly asked as she scooted over a little to offer him room on the couch. \"Yeah, it'll be dangerous even if most of those things are dead, but if we're careful I know we'll find help. We might have to go to the next state, but we'll find help.\" He said as cheerfully as he could while giving Shelly a weak smile. \"Alright, dear.\" She said as she smiled back. \"If you think we should leave, I'll trust you.\" She gave him a kiss and they both prepared to venture into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll carry the duffle bag with our remaining supplies, you just worry about staying out of danger.\" Gary called as he packed wrapped up sandwiches into the bag and grabbed his bat. \"Um, Gary... I'll need a weapon, won't I?\" Shelly asked as she met him at the entrance of the store. \"Yeah, I'm afraid so, hopefully you won't have to use it...\" Gary replied as he handed her a golf club that was laying nearby. \"Just promise me you will if you have to.\" He finished as he handed her the club. \"I promise.\" She said regretfully as she nervously wrapped her fingers around the cold metal weapon. \"Now...\" Gary said as he looked over the wrecked mall. \"All we need to do is find a safe way out of this mall and then get the hell out of Bitterwood. Do you remember where we parked our car...?\" Shelly nodded. \"You've taken me shopping here plenty of times for me to remember where everything is. You could've parked our car on the roof and I would have remembered where it was.\" She replied as he got her first real look at the mall. \"Even... even with all thats happened in the last few days...\" Gary nodded and they began walking. \"Its good you remember, cause with all the insanity of the last few days I'm surprised that I can still remember I'm a doctor.\" Gary joked to lighten the mood a bit. \"Now, if we're on the third floor whats the quickest way down to where we parked?\" Shelly thought for a moment and then replied...</span></div></div>",

Gary nodded and began walking towards the elevators arcoss the nearby walkway. \"Careful honey, the glass railing is broken. Don't get too close to the edge.\" Gary cautioned as he looked over the side at the bottom floor. It was alot cleaner, but there were a few zombies shambling about near the barricaded entrance. \"Oh damn...\" Gary whispered as he and Shelly approached the elevator. \"Is everything okay honey? I heard you mumble something when we were crossing the walkway.\" Shelly asked as Gary readied his bat for the upcoming fight. \"I'm sorry honey, but I saw a few of them moving down there... I want you to stay here while I clear them out.\" Shelly's eyes widened with surprise and fear. But... but honey w-\" Shelly began as the doors opened to reveal the walking remains of an old man with half his face torn off. Her voice went silent the moment she saw him and her blood ran cold. She tried to scream, to move, but her limbs refused to work. Had her husband not been faster with his bat she would have lost a good portion of her own face. The sound of wood colliding with rotten flesh sounded throughout the mall as the mans head twisted around with a cracking sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis now limp body fell to the floor where Gary finished him with one more swift whack. Shelly took a step back and collapsed to the ground with tears in her eyes. \"My... my god...\" She moaned as she dropped her golf club and buried her face in her hands. Gary was quick to walk over and put a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm sorry to have to leave you here, but its not safe with so many of them down there... At least if they kill me you'll be able to make it back to the store.\" She looked up at him with fear and sadness in her eyes as if she was begging him not to go. \"Honey... honey PLEASE...\" She began as she struggled to regain her composure. \"Don't... don't do this...\" Gary merely lowered his head and handed her her golf club. \"I wish I didn't have to... but I can't stand the thought of them getting ahold of you. Please promise me you'll use this if another one attacks you... or, better yet, run back to the store where you'll be safe... please.\" He now had fresh tears in his eyes and was clutching his bat as tightly as he could. \"Be safe... even if I die... Promise me...! Promise you'll stay safe no matter what...\" Shelly gave him a hurt look as if he had just asked her to jump out of an airplane. She wiped the remaining tears from her eyes as fresh ones began to form and hugged her husband. \"I... I promise. Please don't leave me Gary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their all too breif hug Gary stood up and walked into the elevator. \"Don't worry. I won't.\" He said with a hopeful smile on his face. He took one last look at his wife, blew her a kiss, and hit the button that would take him to the zombies waiting for him below. As soon as the doors opened two things happened at once. A man with a missing eye grabbed him by the throat and Shelly screamed as loud as she was able as something menaced her from upstairs. \"So you finally decided to come down eh? You fat bastard.\" The man taunted as he lifted Gary out of the elevator and slammed him onto the floor, causing him to lose his grip on his bat. \"Shelly! NO! What... the fuck are you doing?!\" Gary shouted as he tried to free himself from the mans death grip. \"Master will deal with your wife, but he let me ambush you down here. You actually thought we'd let you walk out the front door?\" The one-eyed man said with a demented grin on his face. \"Master?! We...?! Are you in league with the zombies or something?!\" Gary screamed as he tried in vain to break free. Alas, the other man was far stronger. \"In league with them?\" The man said with a soft chuckle as Shelly let out another scream along with the sound of a golf club striking something hard. \"No, you fool. I AM one of them! I'm a soldier in the master's army.\" The Mimic said as his grin widened. \"And now I'm going to KILL you, human!\" All of a sudden the monsters grip tightened as he tried to strangle the doctor. Gary will need to act quickly... or die!</span></div></div>",

Except your fate and expire with a little dignity.\" The Mimic laughed as the doctor wheezed and gasped. Then, without warning Gary put every last ounce of his strangth into shoving the monster aside. The larger man trembled a bit, but remained firmly in place. \"You little shit... give up!\" It growled as it overpowered Gary and kept him pinned. Things began to grow dark and Gary knew he was going to die. \"No... Shelly...\" He thought as tears formed in his eyes. \"I was an idiot... I'm sorry.\" Gary closed his eyes and prepared himself for death when something renewed his fighting spirit. Shelly screamed one final time as something wet splashed onto a nearby wall. \"NO! SHELLY!\" Gary roared in a rage, realizing his wife was still bravely fighting for survival while he was willing to give in and accept his fate. He had never before felt like such a coward. \"DAMMIT, GET THE HELL OFF ME YOU BASTARD!!!\" He yelled as he broke the Mimic's hold on his neck and began pushing him back. \"Its no use... you'll die here... your wife... is... as good as dead...!\" The Mimic responed as it tried to retain its failing grip on the once helpless doctor. \"Shut up...and DIE!\" Gary yelled as he shoved the man off of him and into an approaching level one zombie, causing the both of them to topple over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary quickly took a deep breath and got to his feet as his opponet slowly returned to his. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Gary sneered as he rushed over, grabbed the elite zombie by his own throat, and slammed him head first into a nearby pillar right under a  20% discount poster. The back of the mans skull immediately caved in as his remaining eye was knocked out of its socket. Wasting no time Gary let go of the mangled corpse and stomped its head into paste when it dropped to the floor. \"How do you like it? You piece of shit...\" Gary groaned as he rubbed his throat and walked over to reclaim his bat. It had been almost a full miunte since Shelly's last scream and there were no longer the sounds of a struggle upstairs. \"Shit... I've got to get to Shelly... I just hope to god she's okay...\" Gary said as he panted. \"Not so fucking fast... You're still... my prey...\" A voice gurgled as it choked up blood. \"No... Dear god, no...!\" Gary exclaimed, stupified. He slowly turned around to see the most horrifying sight of his life. The now headless zombie was slowly advancing on Gary while its friends began to close in as well. In a minute Gary would be surrounded by a small mob of zombies which he may or may not even be able to kill. \"You're still alive... what the hell are you?!\" Gary shouted as he backed towards the elevator. \"I told you... I'm a soldier in the holy army that will put an end to this world... and you'll have the honor of being my FIFTH victim...\" Gary was shocked and revolted... how could this thing still be moving... let alone talking?!

You can't escape... you'll just die a little closer to the door...\" The Mimic said as it grined wickedly. \"I wasn't trying to get to the door...\" Gary replied in a raspy voice as he reached out to grab the bat off to his side. \"No! The bat!\" The Mimic sreamed as it realized its mistake too late. With all his remaining strangth Gary slammed the bat into the side of the mans head. A sickening crack was then heard as his head spun back on a broken neck. \"You lose.\" Gary said as he sat up, only to be plunged back to the floor in an instant. \"WHAT?!\" He yelled, shocked that the thing could still move. \"But...

Still rather dazed by all that has happened and the fact that his second wife is now one of the walking dead population, numb and so scared that he can barely feel anything around him, he stumbles in the direction of the house that was once a loving home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intersections and the suburban roads are desolate and eerily quiet as he weaves his way through the center of town. Not wanting to be faced with any stumbling corpses, he was still ready for one to block his path... at least one. But he didn't see any living or not living being anywhere in sight. Leaves and trash littered the streets, abandoned cars with their doors still wide open from apparent previous escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery corner he was faced to turn he expected the worst, but he was just forced to endure nothing but deathly silence. Amazingly nothing looked that disturbed. Store windows were intact, there was not any blood smears on walls or cars. It was as though the population just up and disappeared, not that they had probably been eaten by non feeling, non living creatures. It just added to the dream state Gary had felt he'd been existing in the past five days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he'd started to hear the reports of the unknown infection on the news that first morning while on call at the hospital he'd called home to Shelly to see if she had seen anything strange around their neighborhood. She'd told him that everything seemed fine, she wasn't worried and told him that he shouldn't either. But she had not been one to get too over worked over anything she had heard on the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong willed woman, she'd always been the one to calm him when he was upset. His quick temperament would get him into trouble periodically, especially with people that did not want to listen to reality. He wasn't one to live in a false, rose colored, environment. So his nerves had not been on edge too badly when he rang his wife that afternoon, but he did feel a bit of concern and wanted to quell that by at least hearing Shelly's soothing voice. She had told him that Bree had come by and they had talked about the garden club, sipping lemon aid and gossiping a bit. Told him that the van they owned was leaking a bit of fuel and that would probably have to be looked at when he got home or over the weekend when he had time, but other than that everything was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind at ease he'd told her he loved her, like he would always end an exchange with her, and went about the rest of his morning checks at the hospital. But as the evening came and dinner would soon be on it's way things had gotten so very worse. Patients were coming in with gaping wounds, huge chunks of flesh that had been bitten out by other people. Being a rational person Gary just couldn't imagine that a mysterious case of biters were on the loose all of a sudden. The more he talked to patients and the people that brought them in and followed their account of events that lead them to the hospital he became more fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been scheduled to get off of work at seven in the evening and he only had thirty minutes left on his shift when he decided to call Shelly again. He punched in the number to his home phone while he stressfully leaned against the nurses station, tapping his finger tips on the counter and counting off the rings 1..2..3...7...9. That's when he really started to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that his wife should very well be home now, he called regularly right before leaving to see if he could pick up something from the store on his way home. So for her not to answer at least by the third for fourth ring wasn't in her nature. That's when he was grabbed from behind by a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, Doctor! I'm so glad I found you. We've been looking for you for the last then minutes, it's your wife... she's been brought into operating room seven-two and, well, you have to come, you just have to!\" nurse Tina said hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he got closer, he realized it was one of the SUV's that the local park rangers often used.  The SUV was smeared with dirt and blood.  Frank approached the vehicle cautiously, his bat at the ready.  He pulled the drivers side door open and was relieved to find the vehicle was empty.  Throwing his bat aside, Frank climbed into the drivers seat.  The SUV had a radio built into the dash.  Looking at the gauges, he found the gas tank was full.  \"I'll need this to get out of town.\" Frank said to himself as he searched through the vehicle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked in the back seat and found a large duffel bag in the back seat.  He opened it to find it was full of various guns and ammunition.  \"Look's like Christmas came early.\" Frank said, chuckling to himself.  He pulled out and AKMS assault rifle and loaded a magazine into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imfdb.org/images/d/d0/AKMS.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imfdb.org/images/d/d0/AKMS.jp...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then found the keys to the SUV in the glove box.

He looked down at the tracks that faded off in the distance behind an endless sea of trees. Frank had been one of the few survivors who had the idea of heading to the secluded Bitterwood train station. All in all, it was a pretty good idea, and he would have gotten away... if only he had arrived a bit sooner. Five days ago he had run screaming up to the very same platform he stood upon now, just in time to see the very last train pull away as soon as he got there. By the time he had made it outside to signal it the train was already too far away to notice him. Worried, but certain that they would return later for more survivors he had stayed at the station. He had plenty of supplies thanks to the gift store and snack bar, a nice clean restroom, and due to the station being located far out in the countryside that surrounded the city, a relatively safe place to stay. Zombies had walked by every now and then, but none bothered trying to get inside. Even if they did, Frank had barricaded the doors and a few of the windows, so he could have probably handled them anyway. He had even found a reliable weapon in the gift shop: A shovel left behind by someone who had boarded the escape train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank waited patiently for his first day here and didn't grow worried when the train didn't show up on the next day... when it didn't show up on day three, four, or five he soon began considering heading out on his own. He sat down on the edge of the platform and looked out over the woods before him. It was beautiful in the morning sun of his fifth day here and provided him with a small bit of comfort. \"Looks like... its finally time to head out...\" Frank said as he went back inside and picked up his shovel, stuffed some snacks into his backpack, and walked past the covered up corpse of the only zombie that had managed to break inside. It was an old woman who had been part of a group that had passed by. She was the only one to noticed Frank and he dealt with her quite easily, but he took note that the group she had been with was larger then the ones before. He knew if he stayed here it would only be a matter of time before a big group found him... and then he would be in trouble. Frank jumped down onto the train tracks and began following them west as the bright morning sunlight blanketed the city in a brand new day. He took one last look at his home for the past five days and disappeared behind a corner into the trees. He walked for 25 minutes before coming to a road that crossed the tracks. To his left about 40 yards up the road was an abandoned mini-van...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank decided it was best not to get sidetracked and kept moving along the tracks without checking the van. Even if there was something useful inside it he already had plenty of supplies and a decent weapon. Right now the most important thing Frank could do was put as much distance between himself and the city as possible. It was unlikely that there would be many zombies out this far anyway, and the probability of running into one of them would surely decrease as he got further away. \"I bet they have some sort of safe zone just a few more miles up ahead. I'll get there without even seeing another zombie.\" Frank said confidently to himself, keeping his eyes peeled on the surrounding trees for signs of movement. \"Still, it can't hurt to be careful...\" The wilderness was beautiful, but Frank knew all too well how dangerous the forests around Bitterwood could get. Bears, wolves, and other vicious animals made their home amongst the trees. Now they could all be undead as well, which only contributed to their intimidation factor. The thought of a red eyed wolf shambling out of the trees crossed Frank's mind. \"Jesus, I just hope I find something soon... all this walking in silence is maddening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lonesome journey continued for another half an hour before he stopped for a second time. Up ahead was a large steel bridge that crossed Limestone Creek below. It was roughly 25 yards long and very narrow. Frank got off the tracks and sat down on a rock overlooking the shimmering water below. He couldn't see any zombie fish, but that didn't surprise him. It was at least a 50 foot drop from the bridge above and filled with quite a few sharp rocks. Frank opened his backpack and pulled out a bag of trail mix to eat while he took a rest. \"Guess I'll have to cross that bridge if I want to keep going this way...\" He said as took a sip from one of his 5 water bottles. Once he was done with his snack he stuffed the empty bag and bottle back into his backpack. \"Time to get this over with...\" He grabbed ahold of the railing and tried to avoid looking down. \"Focus on moving... keep moving...\" Frank thought to himself as he looked ahead to make sure a train wasn't coming. It was an immense relief when his feet finally touched solid ground on the other side. \"Well, that ordeal is over... now I just need to keep m-\" He was suddenly cut off by a loud growl that seemed to come from all directions at once. It didn't sound vicious or even angry... just otherworldly... like it didn't belong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank tightened his grip on his shovel and took a quick look around. The only visible movement came from the wind blowing softly through the trees and weeds. As soon as the growl ended the whole world seemed to return to a dead calm. No noise. No movement. No malice could be detected. It was without a doubt the most unnerving thing Frank had experienced yet. Hell, he questioned whether he had even heard anything or not as he slowly moved along. All was silent except for the crunch of his shoes as he walked. Up ahead Frank could see a dirt trail that led up a hill deeper into the woods. It might be safer then walking out in the open on the train tracks... or it might lead him straight into the jaws of some hellish animal. Suddenly, without warning, a second growl echoed throughout the forest... this time a little closer... and angrier...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank picked up his pace a little as he continued forward down the tracks. Being out in the woods alone with god knows how many otherworldly creatures was slowly starting to get to his nerves and he hoped he'd run into someone soon. A shelter, a rescue party, even another lone survivor... anything but another hour of hiking alone in silence. Unfortunately for Frank, he would soon get his wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly twenty more minutes of walking he caught sight of something on the tracks up ahead. It was too far to make out in the distance but as he kept moving closer the true horror of the situation slowly began to dawn on him. Within minutes it became perfectly clear what the obstruction was: a wrecked series of train cars that had been severed from the rest in some kind of accident. Passenger cars, to be specific, which explained the wandering zombies that slowly began to shamble into view from behind the trees and wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh fuck...\" Frank whispered in horror as the walking corpses noticed him and began their slow approach. They were all slow and gruesomely mangled, but there seemed to be at least a dozen of them with even more popping out with every passing minute. Frank slowed his approach and smacked a skinny teenage girl to the ground as she tried to lunge at him, which caused a spray of teeth and rotten flesh to splatter the creature behind her. She let out one final grunt as Frank smashed in her ruined head and then took a quick jab at the zombie behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was an older man who looked to be in his early thirties and had lost half of his body and left arm, another easy opponent. Frank's blow snapped his twisted spine like a dry twig and caused him to collapse in a heap as his remaining arm flailed about weakly. He was quickly finished off with a few good whacks to the head and soon fell motionless as his comrades drew ever closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank backed up a few steps as he looked over the approaching wave of undead ghouls and realized this was a pointless fight. Even if he killed another ten the stragglers would likely just close off his escape and pin him. \"Shit, guess I'll have to come up with something else.\" he muttered as he knocked an obese woman into one of her companions. Just then, another chilling growl came from nearby, whatever it belonged to was getting closer as well. \"Well, doesn't this just fucking suck...\" he groaned as he turned around to gaze at the tracks behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank better think of something to do quickly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In his panicked state he jumped off the tracks and began making his way up the trail. He stumbled a bit at first as he tried to keep his footing on the weed and branch choked path. At one point he stumbled to the ground and smacked his shoulder on a rock, only to immediately pick himself up and continue on as he cursed under his breath. In all his haste he didn't even notice the wooden sign off to the side of the trail, the one with a large \"R\" in a circle spray painted on it... After 10 minutes of relentless running Frank finally slowed to a walk and began looking around at his surroundings. The path twisted and turned up ahead through the trees and bushes. It was also shady and cool with a gentle breeze blowing and the soothing sound of Limestone creek could be heard in the distance. Best of all there were no longer any signs of a third growl happening, it seemed Frank was safe for the time being. \"Thank god... I must have lost it...\" He said as he continued up the trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before a large wood billboard of some sort caught Frank's attention up ahead. \"That trail must have taken me into the nature preserve...\" Frank noted as he checked it out. There was a map of the preserve plastered on it with a plastic container filled with smaller copies right below it. This was useful, but the real prize was hidden deep within the attached wooden box on the side. Intrigued by the \"R\" symbol carved on the front Frank opened it to find a knife, two bottles of beer stuffed with rags, a lighter, and about a dozen pamphlets with details about the park written on them. \"Well now, what do we have here...\" Frank said cheerfully as he reached in and grabbed the supplies. \"This knife is in excellent condition, guess now I don't have to carry around this shovel anymore...\" With that he stuffed the molotov cocktails in his backpack and laid his shovel against the side of the billboard. The last thing he did was grab a map and he set out with his brand new knife. It didn't take long for it to be put to use either. The billboard wasn't even out of sight when a large badger crawled out of the weeds. It was heavily decayed and missing one of its eyes, just the sight of such a mangled creature almost made Frank puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beast tried charging him with the few fangs it had left bared and ready to bite a chunk out of his flesh. Fortunately, Frank was able to avoid its initial attack and plunge his new weapon deep into the monsters rotten skull. A sound like crushing a pumpkin was heard and the badger collapsed to the ground. Frank took a moment to catch his breath and looked down at the glimmering blood-soaked blade. It was beautiful in the tiny bit of sunlight shining through the leaves. \"I think I'm gonna like this knife...\" Frank said as he wiped the blade clean and moved on, eager to dispatch more of the undead. Soon he came to a divide in the path with a sign in between the split, It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;----- Moonlight Hill<br>\r\nPark Ranger Station -----&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow that was a bloody handprint with more words written crudely beneath it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can all go to hell. Stay the fuck out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked up each path. To the left he could see a tall hill in the distance past the trees. To the right he was sure he could make out some type of building. Which way seems better?</span></div></div>",

There were few branches and the only weeds were off the side, the view was pretty nice too. By now the sun had climbed higher in the sky and was casting its warming rays all over the cool forest. Frank looked out over the preserve as he climbed higher up the hill, admiring its beauty to keep his mind off the horrors lurking within it. Off in the distance past all the flowers and plants he could see the city, in all its remaining glory. Amazingly, it looked the same as it always had. If Frank had just arrived here from out of town he'd think there was nothing wrong, well, until he got a little closer. \"Its incredible how much Bitterwood has changed over the past few days... and still, it looks exactly like it always has from this distance...\" He took one of his water bottles out of his backpack and took a sip as he marched along. It didn't take long to reach the campsite at the top, although it hardly looked like one anymore. The few tents were either torn down or sprayed with blood, the grills and benches were broken or in some cases, totally destroyed with pieces strung about the area, and the ground was covered in litter. To top it all off, there were corpses and a few body parts laying about, some on the ground, a few on the tables, and one that was hanging off the roof of the nearby restroom. It was uncertain when was the last time living people had stayed here, but it appeared as if days had pasted without anyone passing through, alive or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly took the right path back there...\" Frank said sarcastically as he walked by the grisly scene and took a seat on one of the undamaged benches. \"At least there were no zombies here.\" He thought as he pulled out a bag of chips and had a snack. When he was done he threw the bag into an overturned garbage can and decided to explore a bit. He doubted that there was anything useful in the restroom so he started with the tents. Only three were still standing, but that didn't stop Frank from looking over the collapsed ones as well. Along with countless beer cans and various other litter he came across a working flashlight, an undamaged sleeping bag, and a handgun. The gun only had 2 bullets left in it, but it was better then another melee weapon. After frank had checked the tents he moved on to the small cabin a litter higher up the hill overlooking the campsite. It wasn't fancy, yet had a strange charm to it. Of course, anything would look inviting to someone who spent the last five days sleeping on the floor of a train station. Frank walked up to it and...</span></div></div>",

The partially closed curtains shrouded the room in darkness, but he could make out some faint movement in the far corner. \"Hello, can you hear me in there?\" Frank called as he tapped the window lightly with the butt of his gun. The creature inside stirred and moaned as it struggled to get up. \"Are you hurt, do you need help?!\" Frank called worriedly as he began looking for his flashlight. \"Hang on, as soon as I find my flashlight I'll come in there and get you out of h-\" A bright glimpse of red light caught Frank's attention inside. The woman who had been confined there finally noticed the living human standing just outside the window. Her lips curled into a wicked smile and she let out a soft growl. \"Oh, oh no...\" Frank gasped as she lifted her head and stared at him with her burning crimson eyes. Frank's hand touched plastic on the inside of his backpack and he quickly flipped the switch to turn his flashlight on. With a deep breath Frank shone the light inside and illuminated the form of the thing looking at him. She had once been a young woman, pretty and polite, who had never left her friends side. She was also the apple of her parents eye and always got good grades in school. The week before she had planned on going on a camping trip with her friends to celebrate their high school graduation. The party had been fun and her first time was something she knew she'd remember forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, forever turned out to be a cool September night that was interrupted by the sounds of the damned returning to the earth. The last thing she had seen was her best friend getting ripped apart right in front of her while they desended upon the helpless campers. That was five nights ago. Frank had been the first person to find them, and now more then ever, he wished he hadn't. \"Jesus Christ!\" Frank yelled as he stumbled backwards onto the ground and accidentally fired a shot through the window. The woman, or rather, the zombie inside was no longer as pretty as she had once been. All that was left of the poor girl was a torso, one mangled arm, and an immense desire to kill. \"Shit! SHIT!\" Frank cursed as he backed away from the cabin and climbed to his feet. The only sounds that tainted the air were Frank's heavy breathing and the scratching of the zombie moving inside the cabin...</span></div></div>",

What he had seen inside the cabin scared and disgusted him... but he knew he couldn't just leave the poor girl like that. \"Goddamn it...\" He said with a sigh as he walked back up to the door. He could hear the creature moving around inside, although he couldn't be sure exactly where it was. He took a deep breath and checked the chamber of his gun. He knew there was only one bullet left, that he would have only one shot at this, yet the actual sight of it prevented him from becoming careless. With his flashlight in one hand and his gun in the other there would be no time to draw his knife... this was it. Frank turned the knob slowly while listening carefully for sound on the inside. Dead silence. It knew he was coming in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked slightly as it swung open and shone a ray of light upon the gloomy inside. The girl was nowhere to be seen. \"Fuck...\" Frank cursed as he moved the flashlight about to check every nook and cranny for life. Decade old paintings of fields and trees were illuminated on the dustly walls along with several antique-looking pieces of furniture. It was cozy and at the same time deeply unsettling. Frank took a few causious steps and let the door close quietly behind him. In front of him was a door leading to what seemed to be the kitchen. Right next to the door was a set of stairs and a hallway leading to a room on the other side of the cabin. Three ways to go and no way of knowing if one would lead him into a trap. Figuring that the kitchen was as good a place to start as any Frank walked into the small room, ready to fire at anything that no longer looked human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only things to be found were what anyone could expect to find in your average kitchen. A table with a tattered red and white checkered cloth covering it, an old green refridgerator, and a sink on the counter with a blood soaked sponge lying next to it. Frank walked over to investigate, only to stop dead in his tracks upon hearing a board creak in the next room over. Then a thought crossed his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if there were more then one of them in here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank spun around to the door leading to the back room of the cabin and grabbed ahold of the aged bronze handle. He tried to turn it but it wouldn't budge. There was something blocking off the back room from this direction... he would have to go around through the hallway. \"Shit... this kitchen was a dead end...\" Frank groaned as he quickly stepped back into the living room. He had two ways he could search... the room at the end of the hallway... or the upstairs. One of these two places had something waiting for him... and he was determined to find it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank sat alone behind the counter of a small gun store located deep inside the Bitterwood city mall, perhaps the only safe place left in the entire city. Frank had first found out about the recent zombie outbreak many days ago when the zombified remains of a group of girl scouts broke into his appartment building. Shortly after they appeared the whole building and everyone in it except Frank were either dead or a zombie. Frank had managed an escape by nothing less then a miracle. He remembered shooting at least 2 people with his brothers revolver during his escape, the rest was mostly a giant horrible blur. Frank was shaking, he had killed two people, zombified or not, he had taken two human lives. He checked the revolver to see how much ammo was left, 3 bullets. For a brief moment Frank contemplated suicide, but what would that solve? It wouldn't bring those people back. It would simply add another body to the growing count, and Frank had witnessed enough death to last him a lifetime. He sat up, wiped the fresh tears from his eyes and placed the revolver back in the gun holster on his belt. He knew he wouldn't last long barricated in a gun store without any food or water so he worked up his courage and decided to leave. He had been isolated in here for 5 days with the only exit covered by boxes, for all he knew all this could be over, maybe the army was rescuing survivors at this very minute. Frank walked over to the door and took down the boxes while trying to keep calm. If there were zombies out there, he would have only his revolver with 3 shots to defend himself with. The gunstore had been cleaned out when he had arrived and only provided shelter along with a few bags of chips and some water bottles he had found stashed in the back in a safe that had been forced open. Frank removed the last box and opened the door slowly. The entire mall was quiet with the only sound coming from the chilling breeze blowing outside. Everything in sight was cast in shadow and disorder, but thankfully there were no zombies in sight. Frank creeped slowly away from the door and started walking towards the fountain in the middle of the vast room. Moonlight shining down from the large windows overhead provided enough light to see which made navigating somewhat easier even though it made Frank feel like he was in some kind of horror movie. After passing an overturned bench while making his way to the fountain Frank saw a directory sitting in the darkness over to his right. It was somewhat hard to read, but there was just enough light for Frank to see all the major nearby locations marked. Nearby stores included a sporting goods store (that may have things Frank could use as weapons or armor), an electronics store (which may have some flashlights somewhere inside), and the food court (hopefully still with food). Where should Frank go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a few minutes since Frank had decided to go check out the nearby sporting goods store and by now the quietness was starting to get to him. He started to hum a soft tune to himself as he walked down the (hopefully) empty hallway. The eerie silence was the last of his worries though as the area in front of him seemed to get more messy, damaged, and...bloody with each step he took. Frank began fingering his weapon as he hurried along. He decided to hum a bit louder, careful to keep his voice somewhat low in case any of those things were nearby, but quickly stopped right before he got to the store when he noticed something written on the glass window of a nearby jewelry store:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was written in blood and the end of \"me\" was smeared down along the glass all the way to the bottom. It must have also been at least a few days old as the blood was dried and starting to peel. Frank took in this disturbing scene slowly and it was a few seconds before he managed to speak again. \"Jesus...\" He was deeply unerved now and a bit frightened too. This little sign wasn't fresh and it was entirely possible that whatever had occured here had happened long enough ago that there was no remaining danger...still, it was unsettling to find. Frank pulled his gun out of its holster and pointed it ahead aimlessly as he slowly walked on. Finally, he had made it to the front of \"Bret and Chad's sports emporium.\" The outside looked nice enough with the windows intact, the interrior mostly undamaged, and not a drop of blood to be seen. \"Guess I'll head on in.\" Frank said with as much bravery as he could muster. The inside was quite plesant, in fact it was even better looking then the outside. There were rows upon rows of basketballs, footballs, baseballs, soccerballs, and even a few balls for less popular sports such as rugby and polo. The shelves were all lined with hockey sticks, baseball bats, and several other types of fine sports equipment. Towards the the back of the store were T-shirts for sports teams Frank had never even heard of along with things like pads and hockey masks that could give Frank some protection if he needed it. After seeing all of this Frank started to feel a little more safe and was able to regain some of his confidence. He then began to wonder what he should look at first. This place was fairly large compared to most of the other nearby stores and he didn't want to waste too much time here. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank already had a weapon and could worry about getting supplies later, right now he wanted to get some protection so he wouldn't be helpless if one of these things jumped him. He walked to the back and began looking at the different types of padding the store had. He managed to find pads to cover his shoulders, torso, elbows, and knees, a football helmet for his head, and even put on a sports cup (he wasn't willing to leave anything vulnerable if he could help it). After making sure everything was on right he walked over to a mirror to see how bad he looked. \"Well, it makes me look like an idiotic sports mascot, but at least it'll help keep me in one piece.\" He walked back towards the front when something crashed through the window and knocked him to the ground. It was an animalistic Stalker who had found a live human, possibly the last one in the whole city. Frank's gun had been knocked out of his hand and sent flying across the store when the thing jumped him, it would be of no help now. Frank sat up on the floor as the Stalker made a second attempt to kill him with its razor-sharp claws. He had no time to react and took the blow full-force as the zombie ripped off his shoulder pad and knocked him into a nearby shelf. Frank felt dizzy from the blow and couldn't stand up right away. The Stalker growled as it raised its hand again for the final strike. Frank quickly grabbed something from the shelf he was backed up against and swung it at the Stalker just as it went for the kill. The aluminum baseball bat Frank had managed to grab caught the zombie on the side of the neck just as its outstretched hand made contact with Frank's other shoulder. The creature had managed to tear off Frank's other shoulder pad, but other than that he was okay. He stood up as the Stalker laid twitching on the floor and finished it off with one last blow to the head. \"I'm sorry...\" Frank said as he walked over to an open box laying on the ground behind the front counter. Inside were a few posters, a duffel bag, and a note. Frank slung the duffel bag over his now bare shoulder and picked up the note. \"Dear... Anyone.\" He read aloud. \"If you are reading this get out of the mall, these goddamn monsters have overrun security and are growing in number. I don't know why they haven't just surrounded us and killed us yet, we're mostly unarmed and a few of us are injured. They must be planning something. We'll try to get out tomorrow night when Sam gets back. If this note is still in the sporting goods store where I left it our holdout location should be north-west up the escalator. The door next to the nearby toy store has a red circle on it, thats where we are. On the way there's a Re-supply trash can hidden behind the escalator. Inside are 2 handguns, a box of snack food, and a few pictures of... my daughter, Marie. If you see her, please bring her to us. We were seperated earlier and I can't leave without her. I've looked for her everywhere, I haven't found her yet, but... I KNOW she's still out there, she's smart, she wouldn't have died. I know you'll want to get out of here as soon as possible, but I beg of you, if you see my little girl please bring her back to me. I'll be waiting. - Mark\" Frank silently put the note in his pocket and walked back outside. </span></div></div>",

The lights inside were all off except for one dying light flickering on and off in the back. \"I best be quick or that light might go out while I'm inside.\" Frank said as he walked into the store. It was hard to see anything, but Frank could make out most of the objects as he moved past the shelves quickly yet quietly. He soon came upon a stand with all types of batteries lined up on it in neat little rows. Frank took as many as he could fit in his pockets and made sure to take as many different types as possible to make sure he would have what he needed when and if he found a flashlight. Soon after Frank had finished collecting batteries he came upon some small hand radios sitting on a shelf. He picked one up and tried turning it on to see if he could find out anything about the zombies that had appeared only five days ago. All the radio seemed to pick up was static so Frank shut it off, but decided to take it with him just in case. He continued his search and found himself at the back wall in no time. If he didn't find a flashlight here he would have to leave. Fortunately he came across a row of flashlights about halfway through the shelf. He took 2 of them (a large handheld flashlight and a smaller one that barely fit into his battery-stuffed pocket) and started walking back towards the entrance with his new flashlight in his right hand and his gun in his left. Frank was about to walk back outside when he saw something move near a bench. It stayed low to the ground and seemed to walk on all four of its legs.

He couldn't have been more right. The Stalker had apparently seen him after all, and it decided to strike first. Frank felt a horrible surge of pain as a razor-sharp clawed hand forced its way violently through his torso. He tried to scream, but could only make gurgling noises as his blood drained out. The Stalker finished him off by ripping out his heart and shredding it in its hand. After licking most of the blood off its arm it took one last look at Frank's mangled body and moved on in search of more prey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instinctively, Frank shone the light on the strange creature and soon realized he had made a terrible mistake. The thing looked vaguely human, but couldn't have possibly been more inhuman. It had long claws, sharp teeth, and worst of all, glowing demonic red eyes. Frank screamed and fired off a shot with his gun as the thing began sprinting towards him. The bullet connected with its shoulder and caused it to stumble, but it just shrugged it off and ignored the blood pouring from the wound. Frank had used the distress to flee deeper inside the store and it was now hurt... but it didn't matter. It had found prey, that alone was more important then any injury it could ever receive, even a fatal one. The monster licked at its bleeding flesh with what could be considered a look of glee on its twisted face. The small shred of a mind it had left knew this would be fun. Most of its other victims hadn't been so helpless, it had to wait for them to make a careless mistake before it got them... this one would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was trapped inside a store that could lose its last light and go pitch black any minute, was small and allowed little room to maneuver, and... it could smell his fear. A fear that the Stalker knew all too well... the fear that came from someone cornered with no way out. Frank raised his gun again and desperately fire another shot. The sound of glass breaking told him he hadn't even come close to hitting his target. One shot left. Frank ran even deeper into the store as the Stalker ran off into the shadows right behind him. \"Shit, where did it go?!\" He yelled as he moved the flashlight around franticly, trying to get even a tiny glimpse of the demonic predator. Nothing. Not even the sound of growling or heavy breathing. All Frank could hear was his own heartbeat... and that would soon change if he didn't do something. He was about to take a literal shot in the dark when he noticed the aisle between him and the exit was clear. He could make a run for it... and hope that thing didn't jump out and rip him apart. The option of staying here and waiting for its inevitable attack wasn't much better... but at least then he'd have a decent shot at it. What does he do?</span></div></div>",

He couldn't bear to do it again, even if it meant his death. He would stand his ground for the first time and face his foe head on. \"Bring it, you little bitch...\" He called out with a little of his courage restored. \"I'm right here.\" A few seconds passed before the Stalker made its move. All that could be heard was Frank's own heart as a pair of clawed hands emerged from the darkness. Not even a scream escaped either combatant's lips as Frank squeezed the trigger on his revolver for the final time. A single shot rang out as blood splattered all over the nearby shelfs. Frank fell to the floor with a thud with the Stalker on top of him. The things claws and teeth had sunk into his arms and shoulder. Frank closed his eyes and waited for the monster to finish him off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly it didn't. The Stalker's limp body had hit Frank with enough force to sink its claws and teeth into his flesh, but not deep enough to cause a fatal amount of blood loss. Indeed, most of the blood splattered in the confrontation had come from the bullet hole in the Stalker's head. Once Frank realized his victory he shoved the things dead body off of him and felt around for his dropped flashlight. It took him no time to find it and he quickly shone it on the body of his enemy to make sure it was dead. The sight was sickening, but it was clear the zombie wouldn't be getting back up. \"I killed him... it... I killed another one.\" Frank gasped as he returned his empty gun to its holster. \"I took another life, yet... somehow I don't regret it...\" Frank looked down at his shaking hands and bleeding arms. \"It hurts like hell, but its not deep.\" He said to himself reassuringly. \"I'm still alive... because I did what I had to... these people... these things are not human, not anymore. They may be able to move, but all they are is corpses...\" Frank walked out of the store with a heavy heart and found another directory with his flashlight sitting about thirty feet away with a few bloodstains on it.

He didn't see a single zombie on the way to the stairs, so this was probably a good idea. As it turned out the little icon on the directory had stood for escalator, which wasn't really much help, but Frank was grateful for the small luxury. He just hoped he didn't end up using all of his luck on trivial matters or small conveniences. \"As if I even believe in luck!\" Frank said with a laugh. It felt good to have a small break from the horror surrounding him, even if only for a few seconds. The first thing Frank saw as he stepped off of the escalator was a large coffee shop with a banner over the entrance proudly advertising their newest concoction, which looked to be some strange blend of coffee and fruit. He had always been more of a tea person, but wouldn't have turned down a free cup of warm refreshment if it had been extract of pickle and lemon juice. Frank cheerfully walked in and looked over the vast wall of flavors and styles, over two hundred in all! When he finally found one he liked he began making himself a cup while looking the place over. All that he found besides countless packets of artificial sweetener was a kitchen knife that was stained with days old blood that was peeling and flaking. \"I don't think I wanna know the story behind this...\" Frank said as he looked at a thin trail of dried blood that led across the table and disappeared into the floor. \"But its good to have a weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes Frank found himself pouring a cup of coffee and relaxing at a table near the back wall next to the counter. Well, as best as one could relax in a situation such as this. A single sip was all it took to let him know it was too bitter for his taste and he was soon filling his cup with several packets of sweetener and cream. Another sip confirmed it as still bitter, yet tolerable so Frank sat down his knife and flashlight and took a few minutes for himself. When he had finished his drink he got up and threw away the empty cup, grabbed his knife and flashlight and headed out. He moved a little further along and soon came to a store that was barricaded with everything from boards to stacked boxes and empty shelves. Fitting, considering it was a hardware store stocked with all manner of home improvement supplies. Frank knocked softly on an overturned work bench that helped cover the main entrance and called out quietly to anyone inside. When no one answered he knocked a little louder and when he again got no response, shone his flashlight through an opening and looked around inside. He saw something move near the back, but couldn't tell what it was. He thought for a moment and decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He passed a pair of restrooms and turned around the last corner to see a single metal door at the end of the passage. It seems he had found his salvation... or did he? The door was intact... and also locked with a key that could be anywhere in the mall now, although it was most likely still on the corpse of one of the security guards. \"No, damn it!\" Frank cursed as he tried to get the door open. \"I should have known it would be locked...\" He said as he turned around to see someone walk around the corner. Its dark outline seemed feminine and it walked slowly as a sad moan escaped its lips. Frank shone his flashlight on it to see that it was indeed a young woman, a deceased one. She walked up to him with an expression that Frank could only interpret as sad/troubled and reached out as if she meant to hug him. In a panic Frank smacked her in the side of the head with his flashlight as he backed up against the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell to the ground, but quickly got back up with three red streams of blood running down her face. Two of which were coming from her despair-filled red eyes. Suddenly, her face twisted into an expression of pure rage as she let out a loud howling shriek. Frank covered his ears and dropped his flashlight as he put one of his hands on the door for support. Then, as quickly as it had started, the shriek stopped and her face returned to its sad state. This was all he could take, Frank wanted to get the hell away from this thing as quickly as he could. He ran back down the hall as best he could in the complete darkness and knocked aside a zombie as he stumbled past the two bathrooms where the Siren must have been hiding.  A horde of level ones had been gathering near the entrance and Frank was having a little trouble getting back to the main hallway. That little became a lot real quick as another shriek echoed from down the hallway behind him. Frank fell to his knees as the zombies quickly surrounded him. He passed away before the poor undead girl could even finish her second song, a dirge of undiluted sadness that stopped humans in their tracks...</span></div></div>",

After five minutes of walking without seeing anything he came to the food court. It was quite large and had over two dozen different places to eat, it even had some games and rides in the center which reminded Frank of a carnival. Most of the ceiling was taken up by a large glass window that lit the entire room with beautiful moonlight. The brightness was comforting and made things much easier to see. Frank took a plastic bag from one of the nearby resteraunts and began checking for anything he could take with him. After checking a few places all he had found was a can of grape soda. \"People who were here before me must have cleaned these places out...\" Frank said as he hopped back over the counter of a KFC. He went over to check some of the overturned vending machines that had been broken into. Most were empty, but he did find some candy bars and a bag of BBQ chips that someone had left behind in a machine that had been turned over on its side. Frank opened one of the candy bars and put the rest in his bag. After a little more searching he came across another bag of chips (green onion) and a bottle of water. He decided to save the water for later and opened the grape soda, drinking the whole thing in 3 big gulps. It was good to finally get something to eat and drink, but Frank didn't want to stay too long so he decided to move on. The food court had an exit that led to the outside parking lot on the far end, but Frank didn't know how safe it would be outside. He could go back the way he came and try to find one of the other stores he had read about on the directory, but it could be hard to find his way back.

Aside from a few overturned or wrecked cars everything looked the same. The pale moon hung overhead, lacing everything in a thick blanket of light. It was even creepier outside the mall, but Frank was glad to be able to see. As he walked he began to feel slightly uneasy, as if something was wrong. He hadn't seen a single zombie since leaving the gun store. \"Hello, is anyone there!\" He called nervously. Silence. Frank decided to pick up the pace and get out of this open area as fast as possible. He could feel it, something was out here with him, something evil. He was halfway across the parking lot when he found out what that something was. A few crows with glowing red eyes landed on one of the nearby light posts. They didn't attack right away, instead they waited for their friends to show up. It didn't take them long. Frank was up to a steady run by the time he noticed it. Birds of every shape and size were descending on the almost empty parking lot. Their grotesque bodies forming a dark shadow over the moon. \"S-shit!\" Frank spat as he made his way towards the nearest building, a lifeless looking video game store. The birds drew closer and began moving in for the kill when Frank noticed a van up ahead with the door open... on the other side of the row of cars he was running besides. If he wanted to get inside he would have to climb over at least two cars without stopping or falling off. He pulled his revolver out of its holster with his free hand and got ready to fire when he glanced ahead across the road at the video game store. Just a little further and he'd make it. He fired off a shot that caught a beakless robin in the wing, severing it. He was almost past the van with the open door... what will he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a brief moment Frank considered taking the risk and trying to get to the van... but couldn't bring himself to chance it. All he'd have to do is slip once and it would all be over. He gritted his teeth as he crossed the highway and pulled open the door to the abandoned building on the other side. He closed it back just in time to sever the head off of a small sparrow. The next few seconds were filled with the sound of tiny dead bodies colliding into the glass windows and door. Thankfully, the undead birds didn't have enough strength to penetrate through and many were left splattered stains on the sidewalk outside. After a few minutes the birds began to fly back to their posts on the edge of the mall, maybe later they'd get some other hapless survivor traveling alone in the dark, but not tonight. Frank leaned against the stores counter next to a cardboard cut out of a space marine from a newly released game. He had made it just in time, another second and he would have been bird food. Frank sat his bag of food on the floor and took out the bottle of water he had gotten earlier and had a drink. Afterwards, he placed it back in his bag and checked his revolver, two shots left. \"Damn, I shouldn't have wasted a shot on that bird...\" Frank said to himself as he got up off the floor. \"Might as well have a look around. I don't think they'd sell bullets here, but maybe they have something else I can use...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank decided to check behind the counter first, if there was anything valuable in this tiny store it was likely to be there. Frank saw some boxes laying half open on the floor, but the only thing he found inside them were a few games and a broken controller. He had a little more luck when he checked the drawer beneath the cash register. Inside he found a switchblade and and a small flashlight. Frank decided to put the switchblade in his pocket for now and keep using his gun until it ran out of ammo. He checked the flashlight before adding it to his inventory to make sure it worked. The light flickered on and back off the two times he flipped the switch, it was a keeper. The moon had provided enough light to see at the current time, so Frank put his new flashlight into his pocket as well. After checking a few more drawers and not finding anything Frank decided to move on. He was just about to get up when he heard something click behind his back. The next thing he saw as he turned around was a shotgun about two inches from his face. \"Don't fuckin move.\" The owner of the shotgun ordered in a calm voice. He looked pretty young, only about 20 or so years old. He was wearing a Halo t-shirt and black jeans. The only thing that suggested he was an adult and not a teenager was the short beard around his lower face. He looked Frank over for a few seconds before asking some questions. \"Why did you come here?\" Frank took a moment to find his voice, replying as soon as he was able to get over the surprise of having a gun pointed at him. \"I-I came from the mall across the street. Some birds attacked me.\" The man gave Frank a look that said he didn't believe a word of what he had just told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he asked another question to the frightened accountant. \"Why are you alone? Did the group you were with get killed?\" Frank answered more quickly this time. \"No, I didn't have a group... I was the only one to escape my apartment alive.\" The man raised an eyebrow. \"You saying you been by yourself this whole time? You must be one hell of a zombie killer then.\" Frank felt a bit ashamed of his next words. \"No... I hid once I got out of the apartment. I've spent the last few days hiding in a gun store, the only reason I'm still alive is sheer dumb luck.\" The man looked into Franks eyes to try and tell if he was lying or not. \"What you're telling me is the truth?\" He asked as he leveled the shotgun with Franks forehead. \"It is.\" Frank replied as he looked down the barrel of the gun at the man who held his life in his hands. There was silence for a few minutes, then the man pulled the gun away from Franks face and helped him up. \"Name's Rob. You seem to be telling the truth so I'll trust you... for now.\" He walked back towards the door he had entered from and motioned for Frank to follow him. \"Oh, thank you... my names Frank.\" He said as he joined his new ally in the stores supply room. On the floor inside was a large box with some high caliber guns inside. \"You seem to be pretty unarmed so I'll let you have one of these.\" Rob said as he sat his shotgun against the wall. Frank didn't know how Rob had gotten ahold of these guns... and for the moment, he didn't care.</span></div></div>",

Rob gave him a smile and padded him on the back. \"Ah, the Ak-47. Not quite as loud as a grenade launcher, but great for moving down the hordes of undead.\" Frank didn't really like using guns, yet felt a lot safer with his new weapon. \"Just so you know, I've only fired a handgun before, not something like this...\" He said as he looked over the powerful gun. Rob gave him a surprised look. \"Its real simple, just pull the trigger when you see something move... that shouldn't. Its set to full auto, so you just need to make sure you actually hit something when you fire. I've got plenty of extra rounds, but we can't afford to waste ammo.\" Rob picked up his shotgun and headed back out into the store. \"Wait here, I'll sneak out and bring the car around.\" He called as he walked over to the windows and looked outside. \"I better do this quick... be ready to jump inside when I get back around, I'm not stopping and you'll get left behind if you're too slow.\" Frank didn't like the sound of this. \"Wait, I just got here, shouldn't we-\" The sound of the door slamming cut him off as Rob ran around the side of the store and disappeared. A few birds stirred in the distance, but didn't bother chasing him, he could just run back inside if they attacked him. They wouldn't make another move unless he was dumb enough to try and cross the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank scratched his head as he stood just behind the large glass window, looking out into the night sky. It was so beautiful with the stars and moon shining overhead that it almost made Frank forget what lurked beneath it. He was lost in thought for only about a minute before he was snapped back to reality. A loud engine started and tires could be heard screeching. Quickly Frank ran outside and waited for Rob. The sound of the car grew louder and a small vehicle pulled out from around the other side of the store. Rob honked the horn and yelled for Frank to get in. Easier said then done. The car must have been going at least 40 miles an hour. Frank gulped as he ran across the road, turned back around, and jumped onto the opened passenger side door as it whizzed past. He tossed his Ak-47 in the back seat and quickly climbed in before shutting the door. \"Nice job!\" Rob said cheerfully as he sped around a corner onto the highway. Frank's heart was beating faster then it ever had before and his hands were shaking uncontrollably. \"G-good job?!\" Frank stammered angrily. \"I just jumped onto a moving car! What in god's name were you thinking?!\" Rob gave him a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I had to outrun a couple level twos that saw me start the car. If I had slowed down they might have climbed on.\" Frank shifted in his seat as he struggled to get his seat belt on. \"Ugh, just try not to be so reckless next time okay? You almost gave me a heart attack...\" The duo moved along the mostly abandoned highway for about an hour before taking an exit off onto a back road, before finally coming to a wreck that blocked their path. \"Well shit!\" Rob shouted as he stopped the car and got out. He walked up to two crashed cars that cut off their way forward and looked around. Up ahead he could see a large sign advertising a reststop, a diner, and a motel further up ahead. He let out a sigh and walked back over to the car and got in. \"Looks like we've got two choices, Frank.\" He said as he sat back down. \"We can get out, and kept going on foot, or turn around and keep moving along the highway.\"</span></div></div>",

At this rate we're better off just going on foot.\" Rob nodded his head slowly in agreement. \"Right, I was thinking the same thing, it'll be more work, but at least we won't need to worry about getting stuck somewhere, like now...\" Frank let off a laugh. \"Hey, you did a pretty good job getting us this far, especially with so many closed off streets in the city. Its almost like you knew exactly where to go.\" Rob stretched his arms before climbing out. \"Yeah, that was mostly luck, I just followed the same roads I used to get to work. People may call me a slacker, but I sure do know how to find shortcuts and avoid roads known for heavy traffic. I never figured it would help me escape a zombie infested city though...\" Frank opened his door and stepped out, taking in a deep breath of the cool night air. \"Yeah... I never thought I'd have to fight my way out of my own apartment with my brothers revolver. Guess its been a pretty crazy week...\" Rob laughed as he closed his door back. \"Yeah, but it sure beats a week of work.\" Strangely. instead of joining Frank at the front of the car he moved around to the back. \"What's the matter, you forget something?\" Frank called as he remembered that he himself had left his bag of snacks back at the game store. \"Ah, shit...\" He blurted out as he joined Rob. \"What is it?\" He asked. \"Its nothing... I just forgot some of my supplies back at the store...\" Rob grinned that devilish grin again and Frank started to feel a little uneasy. \"Oh don't worry...\" Rob chuckled as he popped open the trunk. \"I got plenty of supplies stockpiled for an emergency.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the truck were three backpacks along with several boxes of ammunition. \"Holy... shit.\" Frank gasped when he saw everything. \"Where do you GET this stuff?\" Rob grabbed a backpack and tossed it to him. \"I'm just crazy prepared is all... I think that one has all the extra ammo for your AK. Shame we couldn't bring the grenade launcher too, I also got some spare rounds for it.\" Frank put on the backpack and almost fell over. \"Jesus this thing is heavy.\" Rob put on a backpack himself and opened the last one that was still sitting in the trunk. He pulled out a can of red spray paint and close the truck back with his key still in it. After giving it a good shake he sprayed a crude circle on the trunks lid, along with a \"R\" in the center. When he was done he threw the can off to the side of the road. \"It really is a shame you didn't bring a friend with you... we're gonna have to leave the food and drinks here.\" Frank stopped in his tracks when he heard this. \"Wait, there was food and water in there?! Thats more important then ammo, lets put mine back and take that one!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob simply shook his head as he walked. \"No good, we need the extra ammo in your backpack and the spare gear in mine. The food does us no good if it can't help us kill zombies.\" Frank couldn't believe what he was hearing, this guy really was crazy. \"Just how the hell do you suppose we survive without it then? We can't eat bullets or whatever \"gear\" you got in your backpack!\" Rob let out a sigh. \"Look, I'm nice enough to get you out of the city, share my stuff with you, and not shoot you in the face for getting on my nerves... and FYI there's a reststop, diner, AND motel up ahead. We can eat and drink all we want there before moving on.\" Frank simply shook his head silently as Rob began climbing over the cars. It seemed he had no choice but to trust him. It was a little hard to get over the the cars with a full backpack while also carrying an AK, but Frank managed just fine and jumped down next to Rob. \"Guess complaining won't do me any good, go ahead and lead then...\" Frank said as he followed Rob down the cold, quiet road...</span></div></div>",

You need to get used to firing that gun.\" He called as he reloaded his weapon. \"Um... sure.\" Frank called back unenthusiastically. He wasn't sure he had what it took to take any more human lives, zombie or not. Fortunately for him, they came to the reststop before having to deal with any more undead. He was so glad to finally take a break that he ran past Rob and took a seat on one of the picnic benches next to an outdoor grill. Rob walked past him up towards the public bathrooms at the top of a steep hill to clear out any zombies that might be inside. \"I'll be right back, I'm gonna go check the restrooms up there. If you want, you can come with me or stay here and rest for a bit.\" Rob called as he made sure he had plenty of spare ammo with him. \"Yeah, I'll stay here. Call if you need anything.\" Frank replied as he took off his heavy backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob returned about ten minutes later with stick of dynamite in his hand. \"Jesus, where'd you get that?!\" Frank shouted when he saw it. \"Don't tell me that you had that when you went in there. \"No...\" Rob said with a grin. \"It was pretty bad in there... blood, bodies, and trash everywhere, but the garbage can in the mens bathroom was a RSL.\" Frank gave him a confused look. \"RSL?\" Rob shook his head it disappointment. \"RSL? Re-supply location? You didn't know that?\" Frank shook his head. Rob let out a sigh. \"Anyway...\" He said. \"I also found this.\" He held up a shiny metal lighter, a Zippo in fact. \"Thats good, I guess.\" Frank said as he stood up and put his backpack back on. \"I guess we'll be moving on now?\" Rob shook his head. \"Not just yet... come with me.\" Rob began walking back up to the bathroom with Frank following closely behind, curious to see what Rob had to show him. They walked past the soda machine outside and into the small smelly room. The first thing Frank noticed was the half dozen corpses scattered across the floor in pools of blood or torn sleeping bags. Most were fairly decayed and covered in blankets or sheets, but one or two were still fresh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear god, what HAPPENED in here?!\" Frank gasped as backed up against the wall for support. Rob ignored the question and walked over to a stall with the door broken off. \"Come here.\" He said as he knocked a severed leg out of the way with his foot. Frank began shaking, this was too much. What could have done something like this? He lowered his gun a little and slowly walked over to where his friend was standing. Rob pointed to some graffiti on the wall just above the broken toilet. Frank bent over and began slowly reading it to himself. \"Sophie Newhart 1978 - 2012 A dear friend and loyal companion until the end. Bob Mills 1962 - 2012 Beloved father and brother. Taken too soon. Nick \"Fingers\" Rhodes 1989 - 2012 Saved my life at the cost of his.\" Frank was confused. \"These names... are they the people who died here?\" Rob pointed below the names at something else that was written. \"This was what I wanted you to see, as for the names, they were probably scribbled down when other groups of survivors passed through here. But never mind that, just read this.\" Frank looked to where he pointed and read. \"I saw one of them today, the ones who did this. The brotherhood. They wear white robes and each one has a unique ability. They used dark magic to do this. The only way to kill them is...\" Frank trailed off as the paint used to write the message smudged, making the rest illegible. \"What do they mean brotherhood?\" Frank asked as he turned to Rob. \"I don't know.\" Rob replied. \"No point in worrying about it right now, we need...\"</span></div></div>",

Its night, thing's are dark, and we'd be easy prey. I've seen several types of zombies, big fat ones, burning ones, hell, even ones that can shoot slime. I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a fucking Wendigo out there killing people right now. I know this isn't the safest of places, but use your head. If whatever came through just brutalized these people I doubt it would bother coming back before morning. Besides, would you really rather be walking down an abandoned road at night with only me and that gun you don't want to use as protection, or sleeping in a semi-comfortable public bathroom with a few dead bodies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank's stomach turned as he considered the two options, he almost wanted to take his chances outside with whatever boogieman did this. Almost. The color left Frank's face when he realized staying here was the better option. \"Ugh, fine... We'll stay here until morning, but then we get the hell out of here. Deal?\" Rob grinned. \"Glad you see it my way. Come on, we're sleeping in the ladies room.\" He said as he stepped back outside and went into the only other room. Frank followed and was somewhat relieved to see that the ladies room only had two bodies over in a corner, thankfully with a thick blanket covering them. \"Heh, guess the girl's restrooms really are nicer...\" Frank said with a weak laugh, trying his best to calm himself. \"Yeah, that's funny, now give me a hand with this!\" Rob called as he yanked a loose door from a stall and carried it over to the only entrance. \"Eat shit and die.\" Frank said in a deadpan monotone. \"What did you say?!\" Rob called angrily as he placed the door against the wall. \"I was reading this message on the wall...\" Frank said as he pointed to the bloody words written just above the sinks in all capital letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind the damn graffiti, just help me secure this place... or do you want to sleep outside?\" Rob called in an annoyed tone. Frank sighed and helped him with the second door and the third. \"You really thank this'll keep us safe?\" Frank asked half-expecting an answer he would regret hearing. Sure enough, that's exactly what Rob gave him. \"Fuck no, this won't keep us safe. The only reason I put it up was to alert me to the fact that something's gotten inside and is munching on your guts. That way I can escape and leave you to die.\" Frank's face lost its color again and he sat down on the cold hard floor with sweat pouring down his face. \"I think I'd like to go to sleep now...\" Rob grinned as he sat down his backpack and pulled out a couple of thin sheets and pillows. \"Here you go little Frank, would you like a bed time story?\" He taunted as he tossed Frank his sheet and pillow. \"NO!\" Frank shouted, more annoyed then angry. \"And why didn't you tell me you had pillows and sheets stuffed in there?\" \"You didn't ask.\" Rob mumbled as he pulled his sheet up and turned on his side. \"Now get some sleep, we'll only be here for about 5 or so hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank spread his sheet over the ground and laid his head on his pillow. He was cold, but there was no way in hell he was going to lay on the bare floor. The wind howled a bit outside and he soon found himself dozing off. That morning Frank dreamed nightmare after nightmare about the events of the last few days. A thousand twisted faces appeared out of the darkness and taunted him as he screamed. \"You killed us, why? WHHHHYYYY?! What did we do to you?\" They laughed as they watched his torment. Finally, after four hours of restless hell, he woke up to a new nightmare. A double-barrel shotgun was planted firmly against his cheek and Rob had a cleaver just inches from his throat. In the dim light of the new morning sun Frank could see that their attacker's were not monsters, but humans. The one who had captured Rob was wearing an orange hunting cap and a flannel shirt under his orange jacket. The one who had Frank had a thick mustache and a camo colored jacket and pants. Strapped to his belt was a high caliber revolver along with some small pouches. \"G'mornin.\" The one with the shotgun taunted as he removed his sunglasses and revealed a nasty scar running across his left eye and down his cheek.</span></div></div>",

He was so shocked that he doubted he could even speak without accidentally provoking them in some way. \"Yeah, nice to meet you too.\" Rob suddenly blurted out. \"Good fuckin' morning.\" Frank's jaw dropped open as the hick with the shotgun walked over to him while his buddy held him in place with the cleaver. \"What? You g-\" Rob began to speak, but was quickly silenced with the butt of the shotgun painfully smacking him in the side of the mouth. Two teeth flew across the room and landed on the floor as a thick stream of blood began pouring from his torn open lip. \"Augg...\" Rob gasped as he raised a hand to wipe off his mouth, only to have it grabbed and pulled behind him. \"Rob!\" Frank called out as he moved closer. \"Hol' it.\" The man in the orange hat and vest called as his friend aimed his shotgun at Frank. \"You shoulda  kept quiet like yer buddy there.\" The man with the shotgun taunted as they tied Rob's hands behind his back with rope. After both his hands and feet were bound one of the two rednecks carried him outside while the other tied up Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, we got em!\" The man called as he hauled Frank outside where the others were waiting. Down near the road were three pickup trucks, one of which was piled full of supplies. The other two seemed to be moderately armored, but Frank hardly took notice as he was far more concerned about the fifteen or so armed men loading Rob into the back of the one on the far end. \"W-where are you gonna take us?\" Frank asked meekly as one of them walked over to help the one carrying Frank. \"Shuddup, boy!\" The new hillbilly growled as he grabbed Frank by the feet. Once both of the survivors were secure in the back next to each other a few of the men began loading their supplies into the back of the truck in front of them. \"Shit!\" Frank thought to himself as he looked around the bed of the truck. Not only was there nothing that could cut the ropes, but there were also no less then 3 guards keeping a close watch on him and Rob. Seeing as there was nothing he could do at the moment, Frank simply sat back and listened as the truck up in front of him started its engine. \"Alright boys, les git these two back to th' farm!\" One of the hicks up front called. Soon, the trucks were all moving in the same direction Frank and Rob had been walking the previous night, only to make a sharp left turn as soon as houses starting coming into view up ahead. The last thing Frank saw as they began driving deep into the woods was a quick glimpse of the shiny, silver diner off in the distance behind the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gravel road leading to the farm made for quite a bumpy and noisy ride, but Frank dared not to complain. Occasionally, the men would fire off a shot or two at the odd zombie that they drove past, often scoring a killing blow on the first try. \"Damn Lester, you see tha son' bitch?!\" One called as the guy next to him fired three shots at a large bear off in the distance. \"Um yeah, good shot...\" Frank said weakly in an attempt to make conversation. \"Yew best jus stay quiet, boy...\" One of them sneered in reply. The rest of the trip was silent expect for the crunching of gravel beneath the wheels of their trucks. Finally, after 20 minutes they pulled into the driveway of one of their homes right next to a large wooden barn. Most of them began heading towards the nearby house while the rest unloaded supplies and such. As luck would have it, none of them remembered to keep an eye on their prisoners, leaving Frank and Rob a possible chance to escape... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should they do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank scooted over to the edge of the truck and peered over the side. From the looks of it the driveway steadily moved down a steep hill surrounded by trees. Off to the right he could see a small house far below them through the trees. \"Damn, if we try to run while we're tied up we could end up tripping and falling off the edge.\" He whispered as he leaned out a little farther. No way he'd survive a fall from this hight... and the woods surrounding them were probably filled with zombie animals... \"No... no. Its just too risky, one slip and we'd both be dead...\" Frank muttered as he sat back down in the bed of the truck, careful not to make any noise. \"Well Rob, looks like our best bet is to just wait this out. If we tried getting down the hill before they saw us we would most likely trip and either end up shot or dead at the bottom of this hill.\" Rob only made a grunting noise as he stared at the nearby house. He had been really quiet ever since the incident at the reststop and seemed to be in a daze, but now he was really focused on the farmhouse for some reason. It was indeed a nice two-story house, but Frank hadn't noticed anything going on near it. Of course, he had spent the last few moments trying to think of a way to escape. Maybe Rob had noticed something important...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few hours the two sat in the back of the truck waiting to see what these men wanted with them. The sun was now almost overhead and slowly warming the earth with its light. Finally, around noon three of the men walked out to the truck, two with weapons, and one carrying some supplies. \"Git out.\" One of the men said in a cold tone as he lit up a cigarette. Frank and Rod did as they were told and stood before the men waiting further instructions. \"Well now, you two seem to be behaving real good now.\" A man in a NASCAR t-shirt said with a grin. \"But don't be thinking you'll be getting off for good behavior.\" Both of the other two men rolled their eyes and told him to shut up as began leading their two captives to the barn. A forth man was there waiting and opened the door as they walked up. \"You sure they'll be secure until tonight?\" He asked as the man with the cigarette nodded his head. \"Don't worry, if they try to escape, we'll feed em to ol' Bessy.\" He replied as he shut the door back. \"Just remember that they'll be here at 8.\" One of the other men called from inside the barn. Immediately, Frank noticed two things. One, the barn was smelly and dark. Two, there was something breathing in the pin up ahead. Something big, with glowing red eyes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is that thing?\" Frank stuttered as he and Rob were shoved to the ground. \"None of your fuckin' business!\" The man in the NASCAR shirt hissed as walked out of sight for a moment. He returned less then a minute later with two large cinderblocks in his hands. \"You wanna help me Jonas? This shit weighs a ton!\" The other man let out a groan, but obliged. Soon Frank and Rob found themselves in a kneeling position while the rednecks wrapped chains around them. Each chain severely restricted their movement and was attached to a cinderblock, making it impossible for them to get free without outside help. \"Here ya go boys.\" The man with the cigarette called as he flicked it to the ground and opened up a jug. \"Y'all have been so good we decided to reward ya. Have a sip.\" The liquid in the container smelled of alcohol and something sweet. \"T-thats okay.\" Frank stuttered as the man lowered the jug closer to his mouth. \"Drink it.\" He said in a much less friendly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seem to be going from bad to worse. What should Frank do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frank kept his Ak-47 pointed straight ahead of him as he walked, ready to fire it at anything that decided to jump out at him. Rob however, was more laid back in his approach and didn't even bother raising his shotgun unless he saw a zombie. By the time they walked the half mile to the reststop they had encountered three zombies, all level one. Rob had made short work of them with his shotgun, but encouraged Frank to deal with the next one they saw. \"You need to get in some practice with that thing, so the next time we see one of the undead I'm letting you kill it.\" He had said when he realized that Frank hadn't so much as pulled the trigger once on his gun. Frank was perfectly willing to let Rob do all the dirty work as he seemed to enjoy it and Frank didn't like shooting things, living or dead. Yet, as much as he didn't want to, he knew Rob would expect him to help out sooner or later and he'd have to start shooting or give up his only source of protection and possibly his only ally. He let out a sigh as he looked over the reststop. It wasn't much, but it would be nice to take a break and sit down. \"Hey Rob, should we check out that reststop?\" Frank called out as he gave it another hopeful look. \"Sorry, but we gotta get to a place with some shelter, and that place isn't exactly a fortress. Besides, its small potatoes compared to what we'll likely find at the motel and diner.\" Frank thought of protesting, but knew it would be fruitless so he decided to forget he ever saw the reststop and focused on the trip ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank fired his gun for the fist time ever when a large buck with a broken antler jumped out from the side of the road and rushed the two. Rob, who was about 15 yards ahead, managed to jump out of the way just in time. Frank, who had no time to move, simply opened fire and emptied the entire clip into the undead deer. It slumped over and fell to the ground as the bullets tore through its flesh. When the gun finally ran out of ammo, the Beast's corpse was riddled with holes and leaking blood. Rob got up off the ground and walked over to congratulate his companion on his first kill. \"Nice job, noob.\" He said as he brought the butt of his shotgun down on the zombies mangled head, just to make sure it wasn't getting back up. \"Next time, you might want to stop firing when your opponent falls over dead, you know? Saves more ammo that way.\" Frank slowly got to his feet and surveyed his fallen foe. \"Did... did I really do that?\" He choked out as sweat poured down his face. \"Yeah, it was close, but you're still alive so I guess we get to hang out a little longer. Here.\" Rob tossed him a spare clip that he had taken out of Frank's backpack. \"You know how to reload, don't you?\" He taunted as he resumed walking down the road. \"Oh, yeah...\" Frank mumbled as he stepped away from the corpse and joined back up with his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour passed and a few abandoned houses came in to view behind the trees and bushes. Rob cautioned Frank to keep his eyes out for any sudden movement. Frank nodded and got a little closer to his companion. Up ahead was a round silver building with a large sign on top. Rob noticed it first and gleefully pointed it out to Frank. \"Oh man, there the diner is up ahead! I'm starving!\" Frank was still upset at Rob for abandoning the food backpack, but if this diner had half of what had been in the backpack they left that would soon change. As they got closer Frank noticed another building on the other side of the street. It was the two-story motel that Rob had mentioned. \"Hey Rob! There's the motel!\" He called to make sure Rob knew about it. \"Yeah yeah, I see it.\" He replied. \"Now, we have two things we need to do: Clear any and all zombies out of the motel so we can sleep there and gather supplies at the diner. I'll let you choose which job you want to do. What'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

Be careful...\" Frank caught the clip and put it into his pants pocket where he'd have easy access to it. \"Okay, Frank... You can do this...\" He mumbled to himself as he looked over the motel. \"Well, its not what I would call 5 stars, but it'll have to do.\" Frank slowly made his way closer and kept listening for any movement as he stepped into the parking lot. Funnily enough, he could hear something that sounded like music coming from somewhere on the upper level. Frank shook his head and tried listening again. The music was still there, something about a boogie man killing people or something. \"Great, I'm not going insane, but who the hell would be playing music at a time like this?\" Frank rubbed his forehead and began walking through the parking lot. \"Guess I'll find out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was so concerned about the music that he almost missed the limbless zombie sitting propped up against a rusty old car. It's belly was carved open and its guts were spread out around it. There was no threat, but it caught Frank completely off guard. \"Jesus!\" He gasped as the thing began twisting around, trying to get closer and kill him. Frank bent over a nearby truck and threw up a little on the hood. \"Oh god... how is that thing still moving?\" He tried aiming his gun at it as it gargled and spat blood, yet couldn't bring himself to pull the trigger. After a minute of nausea he decided to just leave it be and ran over to the short hallway that led to the stairs at the back of the motel. Frank wiped the sweat off of his face with his sleeve and tried taking a few deep breaths. Once he had calmed himself a bit it continued on to the top floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank grabbed ahold of the metal railing as he stepped onto the upper floor to steady himself. The sight of that mutilated zombie had proved to be quite a distraction... so much so that he had forgotten all about the music he had been hearing until now. A new song began and Frank listened once again. The music was coming from a room further down the hallway. \"This is crazy...\" Frank said as he climbed over part of a barbed wire fence someone had placed to block off the hallway. Just as he jumped down on the other side Frank ripped his pants and part of his leg on the annoying hazard. \"Ah, son of a bitch!\" He groaned as he rubbed his leg. \"Whoever is up here has to be insane...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Frank couldn't have been more right as he soon found out when he came to the room of the people playing the music. The only window was boarded up with \"FUCK OFF ZOMBIES\" written on it in bright red letters. The door was no better... as the evil-looking clown face on the front could attest. \"What did I get myself into...\" Frank whispered as he opened the door and was met with the full blast of the loud music playing. Of course, the music was nothing compared to the dozen or so people inside. Everyone was dressed in hoodies, coats, or otherwise going around shirtless, including one of the only two girls in the group who looked to be about 20 years old. The real kicker though, was the fact that every last one of them was decked out in clown face-paint. \"Ugh sorry, wrong room...?\" Frank squeaked as a large man got up off his beanbag chair and set his can of soda down on a table with a bong on it. \"Well, look what we got here, Juggalo's and Juggalette's. A survivor...\"</span></div></div>",

Although, we'd like if you stayed for a little bit, we got plenty of supplies to go around and you must be tired.\" Frank froze in place. Was the 6 foot tall man in front of him... inviting him in? \"Well, I guess I could use a... rest...\" Frank replied. \"Cool man, cool. Hey Weed man scoot your ass over and give our guest a place to sit.\" The big man called as he pulled the door aside for Frank. \"Yo, sure thing boss.\" A man with a headband said as he sat up on the two person couch next to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, um, thank you...\" Frank said nervously as he walked into the room. \"Can I get you anything, sugar?\" The topless woman said in a sweet voice as she got up off the floor. \"Anything... at all...?\" She finished in a seductive tone. \"Yo Brandy, cut it out. Our man here just made it past god knows how many zombies to get here. I'm sure he'll want some refreshments more then anything else. What can I get you?\" The man said as he turned to Frank. \"A beer? Blunt? Faygo?\" Frank paused for a moment. \"Wait, what did you just call me?\" The man began laughing. \"Don't tell me you never heard of faygo... hey Stitches toss me a can of that shit!\" A skinny man in the corner reached into a nearby cooler and pulled out a brightly colored can of soda. He tossed it to Frank and smiled. \"That be a moon mist dog, drink up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to insult them Frank quickly pulled the tab off and took a big gulp as he sat down next to the guy call Weed man. It wasn't like any soda Frank had had before and was surprisingly good. \"That's great... I didn't know what I was missing...\" Frank said with a weak laugh. \"Hey, chill man, relax. We ain't gonna hurt you. Oh, by the way my name is Moon Killa. Nice to meet you.\" The large man said as he returned to his spot near the table and grabbed his soda. \"I'm... Frank, nice to meet you.\" Frank said as he took another sip of this moon mist stuff. \"Welcome, Frank!\" Shouted about half of the people in the room. \"So Frank, my man...\" Weed man said as he leaned over with a freshly rolled joint. \"Want to take a trip wit me?\" Frank felt a bead of sweat roll down his cheek. \"Ah, no... thank you...\" He said as he finished off his can of Faygo. \"Aww, c'mon man. What could it hurt, the zombies will probably kill us anyway sooner or later.\" Weed man said as he lit it and took a deep puff. \"Stop that Weed, the man said no so how about you get that away from him.\" Moon Killa said as he lit up a joint himself. Weed man let out a sigh, but did as he was told. \"Yeah yeah boss, but he don't know what he's missing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sat alone for a few minutes while the rest of the group partied. Finally, he worked up the courage to start asking them questions. \"So, Moon Killa, what are you guys going all the way out here instead of trying to escape?\" Moon Killa took a long puff on his joint and chuckled. \"Well, we figured the whole world's shot to hell anyway, so we all banded together and fortified this motel as best we could. If we're all gonna die we wanna go out partying for as long as we can. Even if we do make it out alive there's plenty of us who would have nowhere to go. We're gonna live the time we have left as a family and if it comes to it, die like a family. You're more then welcome to leave anytime you like, but we're all gonna stay here.\" Frank was surprised at the unity and loyalty these people showed one another. When he first saw them he thought for sure they'd be hostile to him... He took a few moments to think up his next question and asked...</span></div></div>",

Follow me and I'll show you your bed.\" He said as he got up and and walked over towards the bathroom. It was fairly small inside with only a bathtub, toilet, and sink, but it didn't really matter as Frank watched as Moon Killa disappeared into a large pitch-black hole in the wall. In few seconds the room beyond the hole was lit up with a light and Frank cold see that it was almost an exact copy of the room the duo just came from. \"You knocked out the wall in the bathroom?\" Frank asked as Moon Killa showed up to greet him as he walked in. \"Oh yeah.\" Moon Killa replied with a proud smile. \"Me and my boys boarded up the door and window in this room and made us a new entrance. See, this way if zombies attack while we're asleep they'll have to go through all of our homies in the other room to get to us. Plus...\" He leaned in close to whisper in Frank's ear with a sly smile on his face. \"We keep our weapons and supplies in the spare bathroom over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank looked around as his new friend grabbed a spare blanket from their storage room. There were 4 mattresses scattered over the floor along with a few sleeping bags, 3 of which had people sleeping in them. In the corner there was a pile of sheets and blankets with a few pairs of underwear and socks mixed in. Pillows of all sizes and types were strewn about everywhere and the wall was covered in graffiti and crude drawings. It seemed a little crowded with almost zero floor space, but damn if it didn't look comfortable. \"Here you go!\" Moon said with a big smile. \"Since you and your buddy are guests we'll let you share one of the beds tonight, so feel free to crash anytime you like.\" Frank walked over and sat his pillow and blanket down on the mattress just below the boarded up window. \"Thank you Moon Killa.\" Frank said as they walked back into the other room. \"My friend should be showing up pretty soon, I'll head outside and wait for him.\" Moon walked over to the cooler and grabbed another Faygo, this time a 60/40, and tossed it to Frank. \"Give that to your friend when he gets here, and be sure to grab one yourself anytime you're thirsty, we got plenty!\" Frank caught the soda and picked up his AK-47 which he had sat by the door when he came in. \"I will, thanks.\" And with that Frank closed the door and stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on the edge of the walkway with his feet dangling between the railing. A gentle breeze began blowing through the trees, causing them to rustle softly. Of course, it was almost impossible to hear them over the music booming inside. Frank kept his gun ready to fire should he notice any movements in the parking lot below as he looked towards the diner. After 5 minutes a single gunshot was heard in the distance along with the sound of a body falling to the pavement. Frank focused his full attention on direction it came from and soon saw Rob running like a mad man out from behind a tree next to a house. There were 3 level 2 zombies in hot pursuit behind him and from the look of terror on his face, more following further behind. Frank yelled out to him as he entered the parking lot and began sprinting towards the stairs. Frank fired his AK-47 just as they passed under him and killed two of the zombies, leaving one to chase rob up the stairs. Fortunately, Frank remembered the barb wired fence in the hallway and quickly made his way over over to it. Rob slowed down as he got closer to it and ducked just in time for Frank to open fire on the last zombie. The first few shots to its chest did nothing, but when it began taking bullets to the head it quickly succumbed and fell to the floor. Without saying a word Frank quickly helped Rob over the fence and they headed back inside the motel room where their new allies were waiting...</span></div></div>",

What the hell happened out there?\" Frank asked as he helped Rob over to a cushion on the floor. \"It was one of them moaning bitches... I saw her in the diner and tried to shoot her, but I was too late. Before her body even hit the floor a mob of zombies began surrounding me... Most... most of them were level one and a few level two's, but there were a few others that I saw in the distance... Goddamn it... a whole mob of the bastards are gathering outside...\" Rob gasped between pants. \"Where's your shotgun?\" Frank asked as some of the juggalos began tending to his wounds. \"A Digger grabbed ahold of it as I ran down the street and pulled it underground...\" Rob replied with a groan as disinfectant was sprayed on his bleeding left arm. \"Don't worry, he'll live... but he's way too fucked up to be fighting right now.\" A juggalo in a hat said as he wrapped some bandages around Rob's arm. \"Shit... I'm sorry man.\" Rob said while trying to grin. \"I guess I fucked up...\" Frank simply shook his head and headed over to the door where he was joined by several freshly armed juggalos. \"Don't worry, you did what you could, now take a rest while me and our new friends clean up. Isn't that right Moon Killa?\" The big man grinned and adjusted his grip on his aluminum baseball bat. \"Bitches won't know what hit 'em.\" He said in a confident tone. \"Now then, let's show these punk ass zombies what happens when you fuck with the hatchet!\" The cheers and battle cries that ensued assured both Rob and Frank that they were in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes snipers armed with hunting rifles were set up along the upper walkway while Frank and the rest of the juggalos gathered in the parking lot to face the horde. The zombies were fairly thin at first with most of them being snipped from far away before they could get close. Then they grew thicker... and thicker... until even the people on the ground were beginning to fall back a bit incase they needed to retreat. Frank was on the last clip of his gun and, although he had been given a sledgehammer to act as a melee weapon, tried to only shoot when he had a clear shot. Moon Killa and several of his friends were crowded around the tightly pack cars so he also had to be careful not to accidentally shoot them. When his gun finally blasted its last bullet into the head of a level three zombie coming in from the side he grabbed the massive hammer strapped to his back and gave it a hefty swing. Frank was by no means a strong man, but what he did to the skull of the poor zombie caught on the receiving end of his attack was almost enough to make him sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting continued for a few minutes without the humans giving much ground, but soon stronger specials began appearing, making the fighting much harder. \"Shit, look the fuck out!\" A man with a scythe tattoo on his chest yelled as he knocked a man in sunglasses away just in time for a blob of purple slime to splash over him. \"Ugh, what in the high fuck IS this?!\" He shouted in disgust. Unfortunately, he soon found out as a Pyro appeared from behind a car and gave him the worst hug of his life. \"Charlie!\" Some of the juggalos shouted as a small explosion sent blood and flesh spraying in all directions. The zombies had claimed their first victim. \"Oh god, they got Charlie...\" One juggalo moaned as the smoke cleared from the mangled corpse that had once been his friend. \"Its hopeless, too many... there's too many...!\" He screamed as he dropped his gun and took a few steps back towards a parked truck. No sooner had he touched the hood then a Stalker grabbed him by the neck and carried him off as bullets whizzed past it. \"Son of a bitch, we're losing ground!\" Another juggalo called as an eerie shadow surrounded him before he could notice it. Something grabbed ahold of him and was just about to carve open his chest when the confused man was saved by one of his allies that had been nearby. \"Come on, keep fighting!\" His savior called as he smashed the skull of the Nightmare and led the man to safety. \"Thank god, I thought I was screwed...\" The man said tearfully as he fired his handgun at a rapidly approaching level two. \"No problem, just be more careful!\" Frank called as he took a swing at another zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans have managed to survive this far... now how with they turn the tide of this seemingly hopeless battle?</span></div></div>",

Just hold them for a few more minutes... we can do this!\" The minutes might as well have been hours with the opponents they were up against. They managed to hold their remaining ground for less then a single minute before another of their number fell prey to the zombies, a shy juggalette named Samantha was caught off guard by a Vampire and got her neck ripped open before she could react. \"Ah fuck it... we ain't got any choice...\" Moon Killa said as another of his friends took a nasty hit to the arm, nearly severing it. \"You guys up top! Get the turret and explosives, HURRY!!!\" The snipers nodded and disappeared inside, leaving their allies on the ground without any covering fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe survivors struggled even harder for the brief time the snipers were gone, losing two more of their members, but still managed to hold their ground. Finally, just as it seemed they were about to be overrun the men returned with several boxes and a mobile turret. \"Get that shit set up and start tossing bombs!\" Moon Killa yelled as he helped Frank take down another level three zombie. As soon as the gun was set up it began firing a hail of bullets that shredded the incoming hordes as molotov cocktails and other explosives were prepared. The remaining survivors quickly began to fall back to the staircase while they had the chance and began sealing off the ground floor as soon as they were all up top. By then the turret had used up most of its ammo supply and its operator quickly abandoned it to help the others light up explosives. The undead were finally starting to thin out a bit and things began looking up. That was before 2 men in white robes appeared amongst the zombies. \"Hey! HEY!\" Frank shouted as he lit a molotov. \"There are some more survivors down there!\" Moon Killa quickly rushed over to Frank and looked where he was pointing. \"Where?! Wh-\" Then he saw them. Two men with long hair were standing amongst the zombies, each with a white robe and a sinister look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juggalos, the brotherhood is here! Open fire on those bastards!\" Moon Killa shouted as the two men began walking closer, passing harmlessly by any zombie in their way. \"What?!\" Frank shouted as a Juggalo got back on the turret and began shooting. \"Why are you going to kill them?!\" Moon Killa was just about to answer when the turret abruptly ceased firing and the juggalo manning it fell to the floor, dead with a large black Crystal shard sticking out of his forehead. \"Told you I could hit him from this distance.\" One of the men said with a chuckle as his partner rolled his eyes. \"Yeah yeah, just make sure you block any more bullets they shoot at us with those crystals of yours.\" The other man said as they resumed walking. \"Oh... oh my god!\" Frank gasped as soon as he caught a glimpse of the nearly foot long shard sticking out of the corpses head. \"What... what did they do to him?!\" Moon Killa quickly grabbed the molotov out of Frank's hand and lobbed it right at the two. He knew it wouldn't work, but he had to distract them while the others retreated inside. \"Everyone, get inside NOW!!!\" He screamed as the molotov shattered on a thick sheet of black crystals that extended from one of the duo's arms and burst into flame. \"Well now, looks like their leader has noticed us brother...\" The other said as his sibling quickly extinguished the burning fire by spreading the crystals around it. \"Indeed, let's go meet him...\"</span></div></div>",

None of them missed their target, but neither did they pierce the duo's crystal shield. \"Fuck, as long as that bastard has those crystals we can't touch 'em!\" Moon Killa was about to lose hope as the remaining zombies roared while their masters drew ever closer. As he struggled to light and throw another molotov he felt a hand on his shoulder. \"Shit, didn't I t-\" He yelled as he turned around, only to cut himself off as he looked into Frank's eyes. \"Its not over yet. I fought like hell just to get here, now we're gonna finish them off.\" Frank said with determination in his voice. Without a word, Moon Killa smiled and gave a slight nod. \"Even if it kills us, we won't stop fighting.\" Frank finished as he lit a molotov and handed it to his alley. \"You keep the zombies from getting to our friends.\" Moon Killa took it and threw it right below them, creating a wall of flame between the nearest car and the entrance to the top floor. \"Don't worry homie, I'll keep those fuckers from getting our friends, but what are you gonna do?\" He asked as he turned towards Frank and grabbed another molotov. \"You said those guys are against us, right?\" Frank asked as he climbed over the railing right above a parked semi. \"What? Yeah, but they have powers, you can't-\" Moon Killa was then cut off with a loud thump as Frank jumped onto the top of the truck, narrowly avoiding falling of the edge. \"Jesus, I hope this works...\" Frank said as he pulled the two molotovs he had kept in his pockets out and removed the rags. He quickly poured them out all over the roof of the truck while keeping an eye on the two brothers as they stood motionless on the street, waiting to see what Frank would do. \"This is it.\" Frank said with finality as he flicked the lighter and tossed it in onto the roof of the truck as he got down on the front hood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tremendious roar flames slowly began engulfing the truck. \"Only got one shot at this.\" Frank said as he knocked a zombie that tried to grab him aside and shattered the driver side window. He climbed inside and turned the keys that were still in the trucks ignition, just as he had noticed when he first walked up. \"What the hell is the bastard doing?\" The younger man asked his twin brother as Frank hit the gas... and drove straight at them. Zombies were pushed aside or crushed into the ground as Frank drove the blazing truck right out of the parking lot. \"FUCK! HE'S GOING TO HIT US!\" The older brother yelled as he turned to flee, but it was too late. Frank clentched his teeth as he swirved the truck and sent it flying onto its side right as the younger brother raised a crystal barrier to protect himself. The truck collided with the both of them as it slid into the ditch and ceased moving. \"Oh... oh my god! Frank! FRANK!\" Moon Killa called as the smoke from the ruined truck rose slowly into the air. Nothing stirred, nothing moved except the smoldering corpses in the parking lot...</span></div></div>",

A few more seconds passed before the smoke from the truck started to clear, revealing the burning wreckage of the truck. \"Frank?! FRANK! Can you hear me?! Are you still alive?!\" A lone figured sturred behind the truck, but seemed to be slumped on the ground holding something. Moon killa doubted it was Frank, but how could those Brotherhood members have survived that? The silence was finally broken by the sound of glass breaking, which seemed to attract the attention of a few zombies. Soon another lone figure was climbing out of the truck and onto its side before hopping to the ground. Moon Killa couldn't see very well from this distance, but he knew his friend had made it out okay. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you get back here safe.\" He said as he headed inside to grab some supplies to help finish off the remaining undead gathered around the motel entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank rubbed his bleeding forehead as he took a moment to rest. Okay, THAT was definately one of my stupider ideas.\" He choked as he stumbled away from the smoking wreckage. Just as he was about to retreat back to the motel he heard something behind him... it sounded like... crying. The sight that met Frank when he turned around filled him with shock and horror. There, surrounded by broken crystal shards were the 2 men in white robes. One was holding the other in his hands as tears streamed down his face. The younger brother had not survived Frank's surprise attack... but the older had. \"No... NO! EZEKIEL! Brother! Answer me!\" He screamed as he tried to shake the dead man awake. \"Answer me brother!\" It was no use. Ezekiel had taken the full force of the truck and his shield had shattered on impact as evidenced by the many shards jutting out from his body at various angles. While that may have been survivible by a member of the Brotherhood, a broken neck and crushed skull certainly were not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time Frank quickly began sprinting back to the motel before the surviving brother noticed him. He had no weapons and was pretty banged up, not to mention up against someone who could apparently somehow survive a full on burning truck collision. \"My little brother... Ezekiel... I WILL AVENGE YOU!\" The robed man screamed furiously as his dead sibling was slowly engulfed in a bright red light and crumbled apart, leaving behind only his own robe. \"Fuck!\" Frank muttered under his breath as he shoved aside a zombie that made a grab for him. \"I have to get past over a dozen zombies to get back inside and that psychopath is right behind me!\" Frank was in a tight spot, but had managed to survive so far... what can he do?</span></div></div>",

To his absolute horror the door of the van slid back open just as the birds made their final descent. It was broken and couldn't be closed ever again.

The diner had been on her way to her destination anyway, and she couldn't bother to pass it up. She had managed to get out of her house safely and was headed in the direction of a safe spot where she would be meeting up with other survivors. Hopefully, well armed and friendly, not that she was in a position to be bargaining. She stuffed the tiny piece of paper into the pocket of her jeans and left the diner, eager to get back together with some humans who were still living.

Betty felt a chill run down her spine as she stepped over it and quickly ran up to the side of the building. Inside see could hear footsteps, people were here!

From what she could tell all the footsteps were coming from the ground floor so she'd have to find a way back down once she got there. The entire factory was falling apart and covered in rust, but it sure beat wandering around on the rainy streets outside. \"I just need to make sure I get a tetanus shot after this is all over...\" Betty said as she leaned against the upstairs door and looked through the window. She didn't think there would be any zombies in here, but it never hurt to be cautious. The walkway was clear and out of the corner of her eye she could see a few moving shadows on the ground floor. \"Thank god, hopefully they'll help me...\" Betty whispered as she slowly opened the door and walked out onto the rickety walkway. She began looking for a way down when a loud explosion sounded from the floor below her and several bodies were flung through the air. \"How'd you like that grenade, you undead pieces of shit?!\" A voice shouted over the enraged growls of about a dozen angry zombies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" Betty cursed as she ran over to get a better view of what caused the explosion. \"Did the zombies break through the wall?!\" She yelled over the sound of machine gun fire. Below her was about 7 or 8 people getting blow away by a man in a hockey mask. \"KILL HIM!!! KILL THAT LITTLE BASTARD!!!!!\" The still living ones shouted as they tried to surround him. \"Oh my god, I've got to do something...\" Betty whispered to avoid alerting the crazed mans attention. \"She quickly began looking around for a set of stairs and ran down the first she could find. By the time she had reached the scene of the massacre, however, all that was left was the lone man reloading his now empty gun. \"Hold it right there, you damn Mimic!\" He growled when he noticed her. \"I'm not letting any of you get away after what you did to my grandfather!\" The gun clicked and the man leveled it with Betty's chest. \"Wait, don't shoot me, please! Why are you doing this?!\" She moaned as she took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took a few steps closer and looked into her eyes from behind the mask. He then lowered his gun once he heard her heartbeat. \"You... you're not one of them... are you?\" He asked in a confused tone as tears began forming in Betty's eyes. \"Why? Why are you here if you're not a Mimic?!\" He then asked in a more upset tone. \"Please... I have no idea what you're talking about... What's a Mimic and why did you kill all those people?\" Betty replied as she backed up against a broken down piece of machinery. \"Those people? You really don't know what a mImic is? God, you must have been hiding somewhere for these past few days. Anyway, those people you saw were all really zombies.

Unfortunately, there's no paycheck here and all of the rest of us have left for the warehouses downtown. We've received word that one warehouse in particular belonged to a gang who ran a chop-shop and we hope to use some spare parts to make us an armored vehicle that can get us out of here. I've made sure to include the directions and address on the back of this paper. I doubt you'd be willing to hike across the city to join us, but I wanted to make sure you knew where we went. Just... whatever you do, stay away from the abandoned factories on Oak street. There's a nest of... things there... they look human, but are zombies as well. They ambushed three guys we sent off to investigate, only one made it back. Betty, if you see something that looks human, but isn't... run! I'm sorry, I know this is dragging on and I'm sure you don't have the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust be careful... and Betty? I'm sorry, we all are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssistant manager Drake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty re-read the letter one last time before turning it over. Sure enough, on the back were instructions on how to get to the warehouses downtown using the safest routes possible. \"Well, I guess I'd better get going... thanks Drake.\" Betty said as she walked back into the downpour outside. She had planned on meeting up with other survivors at the factory... well, that plan was shot to hell now. Or was it? Drake and his buddies had always picked on her and made her the butt of several of their \"practical jokes.\" She liked to think they wouldn't be so petty if her life was on the line, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a chorus of growls sounded off in the distance, the undead drew closer by the second...</span></div></div>",

She cared deeply about other people and hated to hear the sorrow and pity and fear in his voice as he told her about how it had been a normal day for him. Paperwork for Mr. Lyles, the barber shop owner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sometimes took part in free lance offers, and Mr. Lyles had been a long time friend of his uncle. So when he'd been asked through his uncle if he would come down to the shop to look over Mr. Lyles finances he'd been happy to do it. It had been a pretty, lush spring day. Quite beautiful day, as most of them were in Bitterwood. Idealistic seasons and pretty, neat rowed houses and offices had been what attracted Frank to return to the city a year and a half ago. He'd started his accounting career in New York, and though the business was good and the pay was even better. He'd grown tired of the arrogant and mean spirited co workers at the firm for which he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis family had of course, long since accepted him as a homosexual man and that gave him the confidence to embrace that in his daily life at work too. However, his boss and a few others at his job didn't like him if not only for that one reason. He'd been a bit shocked at first that people in such a big city could still be so back woods about him being gay, but they were and they were not shy about showing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't go into detail about the hate that presented itself almost daily at his job from his fellow co workers to Betty though. He could tell she was young and perhaps a bit naive and so he only casually brushed upon this top of out-casted-ness he had felt. He noticed she was watching him closely, even though he wasn't looking directly into her eyes she was in fact never taking hers off of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank went on to tell the girl about his return to Bitterwood and open armed acceptance into the town where he'd been born. Then met back to the point where he'd spend his last normal day here in Mr. Lyles office. It had been a Tuesday, mid afternoon and the shop was never really bustling with customers or activity but there had been a steady low murmur of shop talk to be heard from the outside of the office door that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank had been going about his business, scratching his head at some figures and making mental notes about a few lines of numbers to ask Mr. Lyles about when he'd gotten a chance. Everything seemed perfectly normal and even pleasant until ... the <i>screams</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as though it had been planned to play out that exact way, as soon as the words had left his lips, there was a new set of screaming going on again right outside the office door...</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, she had managed to not land on top of her butcher knife, although she was now bleeding from a skinned knee. \"Oww! Dammit!\" Betty groaned as she quickly got up and rubbed her knee while examining her injury. It wasn't bad, but it sure hurt like hell. A boney hand reached out for her just as she began running down the alley as quickly as she could. Thunder roared overhead as a flash of lightning illuminated the way ahead. Betty turned a corner while trying desperately to avoid stepping in the large puddles or slipping on the wet pavement. It didn't take much for her to keep ahead of the zombies as they were all level one, but she knew that one slip up would give them time to close in on her, especially if she hurt herself again. She was making her way past an overturned dumpster when she ran into her first mayor threat that night, a zombiefied dog. It was a doberman that was missing half of its front leg, which ended in a bloody stump. It had jumped out from behind the dumpster just as Betty tried to make her way past it and knocked the butcher knife from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt attempted to maul her, but with quick reflexes she had managed to grab ahold of the Beast's head and hold it away from her. \"Oh my god! Oh my god!\" She screamed as it tried wrenching its mangled head free. The footsteps of the zombies behind her grew closer and would soon be upon her so Betty braced herself for what she had to do and grabbed the dog's remaining front paw with one of her hands. It was hard to keep it away with only one hand, but Betty was soon able to force it off of her and slam it headfirst into the ground. It began whimpering as its eye tracked her as best it could while hanging out of the socket of its ruined head. Betty had earned herself a few more scrapes in the battle, but was far from dead. She picked up her butcher knife and lopped off what remained of the dog's head in one clean swipe before moving on. Finally, she came to a dead end on the other side of a large apartment building. \"Shit, how could I make such a bone-headed mistake?!\" She growled at herself as she turned to face the approaching hordes. She had only one escape route, an open doorway that led into a darkened room. Just as she was about to run inside, however, she noticed a fire escape above her to her left...</span></div></div>",

Just as she reached out to grab the handle the door behind her burst open with savage force as the undead began to pour into the room. Betty let out a loud yell as she turned the handle... only for it to stop moving just short of opening. Something on the other side was blocking the door and keeping it from moving. \"No! No! God damn it!\" Betty screamed in a panic as she turned around to meet the terrifying swarm of red eyes glaring at her amidst the sea of black. Betty tried running off to the side in an effort to get around them, only to trip over a chair and stumble to the ground as her butcher knife dug deep into her left arm. \"No...\" She moaned softly as the hordes surrounded her. She managed to pull the butcher knife from her arm and kill a few of them, but it wasn't long before her injuries were too great and she succumbed to the pain coursing through her body.

After a moment of steading herself she tried to pulled herself up just as a cold moist hand grabbed ahold of her leg. \"No, dammit! Let go!\" She screamed as she kicked it away and pulled herself the rest of the way up as the undead crowded below her. Without looking back Betty began ascending the fire escape as the zombies tried to climb up after her, knocking each other aside with their hands reaching up vainly for the cold, wet metal. By the time Betty reached the forth floor she came to a blockage that prevented her from going up any further and the zombies below her finally began spilling onto the platform under her while trampling their brethren underfoot. Thinking quickly Betty went back down to the floor below her and climbed into an open window before the zombies could get to her. She jumped down from the inside counter and sat her butcher knife down on the nearby table as she blocked off the window. Once a fairly secure barrier was in place she picked her only weapon back up off the table and made a run for higher ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls were dark and only a few lights were on, but Betty had just enough light to navigate by as she made her way to the top of the building. The final staircase leading to the top floor was closed off by several large pieces of furniture, however, there was a small hole in the ceiling of one of the bedrooms of that floor. Betty took a few minutes to catch her breath before sitting a nearby coffee table on the bed. After she was sure she could make it she carefully tossed her butcher knife through the hole and made a jump for it. The table bounced off the bed and crashed to the floor below her as Betty pulled herself up onto the slowly collapsing floor. A few large chunks of splintered wood fell onto the bed below and Betty quickly backed away as the wood creaked and groaned. She was sweating all over and exhausted, but was now relatively safe. Even a level two zombie wouldn't be able to climb through that hole without a lot of help. \"Now maybe I'll at least be able to get a decent night's sleep before I head out tomorrow.\" Betty said between huffs. \"Now where did my knife land?\" She began looking around as she got up, only to notice she had a new problem to deal with. She could feel something warm running down her inner thigh and quickly began unfastening her jeans to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought she may have actually wet her pants, only to scream as she caught sight of the small blood trail that stained her panties and ran down her leg. \"Oh no, was I cut and didn't notice it in the excitement?!\" She stuttered as she tried desperately to find an injury. Then it hit her. The blood wasn't from a cut or scrape. It was menstrual blood. She was now on her period. \"No, it can't be...\" She groaned as put her jeans back on. \"That isn't supposed to happen for another week...\" She buried her face in her hands and began crying as she collapsed into a nearby chair. \"Can anything else possibly go wrong...?\" She moaned as she listened to the downpour outside. The past few days had seemed to only get worse and worse and now she had to deal with this as well. Betty was unsure just how long she sat in that chair before finally getting up, but it felt like hours. She wiped away her tears and tried to find a bathroom. Luckily, there was one in the room next to her with decently stocked medicine cabinets. Betty smiled faintly as she pulled out a box of tampons that was sitting on a shelf next to a pink razor. \"Finally, its about time something went right... I just hope these are the right size...\" She said as she also grabbed a box of band aids for her knee. Once she had taken care of everything she found a bedroom and took a well-deserved rest.</span></div></div>",

A nightmare she could vaguely recall now had stirred her from her sleep. All that she could remember was a man in a suit smiling wickedly as a fiery red sky burned behind him. \"Jesus, what time is it...?\" She groaned as she got out of bed and headed back into the bathroom to see if she could take a shower. Fortunately, the water was still running and even decently warm, allowing her a brief escape from the madness around her. When she was done with that she wrapped a towel around herself and headed back into the bedroom to check for fresh clothes as the ones she had worn yesterday were still wet from the rain. Among the various clothes in the closet were a small purse and a shoebox filled with home and gardening magazines. Betty changed into a fresh pair of barely fitting panties and a large t-shirt with a bird on it. None of the jeans she found had fit well as they all seemed to belong to an older male who must have had a few weight problems. Thankfully, the man also had quite a collection of belts which made the jeans a much better fit. Once she was dressed Betty went through the purse she had found looking for anything useful. Inside had been a comb, brush, half a pack of cigarettes, a packet of tissues, a bottle of hairspray, and some makeup. Betty laid everything out on the bed and sat there for a few minutes deciding what to keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the tissues and hairspray back inside the purse while leaving everything else on the bed. She then made a quick trip back to the bathroom to fill up the rest of the purse with other useful supplies. Once she was sure she had everything she needed she slipped the purse over her shoulder and stepped back out into the hall to grab her butcher knife. After about ten minutes of searching she noticed something shining in the morning light that peeked through the boarded up window at the end of the hall. She bent down and reached underneath a fallen painting that was propped up against the wall. The feel of a cold metallic blade meant that she had found what she was looking for. With her weapon reclaimed and a bright new morning to great her Betty readied herself to move out. She stepped outside onto the fire escape and looked at the alleyway below her. There were still a few zombies down there, but most of them had given up on her and moved on. Betty was sure she could handle the ones that remained... if they were indeed the only ones down there. It was entirely possible that some had simply moved inside the building, which she would surely encounter on her way down. From the looks of things Betty had two options.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way that Betty would be heading back down there any time soon with only her butcher knife, especially if some might be waiting for her inside the building itself. \"Guess I'll have to find another way down...\" Betty said as she stepped back inside. After all, she hadn't taken the time to explore the entire floor last night and there were still a few rooms that might be worth checking out. Betty walked down the hallway and began checking the rooms one by one. Most were free of corpses and blood, but also supplies. It was as if everyone that had lived here left in a hurry, packing up anything even remotely useful to take with them. When Betty finally came to the last room she crossed her fingers and turned the knob. When the door swung open she let out a gasp of surprise and grabbed ahold of the door frame for support. On the wall was a large triangle spray-painted inside a square with an arrow next to it pointing towards the roof. More importantly then that, there was a massive hole in the ceiling with a ladder leading up onto the roof. Betty quickly closed the door behind her and walked slowly across the waterlogged carpet to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put one hand on the gleaming metal and made sure it was steady before heading on up. It was slippery, but at least she didn't fall. Up on top of the roof were a couple of sleeping bags and an empty cooler along with one of the most bizarre things Betty had ever seen. On the edge of the building was a makeshift bridge that connected this building with the next. It didn't look very sturdy or even safe (most of it appeared to be made from filling cabinets and duct tape) but it was also the only way down aside from the fire escape. \"What... were they thinking...?\" Betty groaned as she tested the odd structure with her foot. It creaked a bit, but held in place. With a deep breath Betty broke into a quick run across it and jumped down onto the second building just as a large piece of the bridge came loose and fell to the ground. \"Jeez, rickety piece of crap...\" She said as she walked over to a door located on the far side of the building. To her surprise it was locked, as she found out when she attempted to turn the knob. \"Oh no, shit... shit, open up!\" She called as she banged on the door with her fist. Amazingly a voice called back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who's out there?\" A young male voice asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank god! Another human!\" Betty called out cheerfully as she heard the man climb up the inside stairs towards the door. \"A-are you... infected? Did they... bite you?\" He called out as he leaned against the inside of the door. \"Infected?\" Betty asked in puzzled tone of voice. \"Mister... I don't think an infection did all of this... there are zombies out here who have strange powers and abilities. Its... I can't believe I'm saying this... its almost supernatural... like they're demonic in nature or something...\" Upon hearing this the man banged his fist into the door, startling Betty. \"Who the hell are you trying to fool?! You think I'd buy that?! You're infected, ain't you?\" He growled in a paranoid tone of voice. \"No!\" Betty protested desperately. \"I've been bitten by those things, yeah, and I've even been punched and scratched by them. Its been almost an entire week since I first encountered them and I don't have any sort of symptoms. Whatever this is, it can't be passed on simply through contact. The only people I've seen turn were the ones who were actually killed...\" In a rage the man on the other side of the door began banging it even louder. \"Liar! LIAR! I've seen every zombie movie ever made and I know you're lying! You must be a carrier! That's why you've been okay so long!\" Things seem to be getting worse by the minute... how will Betty get out of this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to kill you before you infect me...\" Betty immediately moved away from the door and took a step back. \"What...?!\" She yelled as she heard the man begin digging through his supplies. \"You want to kill me?! What the hell is wrong with you... can't you see that this isn't an infection?!\" The man didn't bother responding and soon began making his way back up the stairs. \"No...\" Betty thought to herself as she backed further way from the door. \"I can't make it back to the other building... if he has a gun I'm as good as dead...!\" The man paused for a moment as he opened each of the locks. Then the door swung open and Betty finally got a look at him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to be in his early twenties and had a short beard along with a mustache. He was wearing a bloodied shirt and pants. On his exposed forearms were many scratches and bruises along with a few on his face. In his hands were a bloody fire axe that had a bit of dried gore on the blade. \"Im sorry...\" He said in a soft voice. \"But I can't let you infect me like my wife and daughter tried to...\" He began moving closer as he spoke, his expression never changing as he closed in on the helpless girl in front of him. \"I don't like this... but it must be done to insure my survival... I had to leave friends and family behind to die when this whole thing happened... What's the death of one more stranger if I get to live?\" Betty would have screamed, but her throat seemed to have gone dry as she slowly backed towards the edge of the building. \"Oh god... oh god... think, think of something!\" She yelled out in her head. She remembered the butcher knife in her left hand just as her foot connected with the side of the building. Murder and violence had always been the last things on Betty's mind, however in this situation it seemed she would have no choice. \"Don't... please... don't hurt me...\" She whispered through tears as the crazed man raised his axe to swing, \"I... I regret it...\" The man choked out as he steadied the axe. Betty tightened her grip on her own weapon and prayed silently for him to come to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleam of sunlight reflected off the blade as it was swung into its victim, sending blood flying through the air. \"Wha? No..\" A voice mumbled as one of the weapons fell to the ground. A look of utter horror spread across Betty's face when she realized what had happened. A deep gash glittered in the midmorning light as fresh blood poured from the wound. The man stumbled forward moaning as the pain from his chest reached his brain. He reached out to Betty as if he wanted to ask for help, only to trip over his fallen axe. Before Betty could even register what had happened a terrified scream filled the air as the man tumbled off the side to his death. Betty loosened her grip on the now blood-coated butcher knife and slumped to the ground as she slowly realized what had happened. She had killed him... not directly, but that injury she had inflicted on him would have been fatal even if he hadn't fallen. She had willingly assaulted another person, in self defense yes, but she had stuck to kill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty didn't know what horrified her more, the fact that she had to take a life to survive... or the fact that she was okay with it...</span></div></div>",

She managed to stand back up, although she was shaking so badly she had trouble walking. With her bloodied weapon in hand she slowly made her way over to the open door and grabbed ahold of it to support herself. A horrible smell crossed her nose as she set foot on the first step causing her to throw up on the nearby wall. \"Oh, oh god... what is that?\" She groaned as she wiped her mouth off with a tissue and closed the door behind her. As she made her way down the stairs the smell grew slightly stronger, which forced Betty to cover her mouth and nose with her free hand. At the bottom of the stairs was another doorway with blood smeared on the nearby wall leading inside. Betty raised her butcher knife and peeked around the corner into the dimly lit room. What she saw made her throw up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on a table next to a curtain was the mangled body of a highly decomposed corpse. She looked to have been about 30 years old and was stripped to her underwear. The entirety of her exposed flesh was covered in scrapes, cuts, and lacerations. Her face had a twisted mix of fear and panic painted upon it as she died, which made it seem like she was staring directly at Betty in some kind of dazed stupor. Her stomach had been carved open and was held open by several odd tools. A bloodied syringe and other various surgical instruments were sitting on a tray next to her. She even had an I.V. stuck in her arm, not that it seemed to have done any good. Perhaps the most disturbing thing was her hands... which were covered in blood with bits of flesh underneath the fingernails...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty turned away and pulled the curtain next to the body the rest of the way closed as she walked towards the door, trying her best to ignore the charts and graphs hanging on the wall covered in various insane graffiti. Whatever horrors laid beyond it she would rather not see. The front door was locked, but since it was from the inside Betty had no trouble opening it. \"My god... that was horrible...\" She choked out as she closed the door and stumbled out into an abandoned hallway. There were several more rooms lining both sides of the long hallway, ending in a set of stairs that led down at the very end. Checking the rooms before leaving was probably a good idea... but Betty was afraid she would come across another horror show like the room she just left... What should she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty was tempted to check the surrounding rooms for supplies, but the crippling fear of what she might find kept her moving towards the stairs. There was no way she would be prepared to deal with another encounter like the room she had just left. \"I have to... keep going... I have to get... out of the city...\" Betty said to herself as she looked down to make sure it was safe. Once she had recovered her nerve Betty took the first steps leading to her freedom outside. After getting back on the streets she would have a lot more maneuverability. Things went smoothly at first... then she came across a corpse slumped against the wall right above the stairway that led to the first floor. Betty almost screamed when her eyes fell upon him, but somehow she managed to keep her voice down even as she walked closer. The man wore ragged clothing that was torn in places and was otherwise unkempt, yet he was very handsome. A single bullet hole underneath his short blonde hair had been the cause of his death. In his hand was a 9mm handgun and in his coat pocket was a piece of paper, a suicide note. Betty took it out and began reading it slowly, unable to keep from tearing up as she went along:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my dearest Brittany, I'm sorry. They've cornered me and trapped me inside this building. I tried to get to higher ground, but some insane fuck won't let me inside. Said something about zombie movies and an infection, crazy bastard. I heard screaming come from his room today, a little girl. I demanded he let me in, that I'd break down the damn door if I had to, but he just taunted me. The door must have been reinforced somehow, he must have moved something in front of it... or even sealed it off. I'm sorry my love, but I haven't had any food or water in almost three days... and I just can't take the sounds of that man or those fucking things outside anymore. If you find this, for god's sake, don't go upstairs, get out as fast as you can! Goodbye baby, take care of the kids and tell them I love them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Richard <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty crumpled up the note and put it in her pocket. \"Goddamn it... why'd this have to happen... this fucking zombie apocalypse...\" She picked up his gun and checked to see if it had any rounds left. Five bullets. Five shots. She put her new weapon into her purse and continued to the ground floor. The entire downstairs lobby was a complete mess and more then a little creepy with thin beams of sunlight slithering in through the boarded up windows. \"At least there isn't any...\" Betty said as she looked around, unable to finish the sentence. She walked over to the front door, which was barricaded by several large objects, including a massive sofa. \"Damn... there is no way I'll be able to move all this...\" Betty groaned as she turned her attention to the front desk. \"May as well look for stuff I can use... then hopefully I'll be able to find a way out of here...\" It was a little difficult to search at first thanks to the darkness... fortunately, there was a working heavy duty flashlight hidden behind an abandoned stack of magazines. The soft glow illuminated the room perfectly and made looting the place much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty was satisfied when she had recovered a pack of batteries for the flashlight along with a case of shotgun shells and 2 unopened bottles of flavored water. Betty took a long drink from the first bottle and shown the flashlight around the room, looking for alternate pathways. There were three doors in the room apart from the main entrance. One had merely led to an empty janitors closet, however, the other two were much more useful. One went down a hallway to a backdoor that led to the alleyway Betty had escaped from the night before. The other led to a bathroom... which had an opened and unbarred window that looked like it would lead to the streets outside. The sounds of movement could still be heard, although there was no sure way to tell where it was coming from. As much as she hated it, Betty would have to gamble her safety on a guess if she wanted to leave here alive...</span></div></div>",

Betty walked into the small bathroom and took out her gun, ready to use it if need be. She quickly gathered up her courage and peeked out through the large frame into the street. The rain from the previous night had left puddles of muddy water everywhere, but there wasn't a single zombie in sight. \"I'll just have to be careful to avoid the puddles and I'll be fine...\" Betty said, trying desperately to reassure herself. With a deep breath she climbed up onto the toilet and sucked in her belly. It was a tight fit, but the window was just large enough to accommodate her as she dropped down onto the sidewalk outside. She hadn't made much noise in her exit and didn't drop her gun, although she did skin one of her elbows. \"Ow! Ow! Ow! Dammit!\" She stuttered as she got back on her feet and took cover behind a nearby truck. She listened for a few seconds and didn't make a sound. Once she was sure nothing had noticed her she got back up and began walking hurriedly down the street with her eyes peeled for the undead. After a few minutes she came to a familiar row of restaurants off to the side of the road. Needless to say, she was eager to get a bite to eat and rest a moment before making her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief and fleeting memory of her mother and father taking her to the nearby McDonalds flashed through her mind. It had been her 5th birthday and she was finally old enough to explore the vast playplace by herself. Before long she had gotten lost and began crying... it had been once of the scariest moments of her childhood. The last thing she remembered as she opened the front door was her mothers calm voice telling her it would be okay as she embraced her in a warm hug. \"Mommy... daddy...\" Betty whispered as fresh tears began filling her eyes. It took all of her strength just to keep from breaking down as she approached the counter and caught the first glimpse of the playplace she had enjoyed so much as a child. As Betty climbed over the counter more memories came flooding back. The smiling cashier who had worked there. The children laughing as their parents watched them play. The reality of the establishment she now stood in was truly melancholy. Betty wiped the tears from her face as she began her search for something to eat, completely unaware of the glowing red eyes that had watched her every move since she had come in...</span></div></div>",

She had expected a paycheck, instead she got a key to the diner's wine cellar in the basement. \"What the fuck is this?!\" Betty groaned as she wadded up the envelope into a ball and threw it against the wall. She looked back down at the key in her hand and let out a sigh. \"Maybe, they have something in the basement for me...\" She walked out into the diners back hallway and stood silently before the door to the basement. She had always hated going down there... even it the daylight it was creepy as hell. She took a deep breath and turned the key. The lock clicked open and she turned the handle slowly as it creaked all the way open. She felt around for the light switch on the wall and flipped it when she found it. The dark stairway before her was then illuminated with a bright and eerie glow that came from the overhead light on the ceiling below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down slowly and made sure to keep her eyes peeled for any sort of movement. When she reached the bottom without any problems she began to lose some of the fear that had been building up inside her as soon as she climbed down the first few steps. It was silent and peaceful down here... nothing to be afraid of, right? Then she turned around. A screamed escaped her lips as she fell to the cold, hard floor. Upon the wall opposite of her were no less then a dozen corpses propped up against the wall in a line. Some were fairly fresh, only a day or two old, but some were almost a week old and heavily decayed. A lone spider crawled out from beneath ones eye and skittered down the side of his pale cheek. None of them moved, indeed none of them were undead, but the sight was the most horrifying thing Betty had seen in her entire life. Tears began to form in her eyes as she crawled away slowly and backed up against the wall. Apparently, the survivors had stored their dead down here before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Betty was able to get back up on her feet and walked a bit closer to get a better look at the corpses. She recognized three of them as employees of the diner like herself, but the rest were people she had never seen before. Each one of them had a hole in their foreheads, wounds made by a small caliber gun. Betty breathed out a sign of relief when she realized that they wouldn't be getting back up. She wiped away the remaining tears in her eyes and walked over to a wine rack that caught her attention. There was a note attached to a bottle of Pinot Noir that was barely legible in the dim light. It informed anyone who might be reading it to stay away from the factories on Oak Street, but it didn't say why...</span></div></div>",

It was empty and a had a few dried bloodstains on the side, but it didn't have any big holes and was clean on the inside, which would make it a great mobile storage container. The last thing she did before heading back up the stairs was grab a few bottles of expensive champagne and stuff them inside the duffel bag along with a few clean rags. Betty had never drunk before and wasn't about to start now, but she knew that some high quality booze would make a good trade or bribe if she ran into any other survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling her nerves for what was to come she grabbed a knife from the kitchen and headed back out into the streets. It was raining fairly heavily now and small trails of water poured along the streets towards the storm drains as various undead shambled about. Betty knew she wouldn't last very long if she tried to make her way home with the weather like this, one bad slip and she could be cornered. These ghoulish monsters weren't too fast or smart, but there were enough of them to catch a lone survivor easily enough even if they were very careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find a place to stay and rest for the night.\" Betty whispered to herself as she closed the door to the diner and ran across the street to a vacant lot sandwiched between two condemned buildings. A lone zombie stirred near the brick wall of one of the buildings next to a pile of trash and let out a soft growl. He was immobile thanks to a survivor kneecapping him with a rifle some days beforehand, though he still managed to give poor Betty a fright as he flailed around on his hobbled legs. With a small grunt she kicked his head back against the wall, painting a oozing red stain where his head had connected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zombie groaned as it stirred about on the ground, its glowing red eyes fixed on her as she ran out of the lot onto the next street without looking back. \"A place to rest for the night... somewhere safe...\" she chanted as she took cover behind a car as a large dog ran down the street after a cat. She couldn't tell if the dog was undead or not, but wasn't in a hurry to find out either. As the cat made its escape through an open window Betty ran out of cover and continued onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the buildings she ran past had been boarded up or stained with blood, not exactly ideal hiding spots. Finally, she came to a large intersection with few zombies traveling through it and decided she would find a secure place here to spend the night. Across the street was a gas station, abandoned though it still had electricity. It would be a good spot to rest if Betty could find a way to block the main door. Alternatively, on the opposite streets were a small apartment building and a local pizza place. They would both make good hiding spots as well if she could barricade them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one should Betty choose?</span></div></div>",

The undead had chased her here the day before and she narrowly managed to escape them. She had also managed to shove the teachers and students desks over the door. She got up and took a look out the window. The zombies were still there looking around for a living creture to kill. At least two of them were Stalkers and there was also a Carrier crawling on the side of the building across from her. She ducked back down before any of them noticed her and crawled slowly back to the corner of the room. Why had this happened? Is the whole world like this? Was she going to die? Betty tried to think of something to get her mind off of her current situation, but she was too scared to think of anything else. Somehow she had managed to hold on to her spatula from work and bring it with her. She woundered if it would even be any help. In anger and dispair Betty threw the spatula agenst the wall. Suddenly the noise outside grew, and the zombies started to draw closer to the room she was in. She held her breath and didn't move, hopefully they wouldn't find her. She heard the sound of wings moving outside and drawing closer towards her. They must know where she is! She got up from the floor and made her way over towards the door slowly and quietly. Along the way she picked up her spatula, it won't be much help, but at least she'll have some type of wepion. She carefuly started moving aside the desks when she heard something loud behind her. She looked back at the window and couldn't help but scream. The Carrier was pressed up agenst the glass window, its red eyes glowing and its mouth wide open growling. Crawling along its body were several small Beasts, mostly chipmunks and rats, along with a few lizards and even a turtle. No sooner had Betty screamed then the Carrier broke through the window and landed on the floor mere feet away from her. The small Beasts climbed off of the carrier and started to run towards her. Betty acted quickly and...</span></div></div>",

The beasts were about to bite into her legs when she slamed the desk in her hands down onto them as hard as she could, causing them to make sickening noises as they were crushed like grapes. Betty was disgusted at the sight, but knew she had to hurry up if she wanted to get away. She picked up the 2nd desk and threw it at the Carrier that was now crawling at her at a fast pace. The desk only managed to graze its shoulder, but it was enough to slow it down and allow Betty to grab the final obstruction to her freedom. By now the remaining beasts were starting to move around the desk that had crushed their friends. Betty decided to ignore them for the moment and tossed the last desk at the Carrier. Her aim was much better this time and the Carrier took a sharp hit to the face. Betty knew that it wasn't enough to kill it, but had no time to finish it off. She opened the door and stumbled out into the hall just as a zombie rat made a swipe at her leg. She slamed the door behind her, cutting a few of the Beasts in half, and ran down the hall as fast as she could. Up ahead of her was the stairway that led to the main hallway downstairs, the door to the school library, and the boys/girls restrooms. Where should she go?</span></div></div>",

After thinking for a minute Betty decided to ignore the exit for now. Even if it was unlocked, where would she go? The zombies had taken over everywhere else and she didn't even have a decent weapon. Walking outside right now would be suicide... and it wouldn't be painless. Betty walked down the hallway making sure to keep an eye out for any zombies that might be hiding. The lighting wasn't too bad, but there were several dark areas where a zombie could hide while waiting for something that was still living to pass by. Betty's stomach growled, the last thing Betty had eaten was a burger and fries... three days ago. She wanted nothing more then to raid the cafeteria for food, yet at the same time felt as if she should check the assembly room. If anyone else was alive, chances are they would have hidden in there.

She hated the idea of being helpless and alone in this school, being hungry too was something she couldn't stand. She passed the assembly room without a second glance and took a good long look at the school lunchroom. It was vast and empty, but provided little cover if a zombie were to find its way inside. The tables were covered in blood and Betty saw what she thought was a severed arm sitting on a chair on the far side of the room. \"Guess I better get moving...\" She said meekly. \"Its better I get some food sooner rather then later.\" Walking as quietly as she could Betty made her way past the gorey scene. She hadn't noticed before that some of the bloodstains looked like handprints and footprints, but up close their eerieness was unmistakable. Betty tried to ignore all the horrible thoughts that entered her mind with little success. By the time she had made it the kitchen doorway she was shaking. She walked inside without even bothering to check for zombies, thankful that she had at least made here without any trouble. Upon checking the back room she found a few boxes full of snack foods and a case of grape soda. Grape wasn't her favorite flavor, but right now it tasted better then anything she had ever drunk before. After a few minutes of eating snack cakes and chips she got back to her feet feeling much better then before. She was able to fit two bags of chips and some small snack cakes in her pockets along with one can of soda. She still had her spatula, which was soon joined with a small cutting knife that had been on the floor next to the boxes. Not much, but still better then before.

On the plus side however, nothing inside moved or made any noise, there were no visible zombies. Betty opened the door slowly and walked inside, careful not to make any loud noise. The inside was pretty creepy if not outright scary. Before this horrible nightmare had begun this would've been one of the nicest places in the whole school.

She was screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, it was just eerie silence. By now, if it was zombie, it would of clawed her face after making that pathetic threat. Soon enough, a pair of hands had gone up. One of which was holding a gun, which he or she had quickly dropped, in surrender. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe they really didn't like spatulas.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't convinced that whatever \"it\" was, was human. Several students were turned into mimics and attempted to trick her. Yet again, these were the students who ran naked through the cafateria so they were easily out-smarted. She wouldn't think twice before going anymore near another human being after the apocalypse. It would be just like every other average day, but with zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt more brave as she edged towards the pair of hands. If this was another airheaded mimic, then she could just easily throw a playboy magazine and make a run for it. \"Come on. Get up and show me your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure slowly stood up. It was blonde-haired man wearing a business shirt and a pair of pleats. On his back was an array of guns hanging from his belt and a baseball bat. Turning around, she saw a face that she had recognized. Instantly, Betty had dropped her spatula.\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Frank!?\" shock had come across the Frank Hugh's face. In the same second, it had turned into a widespreaded grin. That he was able to find his favorite niece through the hordes of zombies seemed impossible, but she was right there. \"Betty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly ran towards him and tackled him into a warm embrace. The sound of his heart beat was reassuring enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, you gotta be careful during times like these. I was this close smashing a baseball bat into your skull!\" he said, still a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too, uncle Frank.\" after refraining from the hug, she took a big long look at here uncle. It was strange to see her calm well-mannered accountant of an uncle suddenly go all Rambo. Rips and bloodstains were all over his shirt. He kept guns around his belt. There was a bullet hole through one of the lenses in his glasses. \"Sorry for threatening to gut you with a spatula.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. I just thought it was kinda sad that that was the best weapon you had.\" he grabbed the handgun from his belt and a survival knife. \"There. You have now been un-pathetic-erized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving an actual weapon in her hands felt rather uncomfortable, but she could get used to it. \"Thanks.\" she kept the survival knife in her pocket and held tightly to the handgun. \"What are you doing here anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced. \"As you can tell, we've got a huge infestation problem with zombies. I was worried about your safety and I expected that you were stuck here in the highschool of bat-shitery. And I was able to find you!\" he took a look of his surroundings. \"And . . . Now I don't know how to get out.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty quickly answered out of nowhere. \"Down the hall, to the right, and pass the gym there's an emergency exit.\" Frank thought about the option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I passed by that gym area, and it was infested with vampires and level twos. Might be a bit too risky.\" Betty searched her brain for any more routes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's another way past the office. But it's way harder to find. The only thing it has is a bunch of level ones hanging around.\" Frank thought about his two options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say we . . . \u00a0\u00a0</span></div></div>",

When they came to the door they checked the window to make sure it was clear. No zombies, not even any blood. Frank motioned for Betty to follow behind him as he opened the door quietly and walked inside. The hallway passed over the gym and cafeteria and led to a door that would take the both of them to the top of the bleachers inside the gym. Once they were there they could walk down to the door and take another hallway to the exit. It would be easy, hopefully. When they were about hallway through the hall Frank decided to look out one of the windows that overlooked the cafeteria and asked Betty to check a window overlooking the gym. After surveying the cafeteria below him for a few seconds Frank noticed some zombies near one of the folding tables, two level ones and some naked teenager with no head, clearly a Mimic. \"Like that's going to fool anyone...\" Frank said as he turned towards Betty. \"How are things on your side?\" She didn't answer. When he walked over and looked out the window himself he saw why. The entire gym looked like the killing floor of a meat processing plant. Bodies (and body parts) were laying all across the floor, some in piles and some by themselves. Blood red may as well have been the new school color as it was covering the floor and walls like a fresh coat of paint. This was all topped off with several level two's, a few level ones and worst of all, a nest of Vampires who were eagerly \"cleaning up\" the blood that had stained the massive room so throughly. \"Jesus...\" Betty whispered once she was able to speak again. Frank put a hand on her shoulder and turned her away. \"We should get going...\" He said as they moved forward. Soon they came to the door that led to bleachers inside the gym. \"I don't think those zombies will just let us out of here, we'll need to fight at least a dozen or so of them.\" Frank said as he took out a another handgun. \"You should keep that survival knife in your pocket unless you absolutely need it. Use this instead, it'll be better if you use long-range weapons.\" Betty took the second handgun and gave her uncle a confused look. \"Wait, if I use both of your handguns what will you use?\" Frank just smiled and held up his bat. \"I have more then just two handguns, but I'd like to use this and it requires both my hands to use it to maximum effect.\" Still confused, Betty asked Frank another question. \"But didn't you say long range would be better?\" Betty said as she held up her two handguns. \"Yeah, but one of us needs to do melee in case they get too close and you need to learn how to use a gun, plus I'm stronger then you so I'll be able to use this bat better.\" Frank replied. Betty did need to learn to use a gun, but the real reason Frank wanted to cover the melee angle was for Betty's safety. He would have to be a lot closer to the zombies and didn't want to put Betty in that kind of danger. \"Alright, I'm ready uncle Frank!\" Betty said as Frank put a hand on the door. \"Good, just remember to only fire when you have a clear shot and be careful not to slip in the puddles of blood. Now lets Go!\" Frank yelled as he slung the door open.</span></div></div>",

Maybe he was deeply into the whole Rambo persona that he surprisingly enjoyed. Maybe he sought to impress his niece with his new found bravery. Either ways, he immediately regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the vampire's slightly pointed ears twitched, sensing a newer, fresher prey. It took a few good whiffs into the air, amazingly able to smell the dry stench of blood, not too far away. It's head jerked quickly to the side, tilting a bit upwards. In sight was a tallish blonde man, eyes wide open and mumbling what seemed like swearing. From behind him was another figure, standing safely behind the man, doing what seemed like smacking her forehead with her palm. Details didn't matter all that much. The need to satisfy its never-ending hunger did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank watched as one vampires crouched down, letting out a short calling screech. The second it had rang out, every zombie surrounding the area looked directly towards him, baring their claws in anticipation. About every one of them, except the brain dead 1's, kept that horrifying grin on their faces as they got ready to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seemed like a very good time to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, run!\" he yelled out, breaking off from his initial shock. As soon as Frank took off, Betty followed after him with no time to loose. She managed to keep a weary eye on the crowd of ravaging zombies, coming towards them all too quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the short while, Frank was able to simply push out the wandering level ones, not coming across that much as a threat. Eventually, from the crowd of 1\u2019s in front of him emerged one the vampires, clawing towards him. If there was one instinct that the zombie apocalypse has thought him that he loved most, was the need to smash just about anything that moved. Before the vampire could outreach its claws, Frank already had his bat swinging, aiming towards the vampire in a blur. All that came next was a deafening crack and the major splatter of blood and what seemed like brain matter. Originally, Frank would of cringed at this and immediately head for the showers. When both his and Betty\u2019s life was in danger, it would have to wait. He simply ran onwards, rubbing away some of the few specklets that had landed on his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Betty continued to follow her uncle, holding onto the handguns given to her in an intense grip as her heart pounded as quick as ever. She watched as he desperately battered down each and every zombie that had dared cross them. Even though Frank was able to rid of the oncoming zombies ahead of them, he wasn\u2019t able to cover the ones coming at them from the side or behind. This worried her, noticing how they all seemed to be getting closer. One of the level 2\u2019s were getting awfully close, treading just a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank quickly glanced back, only managing to let a out few words. \u201cJust shoot-\u201d he was cut off as he smashed his bat into one the bigger vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty raised one the guns towards the zombie, gripping as tight as possible. She tried to rid all of her fears of violence and harming another being. This \u201cthing\u201d was no longer human. It no longer had a pulse, or a soul. Repeating this thought in her mind, her finger had let down. She heard a loud boom travel to her ear, feeling as though she had just released lightning. After stumbling a bit, she found the one zombie blown completely off its feet, landing onto the ground, emotionless.  She also noticed a few vampires that were falling back, changing course, and actually going for the blood of one of their fallen comrades. This had given her an idea.<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Frank, try aiming more towards the level 2\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he responded, beating down one slightly moving vampire laying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it!\u201d she yelled out, plowing another bullet into a level two, letting a few more vampires wander off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was surprised by his niece\u2019s sudden harshness. Not wanting to argue, he kicked away the nearest vampire, landing a deadly blow to the head of a level two. At the smell of more strong blood, some of the nearby vampires began to ignore him, lunging towards the new dead body, fighting amongst themselves for a slab of flesh. Sickening, yet highly useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked rather well for the while they were running, noticing how more vampires ignored them to feed on the other dead zombies. By the time they had made it to the door, they had already rid themselves entirely of zombies, letting the vampires simply fight amongst themselves. For the short time, they looked back, noticing the trail of dead zombies, all with a cracked skull or bullet hole. Nearby they saw there were still at least 25 vampires feeding upon them. Betty looked towards Frank, as he took out some sort of purple tube-shaped grenade. Only slightly did she catch a label on it, something about a man named Gary Wilson. He also took out a match, silently asking her if she wanted him to finally rid them all off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \u201cDo it. I never liked this place anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, lighting the small tube on fire as he tossed it towards the middle of the gym. After a few seconds of running away from the building did they hear an explosion and the sound of several screeches. </span></div></div>",

He replied in a serious tone: \"We're going to my car, I left it in the parking lot.\" Betty was surprised to hear that. The only car her uncle owned that she knew of was an older model he used to drive to work. Definitely not something she expected to still be in use in the zombie infested hellhole the world had become. For a moment, Betty considered asking Frank if he was indeed referring to wimpy old car, but decided she would find out soon enough and instead decided to ask something else. \"Okay then, where did you get that thing you threw at those Vampires back there?\" Frank let out a chuckle. \"Oh, you mean that anti-son-of-a-bitch bomb? I got those from a man I met, a doctor, named Gary. I helped him clear away some Swimmers down by the river and he tossed me a few. Said the stuff was highly flammable and prone to exploding in intense heat. We didn't get a chance to talk very long, but he said he got the stuff from these things called Slimers, zombies who spit slime, obviously. You have to watch out for them though, they also spit red acid and blue sticky slime.\" Betty hadn't encountered any Slimers yet, and was very thankful for it. The Mimics she had learned how to handle early on, and weren't a major threat. Something that shot deadly slime at you, on the other hand, was something she doubted she could handle by herself. \"Wow, that's amazing... say what happened to Gary?\" Frank was silent for a moment before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know.\" He finally said. \"Me and Gary were separated when a group of zombie dogs chased us into a nearby building. By the time I lost them Gary was nowhere to be found. We had run in opposite directions so I sure we just lost track of each other, but...\" Frank trailed off as he and his niece came to the school parking lot. \"I'm sure he made it out okay.\" Betty said as she put a hand on her uncles shoulder. \"Me too.\" He said with a smile. \"Anyway, we need to get going, my car is parked over there.\" The car Frank pointed to was indeed the one Betty had thought it was, only with a few small changes. The wheels were reinforced, the front grill had a row of spikes running across it, and thick sheets of metal helped cover and coat the car with added protection. \"Whoa...!\" Betty gasped as she got a good look at the car. \"When did you get all of this?!\" Frank merely grinned as he got in and started it up. \"Oh? I guy I met fixed it up for me, but we can talk about that later. Get in and let's get out of here.\" Betty nodded and got in on the passengers side. The two soon left the school in the distance and began moving along the cities empty streets. \"Uncle Frank, I have another question...\" Betty said as she looked out her window at the destruction around her. \"Sure, what is it?\" Frank replied cheerfully. Betty took a deep breath and asked...</span></div></div>",

But, before we can do that we have a few stops to make.\" Frank reached below his seat and pulled out a sheet of paper. It was about twice the size of a piece of printer paper and a highly detailed map of the city. Frank handed it to Betty to look at and continued explaining their escape plan. \"Back when this all started I met up with a group of other survivors in an abandoned church. One of them was a pilot who had escaped from the airport while it was being overrun. He said he could fly us all out, but we would need supplies. The place was swarming with zombies when he left and it could still have plenty of them hanging around when we get there. We decided it was best to split up for a few days, with a plan to gather what we could and met back at the church within a weeks time. Once we've all come back we'll help get the pilot to one of the planes and hopefully he'll fly us all out of here.\" Betty felt a little uneasy at hearing this, she had never flown before and with all the zombies attacking them while they tried to get away it made the situation seem even worse. She tried to get her mind off of it as she looked over the map. Several locations were marked in red ink, those must be the stops they had to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of reading the car stopped and Frank opened his door. Betty set the map down between the seats and followed her uncle outside, making sure to grab her handguns along the way. \"This our first stop, uncle Frank?\" Betty asked as she joined him next to the front door of the cities history museum. \"Yeah, I heard this place was mostly untouched when people were trying to escape the initial outbreak of zombies. Should be a pretty good place to loot. You still got your knife and handguns?\" Betty held up her hands to confirm that she did. \"Good, here's some more ammo for them. Make sure you keep them reloaded.\" He tossed her a small case of handgun bullets as he opened the doors and peered inside. It was empty except for a level one shuffling down the entrance hallway. Frank closed the door back and turned to Betty. \"I hate to say this, but we're gonna have to split up to cover more ground. After half an hour we can meet back here. Think you can handle it?\" Betty thought for a moment and shook her head yes. \"Alright, I know you'll be strong. Let's hurry up and get what we need.\" No sooner had Frank said these words then he disappeared behind the large door with Betty following close behind.</span></div></div>",

Betty had decided to take a stealth approach with her knife and save ammo, something told her she'd need it later. She had made it down two hallways and successfully brought down two level one zombies by sneaking up on them. She was more used to fighting now and wasn't quite as squeamish as she had been when she took shelter in the school. Along her way to the north exhibit hall she had seen a large R spray painted inside a circle on the wall. She didn't know what it meant, but decided it would probably be worth checking out. She walked into a huge display room that was decorated with wondrous artifacts and valuables from the far east. Betty felt as if she had actually stepped into feudal japan as she looked about. Everything from full suits of armor to expensive-looking vases lined the walls. In the far corner was a lone trash can with the same R symbol as she'd see in the hallway. \"Just a trash can?\" Betty said to herself, confused. \"Am I supposed to look inside it or something...\" She removed the top and found to her surprise that it wasn't full of garbage. She pulled out a backpack and opened its main zipper to find 2 bottles of water and a lighter. In the pockets she found some notes on the zombies and a few pens and pencils. \"Wow, I'll have to show uncle Frank these!\" She said gleefully as she put the backpack on. \"Its a little small, but at least its not uncomfortable.\" She was about to move on when something caught her eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to a display case that sat next to the door she had just come through. She must have not seen it on her way in and almost missed it, which would have been regrettable considering what was inside. Through the clear glass sat a sword in a sheath that was laying on a soft red pillow. Right below it was a small card that detailed its back story. \"This sword once belonged to Miyamoto Musashi, a japanese samurai who...\" Betty stopped reading for a moment. \"Wait, I've heard that name before in history class. He was one of the greatest warriors of all time!\" She looked back down at the glass case again. \"Should I take it?\" She thought for a moment. Surely taking the sword would set off some sort of alarm... unless it had already gone off. She HAD seen several broken cases on the way here, so its possible taking the sword wouldn't do anything. Betty crossed her fingers as she brought her pistol down on the glass as hard as she could.</span></div></div>",

She heard a large bark, an infected dog started to run towards her but she took the sword and sliced it's head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared in disbelief at what she did, But quickly regained her senses. She looked towards her uncles car, but he wasn't there. In fact... Frank was nowhere to be seen! She panicked and ran away as more zombies surrounded her location. Up ahead was a subway entrance, maybe she could escape them inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany trains were on fire and flipped around, dead zombies and body bags were everywhere. Reading the wall she saw many messages. One caught her attention: \"THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RESCUE US. - JACK\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty didn't believe it and continued towards the subway's exit, Along the way she found a suitcase full of pistols and money on a bench. She took a pistol and got out of the subway's exit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large boom came from the other side of the town... they were bombing the city! After a few minutes, the jets didn't bomb her location. She hopped into a car and. amazingly, managed to hot wired it. \"I hope I know how to drive....\" She muttered as the car's engine started.

A survivor saw her from a watch-tower and aimed his rifle at her as she got out of her car. \"I'm not infected!\" She shouted to him. He pressed a button and the gates opened. She went in and saw that there were many people here. There was a dead Deathtouch lying against many bodies and many dead zombies. \"Welcome to Safe Point City.\" Said someone behind her. \"My name is Jack, nice to meet you.\" He smiled. \"Jack? Are you the one who wrote the writing on the wall in the subway?\" She asked. \"Yes, It was me.\" Jack replied. After chatting with her,Jack brought her into a house and gave her a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be your house from now on.\" He told Betty, she nodded and he left. \"This fort won't hold out much longer, the barricades are broken...\" She inspected the things outside from the window, when a large Deathtouch came. \"FUCK NO!!!\" Yelled people outside as they shot the Deathtouch. \"THIS IS THE MOTHER FUCKING 5TH TIME!!!\" Another one yelled. Jack opened the door and threw her an AK-47. \"Come out and help us!\" He shouted. Betty ran out and shot the Deathtouch from a far distance. The deathtouch started to break the barricade as it summoned many hordes of zombies with its anguished yell. The deathtouch came in after a short while and went on a rampage. He grabbed two people and ate their limbs out and swallowed them whole. He climbed onto the watch-tower and bit the person's head off and crushed the tower down. Betty fired many rounds at the horrible monster but it didn't fall. Jack climbed on a ladder to a tower with a large turret and blasted it at the Deathtouch, but it still continued to feast on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly tore away people's limbs, hearts, lungs and many other parts. When all hope seemed lost, a large gunshot came from behind the monster and it fell, finally succumbing to its many wounds. The Deathtouch (what was left of it) tried standing up, but was shot again. It seemed like it was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty looked at the person. He was wearing a helmet with amour that no zombie could destroy. He had a large rifle that held grenades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks up and....</span></div></div>",

It still had part of its head and upper torso, but most of the rest of it had fallen apart. A thin stream of pink mist rose from the corpse and quickly dissipated. \"I refer to these ones as G2's, which means generation 2. I'm pretty sure one of the members of the brotherhood is doing this, they were the ones who made these monsters, I've been hunting them since day one...\" The man turned away from the gathering crowd of people and continued. \"They took my wife and daughter, there were too many... and then that man in the white robe showed up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty walked over to the man and put a hand on his shoulder. \"I know what you mean... a swarm appeared while me and by uncle where looting a museum, we got separated...

Before the person could even get down from the tower, a large rock hit him in the face and he flew off it. Betty quickly fired an entire clip into the horde and reloaded. \"Enter this truck!\" Jack shouted as he drove a truck out of the garage. It had a turret at the back and two seats in front. (THIS IS NOT A WARTHOG FROM HALO.)  John climbed up at the turret and manned it while Betty opened the door and went in. Jack handed her a RPG. \"Blow up the tower over there!\" He said as he pointed towards the biggest tower. Betty fired the rocket and the towers fell. Jack quickly drove as the death-touches followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHOOT IT! SHOOT IT!!!!!\" Betty yelled. John was firing the turret like mad towards the three monsters while they chased the car. One of them was looking very disturbing, it's skin has fallen off from it's face and you could see blood dripping from it while the body was bleeding in the same way. It soon died, leaving two left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are almost out of gas! Betty! FIRE A ROCKET AT THEM!!!!\" Shouted Jack. Betty reloaded the RPG7 and fired a rocket at them.

A little further ahead on the docks they saw a boat. \"FUCK YEAH!\" Shouted John as he looked at it. \"We need gas for the boat...\" Jack said while he looked around. A few gas-cans were near the boat,\"Well, that was easy.\" Betty ran towards the boat and filled it up. A bridge was in front of the boat, making it impossible to pass it.

Each time they powered up a generator.

It was a little heavier then she anticipated, but still light enough for her to get some practical use out of it. \"Magnificent...\" Betty said as she left the room and began looking for a \"volunteer\" to test her shiny new weapon on. She walked down yet another massive hallway that would eventually take her back to the main entrance hall. Too bad the entire passage was completely empty except for the occasional corpse, non-moving of course. \"Damn, I get this cool new toy and can't find any zombies to use it on... and uncle Frank's expecting me back up front in fifteen more minutes so its not like I can go hunting for them.\" She sighed and swung her new sword around a bit as she walked. \"I guess I should be thankful...

Worse, what if the zombies got him? \"No, no. That's ridiculous.\" She said aloud to reassure herself. \"He fought his way into my school just to rescue me...

It wasn't hard to lose the little zombie girl and soon Betty was alone once again. As she walked she tried to listen for moans and footsteps, but soon became distracted by the many exhibits surrounding her as she moved deeper into this place trying to keep her thoughts off what might have become of her uncle. Several old cars from the early 1900s were proudly displayed alongside mannequins dressed in the bygone decades most fashionable attire. A few signs mentioned things like prohibition and women's suffrage which Betty had read about in school with several other signs and charts displaying similar facts and trivia relating to this point in history. It was oddly comforting and reminded her of her old history class with her one and only friend. The teacher who taught that class, mr. Duncan, had been fairly nice to the two and actually paid attention when the other students bothered her. Normally these happy memories would have brought a smile to her face, but were bittersweet under the current circumstances. \"God, I miss her...\" Betty said aloud as she looked over a display of various old appliances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quickly snapped back to reality when she heard a faint moan echo down the halls along with a loud chorus of groans from a nearby horde of undead. With all the courage she could muster Betty readied herself for the fight of her life and headed in the direction the moan that had obviously been her uncle came from. When she got to the door the noise was coming from her heart sank. Along with the sound of two people talking inside there were the unmistakable cries of a massive group of undead emanating from the room. Once of the two voices belonged to Frank, but the other was deeper, more commanding and intimidating. \"Holy shit, don't they realize that they're surrounded in there?!\" Betty gasped as she put her hand on the door and pulled it open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long scream escaped her lips as her eyes fell on the scene inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was her uncle, beaten, bloody, and barely breathing as a man who was easily at least 7 feet tall and wearing a white robe interrogated him with a sword to his throat. Frank barely even noticed his niece enter the room as he tried vainly to free himself from the half dozen swords that pinned him to the wall. That was nothing however, compared to the dozens of decaying dead bodies that surrounded the two as if they were obedient dogs waiting for their masters next order. \"B-Betty, run...\" Frank choked out as the man in the robe turned to face her, a sinister smile on his twisted face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to think, what does Betty do?</span></div></div>",

But first, I think introductions are in order. My name is Cain, pleased to meet you. And you are...?\" Betty was silent and merely glared at the man. \"Come now, don't be shy... I believe your uncle here called you Betty? He has been quite helpful, told me all about his friends, the other survivors, and their plans... yet...\" He paused for a moment and then resumed talking. \"He never mentioned you, not even your name. Even as I beat him senseless he told me no more then the fact that he had a niece, let alone one here with him. Had you not barged in so rudely... I doubt I would have noticed you here.\" He smiled and looked back at Frank. \"You tried so hard to protect her, shame it was for nothing, eh?\" He said as he gestured for his minions to move in and surround her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! BETTY RUN!\" Frank shouted as he watched helplessly as they swarmed around her, cutting off her escape before she could even notice. \"Now now.\" Cain said in a stern tone as Betty screamed. \"They won't harm her, not just yet anyway. I still need your cooperation and I don't intend to harm a child.\" He smiled wickedly as he watched Betty cower in the center of the mob of zombies, meekly holding her blade in front of her. Frank glared at him with disgust as he struggled once again to get free. \"Damn it, you son of a bitch! Just kill me and get it over with, but leave her alone, she has nothing to do with this! She's just a child, for Christ's sake!\" This outburst seem to catch Cain's attention rather quickly, as the frown on his face showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing... to do with this?\" He growled as he towered over the helpless man before him. \"Just a child...? My wife had \"nothing to do with this,\" my son was \"just a child,\" and neither of them were shown mercy! They were both killed right before my eyes and there was nothing I could do to stop it!\" Tears began forming in the huge mans eyes as his fists trembled. \"This world takes without remorse... Why do you think you and her are any different?\" Frank fell silent. All this time he had been this mans prisoner and he hadn't heard him once mention a wife or child. Only the brotherhood and its plans to \"save\" the world, starting with Bitterwood. \"You... your wife and child?\" Betty asked, breaking the silence and nearly startling the two men who had almost forgotten she was there. \"Yes...\" Cain answered softly while wiping the tears from his face. \"Will... will you hear my story, child?\" He asked as he motioned for the zombies to step back.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't see any zombies, but the whole room was like something out of a horror movie. Blood was smeared across the walls, the door of one of the stalls had been torn off, and worst of all, the bodies of 2 of Betty's classmates were leaning against the wall. They must have been there for a few days as they gave off a horrible smell and looked mildly decayed. Betty nearly threw up at the sight and grabbed the nearby sink to keep from falling over. She threw up into it and began to cry. This had all seemed like a horrible dream before, but finding the corpses of 2 other girls her age laying in puddles of their own blood helped to hammer the realism of the situation into her mind. She had been lucky to survive this long while everyone else was dying, but she couldn't rely on luck to get her out of this. She would have to confront this nightmare head on if she was going to survive, which may the hardest thing she would ever have to do. Betty slumped to the floor as she stared in horror at the unfortunate girls who had met their end only a short while ago. It would be a while before Betty could bear to stand again. She had see a few bodies before while trying to escape the zombies, but none like this. Just thinking about what must have happened made Betty shiver. After what seemed like a hundred years Betty finally got back up on her feet and prepared to move on. She would have to figure out a way to get out of here and fast before the zombies find her again. She would also have to be more careful, one wrong move and she could end up like those two girls...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty Winters sat on her couch with her knees pulled to her chest, watching the eriely claming glow of the TV. All the channels had been the same for the last two days. An old-time warning symbol representing the Emergency Broadcast System with scrolling text. Five days ago, it had interupted her watching the latest episode of American Idol. Something had happened, and the dead where coming back to life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive days ago, the recommendation was to try to evacuate. When that failed, four days ago, they recommended that everyone try to get to localized areas. Her mom had refused to leave the house, so her dad went to go get supplies to come back and hunker down. On day three of the outbreak, her father returned injured, bitten and scratched. That same day the recommendation was to stay inside. The message had been the same ever since. Late on the third night, her dad died. On the fourth morning, she woke to her mother screaming. Her dad was attacking her, and Betty's mother was defending herself with a knife. He almost killed her - he would have killed her - but Betty intervened. Grabbing her mothers pistol from their bedroom closet, Betty fired on her father through tightly shut eyes. The round amazingly found its mark, piercing her father's heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty looked to her right. On the recliner laid her mother, her breathing shallow and nursing the bullet wound to her gut. The shot had gone through her father and into her mother. She sighed, knowing her mom wouldn't be long for this world. Other zombies had come calling, attracted to the noise, but her dad had fortified the house on the first two day. Apparently the zombies where attracted by noise, so Betty had muted the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning this morning was that the best way to kill them was to take off their heads. She wimpered as her mother began to cough, her already labored breathing becoming more shallow as the fit ended. Betty onlyknew she had to do something. She had to get out of this house, to go find help. She needed someone else to help her. She couldn't do this alone. She got up and kissed her mom on the forehead. \"I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back, mommy.\" Her voice caught in her throat. \"I love you...\" she whispered as she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the hall, past the bathroom and into her bedroom. She put a black zipup hoodie on, and changed from her sweats into her favorite pair of jeans and a pair of slightly used cross-training sneakers. She grunted as she put on the poorly recieved gift from her uncle, his way of hinting to loose some weight. Grabbing her backpack she made her way to the kitchen and grabbed what little water and food she had left. On the kitchen table she grabbed the half used first aid kit and her mom's pistol. Checking the chamber, she saw that she only had three rounds left in the 9mm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down the hall and frowned. To her left was the master bedroom, and she could see her dad's lifeless feet in the room. Off to her right she could see the somehow peaceful blue glow in the den, where her mother lay dying. Reaching up, she grabbed the hanging ball and pulled down the ladder to the attic. \"I love you,\" she whispered again as she climbed up into the attic and cralwed over to a set of vents over the garage. Kicking hard, she popped them out and slid her pack of provisions onto the roof of the garage and took a couple claming breaths before squeezing through the very tight hole to the world outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her garage, Bitterwood was frighteningly quiet. She wished silently that Sally hadn't moved and then rebuked herself. If Sally had been here, she would be caught in this nightmare too. But then again at least she wouldn't be alone. Her eyes filled with tears, and she sank to her knees under the weight of the enormity of the situation. She looked back at the vents and then out to the city. The last time she had seen any \"community gathering\" locations broadcast, they had said to go to churches or schools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church was three miles to the east, her high school was only two miles north-west. She looked at the vents again. Home was so familiar, but she knew what waited for her inside. Bittertown High was familiar too, but she hated every day she spent there. The other kids had never accepted her, none of them - except Sally. The church might be safe, but her family wasn't the god-fearing, bible-reading, church-going folk that would likely be assembling there. Who knew if they would accept her. No one else seemed too...</span></div></div>",

She carefully heaved the body out and gently laid it in the water surrounding her.  She then spent 3 minutes in silence.  Betty then climbed into the drivers seat.  She found the keys and started the engine.  She steered the vehicle slowly out of the submurged garden and onto the main road, continuing toward the high school.  As she neared the high schools parking lot, she suddenly spotted someone wandering in the parking lot.  \"It must be another survivor.\" she said, as she pulled up to them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty walked over to the edge of the garage and peered into the street below. There were a dozen, or maybe two dozen, zombies shambling past abandoned empty cars and lifeless looking houses. The once quiet suburb was now filled with the noise of moaning, scraping, and the occasional fear or pain filled scream. Many of the houses looked broken into despite having various qualities of defense. Betty's had been one of the lucky few they ignored for whatever reason. The only positive thing she could see about the current situation was the fact that all of the zombies were the common slow-moving ones she had seen on the news. She knew there were a few stronger types, but hadn't seen any of them so she would be unable to identify any of them right away. Hopefully, she would be with other people when the time came to actually fight these monsters and escape. Betty moved over to the side of the garage that overlooked their driveway and found the ladder her dad had left propped up in case the house was overrun. The level one zombies couldn't climb it and the garage was relatively safe with its massive door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty took a deep breath and quickly climbed down before the zombies noticed her. She went around to the back of the house and was pleased to find that no zombies were in any of the backyards, at least none that she could see... who knows what awaited her behind the fences surrounding her neighbors houses? Still, it was the safest way if it meant not having to deal with a mob of zombies chasing her. She moved quietly and hopped over the wooden fence that led to Ms. Davidson's house. She and her husband had lived there with their two sons for the past ten years and they were always friendly and kind to whoever they met. Betty looked into a broken window into the empty house and felt a pang of sadness. They might've escaped... after all, no one in Betty's family had heard any noise coming from the house since day one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty decided to take out her pistol as she made her way over the short metal fence into the next yard. She probably wouldn't need to use it, but it couldn't hurt to take precautions. She made it by the next three houses with ease. When she came to the last one on the street though, she ran into trouble. Before she could climb over the fence into the final yard she heard a loud growl come from the other side. Betty looked through a small hole and saw two dogs, one chained to a doghouse, one wandering about freely, both disfigured and obviously zombiefied. She quickly looked away, unable to stomach the sight for more then a few seconds. She looked back towards her house which was almost out of sight and tried to think. She walked to the side of the house she was next to and looked around to the front yard. The only zombies were several yards away, about half of them were surrounding a car for some reason. Betty could run for it... but if they saw her before she could get to the next street they'd chase her all the way to the church... if they didn't kill her instead. Betty looked down at the gun in her hands and back out at the street. Finally, she spared one final gaze at the fence where two zombie dogs waited on the other side...  </span></div></div>",

Fortunately, whatever held the mob of undead's attention kept it long after Betty had disappeared onto the house that had been across the street... she didn't even have to open the broken off door. As soon as she stepped inside Betty pressed her back up against the wall and kept her eyes peeled for signs of movement. Silence. Betty walked past the stairs and into the living room where she found a Spongebob backpack laying on the floor. It was a little small and not really her style, but she was glad to have something to put her first aid kit in. Betty gave the room a quick look around and when she didn't see anything useful, moved into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a days old corpse of a middle aged woman laying under the table with a towel over her face and flies buzzing over her body. Betty covered her mouth and nose in an attempt to cut off the smell and moved over to the refrigerator. She was hungry and it would be good to get some supplies to take with her. The warm glow of the tiny light bulb and fresh looking produce told Betty that this house still had power. \"Thank goodness.\" She said as she reached inside and pulled out a crisp orange carrot and took a bite. Unlike most teenagers, Betty had a certain fondness for vegetables, of course she also had quite the soft spot for sweets. After finishing the carrot Betty closed the door and checked the cabinets for food that wouldn't go bad if the church didn't have a working fridge. The shelves inside were lined with everything from captain crunch to ketchup. It took a few minutes for her to decide what to take and what to leave, yet once her backpack was full she had a little bit of everything and was quite satisfied with the variety. She may have packed more snack cakes then necessary, but also included plenty of heathy foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had checked the window to make sure the outside was clear, Betty open the kitchens still intact door and walked out into the houses back yard. In a few minutes of careful navigating she was back on the street heading for the church, which she could now see up ahead. The tall tree that was growing in its front yard was unmistakable. Betty took momentary cover behind a car as a level 2 zombie seemed to sniff at the air around it as it passed by. Once it was out of sight Betty made a run for the church and was just about to the front steps when that same zombie appeared from behind a nearby car and began running towards her at a frightening speed! Betty hadn't seen any zombies like this one and in a panic...</span></div></div>",

The first two shots she fired hit it dead center, but didn't seem to do anything. Just as she was about to panic and waste her final shot a faint memory of a zombie movie she had seen as a child pasted through her mind. Headshots. There was one bullet left in the chamber, if she missed with this one she wouldn't even have time to bang on the door or call for help. She waited a few moments for it to get as close as possible and then fired....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the bullet found its mark and tore through the zombies head, making a slight splurting sound as it broke through the back of its skull. The monster twitched and fell to the ground right at Betty's feet, blood and bits of brain leaking from the back of its destroyed head. Betty dropped her empty gun and sat down on the nearby steps of the church shaking uncontrollably. \"My god, I've taken another life...\" She thought silently to herself. \"When... when will this nightmare end?!\" A tear began rolling down her cheek only to be wiped away by a gloved hand. Shocked, Betty quickly spun around and almost fell to the ground from the surprise. She was so consumed in her grief that she hadn't even heard the door open behind her. \"My my, dear child, are you all right?\" The skinny old man before her asked. \"I'm priest Edwin, please come inside quickly before more of them show up.\" Betty got up slowly and picked up her gun before following the man inside the church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself!\" Betty stammered as they walked into the main room of the church as two burly men resealed the entrance to the door. \"My name... is Betty... I lived a few miles away. My parents... didn't make it here with me...\" The old man frowned as he led her to a seat next to a table with drinks and plastic cups stacked upon it. \"You brave child, I'm so sorry to hear that.\" Edwin said as he got her a cup of water from the table. \"You must have the lord's protection to be able to get here by yourself.\" Betty took the cup and gulped down half of it before thanking him. They talked for a few minutes and he soon got up explaining that he had other people to see to and if she needed anything to talk his nephew, Brock. Betty nodded her head and finished drinking her water alone amidst the chatter of the other survivors.</span></div></div>",

He had once been an immate here, now he was one of the only humans left alive. Just three days ago he saw his best friend Richie get torn to pieces by a Stalker (former immate Lester) as they both were making their way through the mess hall. Only Eric and Smith made it to their current safehold and avoided death. Eric got up out of his seat and walked over to the barricated doors. They were still standing and may even hold out for another day or two. Smith got up off of the floor and walked over to the broken window behind the wardens desk and looked outside. They were still there, eeriely lit by the moonlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zombies continued to walk aimlessly through the yard outside, hunting for those that still breathed air. Across the yard near the wall was a Pyro and what appeared to be a Vampire. Smith looked back over towards Eric and saw that he had moved away from the doors and into the back room. When Smith entered the room he saw Eric was checking their food supply box that they had picked up in the mess hall. \"How are our suppies doing?\" Asked Smith. \"Its all gone...\" Said Eric grimly as he stood back up. He pushed Smith aside and walked back into the wardens office. Smith follwed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric picked his makeshift screwdriver shank up off of the wardens desk and tossed Smith his brass knuckles. \"Surely you're not thinking of-\" Began Smith, but he was cut off by Eric. \"We can't stay here, we're out of food and water. I'd rather go out there and kill as many of those motherfuckers as I can, even if they kill me. Its a hell of alot better then sitting here and waiting to die like a pussy.\" Smith stood there for a moment, thinking over what Eric had just said. \"Good point I guess, what do you want to do...?\" Eric walked over to the window, looked outside for a few minutes, and rested his hand on the desk. \"I figure we have three options...\" Eric and Smith talked it over and weighed their choices.

We could fall, the other windows could all be locked, or any number of things. But this is the best chance we got unless one of them bastards learns to climb, which I think is unlikely.\" Eric replied back as he steped out onto the narrow row of bricks jutting from the prisons wall. He motioned for Smith to follow as he moved slowly sideways across the tiny inprovised walkway. There were only about 6 inches of footspace and one false move would send them plumeting to their doom. Eric, being calm and collected when he needed to be, was having no trouble with this little endevour. Smith, on the other hand was more use to the less physical aspects of crime such as working a chopshop or smuggling goods from location to location, and didn't like to put his own ass on the line. Unfortunately, the current situation called for him to take a few risks that would hopefully pay off. \"We almost to the next window?\" Smith asked as he tried to avoid looking down.\"We're about halfway done.\" Eric called back. \"Pick up the pace a little, the sooner we get to the next window the sooner you don't have to worry about becoming a stain on ground.\" Smith gave him a glare as Eric shuffled along without noticing. \"So, what do we do if this window is locked?\" Smith questioned as he started to move a little faster. \"We go to the next one.\" Eric replied. \"And if that one is locked?\" \"Next one.\" \"What if ALL of them are locked?\" \"Guess we're screwed then.\" Eric said with a laugh. \"Great...\" Smith mumbled as he began to sweat. Eric stopped all of a sudden when he came to the window, almost causing Smith to bump into him. \"Why'd you s-\" Smith began to ask. \"We made it.\" Eric said as he bent down carefully to check the window with one hand holding onto the building for balance. Using his free hand Eric took his shank out of his pocket and pried the window open. \"Good thing it wasn't locked.\" Eric taunted Smith. \"Har har, now hurry up and get the hell inside.\" Smith retorted. Once both men were back inside they took a look around the room they were in.  It appeared to be a small cleaning supply room as the shelves were stacked with things like paper towels and various spray bottles. There was also a door with a clear glass window that led out into the hallway. \"What now...?\" Smith asked, annoyed.</span></div></div>",

I really don't wanna die because we were in such a big hurry that we passed a gun or something.\" \"You really think someone might've stashed a gun in here?\" Smith asked as he pushed aside bottles filled with bright clear liquids. \"Zombies are probably standing outside this room right now.\" Eric said as he opened a box filled with bottles of bleach. \"I wouldn't be surprised to find a goddamn RPG sitting in one of these boxes.\" In their first five minutes of searching all they found were enough cleaning supplies to fill an armory, but they kept looking. Finally Smith had had enough and decided to take a rest. \"Maybe we should just move on, there's nothing here.\" He complained as he sat down on the floor by the window. \"Forget it, I came this far and I'm sure as hell gonna finish, there's only 2 boxes left.\" Eric replied angrily. \"Great, 15 boxes down and 2 to go.\" Smith said with an annoyed tone. \"Shut up and help me pull the duct tape off this long one!\" Eric yelled at Smith, finally starting to lose his temper at the box which he couldn't seem to get open. \"Fine.\" Smith almost yelled back at Eric. \"But after this one we need to move, I can hear them moving outside and I think they know we're here.\" It took them a minute to get the box open, a minute that they might not be able to spare judging from the sounds coming from the outside. \"Christ, I hope whatever was in here was worth it.\" Smith said as he and Eric reached into the packing foam inside. They each touched something at the same time and pulled out what they had. In their hands were 2 brand new mops with shining metal handles. \"These'll do...\" Eric whispered as he got up and walked over to the door. Upon looking through the doors clear glass window Eric saw that there were indeed zombies outside, 12 to be exact. 3 level 2's, a vampire, and 8 level 1's. Most of them were standing along the hallway to their right, but the vampire and one of the level 2's were standing to their left, just in front of the stairs that led to the first floor. \"Holy shit...\" Smith gasped when he joined Eric at the window. \"Well, we have to go one way or the other.\" Eric said in a grim voice. \"Personaly, I think we should...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smith hated the idea of just the two them trying to fend off a whole gang of zombies with just mops. True, they had metal handles and could probably deal some damage if swung hard enough, especially against the decaying level ones, but they were both outnumbered and probably outmatched with the level two's and the Vampire. \"Ah shit, guess I'm ready whenever you are...\" Smith said as he tightened his grip on his meager weapon. \"Right as soon as I open this door we run down that hall and take cover in the first open room we see. Don't stumble or fall, I'm not taking the time to rescue you from one of the fast ones. Smith nodded nervously and got ready to run as soon as Eric turned the knob. A few seconds passed and the air was filled with the moans of the damned and the screams of the two convicts as they ran for their lives. There was no way they would be able to get back to the cleaning supply room now, they would either reach salvation or fall to the undead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn't really used to using weapons as he had won most of his fights with only his own two hands, but he was a natural with the staff-like mop. He effortlessly knocked aside three level ones as he ran towards the only open door at the end of the hallway. One of the level two's tried to run up and swipe him, only to be bashed aside with a broken jaw and a few missing teeth. Even Smith, who had only fought a few times in his life was doing an impressive job of keeping the zombies approaching them from the rear away. The Vampire was still closing in on them, but the level two that had been with it suffered a case of broken kneecap and was limping along pathetically far behind. The final level two posed more of a threat as it stood directly in front of the door they were trying to reach. \"Smith!\" Eric called as he made another level one taste the floor. \"Get ready to run inside, I'm gonna knock that fucker down!\" Smith nodded and kicked away a staggering level one. \"I'll take out the Vampire then!\" He called as he quickly pulled a 180 and sent the Vampire flying with one mighty swing of his mop. Then, without missing a beat, he spun back around and continued following Eric to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe level 2 growled and tried to slash Eric as he held up the mop to defend himself. The bastard's claws cut clean through the mop, yet only served to give Eric a means of finishing it. Smith ran inside the open door as Eric brought the sharpened end of the mop crashing through the thing's mouth and skull. Both convicts were safely inside the room before its body even hit the floor. \"Jesus man, you were a BEAST out there!\" Smith complimented as Eric pulled the door shut just as the surviving zombies began crowding around the outside. \"You didn't do too bad yourself, nice work.\" Eric said calmly as he looked over the broken half of the mop he still had. It wouldn't be much for defending now, but its new sharpened edge gave it some excellent killing potential. It seems things had gone rather smoothly so the two remained calm and hopeful as they ransacked the messy office they found themselves in. \"Say, this place look familiar to you?\" Smith asked as he pushed aside a stack of papers and looked inside a desk. \"Sort of...\" Eric replied as he opened a filing cabinet that was laying on its side. \"Well, lookie here...\" He called cheerfully as pulled out a wad of hundred dollar bills. \"Apparently, mr. Ben Franklin decided to hide in there...\" He held the small fortune in front of a stunned Smith for a few seconds before putting into his pocket. \"Arn't you the least bit suspicious of why that was in there?\" Smith asked as he resumed clearing out the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure don't fuckin' care!\" Eric said as he dumped the rest of the contents of the filing cabinet onto the floor. \"Maybe the money fairy left it for all the good little serial killers and rapists to find here in this shithole of a prison. Hell, that would make more sense then whats going on now...\" Both the two looked long and hard for half an hour and when all was said and done had: a book of matches, a crowbar, and a vintage bottle of wine that was inside a damaged safe. After quickly polishing off 75% of the wine by himself Eric decided it was a good time to leave. Smith however, who was a little less drunk, wanted to wait here until morning. Eric didn't like the idea, but was just sober enough not to get pissed off and instead made himself a makeshift bed from the papers and the curtains from the rooms only window. Smith got what was left and slept very poorly that night.</span></div></div>",

Smith, meanwhile, had grabbed a pair of handguns, a shotgun, an assault rifle, plenty of ammunition, and some bulletproof vests.  \"You'd better put one of these on.\" Smith said, as he slipped on a vest \"There's a chance these may come in handy.\".  Eric nodded and strapped on his own vest.  \"Now let's go.\" Smith said as he walked toward the door \"The sooner we're out of here, the happier I'll be.\".  Eric followed Smith out of the armory and into the disheveled corridors of the prison.  Half an hour later, the two finally found the exit to the prison.

This just might be our last chance to get away...\" Eric said as he walked over to the flimsy barricade. \"If you wanna stay here and hope for a miracle rescue that probably won't come then go ahead, but I'm gonna try to get out of here.\" Eric finished as he started to take down the only thing that had kept the two safe for the past few days. In a few minutes Smith joined him and when the barricade was finally down they ventured out into the halls. There were three zombies down the hall to their left, four down the hall to their right, and one halfway down the stairs in front of them, but they were all level ones. Eric and Smith could easily outrun or fight them if they needed to so they decided to take their time in making their next decision.</span></div></div>",

In the second room they checked Eric found a nightstick and Smith found a couple of handguns. Smith handed Eric his handgun along with 2 bullets. \"Why only two?\" Eric asked. \"Because I only found 5 bullets altogether and I'm keeping three for my gun.\" Smith replied in an annoyed tone. \"Don't waste em' on those level ones outside, we don't know when we'll find more.\" Eric put his shank into his pocket and loaded the two bullets into his gun. \"Don't worry, I'll only use em' to shoot you if you do something to piss me off.\" Eric said half-jokingly. Smith ignored him and walked back out into the hall with Eric following close behind. They made it past the level one zombies fairly easily, Eric only had to beat one of them to death with his nightstick. The duo followed the hallway around a corner and into a new hallway lined with lockers on one side and a few clipboards on the other. The hallway was empty and there were no signs of more zombies. Eric and Smith took the time to check a few of the lockers, but none of them would open so they moved on. About halfway down the hall the two men came to a doorway and another set of stairs. Smith walked over and looked down the stairs to check for zombies. It was clear. He turned back around to tell Eric to follow him, but Eric was still making his way down the hallway towards the door at the end. Whoa, where are you going?!\" Smith called to his companion. \"The exit's down this way!\" Eric kept walking and called back \"I'm going to go check the weapon storage on the third floor and this is the quickest way to get there.\" \"But we're almost free, we just gotta go down these steps and out the front door and we can get the fuck out of here!\" Smith yelled to him in a desperate attempt to get Eric to follow him. \"How do you even know if there's anything left in there?!\" Eric stopped and walked back over to where Smith was standing. \"You think it'll make any difference if we escape and all we have is a couple of handguns and some junk we found laying around. I don't think we'd last longer then a day.\" \"True, we arn't very well armed, but right now we need to escape while we can. We can find better weapons when we're outside.\" Smith said as Eric consitered the two options. Eric...</span></div></div>",

No zombies. Eric followed close behind him with his nightstick in one hand and his gun in the other, if anything jumped them he would be ready. The two walked around the final corner and began making their way to the front door. There were a few zombies in front of it, but they were all level one. \"We're almost outta here, I think it'll be okay if we use our guns now.\" Eric said as he took aim at one of the zombies. \"You go ahead, but I'll save mine in case we run into trouble.\" Smith responded as he moved off to the side to give Eric more room to shoot. Eric scored headshots with both of his bullets and two of the level ones fell to the ground, leaving only three more. \"Good, we can probably shove the remaining zombies aside and run outside before they can grab us.\" Smith said as he ran at the door. Eric quickly sped up after him with his nightstick ready to strike. 'I'll be able to knock two of them away, but you'll have to take the last one.\" Eric called as he prepared to smack the two farthest away from the door. \"Got it!\" Smith called back. Eric tackled one of the zombies to the ground and smacked the other one across the face with his nightstick. Both zombies were now down for the count, but the one he had tackled was still alive and trying to get back up. Eric finished it off as Smith blew away the remaining zombie with his gun. \"Thought you were gonna save ammo?\" Eric asked Smith as he pushed open the broken doors and stepped outside. \"I am, I still have 2 bullets left.\" Smith said as he joined Eric outside. \"Looks like you're gonna need them.\" Eric said grimly as he look around the front yard. \"Cause I can see 3 zombies over by the main gate.\" Smith looked to where Eric pointed and saw them too. The first two looked like normal zombies, but the third was... different somehow. The darkness kept them from telling what type of zombie it was so they would have to make their next move carefully. Other then the zombies they could make out what seemed to be a car about 150 feet away in some bushes and another strange zombie standing on top of it. What should they do?</span></div></div>",

Soon they were close enough to see that the shape was actually a police car with what they assumed to be blood on the back windshield. On top of the car was a Vampire, one of the weaker special zombies. Smith could have easily shot it with his gun, but the noise would surely draw the zombies near the gate over to where they were. Eric still had his nightstick and decided that it would be a good idea to kill it while making as little noise as possible. He signaled for Smith to stop when they were about 15 feet from the car and moved ahead by himself as quickly and quietly as he could. If he caught it off guard he could probably beat it to death with one or two strong hits to the back of the skull. Up close Eric could see that the Vampire seemed to be looking over towards the gate at the other three zombies and had been facing away from the two men since they left the building. Eric took advantage of his good fortune and quickly climbed up onto the car with his nightstick ready to put an end to the zombie that stood before him. The Vampire began to turn around just as Eric swung his weapon with all of his might. The force of the blow sent the zombie flying off the car and onto the cold ground below. Eric looked down to where it had landed and saw that its body had partly fallen onto a bush. It was hard to see how much damage had been done, but Eric could tell from the broken teeth and bloody face that his foe wasn't getting up for a while, if at all. He then raised his hand to show Smith it was okay to get closer. Smith walked over and looked into the front window of the car as Eric jumped down off the car and rubbed his arm. \"You okay?\" Smith asked. \"Yeah, I think I just pulled something killing that zombie. I'll be fine after we get out of here.\" \"Do you think this car still works?\" Smith asked as opened the door. \"At least its not locked...\" Eric said as he and Smith got inside. The keys were still there and even in the ignition. \"Well, lets see if this piece of shit still works.\" Eric said as he turned the key.</span></div></div>",

The car pulled out of the bushes and quickly made a sharp turn for the gate. \"Now, LET'S GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\" Eric shouted as he increased the vehicles speed right before coming into contact with the gate. The zombies that had been standing there were knocked aside as the convicts new ride crashed through what remained of the prisons gate. The two men were finally free. \"Hell yeah!\" Yelled Smith as the car began following the short road away from the prison back towards the cities streets. \"Take that, you bastards!\" Soon the road ended and Eric drove out onto the mostly abandoned streets. The two men decided to look around before driving on. Other than a few zombies walking aimlessly along the streets, there was a nearby gun store with a grocery store just beyond that. Eric checked the fuel meter and saw that they had about half a tank of gas left. \"We got plenty of fuel, should we check out some of these buildings for supplies?\" Eric asked Smith as looked over the nearby stores. \"Yeah, we can get more gas later, right now we need to loot these places for anything useful.\" Eric nodded his head and stepped outside with his nightstick in hand. He took a deep breath of the cool night air and relished his first few moments of true freedom in a long time. \"Damn, it feels good to be out.\" He said as he and Smith walked across the street. \"So, what place we hitting first?\" Smith asked as they came to a row of stores. Eric looked them over and noticed the gun shop and grocery store he saw earlier.

What surprised them was the sheer amount of firepower that laid before them in the glass cases and on the shelves. This place had it all, from handguns to automatic shotguns, everything a gun nut could ever want stood before them ready to be put to good use. Eric dropped his nightstick to the floor and walked up to the large glass display case in front of the counter. Smith merely looked on in awe for a few seconds before making his way over to the guns on the shelves. Eric had some trouble resisting the urge to break the display case and grab the biggest gun he could, but knew that doing so would set off the alarm and draw the zombies over to them. Fortunately, he managed to avoid acting impulsively and doing something stupid. He left the display and walked over to a shelf on the other side of the room where several hunting rifles were lined up in a row. After checking the scopes on a few of them he found one he liked and carried it with him over to where Smith was. \"You find anything?\" Eric asked in an almost disintrested tone. Smith pulled a large auto shotgun off the shelf and aimed it at a target poster on the nearby wall. \"This'll do.\" He said as he lowed it to his side. \"Oh, and I found these on one of the shelves.\" Smith handed Eric a laser sight for his gun and put another one on his own. \"Nice. Let's grab some ammo and get moving. I don't want to leave our car alone for too long.\" Eric said as he grabbed a couple large cases of ammo. \"Take all you can carry, we probably won't be coming back anytime soon.\" The two then walked back outside where it was starting to get brighter as the sun came up. \"Well, we got some light now, that's good.\" Smith said as he and Eric lugged their armfulls of weapons and ammo over to their car. They put all of the ammo in the back except a few cases each. They loaded their guns and walked over to the grocery store. \"I'll check the canned food section.\" Smith said. \"What about you?\" \"I'll get the...\"</span></div></div>",

The inside was quite bloody and a few corpses were scattered about, but it was nothing the two hadn't seen before at this point. Smith grabbed some plastic bags from a check-out counter and walked off to to get the canned food. Eric walked over to another check-out to get some bags for himself when he noticed the cash register was broken open. \"Might as well grab some cash, its not like I need it right now, but neither does anyone else here...\" He took what must have amounted to over $500 and stuffed all of it into his pockets. When he was done with that he got some plastic bags for himself and headed off in search of the freezer section. He soon found it and made his way over to the alcohol section. He grabbed a six pack of beer and took a bottle out of it. He popped the cap off and took a long chug, draining over half the bottle. \"Ah, damn its been long since I had one of those...\" He put the rest of the six pack into a bag and continued gathering more alcoholic beverages while finishing off the rest of his drink. Once two of the plastic bags were full he headed back up to the front where Smith was waiting for him. From the look of things Smith had found plenty of canned food, enough to last them for a few days at least. \"You got the drinks?\" Smith asked as Eric walked over. \"Yep, got me some real good stuff...\" Eric said as he held up the bags. \"Good. Let's get this shit to the car.\" Smith said as he went over to the exit. Smith was about to open the door when he stopped for some reason. \"Hey!\" Eric called as he caught up with him. \"This shit weighs a ton, open the fucking-\" Eric stopped when he looked outside and saw what Smith had. Standing not 20 feet away were no less then a dozen zombies. Most of them appeared to be level one or two along with at least five special zombies. There was a Slimer, a Carrier, TWO Pyros, and a bear (Beast). The zombies stared at their prey for a few moments before moving in. Eric and Smith...</span></div></div>",

He didn't have the time to use the scope on his first shot, but still managed to hit the bears neck. His next few shots had the benefit of being aimed properly by the hunting rifle and all hit the bear in its head, one down, eleven to go. Smith had joined Eric in his preemptive strike by now and managed to kill a level one by firing into the other glass door directly. \"Nice shot.\" Eric called. \"But we need to kill those special zombies first, aim for them.\" Smith fired another shot and managed to hit a level two that was about 10 feet from the door. \"I can't get a good shot with this type of gun. You'll have to snipe them.\" He said as another blast rang out and destroyed a nearby pay phone. \"Fine. Guess I'll have to save both our asses then.\" Eric complained as he reloaded. \"Look out!\" Smith called as a blob of purple goo went whizzing by Erics head. \"Damn it!\" Eric yelled as he got another shot off. \"What are they trying to do?\" Smith was about to answer him when he noticed one of the Pyros moving closer, then it hit him. \"Quick, get away from the door!\" Smith called as he made a dash for a nearby check out. Eric groaned, but followed his companions advice and took cover as well. Just as Eric disappeared behind a register the whole store was filled with the sound of a loud explosion. The Slimer had scored a directed hit on the suicide bombing Pyro. With the door now blow open the zombies moved in for the kill.

Eric simply ignored the comment as the two began their steady retreat. With their backs turned away from the zombies they had to move slowly, but Smith was able to keep them at bay with his shotgun while Eric tried to snipe the stronger ones. Things seemed to be going well until Smith ran off of ammo for his gun. \"Shit, I gotta reload!\" He yelled as Eric fired another well-aimed shot. \"What?! Theres only four left!\" Eric shouted as the last level two in the group made one final charge towards the two men. Eric himself had one shot left in his hunting rifle and he would have to make it count. He pulled the trigger just as the zombies claws connected with his left shoulder. Both men were knocked to the ground along with the now dead level two. Eric couldn't get up right away and Smith had no hope of getting back to his feet without Eric, this fight would be finished on the floor. The remaining zombies were a level one, Pyro, and Carrier. who each seemed to realize that this was their big chance. The Pyro picked up the pace and charged the two survivors with flames emitting from its overheating body. Fortunately, its fiery charge was cut short with a shotgun blast to the head. Smith had reloaded his gun and was back in action. The Pyro burst into flames just as it stumbled into a shelf of potato chips. The fire provided by the dead Pyro allowed Eric just enough time to load two bullets into his hunting rifle. The Carrier, who had been waiting for a chance to strike now saw one and took it. Just as it appeared out of the smoke to grab Smith, however, it was hit in the forehead with Erics scoped hunting rifle shot. The two men used this time to help each other up before the level one could get around the fire. Eric was bleeding worse then Smith by this point and could hardly point his gun and shoot the final zombie in the torse, killing it. They both managed to get back outside and were relieved to see that their car was still there and no zombies were in sight. \"You take... the wheel Smith...\" Eric said between gasps.

He felt lightheaded and soon began mumbling something to himself. Finally, after half an hour on the road, Eric passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                    ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright light and sound seemed to return to Eric's world.

He appeared to have short brown hair along with a mustache and was clearly a doctor. Eric put a hand on his head and groaned in pain. He had a pretty bad headache, but his shoulder was killing him. \"Ah... shit, where the hell am I?\" He managed to choke out as he sat up in his makeshift bed. He noticed an IV was attached to his arm which seemed to be restoring some of the blood he lost back at the supermarket. O- was printed on the blood container which Eric guessed was the blood type. The doctor handed Eric a juice box that had been sitting on his medical tray. \"Here, drink up. You lost a lot of blood.\" Eric took the juice and drained it in one long sip. \"Alright then...\" Eric said gasping. \"Now tell me where I am... and how I got here...\" The doctor explained that Smith had managed to get the two of them to a hospital despite having a pretty bad injury himself. By the time Smith had arrived, however, Eric had passed out from blood loss and needed a transfusion. Luckily, they had some blood on hand that could be donated to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at a wristwatch on his hand. \"Its 3:09 p.m. You've been old cold for hours.\" Eric rubbed his head, he couldn't believe it. Apparently his injuries were worse then he thought. \"So where's Smith?\" Eric asked. Gary simply stepped back to reveal Smith sleeping soundly in a chair across the room next to two people dressed in scrubs sitting on a couch. His leg was bandaged and a pair of crutches were propped against the wall next to him. \"So we both okay... and from the looks of this place we're in a waiting room. So I take it this is the only safe spot in the whole hospital?\" The doctor nodded. \"When the zombies first appeared me and those two nurses over there were the only ones to get away. We barricaded this waiting room as best we could and are trying to wait it out. After all, we have plenty of food and drinks with us thanks to the vending machines and we have plenty of medical supplies we managed to scavenge on the way here...\" Eric laid back down on the bed. \"You're not going to be able to stay here.\" He said in a tone as serious as he could muster in his condition.. \"The only hope we have of surviving is getting out of this damn city.\" The doctor gave him a strange look. \"Well, perhaps you're right... we can talk about it more after you've rested a bit. Oh, uh excuse me, in all this excitement I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Dr. Gary Wilson, pleased to meet you.\" Eric gave him a look as if he'd lost his mind and sighed loudly. \"For what its worth...

Gary's smile disappeared and his tone turned deadly serious when he spoke. \"Yes... your friend Smith here told us about what you two had come across out there. I had no idea things had gotten so bad. When me and the nurses decided to hold out here we had only come across the low level zombies and some weak specials. If what Smith said is true we're up against much more then we can handle...\" One of the nurses, Ann if her name tag was correct, quickly added: \"Those things that catch fire and spit slime... how are we supposed to deal with that!\" She buried her face in her hands and sounded as if she was on the verge of crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the good news is...\" Eric said with a slight grin. \"...they can still be killed with bullets. I know from personal experience a good gun can work wonders when dealing with those rotting bastards. Now if you'd be so kind as to return our guns I'll show you.\" Gary shook his head and pulled a shiny metal key from his pocket. \"Sorry, I don't think so. I'm not sure of your intentions at the moment... and I'm definitely sure the both of you arn't dressed in prison uniforms because you like the style.\" He said smugly as he returned the key to his pocket. Eric clearly was not satisfied with the doctors answer and immediately began to protest. \"Goddamn it, you know our intentions, I just told you! Give us back our guns so we can kill the rest of those bastards before they kill us!\" Gary merely crossed his arms and said in a calm voice: \"Hmmm... no. I don't think so.\" Eric's face began to turn red, but before he could interrupt, the doctor continued. \"However... I can see you'd really like your guns back so I'll offer you both a deal. I'll return both of your guns if you...\"</span></div></div>",

Disorderly conduct, public drunkenness, assault... robbery...\" Eric rubbed his forehead as he spoke as if trying to uncover the memories as he went. \"My latest crime was possession of a deadly weapon without a permit... the fact that it was an illegal piece I bought off the black market didn't help either. It was a gun... a model that they couldn't trace back to me... I was going... going to murder my father.\" At this point Gary gave him a stern look as if to say he was appalled, but let him continue. \"My dad... my fucking dad. All he ever did was belittle me, me and my mother. He had gotten her pregnant on their second date and demanded she get an abortion, he didn't want me from the start. My mother offered to marry him though, even though she was only seventeen at the time. He was twenty-nine. They didn't have a ceremony, he just called over some friends and they drank beer all day while my mother worked her ass off getting ready. The pastor from the local church came by, said a few words, and they were stuck together, just like that. I was born eight months later downtown while they were on their way to the hospital. By the time they arrived at the hospital, they said I wouldn't make it, it was too late... but I did make it, somehow. I should have just died right there and saved them both the trouble, hell they might've been happier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric seemed to shake as he spoke, the grief he was reliving fueling the anger and sadness in his voice. \"When I was four... by mom got me a dog, Bandit, a black lab. He grew up fast and I actually felt that someone cared about me other than my mother. We played in our tiny back yard while my dad drank and got high with his buddies. I didn't care, he was my dog, my best friend. I hated going to school, the teachers were assholes, the students were morons, and this one asshole kid kept stealing my lunch money. It wasn't uncommon for me to go an entire day without eating, what with my mom working and my dad getting buzzed out of his mind. Finally, on my seventh birthday my mom managed to scrape enough money together to get me a bike. I couldn't believe it, my own bike! It wasn't new or anything, but it was a hell of a lot better then the crap I got all the other years, I was even allowed to ride it to school. Things seemed to have reached a turning point, for the first time in my life I felt like the world actually wanted me here. The next few years were more of the same up to that point, but I had my dog and my bike. Whenever my mom scolded me, my dog was there to lick my cheek. When an asshole at school made me drink out of a urinal, my bike was there to get me home. When my day had been overall shitty, both were there to greet me and make me feel better. Well, that shit came to an end real fucking fast. I was eleven... and my dog was getting old, he was already ten. He... had trouble hearing. One day riding home... from... from school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, for the first time in possibly years let a tear roll down his face. His voice losing its normal gruff tone to become more shaky, more saddened. \"I... I FUCKING RAN OVER HIM!\" He shouted as loud as he was able. \"It was sunny out, warm. All I wanted to do was get home and see my mom. I had a hard day, one of the teachers... I was going home... I turned into our driveway and... heard a crunch as I was knocked from the bike. I scrapped my elbows but my mom said I didn't even notice. When I turned around to investigated the source of the noise I saw him. I'll never fucking forget that sight, I've had nightmares about it. His head was partially crushed and his jaw was torn back to make him look like he was smiling... my dog was smiling at me. He whimpered as blood covered his head and ran down the sides. I wanted to do something, anything, I ran inside crying with vomit staining my shirt. My mom said I must have thrown up when I saw him. By the time she called my dad out to put him out of his misery... he was dead. I wasn't there with him for his last minutes, I didn't end his suffering... he died alone and in pain because of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blood on his head was caked and dried, a bit of his skull and possibly brains were exposed where he'd been hit. My dad told me I'd have to bury him, no getting out of a \"man's duty\" as he called it. He handed me a shovel and cleared a spot near the garden, the rest I had to do. I began digging in the burning afternoon sun, wishing it was me going in this hole, not my dog, not my best friend. It was around six when I finally finished. I went back to get him, had to load him into my wagon. It was hell, the flies wouldn't stop buzzing around him, they crawled all over my sweating skin as I carried my dog to his final resting spot. He was so heavy I had to turn the wagon over and dump him into the grave. He made a squishing sound as he fell, like raw meat. I covered him up went inside and spent the rest of the day in my room crying. No skipping school the next day though, nope. I had a test and I was damn sure going to take it. My mom drove me there on her way to work, I couldn't bear to ride my bike after what it had done. It killed my dog... I killed my dog. That day, that day...\" Eric was actively sobbing at this point, his face red from sadness instead of anger. Gary handed him another juice box and allowed him to move on once he'd calmed down a little...</span></div></div>",

The kids wouldn't leave me alone, the bastards kept making fun of me and teasing me about my dog. I hated them all... The day played out like normal, but when it was over I had to wait outside for my mom for two hours, she was supposed to pick me up sooner, but she was late getting off work. During that time one of my teachers came out and talked to me. I can't even remember what we talked about, she never left me alone... always following me, watching me. She said some things that I didn't understand and left when my mom came. The ride home wasn't pleasant either, my mom keep talking about how we'd be moving, that I was glad for, but before we could move she said she'd have to save up some money. For a few weeks we had almost no food to eat... plenty of beer though. One day my dad caught me drinking one and hit me with a beer bottle he had with him. The bottle broke and cut my shoulder and part of my arm... god I hated that overweight piece of shit. I could tell he was high when he did it, that fucking moron. Well, we moved about a month after my dog was killed, but not before...\" Eric began shaking again, the memories painfully and slowly returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was molested by that same teacher, the one that followed me. I can't even remember the details, dear god, I'd almost forgotten about it. That... that bitch... she... I couldn't even do anything about it! My mom didn't believe me and my dad make fun of me for it, that cocksucker! He even said he envied me! \"Oh, you're so lucky! I didn't get any until I was fourteen, you lucky little shit!\" He laughed at me! Laughed at me!!! I wanted to kill him then, I wanted to kill myself and just be done with it... but I couldn't... I still loved my mom and I couldn't bear to leave her alone with him. We moved and I never saw that teacher again, thank god. We were actually able to buy a house in a decent neighborhood thanks to the money my mom had saved up and hid from my dad, he simply thought she had won 10,000 dollars on a lottery scratch-off card. The house itself was a mess, but there wasn't any hookers or gangs outside roaming the streets, that was a small plus. We still had problems dealing with taxes and such, but we did fine... up until she fell sick and had to be hospitalized. Without her bringing in any money to pay our taxes, let alone her own hospital bills, we would soon lose the house. My father saw this as an opportunity to leave in the middle of the night while I was out visiting my mother in the hospital. That fucker robbed us blind, took everything of value, and left. He didn't even bother leaving a note. I was alone in an empty house, my dad gone, my mother in the hospital, and me jobless and soon to be homeless. I had one desperate idea... I took some money I had hidden for an emergency and bought a gun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I walked into the local convenience store gun in hand and robbed the place. The clerk was about to pull out a shotgun, but I got him in the shoulder first. While he was on the floor screaming I took the entire cash register and ran back home. Turns out I had only stolen about two hundred bucks, that wouldn't even pay my moms doctor bill... To add insult to injury... I left my gun at the scene of the crime and due to about five different witnesses seeing me run home, they had absolutely no trouble convicting me. The judge seemed to take pity on me though, and gave me a light sentence. After spending some time in prison I got out only to find out my mother had passed away not even a month ago. I was so depressed I attempted suicide twice, both times I backed out at the last minute. I had no money to my name and was homeless, I didn't know what to do. Fortunately, I got a lucky break when a friend I met in prison got out and introduced me to his cousin who was looking for a mechanic. I had worked on my bike as a kid and had some experience working on cars so I applied and got the job. I had a steady income and was able to afford to live in an apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, I was even able to buy a few luxuries like a t.v. set and more then three different sets of clothes. My life was looking a lot better and I made a decent living. Then, one day, someone decided to drop off a car that needed fixing. It was Rob. My dad's best friend and right hand man. He was there with his brother Jerry and they both recognized me almost instantly. They started mocking me and telling me about how my dad was short on cash, that he should have taken the floorboards out of house when he left. I just stood there and took it, I wasn't going to risk my only job dealing with two inbred rednecks who didn't know when to shut up. I held out for ten minutes of abuse before I reached a breaking point. They called my mother a whore and I grabbed a wrench and started swinging. By the time my boss and another employee had restrained me both men were lying on the dirt, one unconscious and bleeding, the other bruised and begging me to stop...\" Eric raised his hand to his head. \"After that it seemed like I couldn't stay out of jail...\"</span></div></div>",

Eric wiped his eyes one last time and finished his story. \"I'm sure you don't really need to know the details so I'll give you the short version of what happened next. On my most recent stay in jail I became buddies with two of the inmates, Smith, who is sitting right before you now, and Richie, who was killed before we made it out. Less then a week ago the the dead began walking and the whole city became a warzone. Because we were in jail, me and the other inmates managed to survive for a while after the guards were picked off one by one. Of course, the zombies soon became too much and we had to escape. Luckily, we found a working car and got the hell out of there and managed to find some guns. We killed a few zombies, got hurt, and Smith drove us here.\" Eric wiped the sweat off of his forehead with his sleeve and looked around the room slowly at the people sitting across from him. \"Now, I want you to return our guns. I've told you all that I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary let out a sigh and got up out of his chair and walked over to the bathroom in the corner of the room. He disappeared for a minute inside and came out carrying a large case with a lock on it. He opened it with his key and handed the two inmates their guns. \"Thank you kindly, doctor.\" Smith said as he looked over the weapon to make sure it was in the same condition as when he last had it. \"What the fuck is this?!\" Eric shouted suddenly after checking the chamber of his gun, which was empty. \"Heh heh, like I told you earlier...\" Gary said with a smile. \"I don't think the two of you are wearing those uniforms because its Halloween. I got every last bullet put away... and you neither of you will fire a single shot unless I say so. Now, instead of wasting any time arguing I say we prepare to leave before we have to do any fighting anyway.\" Eric gave him a death glare, but decided to go with him for now. Once they were all safe he could gut the man if he wanted. \"Fine then, what plan of escape did you have...?\" Eric asked as his tone began returning to normal. \"Thank you for asking.\" Gary said as he sat back down in his chair. \"The way I see it, there's only one logical option...\"</span></div></div>",

In a few minutes they were all outside loading up the cars trunk with several small cardboard boxes that contained everything from food, to medical supplies, to spare blankets. The only box that didn't go in the back was the one that contained the ammo for Eric and Smith's guns. Once they had everything packed away Eric got up front to drive with Smith riding shotgun. Gary handed the pair one round of ammunition each and took a seat in the back with the nurses. \"Remember, we're all in this together. Don't try anything funny and I'm sure we'll all make it out of the city.\" Gary called as Eric started up the car. \"Yeah, just don't try any bullshit yourself, doc.\" Eric called back as he pulled away from the hospital and began making his way slowly down the cities darkened streets. It was almost impossible to see where he was going, but Eric dared not turn on the headlights, for they would surely draw zombies. \"Be careful...\" One of the nurses said as she looked out the window. \"We're in no hurry. We just need to stay safe.\" Eric slowed down a bit as they came to an intersection and looked down each road carefully. \"Indeed...\" He replied just loud enough for her to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned around a corner and began moving towards the outskirts of the city. \"Turn left here.\" Gary called as they moved under a flickering street lamp. \"Why?\" Smith asked without taking his gaze away from the window. \"The St. Ann hotel is a little further ahead. Its pretty big and if any survivors were in the nearby area that's probably where they'd go. If nothing else, I'm sure we'll find some supplies there and maybe even a safe place to rest for the night.\" Smith finally turned away from the window towards Eric and looked over his face, trying to find a sign of what he might be thinking. When he didn't get any answers he decided to simply ask his opinion. \"Eric, should we do as he says?\" Eric was silent for a moment, but his expression didn't change. \"I haven't even heard of that place, do you really think its worth the risk?\" Smith hesitated to answer, he hadn't ever heard of it either. Eric turned back to face the doctor and looked him in the eye. \"You're sure that this hotel is the best place to go?\" He asked calmly. Gary simply nodded his head once and Eric turned back around. \"To the hotel, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pulled into the nearly empty parking lot across the street from the hotel and stepped out. He motioned for the others to stay in the car and looked down both sides of the street before crossing over to the hotel. It wasn't quite as impressive as Gary had made it out to be, but was certainly more luxurious then any place he had ever stayed. It stood several stories tall with a large sign over the doorway proudly declaring its name. Eric raised a hand to signal to his companions that it was safe and moved over to the side of the door to wait for them. Smith was the first to greet him and took his place on the opposite side of the doorway and waited for instructions. Gary and the nurses soon took their places at the bottom of the steps with boxes in their hands. \"Whenever you boys are ready...\" Gary called as Eric walked in front of the doors.</span></div></div>",

Four pairs of glowing red eyes in the darkness. Four zombies of unknown type and level. Eric leaned back into place and silently raised four fingers on his right hand. Smith nodded and got ready to move on Eric's command. A gentle wind picked up just as they began their assault. Eric sniped at one of the pairs of eyes in the corner that happened to be separated from the others. The glass door cracked and shattered as two shots pierced it and hit their mark. The sound of a body falling to the floor confirmed the kill. Smith waited for the remaining three zombies to get a little closer and then fired his shotgun when they got close. Two were hit and died instantly, but the forth one managed to survive. It growled and tried making a swipe at Smith through the door just as Eric fried off one final shot from his hunting rifle. The quick moving level 2 zombie staggered a bit and fell through the broken door as blood poured from its forehead. Eric grabbed its arms and pulled it the rest of the way out while Smith grabbed its legs. They sat it down next to the steps and opened the door for Gary and the nurses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary put his box down on the floor inside and opened it. Inside he had packed the hospitals only working flashlights, which he was having trouble finding in the darkness. Finally, he came across something slender with a switch on the side. \"Eureka!\" He called as he flipped the switch and illuminated the remaining contents of the box. He dug around for a few more minutes and pulled out two more flashlights along with a roll of duct tape. \"Let me see your guns.\" He said as he checked the other flashlights to make sure they worked. Smith and Eric both eagerly handed over their guns in the hopes of getting more ammo... only to get them back with a flashlight attachment. \"What, no ammo?\" Smith asked as he turned his light on. \"Sorry, not yet. If we run into more undead I'll give you some, but until then I don't think you'll be needing that much firepower. Oh, and Smith?\" After switching his light back off, Smith turned to Gary, or rather, where he thought Gary was. \"Yeah?\" He asked disinterestedly. \"I don't have any spare batteries... so you might want to keep those off if you're not using them.\" Gary said as he turned his own flashlight back on. \"We'll use mine for now, you two can save yours for when you're fighting. Now, what do you say we explore a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary walked over to the main desk and looked over the list of rooms posted on the wall. Next to several of the numbers were R's in a circle that seemed to be written in marker. Most were intact, but a few had X's over them or had a line through them. The closest rooms were both on the second floor, room number 12 and room 15. The next closest one was all the way up on the 5th floor, room 46. \"Well, then...\" Gary said as he turned back to the others. \"We've got two rooms on the second floor that we can loot and hopefully stay for the night. Sound good?\" Nobody objected, and soon the group was headed for the stairs, which were closed off. There were two huge broken couches near the bottom and a few chairs a little further up ahead. \"Looks like this could take us a while...\" Gary said as he looked over the massive barricade. \"Anyone want to try the elevator?\"</span></div></div>",

If you see anything move call out to it, if you don't get an answer, blow it away.\" The man nodded as Smith handed Ann his shotgun with a chuckle. \"Sure you can handle that size?\" He taunted as he and Eric grabbed onto one of the broken couches. \"Sure.\" Ann replied in an annoyed tone. \"If its the biggest you got it should be no problem for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric actually smiled and let out a giggle at the statement. \"Oh, shut up...\" Smith mumbled as they hefted the large piece of ruined furniture into the air and began moving it out onto the floor. After they got the first one down they had a lot more room to work and had no trouble getting the second out of the way. Just as Eric went to grab one of the chairs Greg fired off a few shots from his hunting rifle. Startled Gary and Smith both asked what had happened. \"Oh, I saw a zombie over next to the parking lot across the street, don't worry though, I got him in the head.\" He replied. Gary let out a sigh of relief and went back to work. \"Just be careful you don't accidentally hit a survivor, only shoot when you know its a zombie.\" He cautioned as he resumed digging around in a drawer out of sight behind the desk. True to their word, Eric and Smith had the stairs cleared in just under 5 minutes. \"Its open, everybody get back over here.\" Eric said as he panted a bit. \"Whew, your face is all sweaty.\" Gary said as he poked his head out from behind the desk. \"I found a monogramed towel back here, catch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric caught the towel right out of the air in the darkness and began rubbing his face. \"God, I sure hope whatever the hell is up here is worth it...\" Greg and Ann stepped away from the windows after doing a final check for zombies. \"Here's your guns back.\" Ann said as they relinquished their weapons back to the original owners. Gary picked up one of the boxes they had brought in with them and took out some more ammo. \"Here, Greg used a few rounds so I guess you two could use a little more.\" He said as he handed them the extra bullets. \"Bout' flipping time!\" Smith shouted as he grabbed the shells for his gun. \"Yeah, thanks.\" Eric said as he reloaded his hunting rifle. \"Well then doc, find anything we can use back there?\" Gary handed the box he was carrying to Greg and walked over to grab the new box of stuff he had found tucked away behind the front desk. \"Just some towels, a can opener, and a half empty bottle of wine.\" Eric's ears perked up at the sound of that last item. \"You gonna share that?\" He asked as he began walking up the steps. \"Sure, sure.\" Gary replied with a giggle. \"When we get to our room I'll pour us all a glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The number 12 was written on it in smeared golden paint, but was still barely legible. \"Looks like we're here, anyone wanna knock?\" Gary asked, eager to set down the heavy box he was carrying. Eric walked in front of him and was silent for a moment... then kicked open the flimsy door with all his might. \"Knock knock.\" He quipped as the door landed on the floor inside with a loud thud. Gary's face began to redden a bit and he was just about to yelled at Eric for making so much noise, but instead simply ran inside and sat his box on a coffee table. \"Hurry up and set the boxes in here next to mine. Eric, do you think you can watch the door while we get everything set up in here?\" Gary asked in an obviously annoyed tone. \"Why, sure...\" Eric called as he quickly turned around to hide his mischievous grin. He was still pissed at the doctor for forcing him and Smith to work with them and was just petty enough to irritate him whenever he got a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys best hurry and unpack, that saggy balloon over there is giving me a deranged look, it might jump us at any minute.\" Eric taunted as Gary groaned in frustration. Once they had everything unpacked Gary called him to come back in and help search the massive room. It would take them a while to search everywhere, but at least the room was less of a mess then they expected. The wallpaper was torn in places, but mostly intact. The floor had a few bits of garbage strewn about, but wasn't covered in trash like so many other places had been. Even most of the many decorations were still intact, including a stack of wine glasses in a pyramid formation on one of the tables. \"This place must have been pretty nice before all this shit happened...\" Smith said as he looked under a king-sized bed. \"I don't give a shit if this was a crackhouse before the damn zombies showed up.\" Eric called as he tried to break into a locked wine cabinet. \"As long as this place is safe and has booze I'll be happy.\" Sure enough, as soon as the cabinet was open Eric began pouring himself drinks while the others continued to search. At least, until Gary caught him slacking off and threatened to not give him more ammo if he didn't start helping. An hour passed and the room was turned upside down, but the survivors had each found several useful supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once everyone was seated they began showing each other what they had found. \"Okay, I'll go first.\" Gary said cheerfully as he sat a bag on the table and poured out its contents. Several boxes of various foods (mostly cereal and candy bars) spilled out into a neat little pile. \"That'll keep us fed a while, now who wants to go next?\" He asked as he put everything back into the bag. \"Well, I doubt dumb and dumber over there are eager to cooperate so how about me and Ann go next?\" Greg replied as he gave both the convicts a disapproving look. \"Whatever, I don't mind if girly and girlier go first.\" Eric sneered as he took a sip from a freshly opened bottle of wine. \"Charming...\" Greg said as he rolled his eyes. \"Anyway, we managed to find a decently stocked first aid kit. It has plenty of bandages and some disinfectant, but thats about it. Oh, and we also found this in a suitcase in the other room.\" He sat a paintball mask on the table. \"Oh goodie, tell me you also found some paintballs and a gun.\" Eric said sarcastically as he propped both of his feet on the table. \"Well then, what did the two of you find?\" Ann asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found some food...\" Smith said as he laid a few items on the table. \"Oh, and some water and...\" Then Eric suddenly cut him off. \"We, or rather I, found some booze.\" He said as he began setting bottles of wine down on the table. \"Yay. Beer.\" Greg taunted. \"What is this, a frat party. What else did you find, or is this it?\" Eric glared at the man and reached underneath the table. \"No, it isn't...\" He replied as he sat a small, slightly bent key down on the table. \"And this goes to...?\" Greg asked, not losing a hint of resentment in his tone. \"We... think it was the key to the wine cabinet...\" Smith answered as he lowered his head. \"Just wonderful, now if you'll excuse me I'm going to try and get some sleep.\" Greg said as he got up and walked into the bedroom. \"Me too.\" Ann said with a yawn. \"After all thats happened I'm quite eager to get some sleep.\" \"Yeah, I hear ya...\" Smith called with a grin as he got up and took down some curtains to act as a blanket. \"Okay then, I think its best we all get a little shut eye.\" Gary said as he stretched out on the second couch. \"Yeah, goodnight everybody, don't let the bedbugs bite...\" Eric groaned as he settled into place on his own couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should lay off those.\" Gary commented as Eric sat his empty wine bottle on the table. \"Yeah yeah...\" Eric groaned back. In ten minutes, when they were sure the others were asleep, Eric and Smith got back up out of bed briefly to show each other the secret items that they had found and hidden from the others. When they were done with that they went back to bed, eager to get some well deserved shuteye. </span></div></div>",

As he rubbed his eyes he noticed the sound of running water coming from tthe bathroom. \"What? Is... is someone taking a shower in there...?\" He wispered as he looked around the room. In was dark and hard to see, but the slumbering forms of both the doctor and his partner were visible in the recliner and on the couch, respectively. \"Neither of those two... I wonder...\" Smith said to himself as he got up and tip-toed towards the hallway leading towards the bathroom. A soft yellow light crept from beneath the door and partally illumitated the hallway. With a deep breath Smith moved up to the door and peeked into the crack in the doorframe. All he could see on the inside was part of a shower curtain, but the unmistakeable sound of a woman humming softly to herself was more then enough to keep him in place. \"Oh my god...\" Smith whispered to himself when he realize Ann, the nurse he had flirted with, was naked behind this door. For a few minutes he just stood there listening to the sound of the water and her voice. Then everything suddenly stopped as he heard a familar tone address him indirectly. \"Hello, is anyone out there...?\" Ann called as she pulled the curtain back a little. \"Who's there?\" She said a little louder when no one answered. \"Goddamn it...\" Smith groaned as he spoke up, afraid she would wake his companions. \"Its me, Smith... the convict...\" Ann was silent for a moment before replying. \"Did you need to use the bathroom, I'm in the shower so go ahead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't... I just...\" Smith studdered as he took a step back from the door. \"I'll just go back to bed, sorry for bothering you...\" He said as his face began turning red. \"Wait...\" Ann called as she pulled the curtain back a little more. \"Could you... come in here?\" The question had barely passed by Smith's ears before he began immagening all sorts of ways this could play out. He had never had much luck with women, so this was an oppertunity he couldn't pass up. \"You want me to come in? Okay...\" He called back, trying not to sound nervious. He turned the knob and walked into the bathroom after making sure no one had heard them and closed the door behind him. \"I'll be getting out soon, would you hand me my clothes when I do?\" Ann asked in a sweet tone. \"Oh... sure...\" Smith replied as he wiped some sweat from his forehead. \"Thanks, my nurse's scrubs are on the toilet lid and... my bra and panties are in the sink to your left.\" Smith was about to respond when she gestured for him to walk over to the shower with her finger.

He knew what was coming, he was sure of it. \"Look, I like you... but we just met, it wouldn't take a genius to know that you're just-\" He was then cut off as the nurse's arm abruptly reached out and took hold of his own arm. Before he could speak a single word of protest he felt his hand wrap around something soft and warm. In an instant he knew what she had done. \"I like you too.\" Ann sighed as she pulled the curtain the rest of the way back to reveal her nude form. \"A lot.\" Smith was in shock. He had never even held a girls hand or had a first kiss and now he was getting intimate with a woman he had met only hours before. Beads of sweat poured down his face as he felt his pants grow tighter. Without thinking he bent over and kissed Ann on the lips as he wrapped his other hand around her backside. She seemed a bit surprised at first, but quickly embraced him and showed her approval by allowing her tounge to dance around in his mouth. After nearly a full minute they released each other and gazed into one anothers eyes. \"You- you really do... like me...\" Smith smiled as Ann began opening the upper part of his prison jumpsuit. \"Do you like me?\" Ann asked as the prison uniform began sliding off at the top. \"I do.\" Smith responded as they shared another long kiss. Finally, Smith's clothes fell to the floor leaving him only his underwaer to preserve his modesty. \"Oh...\" Ann gasped in a surprised and embaressed tone when she noticed Smith's growing \"excitment\" which was now on full display through his snug undergarments. \"Ahh, what?! Its too small... isn't it?\" Smith stuttered as he tried to cover himself. Ann was quick to pull his arm away and get another good look as she began removing his last bit of clothing. \"Don't worry tiger, its just fine.\" She said with a seductive smile as she yanked his underwear the rest of the way down. Smith was far from muscular and even a bit skinny, but Ann must have liked what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two shared one last passionate kiss as Smith stepped into the shower and wrapped his arms around her. \"Hell of a thing, meeting the girl of my dreams on what might be my last night on earth...\" Ann smiled and raised in eyebrow. \"Then let's not waste our last night. Come here and...\" She trailed off as she guided her lovers stiff manhood to her soaking wet neither regions. Smith was a virgin and truth be told, Ann was too, but somehow they made it work. Smith was gentle at first, pausing occasionly to better read Ann's body laungage and let her guide him along. It was a bit uncomfortable at first, but the smooth motions of their bodies soon became pleasureable. Ann's sensual moans told Smith that he was doing alright for his first time and the rushing water from the showerhead kept their little bonding experience from disturbing their friends. \"I... love... you...\" Ann mumbled between pants as Smith slowed down a bit. He could only grunt in confirmation at this point and was eager to finish. With one final thrust coupled with their moans of pleasure the two finally finished and lowered themselves to a sitting position inside the large shower tub. \"That... was good...\" Ann gasped as she caught her breath. \"Yeah... not bad... yourself...\" Smith managed to reply as he wrapped an arm around her. The two then held each other in their arms and talked for a while about their lives up to that point and what they were hoping to do when this was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother owns a flowershop in Ohio, I visit her every summer.\" Ann said sweetly as she dried herself off with a towel. \"Next year... maybe I could bring you...\" Smith smiled with genuine sencierity for the first time in his life. \"Yeah... yeah, maybe this could be a new start for me. Drug dealing, stealing cars, lying to my family... maybe I- WE could...\" He paused as she kissed him on the cheek. \"Yeah, I think we'll be okay... good night Smith.\" She called as she walked back to her room, leaving Smith to get dressed by himself. \"Yeah, goodnight...\" He replied as he put his underwear back on. When he was sure Eric and the doctor were still asleep he snuck back out into the living room. He knew it would be impossible for him to sleep now, esspecialy with dawn only an hour or so away, but that didn't keep him from dreaming...</span></div></div>",

Finally, he was disturbed from his peaceful slumber by several loud screams and the sound of moving feet. \"Eric! Please get up! ERIC!!!!!\" He had awoken to a horror show made reality, one of the nurses was laying on the floor dead along with the doctor. The barricade that had blocked off the rest of the hospital had been demolished, letting in the mob of undead that had been gathering deeper inside. Smith and the remaining nurse were nowhere in sight, but could be heard further down the hall yelling and fighting the zombies. \"Eric get up!\" Came another yell. Eric couldn't believe he wasn't dreaming, had he really been that tired? Apparently so. The sound of Smith and the nurse yelling in anguish let Eric know they had failed to keep the zombies at bay. Eric got off of the couch just in time for two rotting heads to poke themselves around the corner. He knew there was no hope left, but decided to go out fighting. When he finally went down just minutes later he was able to join 5 fresh new zombie corpses that lined the hallway and waiting room.</span></div></div>",

The biggest gathering was 7 level ones along the other side of the prison yard, all of them clawing and scraping at a window that had been broken open. \"Oh my god...\" Smith stuttered as he watched in horror as someone was thrown out of the window. The person was wearing a tattered prison uniform and was covered in blood. The level ones surrounded him as he tried to crawl away and beganing mauling him. \"What the fuck...\" Smith gasped. \"Nevermind that.\" Eric called to Smith from further down the stairs. \"We need to worry about us.\" He slamed the zombie that was coming at him up the stairs into the wall. It fell over, but still twitched as it bled from the forehead. \"Not dead yet, eh?\" Eric said as he bent down and stabed the zombie in the eye with his shank. It slumped over and went limp. He then pulled it back out and wiped it on Smiths uniform as he came down the steps. Smith just stood there with a blank look on his face and didn't say anything. \"What the hell did you see up there anyway?' Eric asked as he continued down the stairs. Smith was silent for a few seconds before finally saying \"they...\" Eric stoped and turned back around to look at his companion. \"What?\" \"They t-they...killed him.\" \"Who?!\" \"I-I don't know...but...they...\" Smith couldn't finish, he seemed to be in a state of shock. Eric walked back up the steps and began to shake Smith. \"Dammit, we don't have time for this! Snap out of it! We. Need. To. Go!\" Eric shouted as he shook Smith. \"God damn it, move your ass before they start to catch-\" But Eric was cut off as a level one grabed him from behind. \"Shit!\" Eric cursed as he pushed the zombie  back down the stairs. It took it a few seconds, but the zombie began to get back up on its feet which meant it was still alive. To make matters worse, three of the level ones from the floor they had just come from appered at the top of the stairs and began making their way down. \"SMITH!\" Eric screamed into the mans emotionless face. \"We have to go now before they surround us, c'mon!\" Smith didn't move.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we'll run into some zombie strippers and you'll change your mind.\" Eric said with a grin. \"I doubt it.\" Frank said as he rolled his eyes. \"Anyway, we were gonna head over to the warehouse on the other side of the city, Smith here used to run a chop shop there and still has a few cars in storage that we can armor and use to escape this hellhole.

OR we could go around the long way and avoid the larger groups of zombies.\" Smith replied as he took aim at a level one zombie about 20 yards down the street that was walking towards them. \"Well, why don't you ask mr. manners here.\" Eric said as Smith dropped the zombie with a few shots from his AK-47. \"Fine, your call twigboy.\" Smith said.

He was with other survivors now, but he had never fought the zombies at night, having managed to find shelter all the days before.

He figured Eric was still moving in the same direction as before, just taking a different route. If Frank kept moving forward he should run into Eric eventually. Frank made his way around the nearby vehicles carefully and quietly, he didn't want to set off any car alarms or attract any nearby zombies to him. As he was moving around an abandoned pickup truck he nearly tripped on something on the ground. Regaining his balance he reached down to pick up whatever it was. A tire iorn. Frank was no longer completely helpless and with a little more confidence continued his journey through this endless maze. It wasn't long before Frank came upon the first zombie he'd seen in hours, a level two, walking through the narrow paths between the cars. It hadn't seen him and he was able to sneak up on it and bash its skull in with his new weapon. The level two fell to the ground with a thud, its head open and leaking blood from its now exposed skull. It twitched a bit as Frank brought the tire iron back down on its head once more to finish it off, covering himself in blood in the process and looking quite fearce in the dim light from a nearby car's broken headlights. Without saying a word Frank left the corpse of his defeated foe laying in a pool of its own blood and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn't having quite as much luck as Frank, he had run into four level two zombies and a Vampire. His shotgun had made quick work of them, but he was now starting to run out of ammo. \"Shit, where the fuck are they?!\" He almost yelled as he blew away the skull of yet another level two. \"There's a goddamn mob of these strong ones up here and those two are nowhere in sight!\" Eric tried to hurry along after sending the last level two zombie to its maker, only to be confronted with 2 more level two's and a level one as he turned around a car. \"Shit...!\" Eric cursed as he prepared to fire again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the level 2 zombies managed to notice Eric before he had a chance to take it by surprise. It growled and charged towards him. Luckily, the level 2 was still far enough away that Eric could kill it before it got close enough to attack. Eric waited for it to get a little closer so he would have an accurate shot, firing the shotgun only when the zombie came into striking distance. He watched as it fell to the ground and didn't get back up. The level 1 and the other level 2 had begun coming closer as Eric looked back up from the bloody corpse on the ground in front of him. \"Guess you two are next.\" He said as he reloaded his shotgun for the last time. The second level 2 didn't fare any better then the one before it and was soon laying on the ground in a bloody slump next to the first. With the two stronger zombies dead Eric had no problem finishing off the remaining level 1. After checking to make sure that no other zombies were nearby Eric climbed into the back of a truck and sat down. Fighting off that many strong zombies all at once and without any backup had worn him out. He wanted to go to sleep, but knew that if he did he would most likely end up dead. He would just have to wait for one of his friends to find him or go out looking for them himself. He checked his gun to see how much ammo remained. 2 rounds. \"I've only got two shots left, if I go out there now they'll kill me for sure and if I stay here too long they'll just find me again sooner or later...\" Eric thought for a few moments and realised what he must do. It would be a huge gamble, but he had no other choice. He broke the window on the back of the truck with his shotgun and climbed into the drivers seat. The keys were still in the ignition, which was all that Eric needed. He turned the keys and the truck hummed to life. \"Let's just hope this works...\" He said as he turned the headlights on. He pushed down on the gas petal to cause as much noise as possible. This would cause any and all zombies within a mile to come to Eric's exact location...and maybe Smith and Frank too. Before even a minute had passed glowing red eyes began appearing all around Eric in and around nearby vehicles, drawing closer and closer by the second. Eric...</span></div></div>",

Both of the level 2's were fast enough to keep up with him, but the slow level one was quickly left behind. Eric turned around just as one of the level 2 zombies made a swipe for him with its claws. Eric narrowly managed to dodge it and fired his shotgun into the undead monsters face. It fell to the ground and tripped the other level 2 who had been following close behind. \"Take that you piece of shit!\" Eric yelled as the zombie struggled to get back up and resume the chase before its prey escaped. It looked as if Eric would make a clean getaway, but fate had something far crueler in store for him. Just as he turned back around he crashed into the door of a car that had been pushed open by another zombie inside. Eric fell to the ground with a thud and accidentally flung his shotgun under a nearby car. \"Shit...\" He gasped as he struggled to get back up, but his knee was broken and bleeding, making standing up an impossibility. The level 2 however, was finally back up on its feet and ready to finish off the injured survivor. Eric crawled over to the car where he had lost his gun and tried to grab it. Just as he wrapped his fingers around the barrel the level 2 put five sharp claws through his spine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a small family owned market nearby with no boards over the windows or door so the duo decided to check it out and maybe find something to eat. The door had been locked, but the bloodied windows were broken and easy to climb into even with all the shattered glass. The store was pretty small, one long narrow room with a counter and door near the back. There were several bins of rotting fruit along with shelves stocked with all manner of boxes and cans lining the walls. What caught Eric's attention first however, was the wine rack behind the counter that still had several dozen bottles to offer the thirsty survivors. \"Hey Smith, you see that wine rack behind the counter?\" Smith gave him a puzzled look, but replied that he did. Eric grabbed a plastic bag from a nearby dispenser and handed it to him. \"Grab us a few bottles along with whatever good food you can find, I'll see what they have behind that door.\" Smith nodded and hurried over to begin his job while Eric checked the back door. To his surprise it was unlocked and opened quite easily with a quick turn of the knob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stood before Eric on the other side was another doorway... lacking a door and some stairs off to his right. Eric closed the first door behind him and walked past the steps out into the alleyway behind the store where a fat zombie in an apron was digging in a garbage can. Fortunately, it was alone and only a weak level one. Eric grinned wickedly and didn't even bother to sneak up on it. With one quick motion he planted his shank into the back of the man's brain stem and began twisting. A few popping sounds later and the walking corpse was on the ground twitching. Eric finished it with a few powerful stomps to the head and it quit moving. Blood flowed from behind its eyes and Eric pulled his dripping shank out of the dead humans neck. A quick wipe off on his shirt and it was clean and once again ready for action. Eric looked up and down the alley and upon seeing only a few trash cans and fire escapes returned to the inside of the store. \"Everything okay?\" Smith called through the door. Eric opened it and saw Smith had already gotten the bottles of wine and was now picking cans off a nearby shelf. \"Yeah, I ran into a zombie outside, but I took care of him. I'll check the upstairs and meet you down here in ten or fifteen minutes.\" Eric said as he closed the door back without even waiting for Smith's reply, which was muffled by the sound of the door shutting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric walked up the steps slowly and quietly to keep the element of surprise should there be a horde of these things up here. The next floor had only two doors and two windows along with the ever ascending staircase. Eric thought it would be best to just explore this floor and then head back down, he was on a time limit after all. Eric opened the first door to his left and was immediately hit by the sight and smell of a days old corpse laying on the bed in a pool of her own blood. She had a pillow covering her head and a few flies were buzzing over her carved open stomach. Eric about vomited, but quickly regained his composure after he hastily threw a nearby sheet over her. \"Jesus... poor girl...\" Eric said as he moved over to a nearby closet and pulled aside the sliding door. All that was inside were a few shirts, coats, and a shoebox filled with various documents on taxes and the like. The drawers near the bed didn't have much either... only a bible and an unopened box of tissues. Eric left the room and was just about to check the second when he heard something move on the floor above him...</span></div></div>",

All the same he made sure to close and lock the door to the second room behind him as he searched. This room was quite different from the first, arguably for the worse. It was cleaner, smelled nicer, and had a beautiful coat of paint on the walls. It was also clearly a baby's room with a crib sitting next to the wall and various toys laying about. There was even an empty bottle laying next to the crib. Eric paused for a moment, expecting to hear the cries of a baby... only to be surround by a complete silence as he began looking around. There was a working flashlight and a first aid kit inside a box along with some more baby toys, which almost went unnoticed in the eerie quietness. Eric had never had children, hell, he hadn't even had a girlfriend, but he could feel the sadness surrounding this room. For the first time in his life he felt sorry for taking something from someone else. He left the room with what he found and continued back down the stairs to greet Smith, eager to get away from this depressing place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric opened the door to the main part of the store and was happy to find Smith waiting for him next to the window with a full bag of supplies. \"You have any trouble?\" Eric asked as he handed Smith the first aid kit to put in the already overstuffed bag. \"Eh, just one of the slow ones, urg, came in through the window, so I beat him to death with my, er, brass knuckles...\" Smith said as he carefully stuffed the first aid kit into his bag. Eric then noticed the corpse of a police officer laying on the ground over by one of the selves. \"You check him?\" Eric asked as he walked over to the corpse. \"Yeah, all he had was a pair of handcuffs...\" Eric turned him over with his foot to see just how much damage had been done. The poor bastard had one eye dangling from its socket and several broken or chipped teeth. \"Alright, good job then. Let's get out of here before more show up.\" Eric said as walked towards the back door. \"Hey, where you going? The exit's this way!\" Smith called as he pointed to the broken window. \"Yeah, but I think I've found a safer route!\" Eric called back. Smith followed him out into the back alleyway from before which was still free of living zombies. \"See?\" Eric said almost cheerfully. \"If we move through these back allies we'll avoid most of the large groups.\" Smith wasn't smiling when he found out about Eric's idea of a safe route however, and pointed out a glaring flaw Eric had overlooked. \"True, but if we go this way we'll walk right past several stores and likely miss out on collecting a huge amount of useful supplies.\" Eric frowned when he realized his mistake. \"Damn... you're right...\"</span></div></div>",

Eric was glad that Smith had agreed with him, he just hoped he had made the right choice. \"Don't worry, as soon as we find a safe place or better weapons we'll be able to get all the supplies we need. If we had stayed on the streets we probably would have run into a huge group of those fuckers.\" Smith was about reply when he noticed a trash can move up ahead. \"Oh shit, Eric look over there!\" He shouted as he pointed next to a cluster of trash cans up ahead. \"Smith, shut your goddamn mouth before you give away our position!\" Eric whispered in an angry tone. \"Just back me up while I check it out.\" The two men slowly began making their way over to the trash cans when one of them fell over and a skinny zombiefied cat slowly walked out. It shrieked and began running towards Eric as its kittens began crawling out from the spilled garbage behind it. \"Jesus, its a fuckin' cat!\" Smith yelled as he stumbled backwards a bit. Eric kept his cool and silently kicked the monster into the side of a building when it leapt at him. The impact broke two of its limbs and left it almost completely immobile on the ground shrieking and hissing, but Eric refused to finish it off himself. \"Kill it.\" He said calmly to Smith as he watched it twist about on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why don't y-\" Smith began to protest, only to be met with one of Eric's famous death glares. Smith immediately shut his mouth and handed Eric their bag of supplies to hold while he walked over and put an end to the poor cat. \"The kittens too?\" Smith asked as he walked over to the mewing little Beasts who were staring at him with their burning red eyes. Eric simply nodded and Smith did away with them. By the time he was done the entire lower part of his pants and shoes were dyed red. \"Ugh, that's fuckin' nasty!\" Smith complained as Eric handed him back their supply bag and continued walking ahead. \"You... you okay, Eric?\" Smith called weakly as he followed him. Eric didn't respond and simply gestured for him to keep his eyes out for more zombies. \"Yeah, sure...\" Smith said as they quickly exited the alleyway and found themselves on a mostly deserted street. They took cover behind a car as two zombie teenagers wandered aimlessly down the road. When the coast was clear Eric began moving into the next alley across the street, but something seemed to have caught Smith's eye. Eric turned around and was about to yell at him when he noticed what Smith was looking at. Before them was the Sure Shot gun store, one of the best places to buy a reliable firearm in the whole city.</span></div></div>",

When 4 of the massive pieces of wood were torn off the two had just enough room to climb inside. \"Check for a light switch.\" Eric called as Smith hurried inside. The lights flickered and came to life just as Eric stepped down onto the floor inside. \"Good, at least thats something...\" He commented as one of his rare good moods began slowly returning. \"Yeah, except most of the place looks cleared out...\" Smith groaned as he looked at the mostly empty shelves lining the walls of the small store. \"Not quite, just help me look around, I know we'll find something...\" Eric said as he began walking towards the back of the store. \"You look up front and behind the counter, I'll take the back.\" Without another word Smith sat their supply bag down on the counter and began searching. Aside from a few bullets and a couple dollar bills in the register Smith came up empty handed by the time he had checked the counter and shelves. \"Shit, Eric's gonna be pissed...\" Smith whispered to himself as he looked around the room at the empty shelves. \"I just hope he did better then me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he waited for Eric to come back up front Smith pulled out a bottle of wine he had gotten back at the food store and took a long drink. \"At least we still have this food and stuff...\" He took another long drink and sat down on the floor where he began eating an apple he had taken out of the supply bag. Other then the occasional moans of the zombies outside it was fairly quiet and rather peaceful in the little gun store. Of course the silence was quickly broken by Eric loudly asking Smith to come into the back room. He groaned, sat his apple and half-drained wine bottle back down on the table and got up. \"Ugh, what does that bastard want now? Probably stubbed his toe on a table and wants me to help him kill it.\" He slurred as he walked into the next room. \"What is it you want?\" Smith groaned as he resisted the urge to throw up on Eric's shoes. \"Smith, I found... are you drunk?\" Eric asked as Smith wobbled a bit. \"I-I had some... wine and an apple... but I'm okay...\" Eric gave him an odd look and went right back to what he was saying. \"Anyway, I found a magnum with 5 bullets left, a scope for the magnum, and a mini fridge that still has some food in it.\" Smith looked down at Eric's new gun and then across the room where he could seen a small while refrigerator sitting in a corner next to a table with a hunting magazine on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats... that's great Eric. I only found some bullets and about $500 up front.\" Smith moaned as he waited for Eric to yell at him. \"Any bullets for this magnum?\" Eric instead asked in a somewhat friendly tone. It seems finding some food and a good weapon had helped his mood considerably. \"Oh, magnum, uh... I don't know...\" Smith slurred as he dug into his pocket. \"Any of these it?\" Eric looked down at Smith's hand and carefully examined the dozen or so bullets he had gathered. There were four shotgun shells, about half a dozen bullets he didn't recognize, and a single magnum bullet. \"Just one huh? Guess that makes six altogether. It'll do for now, but we'd better find some more if we expect to survive.\" Smith nodded his head and stumbled back into the other room. \"So... should we leave now... or stay here a little longer?\" Eric thought about it for a moment. Smith had raised a good question, would it be better to leave or stay? On one hand they needed to find more supplies as soon as possible, on the other they would be leaving all the food in the mini fridge here if they left now. \"Hmm... I guess we'll...\"</span></div></div>",

After a brief dinner they finished off most of the food stored in the mini fridge to make sure they had enough energy to fight if they needed to. Luckily, the night passed uneventfully and the duo were stirred awake by soft beams of sunlight peeking through the few open spots of the store. Eric and Smith were quick to get up and begin packing so that they could get an early start and hopefully avoid most of the dead wandering outside. Unfortunately, while they slept peacefully a small horde had formed just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing a soft moan right outside the door Eric had decided to peek outside and see how many were there. Most of them looked weak and heavily injured, but one of the zombies caught Eric's immediate attention. Its skin glowed with a soft reddish orange light and it seemed to leave a faint trail of smoke in each of its footsteps as it walked across the road. Eric wasn't sure what it was, but figured that he and Smith could probably handle it. The ten or so other zombies, however, would be a problem. Eric still had his magnum, but it only had 6 bullets and firing it just once would be sure to attract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad is it out there?\" Smith asked as he walked over with their supplies. \"See for yourself.\" Eric replied as he took a step back and drew his magnum. \"Jesus...\" Smith muttered as he watched the zombies walk up and down the road in front of him. Judging by their clothes, three of them were EMT rescue workers and most of the others were victims of serious injuries. It was impossible to guess, but the most likely case was that they were attempting to save people when the zombie infestation hit. Smith moved away from the window as the burning hot zombie glanced in his direction and tried to hide from its sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is with that glowing one? It looked like it was on fire at first, but something is wrong with its skin.\" He asked as Eric walked back to the window with his magnum in hand. \"I don't know, but I say we shoot it first, see what it can do before we move out. It's pretty far away, but if I can get it with only 2 shots I should have just enough ammo to clear a path past the little group in front of the door.\" Eric replied as he looked through the scope at the Pyro as it stared at the front of the gun store. It would easy to get a body shot, but hitting it in the head with only two chances seemed risky. \"Should I take the shot, or do you think we should wait here to see if they leave?\" Eric asked Smith without taking his eyes off the special zombie.

Sadly, the only people there to enjoy the breeze were 3 escaped prisoners, perhaps the only people left alive in the whole city of Bitterwood. The first was a man named Richie, he had short light brown hair and a scar under his left eye. The next man was a tall fellow who was covered in tattoos. His real name was Kyle, but the inmates simply knew him as Spider. Lastly was their unofficial leader, who went by the name Eric. He was the second tallest of the group, but also the strongest. Even Spider, who was well known and feared in the prison they had escaped gave Eric proper respect and followed his every order. They were currently holed up in a ranger outpost near the center of the 500 acre nature preserve. When they had first arrived 3 days ago a Slimer took out the ladder that had gotten them up to the second story, trapping them. Fortunately, the waves of Beasts and a few other zombies that followed the Slimer attack were kept at bay by the 3 hardened criminals. Now, as their third day in this relatively safe location was drawing to a close they began running low on supplies. Their food was gone and they only had one jug of water left. Perhaps even worse then that was the fact that they were almost completely out of ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sat inside the building trying to come up with a plan as his two comrades stood watch over the silent forest from the balcony outside. Both were equipped with decent hunting rifles, but if a strong zombie came along they would be in trouble. After hours of thinking Eric had become exhausted trying to come up with ideas and decided to just call Richie and Spider in for a meeting. The first order of business was to check their remaining supplies and equipment to see what the had to work with. Each man had a backpack that could hold about 10 pounds of equipment each. Spider had a fully loaded hunting rifle, the groups jug of water, a lighter, 2 packs of cigarettes, and a small handgun with no bullets. Richie had a hunting rifle of his own with 2 shots left, a flashlight that had about an hour's worth of battery power left, a Swiss army knife, a switchblade, and a pack of matches. Eric himself had duel handguns (with no ammo), a blue and white bandana, a double-barrel shotgun (also without ammo), and a Playboy magazine. After taking inventory of their supplies Eric began telling them about each of his different plans. After several minutes of discussion and some arguing they managed to come to an agreement.

Eric was the first of the trio to wake up. He got out of his sleeping bag and walked over to the balcony. The fresh light illuminated the forest eerily as it spread slowly over the trees. Eric wasn't normally the type of man who'd enjoy a sunrise on a cool September morning, but was glad to actually have some peace and quiet for a change. That peace would be short-lived, however, as he noticed something on the horizon. It was a large 747 airplane with a huge chunk missing from its side. It bellowed a stream of smoke from its insides as it slowly descended towards the forest below. \"HOLY SHIT!\" Eric yelled as it passed by overhead, its engines thundering so loud Eric didn't even hear the words coming from his own mouth. For a split second it disappeared behind some trees a little over a mile away and a crash that was intense enough to shake the ground was heard. Eric stood in stunned silence as he watched the cloud of smoke rise slowly into the air. Finally, after a fews minutes, a final noise erupted from the downed plane. Its fuel tank had caught fire and exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the the other two prisoners joined Eric by his side wondering what the hell had just happened. Eric didn't say anything at first and merely looked on towards the scene of the crash as the smoke climbed higher. At last he choked out: \"That plane... I saw that plane crash...\" Spider and Richie exchanged confused looks and stared at the spot Eric was pointing at. \"What should we do then...?\" Asked Spider as he shrugged his shoulders. \"Go and check it out...?\" Eric turned around and walked passed both the men and sat down in his seat inside. \"I just watched an entire plane go down right before my eyes...\" He said quietly. \"And you think we should go check it out?\" His words were calm, but Richie could detect fury in his voice as they came out. He knew it wasn't a good idea to get Eric mad and quickly tried to diffuse the situation. \"Eric, are you sure a plane crashed out there? Did... did you see it with your own eyes?\" Eric rubbed his head and looked up at his friend. \"I did. I think... I think there were survivors on that plane. The damn zombies must have gotten on board with them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis temper seemed to be returning to normal as he slowly began to grasp the situation. Richie felt a wave of relief as Eric got back up without breaking anything like he normally did when he was upset. \"Alright.\" He said as he put on his backpack. \"Lets head out, if we wait too long the noise from that crash will attract zombies.\" Spider and Richie quickly put on their own backpacks and waited for further instructions. \"We going to have to get down by climbing on one of the nearby trees. Don't fall, cause I'm not gonna carry anyone with a broken leg.\" The two men nodded and watched as Eric carefully made his way onto a thick branch and began moving down. \"Hurry up.\" He called as he slid down to a lower branch. There were a few close calls, but in a few minutes all three of them were back on solid ground. Eric began walking off as soon as both of his allies were safely down from the tree. \"Um, Eric?\" Richie called ahead to his leader. \"Yeah?\" Came the reply. \"Just where are we headed?\" Eric took a moment to answer, but finally said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So we ARE heading to the crash, huh? Think we'll see any bodies?\" Spider called disinterestedly as he lagged behind his two companions. Eric's temper once again began to rise at the complete lack of sympathy in Spider's voice. \"Just shut up unless you see anything move.\" Eric called back as he brushed aside a large tree branch. \"And be sure not to take your eyes off of the ground, they could be hiding in these weeds and the last thing we need now is someone getting hurt.\" The trio seemed to be having a run of good luck as they walked as quietly as the could manage in the dense forest. Only weak Beast's appeared before them and they were able to avoid the attention of a zombie buck that was making its way through the trees aimlessly. It wasn't long before they came to a small stream that looked to only be one or two feet deep. \"Spider, fill up our jug of water the rest of the way while I have a quick look around.\" Eric said as he walked over to a small tree and began climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view from only ten feet above the ground wasn't great, but Eric was able to see the faint trail of smoke still rising from the downed plane. They were close now, all they had to do was get over the nearby hill and they'd be there. Eric was about to climb back down when he noticed something moving down the hill at an alarming rate. \"Hey Richie, Spider, look out!\" He called as he began moving down towards the bottom of the tree. He looked up as he stumbled onto a weakened branch that creaked as he continued making his way lower, trying desperately to locate the foe he had seen just seconds ago. \"Shit, where is it? Shit, shit, SHIT!\" He cursed as Spider and Richie prepared for an attack that could come at any second. Finally, the Beast showed itself just as Eric hopped to the ground. It was a massive black bear with a huge chunk missing from its side. A few of its ribs and inner organs were even visible in the pale morning sunlight that shone through the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpider was caught completely off guard and was knocked away with a massive paw that sent him flying into the stream as the contents of his torn backpack spilled out into the water. Richie fired his only two shots into its head as it turned around and growled. Blood ran down its face like angry red tears as it charged, apparently mostly unharmed. Richie screamed as its paw began to come down, only to be stopped before it could reach him. Eric had picked up a large tree branch and managed to stop the bear before its attack could connect. \"Big bitch, ain't ya?\" Eric sneered mockingly as the branch began to snap and break under the enormous pressure of the monsters arm. Eric flinched slightly as half of his weapon broke off and sent splinters flying. The bear growled again and Eric swung the the branch with all his might. The force of the blow he dealt cracked the rotting bear's skull and snapped its head back at an unnatural angle. The bear shuttered... and regained its balance just as Eric delivered a punch to its exposed ribs. A soft crack was heard, but nothing else. Eric was at the beast's mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts paw began rising in the air, ready to strike the final blow on its helpless prey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gunshot echoed through the trees and a fresh trail of blood ran down the bears face. It turned around just in time to be caught twice between the eyes by Spider, who was now sitting up in the stream. The cold water washed over him as he glared at the bear with a small bit of blood running down his own head. He fired one final shot and the bear collapsed onto the ground. Eric walked over to it as Richie went to check on Spider. To Eric's immense surprise, the bear still wasn't dead! It didn't breathe and there was no heartbeat, but the otherworldly red light refused to leave its eyes. It let out a soft growl as Eric brought his improvised club down on its head. Richie pulled Spider to his feet and kept a steady hold on him as he got back on his feet. \"That fucker really did a number on me. Sorry... about the backpack.\" He groaned weakly as a pack of cigarettes brushed past his leg. Richie helped him over to the shade of a large tree to tend to his wounds while Eric continued to pound the life out of the bear as it groaned.</span></div></div>",

From what he could tell Spider had suffered a broken rib or two along with a possible concussion and internal bleeding. He made sure Spider was comfortable and walked over to Eric who had just finish turning the bears head into pulp. \"So, how is he?\" Eric asked as he lowered his bloody club. Richie shook his head. \"Several scratches, broken ribs, but what I'm most worried about is that he might have a concussion and internal bleeding. We might be able to help him if we can get our hands on some medical supplies, but there's a decent chance he won't make it through today.\" Eric frowned as he looked over at the hill. \"There's no way we'll get to the city on time... finding that plane may be his only chance. Let's get moving.\" Richie nodded silently and went back over to Spider. \"Can you walk?\" He asked as he helped him to his feet. \"Not by myself, hell, you should probably just leave me...\" Spider said as he coughed up some blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not doing that.\" Eric called as he took his bandana out of his backpack and wrapped it around Spiders still bleeding head. \"You may not last the day, but we're not just gonna leave you.\" Eric said firmly as he continued walking towards the hill. \"Try to keep him awake Richie, if he loses consciousness with a concussion he could fall into a coma.\" It took them a while, but the trio soon made it to the top of the hill without much trouble. Spider and Richie continued talking while Eric moved a little farther ahead to scout out the location. From his vantage point atop the hill it didn't take Eric long to spot the wreckage of the plane. A bit of smoke still lifted into the air over the twisted hunks of metal and flames. It was hard to tell, but Eric was sure he could see a few corpses among the destroyed plane... and some were still moving. Eric hadn't expected there to be any zombies left alive after what he had seen earlier, yet was smart enough to plan ahead just in case.

If it kept up like this the whole city could get completely flooded. \"Heh, maybe the water will wash away all these damn zombies.\" Eric said with a laugh as he lit up another cigarette and began fiddling with the radio settings. As he was messing around one particular frequincy caught his attention. From the sound of things it was a rescue broadcast. \"Citizens of Bitterwood, this is Staff Sargent Devlin of the U.S. Army. We are broadcasting on this emergency frequincy to alert survivours of our position. We have set up a checkpoint on Holland Road 3 miles north of the city as well as at the McKinney motel 8 miles south of the city. We have food, water, and other supplies as well as first aid and have sent several teams into the city to look for survivours. If you come into contact with one of these teams please follow their instrctions and do not branish any weapons or aggressive behavior or you may be shot. If you cannot reach either of the checkpoints provided we advise you to stay in a secure location with no doors or windows if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not make any loud noise and turn off all lights and electricity. While the source of these creatures is unknown we do know that they can be attracted by noise and have at least some form of eyesight. While direct contact is believed to be nonfatal, these beings are extremely dangerous and all contact with them should be avoided at all costs. We wish good luck to you and your families.  This message will repeat until the crisis situation is over. ... Citizens of Bitterwood, this is...\" Eric let the signal play through a second time before turning it off and sitting back in his chair. He took a long drag off his cigarette and began thinking over his options as the rain pounded on the windows outside. The station he was sitting in was near the northeastern side of the city, but Eric didn't feel comfortable heading towards a checkpoint only 3 miles outside the city. By now it was probably overrun... but could he make it to the second checkpoint? It would be hard enough just to stay alive and over 8 miles was a lot of ground to cover even without the large numbers of zombies infesting the inner city.

The way ahead was dark, but some eerily flickering lights provided just enough illumination to see. The trip to the next station would take at least an hour and Eric was tired from fighting his way out of the prison and avoiding all the zombies on his way here. After nearly 45 minutes of uninterrupted walking Eric sat down against the nearby wall and looked back on the events of the past five days. Everyone he had known in prison was either dead... or undead. He honestly didn't care about most of them, those rapists and serial killers had gotten what they deserved, yet couldn't help but feel saddened by the loss of the few buddies he did have. One in particular, Richie, who had been arrested for stealing a car soon became the closest thing Eric had to a friend in his whole life... and now he was gone. Eric popped a few Tic-Tacs into his mouth and remembered the events of that day as they unfolded. It all started out like any other day... then rumors began spreading around the cafeteria of mass rioting going on in the streets. By 3:00 p.m. the prison itself came under attack by the \"monsters\" as the media called them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie was located two cell blocks down from Eric and began fighting for his life the minute the zombies appeared. Eric had been lucky enough to reach him in time to kill a Stalker that had cornered him with a gun he had picked up off one of the dead (and soon to be undead) cops on his way there. The two then met up with Smith, another convict who ran a chop shop, and began fighting their way to the exit. Smith met his end when he accidentally stepped too close to a Digger hole and was pulled underground before Richie or Eric could react, taking with him the gun Eric had lent him. With Smith gone the two had a harder time, but eventually made it to a police cruiser and drove out of the prison... or at least Eric did. Richie had fallen out when was grabbed by one of the Carriers and failed to get free. By the time Eric had realized what happen both Richie and the zombie were dead. It had carried him about twenty feet into the air when he managed to snap its neck, causing them both to fall into the hard pavement below. After going over everything in his mind Eric realized that Richie had probably saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richie... you were the only motherfucker at that place that I cared about... thanks man.\" Eric called out into the darkness as he got back up. The rest of the trip was mostly uneventful, with Eric encountering only a single level one zombie. The poor thing had once been a loving wife and mother, now she was just an obstacle in Eric's way. With one hand he grabbed her and slammed her head into the wall with all his might, causing bits of skull to fall to the ground as the womans blood ran down the wall. \"Excuse me, ma'am.\" Eric said in a cold tone as he left her corpse and continued walking. Pretty soon he could see a bright light coming from the station up ahead. He had made it to his destination safely... but what was in store for him amidst the wreaked subway cars and rotting corpses?</span></div></div>",

She had fought her way there over the course of 3 days. She had been armed only with a shotgun and vary limited ammo, but was able to conserve it and avoided most of the more dangerous zombies. On her way to the shooting range she had killed 4 Swimmers, a siren, over 30 Beasts, 9 level 2 zombies, and countless level 1 zombies. She had managed to defend her house for 2 days, but then a sumo broke through the downstairs wall and almost leveled the whole house, Shannon was lucky to escape. She didn't have a clue what was going on, but she sure as hell wasn't going to get killed by these monsters. She had spent the past 2 hours looking for more guns and ammo, hoping the place hadn't been cleaned out yet. She was in luck as she managed to find 2 small boxes of shotgun shells and a pistol with 3 bullets left. She was thinking of boarding up the place and seeing how long she could hold out, but she knew she'd be better off looking for other survivers and trying to leave the city before the zombies found her. She was about to gather up her things when she heard a thump at the frount door. She quickly grabed her shotgun and ran over to the door preparing for whatever was on the otherside. The door swung open just as Shannon raised her shotgun and prepared to fire. What stood in the doorway was...a surviver! He had long shaggy brown hair, a thick beard, and had a bad cut on his upper lip. He was wearing a bloodstained hunting oufit along with an orange hat. He himself had a shotgun along with an AK-47 straped around his back and his belt was covered in what Shannon assumed were ammo pouches. Both of the survivers simply stood there for a few seconds with their guns pointed at each other. \"For the love of Christ, I could have shot you, you damn fool!\" Yelled Shannon as she lowered her gun. \"A pleasure to meet you too ma'am. The name's Ray.\" The man responded as he lowered his gun as well. \"Mine is Shannon.\" Just as the two were about to walk inside there came a loud noise that seemed to come from the forest off to the south...the zombies are getting closer...</span></div></div>",

He took out a small box that contained ten bullets and tossed it to Shannon. \"Thanks, but I only needed-\" \"Go ahead and keep the box, trust me, you'll need em.\" Ray said as he reloaded his own weapons. \"Need any more shells for that shotgun of yours?\" \"Nah, I found a few boxes when I got here.\" By the time both of them had reloaded their weapons they could clearly hear the zombies outside moving closer. The room they were in now was fairy large with the rile range taking up 2/3 of the room. It only had one window, but it was fairly large and could be a problem. They decided to block off the window with two overturned sofas that had been sitting at different sides of the room. They couldn't block off the hallway with anything, but decided that was best as they planned to leave soon. \"We'll just have to keep a close eye on the door.\" Ray said as he and Shannon got ready to fight off the zombie hordes desending upon them. The zombies could be heard right outside the door now and a few were clawing at the building. What should the survivors do?</span></div></div>",

Shannon and Ray couldn't run now, it was either them or the zombies, someone was going to die here. The first zombie soon made its way through a large hole in the door, it was a level 2. Ray was the first to aim with his shotgun, but Shannon was the one who shot it first with her pistol. The bullet hit it right between the eyes and it slumped over lifeless not even halfway out of the door. \"Wow. You're a pretty good shot.\" Ray said without turning away from the door. \"Yeah, let's just hope your half as good.\" Shannon replied as she put another bullet into her pistol. The zombies outside quickly moved the body away and resumed tearing apart the door. Soon another zombie stuck its decaying head through the door, but this time it was only a level one. Ray got this one with a head shot as it began crawling inside. \"Quick reflexes, you might survive after all.\" Shannon said as the dead zombie was pushed aside to make room for 2 undead chipmunks and a baby deer to get through. \" Well, that's my plan!\" Ray yelled cheerfully as he blew away most of the deers head with his next shot. The 2 chipmunks were quick and managed to get closer to them, only to be killed with a blast from Shannon's shotgun. Things seemed to be going well so far, at this rate Shannon and Ray would run out of ammo before being in any real danger. Soon the zombies managed to bring down the door and attack in greater numbers, but it made no real difference as the two survivors continued to pick them off before they could get too close. In a few minutes the hallway was covered in corpses and the zombies had to crawl over the pile of their fallen brethren just to get away from the doorway. Shannon began to wonder why they didn't attack the window too instead of just rushing to their doom in the narrow passage that she and her companion had no trouble defending. Could they really be this stupid? Or were they setting a trap...?</span></div></div>",

Soon the noise outside grew quieter, the siege was almost over. \"There's only a few left, let's wrap this up!\" Ray called as he began to reload his gun for the final confrontation with the last few zombies outside. \"Yeah, I'll be glad when t-\" Shannon began, but was cut off by the sound of busting wood and something invading their safe zone. It was a Digger. \"Oh shit, what the hell's that?!\" Ray exclaimed as he turned around to face this new horror. The Digger had taken advantage of the distress the fighting above it had caused and snuck up on them unnoticed. Wasting no time, it shot 3 tentacules from its mouth and ensnared Ray. His foes attack caught him by surprise and Ray dropped his gun as the Digger pulled him to the floor. \"Shit! Ray!\" Shannon yelled as she was forced to hold off the newly approaching zombies by herself. Ray could only struggle as his attacker pulled him to his doom, he couldn't even scream as the tentacule around his neck tried to choke the life out of him. \"Damn it, let go of him!\" Shannon shouted as she fired another shot at the door. The zombies were pouring in full force now, their remaining numbers able to attack in larger groups with Ray incapacitated. Shannon wanted desperately to help Ray, but she could barely hold back the zombies as it was. The Digger raised one of its claws as Ray came into striking distance. This was it, Shannon had one last chance to save Ray. If she didn't take a shot now the Digger would kill him, but the zombies weren't going to let up their final assult any time soon.

Shannon quickly killed them without much of a fight, the zombie's assault on the rifle range was finally over. Except it wasn't. Just as Shannon was about to gather up her stuff and leave, something grabbed her leg and wrapped around it. A tentacule! While putting an end to zombies that were an immediate threat she had forgotten all about the Digger that she had let kill Ray. Shannon tried to turn around and kill the last zombie standing between her and survival, but the Digger quickly disabled both of her arms with more of its tentacules. Shannon had one chance left as she was being pulled to her death. She had not dropped her shotgun and if she could aim it in time she might get a clear shot at its head. Just as she was about to be pulled underground she got a good look at its head and raised her gun as best she could to fire. Unfortunately, when she tried pulling the trigger nothing happened. \"WHAT?!\" Shannon thought to herself as she was pulled under. \"I just reloaded this thing!\" She wouldn't live long enough to realize that while the gun was indeed loaded, it was also jammed with one of the Diggers severed tentacules. The one that first grabbed her foot was a simple distraction. While Shannon was worrying about being captured the Digger had been disarming her only weapon.

She rushed over to her captured friend and kicked the Digger's claw away right as it brought it down to finish off Ray. The Digger quickly made another swipe at her with its other clawed hand, but she was able to leap out of the way and catch herself on her free hand. With the Digger's defences down Shannon finally had a shot at its head. And she took it. Although it was much harder to hold a gun up and aim with one hand, Shannon managed just fine. She squeezed the trigger on the shotgun as tight as she could and fired a single blast at her target. She wouldn't have a second chance, this would be it, if this attack missed the Digger would get a free shot at her vitals. Luckily, she had hit her target... right in the head. Shannon landed on her feet as bits of brain and skull splashed onto the walls and ceiling. Ray fell to the floor as the tentacules were severed from their owner. He would have confessed an unending love for Shannon right then and there if he had not been unconsious. As the headless Digger's body slid back underground Shannon turned back towards the hallway. A level 2 was just a foot away from her and was quick to swing its claws at her face, but she was able to duck under them just in time. Spinning around as she got back up let her get in a powerful blow from the butt of her shotgun that sent the level 2 flying into the last few zombies left, knocking them all to the ground. The five seconds were up by now, Ray was free, the Digger was dead, and Shaanon was still alive and kickin ass. With all the real danger gone Shannon was able to have some fun as she mowed down the last of undead with a smile on her face.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, all she heard was the cool night air blowing through the trees. She continued moving north down the shooting range's driveway and stepped out onto the abandoned dirt road. On the other side above a drainage ditch she could see an old sign in the darkness which read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;----- Bitterwood city limits 7 miles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----&gt; Firemare gas station 1 mile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust below that someone had scratched:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeave the city.

She wasn't sure what it meant, but had a feeling it might be worth checking out. She looked in both directions and listened once more for sound. Again, all she heard was the peaceful sounds of the air swirling through the trees. She shook Ray a little to try and wake him up. No response. It looks like she'd be making this decision alone.

The dirt road leading back towards Bitterwood went uphill for about half a mile before connecting to the main road which had much less of an incline. There were several gravel driveways that led deeper into the surrounding woods, but since Shannon had no way of knowing how far back they went or how many zombies might be inside she kept moving along the main road looking for a place to rest. About an hour later, just as Shannon was about to fall over from exhaustion, she spied a working light up ahead inside a window. After getting a little closer she saw that the whole house was lit up, perhaps the only place with power for miles. Best of all, though, was the fact that it was located only about 15 yards off the road up a small hill. There was even a large red truck parked in the driveway. Making sure to say out of view of the window Shannon walked up and checked the mailbox. 375 Sparrow rd. The placed seemed innocent enough and she did need a rest... yet something told her it would be best to just move on. There was something wrong here, something very wrong. What will she do?</span></div></div>",

At this rate she would be at the gas station in about half an hour. As she moved along she was sure to keep an eye out for any trace of red in the shadows. She and Ray would be easy prey like this and she wasn't going to let those bastards get them if she could help it. Her pistol was easily accessible and fully reloaded, but her shotgun wasn't. One or two weak zombies right now wouldn't be much of a problem. If she were to run into a large group, however, she would have a hell of a fight on her hands. Luckily, she hadn't seen a single zombie since she left the shooting range, not even a Beast. After ten more minutes had passed she noticed something odd up ahead of her. It was to far away to be seen clearly, especially at night. She walked a little slower and tried not to make any noise as she got closer. When she was only a few yards away she was able to tell what it was. An overturned pickup truck was laying in the ditch off to the side of the road. The windows were broken, the side was scratched to hell and, Shannon couldn't be sure, but she thought she saw some blood on the passenger side window. It mush have been quite a gruesome wreak, she doubted if anyone was still alive inside. Shannon was about to move on when she thought she heard a voice. It was soft and gentle, like a child's voice. She could have sworn it said \"Help meee...\" This can't be real, there was no way a kid could have survived that crash... and yet... it seemed that one just might have. Shannon listened again. A few minutes passed... nothing but the ever-present sound of the wind in the trees blowing softly in the night...</span></div></div>",

She walked over to the passenger side window and looked inside. In the darkness she could make out two figures. One was suspended from its seat. He must have been the driver, still wearing his seat belt... not that it had done him any good. The smaller figure was laying on the ceiling of the truck and was obviously a child. He seemed to be wearing a hat and his right leg was twisted, broken, and caught on something near the dashboard. The horrible sight was all Shannon could bear. She almost tore her gaze away and moved on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom deep within the darkness of the destroyed vehicle two small eyes opened wide. They glowed a bright red and illuminated the face of the child who had just returned to life. The freshly revived creature smiled at Shannon, a smile filled with sharp teeth and not a hint of joy. Shannon stood motionless, her mind nearly snapped trying to piece together what was going on. All she could do was make a noise that sounded like a soft moan as the Stalker began to free itself from its confinement. Sounds of ripping and tearing filled the air... followed by the sound of a snap and blood gushing from where the boys leg had been. Shannon came to her senses and tried to back away, but it was too late. The Stalker leapt with superhuman agility and tackled both Shannon and Ray to the ground, apparently missing a leg didn't slow the monster down at all. Its claws were ripping through Shannons flesh before she had fully realized what had just happened. The last thing she saw before passing out was the zombie making its way over towards an unconscious Ray...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All this zombie shit is messin with your head. Focus.\" She remembered what her commanding officer had said when she first arrived at boot camp. That no matter the situation, it could always get worse and falling apart would lead to death. Only by keeping your mind on your current objective would you be able to survive. Shannon had found this advice very useful during her time in Iraq, without it she might've died like some of her friends. The memories of what she had seen and experienced with her comrades provided a bittersweet escape to her situation and allowed her to remain calm and collected as she moved down the road. Her friends had died with honor and she sure as hell wasn't going to disgrace their memory by whining about the hand she had been dealt or running away like a coward. If the zombies did get her, she would go down fighting. With new resolve and determination she continued onwards. After another ten minutes had passed she came to the gas station, sitting innocently on the side of the road as if nothing was wrong. It even seemed... welcoming in a creepy sort of way. It was pretty nice for being located in the middle of nowhere, no blood or dead bodies, and it even had a small garage off to the side. Shannon half expected some friendly attendant or mechanic to appear from inside and greet her with a smile as she walked past an abandoned semi truck parked in front of the building. She opened the door slowly and was startled when a small bell rang, but fortunately no one was around to hear it. She walked into the dimly lit room and laid Ray behind the counter where he would be safest until he woke up. Shannon didn't think anyone was around, but decided it was best to quickly look it over and see if she could find anything useful. She left her shotgun with Ray so she could travel light and made sure her pistol was still fully loaded. The last thing she did as she walked off was grab a plastic bag, intending to have it full of supplies by the time she returned.</span></div></div>",

The first thing she did was fill the bag half full with the various snacks that were lining the shelves. After she had what she was sure was enough for a few days she headed towards the back near the the freezers. Several bottles of liquid shone brilliantly in the dim light. Everything from sports drinks to beer were on display waiting to be enjoyed by whoever was lucky enough to find them. Shannon filled most of the rest of the bag full of energy drinks and water and grabbed a beer for herself. It wasn't cold as the power must have been out for days, but it was the most refreshing drink Shannon had had in her entire life. She downed the last of the bottle and tossed it aside. She still had a little room in her bag... should she look for more supplies outside or in the garage?</span></div></div>",

Do you know where we might find someplace safe?\" Ray scratched his head for a moment before answering. \"I'm afraid not, hon. I just came out this way on hunting trips every month or so. I think there's a small town further down the road, but I don't know if its safe...\" Shannon and Ray stood silent as they thought over their options. \"Hell, It'll be daybreak soon, so I don't see any point in resting. Let's try to find that town you mentioned.\" Shannon said as she dug a few energy drinks out of her bag. She tossed one to Ray and they began moving further down the road, away from the gas station and candy store that looked like something you might see on a postcard or calendar. They could only hope this town they were headed to was in as good a condition, and more importantly, safe. The road was dark and the two were still exhausted from their ordeals, but they kept a positive attitude. Just as the sun began rising about an hour later the forest around them started to wear thin. Soon enough they were walking down a road not lined by trees, but fields covered in wet, dewey grass and surrounded by barbed wire fences to keep the livestock in. Too bad all the livestock were now dead or perhaps zombiefied. The two lone survivors slowed their pace a little and took the time to view their now more vast surroundings carefully. They could see much farther ahead, but so could the zombies, if anything they would now have to be more vigilant. They came to a downed power line that was laying across the road which they were able to simply step over, yet couldn't help but feel was a bad sign. Finally, the two came to a driveway that led up to a farmhouse about a mile off the road. Next to it was a barn and a large pond with a dock. It seemed safe and they did need a rest... what should they do?</span></div></div>",

Think you can handle that, hon?\" Shannon gave him a thumbs up as she moved a nearby barrel into place against the door. \"Okay then, this time I'll be the one who rescues you.\" Ray said, determined to prove his worth to his ally. Once he reached the upper floor he moved quickly and silently to the front window and took careful aim with his shotgun. The thing was almost to the door, he couldn't let it get in no matter what. The air was soon filled with the sound of several loud blasts as Ray emptied his mid-range weapon into his foe. The Deathtouch took the full force of every hit, causing it to stumble backwards onto its back. Ray was sure his work was done as he surveyed the damage he had dealt the monster. Two rounds had torn away half its face and the rest had reduced its body to swiss cheese which caused a thick redish-black liquid to pour from its wounds. Strangely the mist around it seemed to grow as it bled and it was soon struggling to get back to its feet. \"No fuckin way...!\" Ray gasped as he began to franticly reload his weapon. He had almost fully reloaded the shotgun when his fingers came back empty after digging through his shotgun shell pouch. These would be his last shots... and he'd damn well better make them count. Before firing again he shouted a warning down to Shannon. \"That thing is still alive, get away from the door. I don't know how it survived my attack, but it did and its starting to spew more of that noxious gas shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Shannon couldn't believe her ears, she clearly heard Ray empty his gun into that thing and drop it. How could it be getting up now? She decided to worry about these thoughts later, however, when a thick red mist began filling the interior of the barn through the cracks in the door. \"Ugh, shit!\" Shannon cursed as she quickly began making her way up the ladder. As she climbed she heard several more shots ring out... along with the sound of tearing flesh. Ray had once again unloaded his weapon into the zombie, hopefully with better luck this time. Shannon quickly joined him at the window and looked down at their enemy. It was harder to see in the cloud of gas now erupting from its mangled innards, but both survivors could clearly make out twitching movements. The thing was still alive. \"Fuck...\" Shannon gasped under her breath. \"Well thats it, I'm out of ammo.\" Ray said flatly. He could visibly be seen sweating now as he tracked the movements of the Deathtouch as it tried to get closer to the door. \"There's only one idea I have left...\" He said quietly. \"That damn things gas is filling this place fast, in another few minutes we'll suffocate, but we can't leave through the front door. The only other way is out the window on the other end of the barn, I saw some bails of hay lined up along that side when we started walking out here. We should be able to jump down safely, but while we're getting back up that thing could move around the barn and kill us. Ultimately, one of us will have to stay behind to distract it while the other makes a run for it.\" He stood silently waiting to hear Shannon's reaction as he kept an eye on the Deathtouches movements. Shannon opened her mouth and in a grim voice replied. \"Damn it... you're right. So... who... who gets left behind?\"</span></div></div>",

You get yourself the hell out of this place.\" Shannon was about to argue against his decision when a cough escaped her lips, the smoke was getting worse. \"You're still a pretty young thing...\" Ray said as he ran a hand through her hair. \"I'm not gonna let you end your life in a place like this. Get out of here, survive, and don't let this beat you. Use the life I'm giving you for something.\" Shannon spoke no words, she didn't have to. Ray knew exactly what see was about to say. She leaned in and kissed him on the cheek before turning around and walking towards the other window. \"I know.\" Ray said with a smile as he began to make his way down the ladder for the final time. Once on the ground floor again Ray grabbed a pitchfork he had seen laying against the wall when they came in. Just as he was about to open the door he heard a few parting words from Shannon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay smiled one last time, flicked his cigarette onto the ground, and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single scream echoed across the farm as he made his final stand against a foe he had no hope of defeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon took a deep breath, closed her eyes and leapt from the window. She felt as if the entire would had disappeared as she plummeted downwards. If she missed the hay it would all be over. Ray would have sacrificed himself senselessly, she would be dead, and nothing they had done over the past 24 hours would matter. For perhaps the first time in her life she prayed for help, she didn't want to do this alone. The next sound she heard was that of her body making contact with the ground, which thankfully was covered by about two and a half inches of hay. She hurt all over, but she was overjoyed to be alive. She struggled to get up and to her surprise... she could! Her feet returned to solid ground as she forced herself to stay upright and keep moving. By this point she was moving on will alone and had almost no idea of where she was going. She rounded the edge of the barn just in time to see a severed red hand crawling in her direction. She turned away from it and jogged as fast as she could to escape it. After what felt like hours her own hand came to a doorknob, which she turned quickly in her frenzied state of mind. Barely retaining the presence of mind to close the door back behind her she entered the farmhouse. She began climbing the nearby stairs and was soon on the top floor. She darted past a bathroom and by sheer luck stumbled into the master bedroom. She let out a deep sigh as she collapsed on the bed and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't remember exactly what had happened earlier this morning, but she had somehow either dropped or lost it on her way inside. She was defenseless, she was heartbroken, and she was alone in a strange house. A zombie could have walked into the room at any minute while she was out and had a free kill. She pressed her head into the sheets and tried to think. She had decent hand-to-hand combat skills and could take out a level one, but if anything else crossed her path she was as good as dead. After sitting there for a half hour in her own misery she finally began to cry. Tears flowed down her face for the first time in over a year. She wasn't sure if she was crying because she had finally realized that Ray was gone, she would probably be next, or the shame of self pity. She wiped her tears away and got up off the bed. She gave herself a hard smack across the face to snap herself out of it. She was beginning to let things get to her... and she knew she was better then that. \"Ray... Tina... Brad... Jerry... Alan... Greg...\" She moaned quietly to herself as she regained control of her emotions. \"My squad mates, my savior, my... friends... I'm through letting people down. I promise...

Quickly, she aimed her AK at the entrance and prepared to fire, but the figure that had been moving just inside the door soon revealed itself and Shannon froze. There, standing in the early shadows of the evening was Ray. His body was intact and almost looked human, the only revealing feature that told Shannon he was a zombie were his glowing hate-fill red eyes. He let out a deep and saddening moan as he shuffled forward, his former life completely forgotten. He was only a level one and posed no real threat to Shannon, but could she really kill him? He had given his life for hers, he had spared her the fate of becoming one of the walking dead.

He took a final step and fell over dead, this time permanently. Shannon walked over to check his body, he had a few bullets she could use for her Ak-47 in one of his bullet pouches along his belt, along with a few other different types. She put the ammo in her pockets and bowed her head in a moment of silence for her friend. After she had moved his body to the inside of the barn and covered it with a tarp she continued down the driveway and back onto the main road. The short trip to the store was uneventful and no other zombie showed its face after Ray appeared. The store itself was little more than a tiny mom and pop grocery store that was likely going out of business if the colorful paper signs in the windows were to be believed. The place barely even had a parking lot with only enough spaces for 12 cars, give or take. Shannon knew that if it had any survivors inside it, however, it could be the most valuable building for miles. She knocked on the front doors and tried to see inside, but nothing answered her or even moved. It didn't help that the only thing she could see on the inside were a bunch of shopping carts lined in a row. She stepped away from the door for a second and looked further up the road. There was a burned down church up ahead and beyond that Shannon could make out a few buildings in the darkness. That must be the town Ray was talking about. She was about to move on when she realized that their must be a back door to this place. She could try that... or she could move on to the town.</span></div></div>",

She mowed dow the 3 level one zombies that had been hiding inside the burned church. Unfortunately, the trigger of the gun clicked harmlessly as the last zombie fell. She had destroyed her attackers, but was now out of ammo and defenseless. \"Well shit.\" She groaned as she walked up the steps and through the burned doorway. \"I just hope there arn't any more inside...\" The interior of the destroyed building was like something out of an old painting. The stained glass windows were broken and the roof was completely gone, revealing several glittering stars that lit up the inky black sky. Despite the intense fire damage, it was beautiful. Shannon decided to look around to see if she could find anything, all she needed was one good weapon and she could go. After a few minutes of digging through burned boards and ash she found a small knife. It was strange, the blade seemed to be made of silver and the handle had a weird design on it. What was most peculiar about it however, was that it seemed completely undamaged by the fire and was shining like it was brand new. Shannon decided she was better off not asking questions and should just be glad she found something. The church was certainly interesting, but seemed to be empty...

She couldn't leave yet. If she had found a knife just sitting here in the debris who knows what else she might find. She decided to check the altar next, which was relatively untouched by the huge blaze that had consumed the church. Upon checking the back she found a scorched bible and what seemed to be a diary of some kind. Sadly the bible couldn't be read from the damage done and the diary was missing its key. \"Oh well, guess I'll check the back room. Maybe I'll have more luck in there.\" She said hopefully as she walked through another burned doorway. The back room was fairly simple, it only had a bed, a ruined chair, and a small singed table inside it. Shannon was about to turn around and leave when something caught her eye. The bed was positioned oddly, as if someone had been moving it. \"What's this...?\" Shannon asked as she pulled the bed off to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she turned to look under where it had been she almost let out a scream in surprise. There was a cellar doorway right in front of her. It had the same strange markings as the knife she had found... along with what looked like a stylized demon head in the center. \"Something tells me this wasn't a normal church...\" Shannon said grimly as she opened the doors. A foul scent filled the air as the large wooden doors fell to the floor, opening a gateway to deep within the church. Shannon took a deep breath and began walking down the steps before her. When she got to the ground floor she found herself in a small dark hallway lit only by strange candles with glowing red flames. She walked slowly and quietly with the knife out in front of her, ready to strike at anything that jumped out at her. When she came to the end of the hallway she found herself standing in the center of a small square room with three doors. The one on the left was a steel door with chains covering it, preventing anyone from getting inside. The door in the center and the one on her right, however, were just simple wooden doors she could easily kick down if turning the knob didn't work.

The hallway that stood before her was even more narrow then the one that led her here, but it still had those same red candles providing illumination. Shannon prepared herself for whatever waited for her and began walking. At the end of the hallway was a set of old wooden stairs that creaked and groaned as she carefully descended them. Once she got to the bottom she followed one last hallway to another door. This one wasn't just any wooden door, however, it had the same pattern as the cellar doorway and  was made of metal. Shannon turned the handle and to her surprise, the door opened with a loud groan. A blast of cold air immediately hit her in the face as she stepped inside the large rectangular room, causing a chill to run down her spine. The inside was truly horrific, dried blood lined the walls, satanic looking symbols were etched all over the place, and in the center was a large alter overlooking several benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire place looked like some kind of giant twisted church you'd expect demons to worship at. For perhaps the first time since this whole thing started Shannon felt truly horrified of her enemies. She walked down the center past the rows of empty seats and up to the alter. A large challis filled with blood set upon it along with a leather book with strange symbols on it. Yet it was hardly noticed by Shannon as she looked ahead to what was just beyond it. Rows of tables were lined up next to strange machines. Over half of them with grotesque human remains lying on their surfaces. Shannon felt sick to her stomach as she walked past them, unable to take her eyes off the mangled corpses. More than one table didn't even have a human on it, only blood and bits of gore. When she finally got to the end of this horrible little tour she threw up against the wall and slumped to her knees. She was shocked that any thinking human could be capable of such atrocities, yet here they were. Shannon slowly got back to her feet and forced herself to move on. She soon came to another set of stairs that led to the upper floor that overlooked the rest of this floor. There was only one door at the top for her to open and at this point she didn't want to, but couldn't bring herself to leave it. What was on the other side wasn't any more horrors, thankfully, but still more stairs. She could go up... or down...</span></div></div>",

Not one, but TWO helicopters were circling the store, which was now in flames and surrounded by a growing mob of zombies. One of the two helicopters was an Apache complete with hellfire missiles and a powerful machine gun, the other was a simple civilian transport helicopter with no weapons. Inside and outside the store the gunfire was audible as the last few survivors for miles fought for their lives. Once she got within 30 yards Shannon could see that the parking lot was one big pile of corpses, both human and zombie. Knowing that she had no hope of facing the mob surrounding the store with just a knife Shannon waited for the Apache to thin their number a bit. After only a few minutes, however, it became apparent that for every one of the ghouls that went down two more would take its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this rate the people inside the store would be overwhelmed and the helicopter would run out of ammo. There was nothing Shannon could do, but watch as the zombies kept pouring out from their hiding places as they continued their ghastly siege. Shannon felt a tear roll down her cheek, it was all for nothing, Ray had died for nothing, the people fighting for their lives would die for nothing, and soon after she would die for nothing, cold and alone out in the middle of nowhere. She had come so very far... for absolutely nothing. In a fit of anger and frustration she plunged the knife into the ground, cutting her hand in the process. Then, something truly amazing happened. The blade grew blood red and seemed to absorb the blood that had fallen on it. Shannon opened her watery eyes and stared at the blade and then her hand. What had she just done? The zombies began to move away from their target... and towards Shannon!</span></div></div>",

It was at this moment the pilot of the Apache saw his chance as well, and took it. He fired one of the helicopters few remaining hellfire missiles at the tightly clustered group of zombies. Shannon barely noticed it though, even as it whizzed by mere feet above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud boom and dirt and grass was sent flying high into the chilly night air. The force of the explosion nearly knocked Shannon down, but she kept from stumbling and made it to the front of the store where a small group of people where exiting to see who their savior was. They weren't former soldiers like Shannon, they were just ordinary folks, moms and dads, best friends, innocent kids. They all had weapons of some sort, but their bloody clothes and smiling faces shown that they were glad that the nightmare was almost over. The civilian helicopter made a quick landing amidst the gore-coated parking lot and some military officers began loading people up while the Apache finished mopping up the nearby stragglers. Shannon was the last on board, making sure that no one got left behind. One in the air she began talking to the people she had just help save. They talked bout everything from friends and family to the loved ones that didn't make it through this disaster. Some tears were shed and some people smiled for the first time in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon took one final look out the window of the helicopter as it flew away from the city she had called home... and marveled at the beautiful sunrise that began a brand new day...</span></div></div>",

The zombies were created using forbidden darks arts and talismans of ancient and great power. The reason given for these crimes went on record as \"Being the best thing for humanity.\" In the brotherhoods own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Shannon Hawking, who discovered one of their many secret bases along with one of their evil talismans, a ritual knife, the goverment was able to put a stop to the spread of zombies. Not many details are known at this time and many of the brotherhood are still unaccounted for, including their leader, but it is safe to say that things will soon be returning to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the year 2012 on the anniversary of this terrible event a memorial was erected on the site of the first attack. Inscribed upon it are the names of everyone who lost their lives in the fight for survival. One such name, Ray, is looked upon every week by Shannon, who brings flowers for the dead along with her husband, whom she married a year after the ordeal. Shannon is still occasionally haunted by the things she saw and heard during that horrible time, but is enjoying her life with her new husband and has never been happier.</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that with the dim lighting Shannon could only see about 10 feet in front of her. The steps made no groans or creaks as she made her way down them, which deeply unnerved her. No noise but the sound of her own breathing... and heartbeat. She kept the knife at her side, ready to carve up anything that attacked her... if anything attacked her. It got colder the deeper she went and she soon found herself shivering. as she watched her every breath escape her lips slowly. When she finally came to another metal door with the same pattern as the two before she actually felt relieved. She pulled the massive door open slowly and found herself in what looked like a research facility. There were several hallways and doors that led to rooms with big glass display windows, some of which were smeared with blood, broken, or both. A lone bit of bloody graffiti covered one of the walls reading \"The end has come. Judgement day is here.\" in bold letters. Shannon began walking down one of the halls, trying her best not to look inside the windows at the horrid experiments contained within. Up ahead was a table with 2 body bags laying on it. Small body bags. Shannon bit her lip and felt a tear roll down her face. \"For fuck's sake... what kind of monsters...?\" She couldn't bring herself to finish and kept moving until she came to yet another flight of stairs that connected this floor with the one below it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon took one last look behind her at the empty hallway and moved down the stairs slowly and carefully. She didn't trust this place. The lights were still working, it was clean and sterile except for the blood and corpses, and, worst of all, it was completely empty. The bottom floor was no better then the one above it and was, in fact, even worse. Piles of body bags were littered about, including a room filed with at least a hundred or so, all completely visible through the large glass windows. Up ahead a corpse was leaning against a wall, an old one judging by its state of decay. His gender was only determinable by reading the I.D. badge on the shirt he was wearing under his lab coat. In his hand was an 8mm handgun and in his head was a single hole from a bullet fired by said gun. Shannon looked away as she pulled the gun from the dead man's cracking fingers and checked it. It had four bullets left. Shannon took it with her and continued on, wondering what horrors were still in store for her. She made it through two more hallways and came to a big steel door that required an identification badge of level 3 or higher. Was that corpse's I.D. badge three or higher? She didn't know, but didn't want to have to go searching for a different once in this fucked up place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

If she wanted to get inside she would need to find a badge that she knew was level 3 or higher. With a sigh she turned around and walked over to the nearest room and looked inside the big glass window. There were two corpses inside along with some blood smeared on the walls and floor, but unlike most of the other rooms it look vaguely like a small office. There were two desks with papers scattered about them along with two computers and even a bookshelf. \"Guess I'll start in here...\" Shannon said as she opened the door with a loud creak. The smell of rotten fruit and meat immediately hit her in the face which forced her to pinch her nose as she began looking. \"Jesus... what the hell were they doing in here?\" She groaned as she walked over to the first desk and opened the top drawer. Inside were some research papers and a tape recorder. Intrigued by the thought that it might explain some of what was going on she pressed the play button and listened as a young man began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Project Alpha research journal number one, Dr. Clark reporting. Day 001, subject 493 has shown an interesting reaction when placed in a chamber with the gas. Remember to take notes as the brotherhood will surely expect us to duplicate the results of this test in the near future... and we cannot fail them. ... Day 002, subject 493 has once again shown the same reaction as before. We seem to be making steady progress. ... Day 005, subject 493 has ceased moving and only shows mild stimulation when exposed to the artifact. If we do not figure out why soon we'll be set back by several days. We cannot afford to lose the research data when we are so close... I must not let this happen... ... Day 007, subject 493 is now deceased and refuses to reanimate. WEEKS of our progress are now lost... ... Day 011, we have replicated the experiment with subject 494 and all seems to be going well... hopefully we will succeed this time. ... Day 012, subject 494 has met with the same fate as 493, damn it all! We cannot lose another one... I am taking precautions to ensure that our next subject succeeds...\" *click* The recorder had reached its end with the rest of the tape blank and unused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What WERE they doing down here...?\" Shannon asked again as she sat the recorder down on the desk next to a chart of some sort. She then resumed to looking for the badge she needed as questions piled up in the back of her mind. The rest of the first desk was empty except for more papers and the second only had another tape recorder in it. Shannon set it on the desk next to the first one and hesitantly checked the two bodies. Both had badges, but were only level two as indicated by the number in the bottom right corner. Shannon let out another sigh and looked back at the second tape recorder. She picked it up and was quite surprised to find it was much longer then the first and would likely take several minutes to listen to... What should she do?</span></div></div>",

Day 006, subject 493 has only gotten worse, if we lose it now we'll be set back by weeks... there must be something I can do... ...

We were so close... so close... and now subject 494 has failed as well. Tomorrow I will contact our superiors and find out what they want us to do next... ... Day 013, Clark has been replaced by Marcus, who was flown in from the brotherhood H.Q. Hopefully, with such an enlightened mind overseeing us we will finally find success. ... Day 014, subject 495 has improved and adapted even faster then the previous two! Dr. Marcus is simply amazing, at this rate our productivity will be doubled by the end of the month. ... Day 017, today our comrades made a breakthrough with project Omega. I feel happy for them, but this will only increase the brotherhood's expectance of us to complete project Alpha as soon as possible. ... Day 019, project Alpha phase one complete, moving on to phase two. ... Day 026, things are moving slow, but thanks to Marcus we'll soon be done with phase two. ... Day 028, phase two is complete, today we will move onto the third and final phase. I can hardly contain my excitement!\" *click* That was the end of tape two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon got up and walked back out into the hallway with things seeming a bit more clear. \"These zombies seem supernatural in nature, but these tapes mentioned experiments...\" She said to herself as she headed towards the next room. \"Things don't add up... if these things were created by scientists who worked here, then why the hell do they have glowing eyes and seem so satanic and otherworldly? Could... could this brotherhood have used some type of magic to make these things? God, the more I find out, the more things don't make sense... but I will get to the bottom of this...\" Shannon opened the door to the next room and was pleased to find it smelled a lot nicer then the last. Probably because there weren't any dead bodies in this one. Shannon walked over to an overturned desk to begin looking when she came across yet another recorder. This one was short. Very short, only about ten or so seconds long... if even that. Should she play it or keep looking for that badge she needs?</span></div></div>",

It didn't look like she'd find anything else here so she might as well play the tape. Who knows, maybe it held a clue about the origin of the zombies. She clicked the play button and was a bit startled to hear the loud scream of a young woman as a panicked man began talking as quickly as he could. \"Damn it, this is Marcus! There's no time to talk, if you find this know that we're all evacuating to the outer chamber! If any of you need it I hid a level 3 security badge in room 023 in the-\" *click* It cut off right there without revealing any more. Shannon groaned as she threw the recorder to the floor. \"Damn it, just a few more seconds and I would have found out... Oh well, I'll probably be able to find it with the information I got anyway.\" With that she went back outside and checked the door. Sure enough, there was a number labeled on the access control. It read \"042\" in bold blue paint just above the open button. \"So this one was 42... I guess that means if I head back towards the entrance I'll find number 23.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon carefully made her way back towards the stairs that brought her here while carefully reading the numbers of each door she passed. \"032... 031... 030... 029...\" She walked quickly past the corpse that had the gun on him and began walking back upstairs. \"If the numbers keeping going along as they have then door number 23 should be somewhere up here.\" When Shannon reached the upper floor she was surprised to see a zombie scientist shambling towards her. She had gotten so caught up in finding that badge and figuring out where the zombies came from she had completely forgotten that she was still in the middle of the resulting apocalypse and fighting for her life as she tried to escape. The young woman in the lab coat groaned when she saw Shannon and began shuffling over towards her. \"Sorry bitch, but you're in my way.\" Shannon said coldly as she raised her gun to fire. Just before she could pull the trigger the woman's low moan grew into a loud yell. \"No, damn it!\" Shannon yelled as the bullet left the barrel and made its way through the Siren's brain with ease. A trail of blood spattered and ran down the walls as a chorus of growls echoed throughout the facility. There was no time to think, Shannon would have to make a quick decision...</span></div></div>",

Humans, normal operating, living, breathing humans. About 20 of them spreading themselves throughout the area of the old 2 story church, cautiously keeping their shotguns and rifles close. Most of them moved around the church, patrolling their stronghold, prepared at all times for any surprises. Some of the more burly looking ones lugged along gigantic storage boxes, containing things ranging from packaged food to ammunition. One that caught her attention most was one of the men standing at the porch. A man with curly brown hair and facial hair, suited in what seemed like a prison inmate outfit, oversaw the production. Perhaps he was the leader of the entire gang. Which seemed rather strange since it had only been a week since the outbreak. It didn't really matter. Shannon was just glad they still had blood flowing through their limbs.<br>\r\n-<br>\r\nOne of  the less fit of them all stood guard at the balcony . In an instant, he caught Shannon from the corner of his eye.  For a moment, he was out of formation, completely surprised. It had been quite a while since they had a zombie attack. 3 hours without any sign of the undead bastards. It was record breaking. He re-gripped his hanging sniper rifle. He looked side to side desperately, unsure of what to do. It didn't take long for him to snap back to reality, running the protocol through his head. Oh yes, he remembered. He had the easiest job there. <br>\r\n-<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Shannon heard a loud boom. Looking up, she a scrawny looking teenager standing on top of the balcony, pulling down the rope of the church bell. Immediately as the sound had left the bell, everyone surrounding the church jerked their attention towards her, preparing their weapons for whatever was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot! I\u2019m human!\u201d She approached them slowly, trying not provoke any sort of threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all seemed to stare at her with a confused look, whispering amongst themselves. Many of them looked to their supposed \u201cleader\u201d, the man in the orange prison suit. His expression stayed completely still, not twitching a bit. Not particularly surprised or angered.  He just tended to grunt and walk out to the front. Closer up, you tell his age, about 30\u2019s. Maybe older,  it was hard to tell due to the amount of scars covering his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he walked slowly, dangling his pistol from his right hand. \u201cThe hell is it you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon let her hands down , talking in a more calm and collected manner. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not looking to cause any  disruption to . . . whatever you got going on.\u201d Her eyes darted back and fourth from the few guards that had aim at her head. \u201cI just need some supplies and I\u2019ll be well on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gruff looking man considered this option  for second. During that second, her eyes darted back to the young man standing at the balcony, gripping the rails. He had this look of fear- or was it sympathy?- on his face, mouthing out the word \u201crun\u201d.  This started to raise a bit of suspicion. The man caught back her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d he walked more towards the left, staring more towards what was behind Shannon. \u201csounds reasonable I guess . . . However . . .\u201d  He nodded his head upward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon turned around, not expecting the following events.</span></div></div>",

Shannon stood up and looked around the car, a quick search yelded a bottle of water and empty shell casings, She put the water in her backpack, one of her best finds other then the gun had been the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to head out.\" She said and steped off the train heading for the stairs that lead up to the street, she tryed to ignore the crumpled bodys and smears of blood that covered the platform, at first she had thought they would get up but the bodys that remained all had shots to the head...all self inflicted by the looks of it, some looked like they had actully been class ones, but worst...the ones holding pictures of kids, women, men...families.....all had self inflicted wounds to the head.....No she wouldn't think about it, she had seen too many people go down in Iraq becasue of that, even in Iraq was nothing like this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Started to climb the stairs and was soon on the street.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadly, things were just as bad topside as they had been in the subway, as a quick look around had confirmed. There was a massive pile up of vehicles of all types closing off the street that led further south. The other two streets were perhaps even worse then that. Corpses (some of which were still moving) were laying everywhere. Some were hanging out of windows, some were sprawled out across the street, some were barely recognizable as human... and some were walking. Shannon ducked behind a car before any of them saw her and quickly began considering her options. She could easily climb over the pile up to the south, but they would surely see her before she got over it, leaving two roads to choose from. She took a deep breath and raised her head just enough to look down both of the streets. The one that led to the north, and the warehouse district if she remembered correctly, had significantly less undead moving about it. \"Looks like I'm heading north...\" Shannon said as she checked her gun to make sure it was still fully loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour of ducking behind cars, trucks, and vans Shannon was finally spotted by a zombiefied old lady who had been out shopping when she had first encountered the zombies. Sadly, it was also her last encounter as she, and everyone in the store with her had been killed, only to awake some time later as monsters. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily she had been blessed with a unique power, she could now spit three types of deadly slime, as Shannon was about to find out. \"Ah shit, sorry granny...\" Shannon called as she raised her gun to fire. \"But I'm not about to-\" She was then cut off by a glob of blue slime that knocked the gun from her hand and caused it to become stuck against a nearby mailbox. \"What the fuck was that?\" Shannon growled as she dodged another blob of slime that connected with the windshield of the car behind her, which caused it to slowly dissolve. \"Jesus... they have powers now?!\" Shannon yelled angrily as she ran into a nearby store as a few more undead began to notice her presence and move closer. As it turned out, Shannon had run right into the butcher shop of Danny Ferguson, who had been lucky enough to have been out of town on vacation when this had all gone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was also lucky for Shannon as Danny had been one of the most paranoid men in the whole city, which in turn caused him to load up on emergency supplies. Including guns. Shannon dashed behind the front counter and grabbed the shotgun that was attached to the wall and checked the chamber. Empty. Fortunately, she noticed a box of shells sitting on a shelf before the zombies managed to get in. She finished loading the double-barrel just as the old woman turned Slimer poked her head in the door, looking for a victim. A full face of buckshot put an end to her before she could attack again and Shannon had no problem taking out the small group that had gathered outside. While there she noticed her 9mm handgun laying on the ground with some bits of dried slime flaking off. \"Wow...\" Shannon said as she picked her weapon back up and put it in her backpack. \"So that blue stuff sticks and wears off over time...\" She looked back at the car with the melted window and burned hood. \"And that red stuff seems acidic... Great. Now they've got superpowers.\" She complained as she checked to see how many shotgun shells were left. About half a box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems luck was on Shannon's side this time... but will it stay with her as she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bead of sweat rolled gently down Shannon Hawking's cheek as she looked out the third story window of Bitterwood's number one radio station. It sat on the edge of the city surrounded by the lush green trees of a nearby forest. Only it was impossible to see that right now as a savage wind ripped through the trees and ice cold water pelted the earth. The storm growing outside had gotten worse and it was now raining so hard that Shannon was unable to see more then a few yards away outside. The only thing she didn't have trouble making out was the empty parking lot right below her. \"Damn, it'd be just my luck if a fucking tornado started blowing.\" She said as she turned away from the window and sat back down at the desk of the stations long dead DJ. She pulled a small cigar out of her left shirt pocket and lit it up as she went back to cleaning her handgun and taking inventory of her supplies. This must've been the third cleaning today, but it wasn't like she had anything better to do. She blew a puff of smoke into the air and sat her gun aside as she counted up the remaining bullets she had left for it. \"27... 28... 29...\"  She stopped when she got to 34, the exact same number she had gotten the past five times she had counted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number of food items she had remaining, however, had been on a steady decrease since she got here four days ago and now seems to have finally run out. All that was left was half a bottle of mineral water she had found on the way here. \"Ah well, at least I got plenty of tunes.\" Shannon said as she began playing another song. \"I guess that's one good thing about hiding out in a radio station, not that I had much choice.\" In a few minutes she put the cigar out and walked over to her sleeping bag that was sitting off to the side of the locked and barricaded door. Shannon checked her watch as she sat down. \"2:15 a.m. Guess I'll try to get some sleep.\" It took her a little while to get comfortable, but the sound of the downpour outside soon lolled her off to sleep. She had a good rest that night, which was fortunate considering the sleepless nights she would undoubtedly face in the near future... if she lived that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ray of warm sunshine shone through the window and eventually found its way to Shannon's face. She squirmed a bit and opened her eyes with a yawn. \"Mm, morning already?\" She rubbed her eyes a bit and unzipped her sleeping bag. The time on her watch read 10:38 a.m. \"Wow, I really slept in...\" She said as she walked over to the window. The rain had ended sometime in the early morning and aside from a few puddles the world had entered a bright new day. Ironically, Shannon could see a large rainbow off in the distance just above a ruined gas station. She laughed a bit as she thought of the all the people who couldn't see it because they were likely fighting for their lives in the ravaged city. \"All we need now is a unicorn spraying confetti from its ass and we'll have a perfect mix of mood dissonance.\" She sneered as she sat down at the desk, possibly for the last time. She took a drink out of her bottle of water and sat it back down as she tried to think. \"What... am I going to do...?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shannon began playing another song as she remembered the events of the past five days. She had managed to defend her house for less then a day before the constant assault of zombies broke in and forced her to retreat. She had met with a few other survivors on her way out of the city, all of whom claimed it was too dangerous to try and make it out alone. Each of them had different plans, but they all agreed that finding shelter and joining with a large group was the best way to survive. Shannon scratched her head, did they really expect to wait this out? Or were they going to ban together and try to fight through the hordes of zombies until they made it to safety somewhere outside the city. \"Ah hell, either way most of them are probably doing better then me.\" Shannon said as she looked over her meager fortress. \"The only reason I haven't been killed yet is probably because this place is fairly secluded from the rest of the city. Only weak Beast's and a few level ones around here and most of them seem to stick to staying in the woods most of the time. I've only seen a few on the roads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of consideration Shannon decided the best option was to get back into the city and meet up with a large group of people who had a plan to escape. She didn't like the idea of having to rely on others, but knew it was the only logical choice. There was no telling how far the zombies may have spread and leaving the city now could mean walking for miles through zombie-infested forests and towns... alone. She'd never make it past the city limits if that was the case. \"Well... better get going.\" She said as she finished drinking her bottle of water and threw it aside. All she had was a handgun, 34 bullets for said gun, and a small switchblade that she kept with her incase she had to cut through some rope or duct tape, not really something that could be used effectively on the undead. Still, Shannon had used more mundane items as weapons before and they had worked fairly well... maybe the switchblade would get some use after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a minute to remove the weak barricade that had sealed off the outside world and Shannon soon found herself making her way down the eerily empty stairs. The only sound coming from her own two feet as she made her way to the ground floor. There was a single level one zombie in the lobby downstairs standing in front of the broken glass doors. Shannon took aim and took it down with a single shot to the head. The body didn't even twitch as it joined the other 3 corpses that were strewn about the floor. Shannon reloaded her gun and walked out into the stations tiny parking lot and took a quick look up both sides of the road. No zombies, at least none she could see. She stepped out onto the road and began walking back towards the city. The looming buildings just beyond the trees seemed strangely intimidating in the bright sun, but Shannon was determined and wouldn't let that bother her. She kept walking past the burned out gas station she had seen earlier and soon came upon a few more signs of civilization upon the lonely road. Up ahead she could see a few broken into houses along the left side of the road and a small bait shop sitting next to a large lake on the right side. She wanted to keep moving, but also wanted to get some more supplies... What does she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shannon knew she would need a lot more supplies if she wanted to survive long in the overrun city and abandoned houses tended to have more useful stuff then tiny little bait shops. She walked off the road and up the gravel driveway of a large home that sat deeper in the woods a little further uphill. Shannon could tell just by looking at it through the trees that it must belong to a very wealthy family... or at least did. Sure enough, there was large two car garage at the end of the driveway and Shannon could see the edge of an in-ground swimming pool in the back yard complete with a diving board. \"Wow, these folks must have been loaded...\" She said as she admired the fine house and the surrounding property. It was all very beautiful, but Shannon knew not to let her guard down and kept her gun out even as she walked up to the front door. She figured ringing the doorbell would only draw zombies so she pulled out her switchblade and attempted to pick the lock. Unfortunately, a switchblade wasn't a very good lock picking tool and she wasn't a locksmith. After several minutes of frustrated turning and twisting Shannon finally lost her patience and brought her handgun down on the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud thumping sound the knob was knocked to the ground and the door opened slightly. Shannon put her switchblade back in her pocket and stepped inside. The only light came from the sun that shone between the tree branches outside... in other words not much. Luckily, the place still had power and the flick of a light switch was all it took to illuminate a nearby living room with a hallway at the end of it and a staircase in front of her. At the top of the staircase was another locked door that Shannon couldn't get open even by breaking the knob off. \"Damn things probably barricaded... or welded shut...\" She walked back down the stairs and into the living room, which was surprisingly in order. No blood, no zombies, a t.v. guide and remote sitting next to an ashtray on a clear glass coffee table. Even the chairs and couches looked comfortable and brand new. \"Must have one hell of a maid...\" Shannon joked to herself as she turned on the big screen plasma t.v. on the wall with the remote. It hummed to life as Shannon settled into a nearby chair and it displayed a test pattern. She began flicking through the channels slowly hoping something was still on... anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a full minute before Shannon finally heard the voice of another living human. She turned up the volume a little as an old man in a suit talked in a stern voice with a sky view of Bitterwood moving in the background. \"...sources confirmed there are still living people within the city who are desperately awaiting rescue. Sadly, for these poor souls that seems to be an impossibility as the entire northeastern armed forces have their hands full just keeping this wave of what appear to be... undead humans, ladies and gentleman. I wish this was a joke, but our footage so far has confirmed that these things... these zombies... truly are walking corpses. As horrifying as this reality is... it IS reality, and as I was saying, rescue for those still trapped within the walls of the city seems like an impossibility. In a bit of good news the government has managed to successfully close off the area making a nuclear strike against the city highly unlikely for the foreseeable future. Please stay tuned for more news as it happens, this broadcast will repeat in BitterWood every hour on the hour. Thank you.\"</span></div></div>",

Probably.\" She walked down the hallway at the end of the living room and stopped at the only door on the way to the kitchen, which was further up ahead. She had her gun out and ready to shoot just in case there was something waiting for her on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo level 2 zombies rushed her before the door was even fully open. Shannon was able to close the door back just enough that the closer zombies claws connected with the door instead of her head. She was then able to kick the other aside with her foot as she fired two rounds through the door into the first zombies shoulders and neck, causing it to pull its claws free and stagger onto the large bed behind it. While its partner was down Shannon took the opportunity to blow a hole in the head of the zombie on the floor as it struggled to get back to its feet. With one of them dead and the other injured Shannon had no more reason to use caution. She walked over to the side of the bed and put a round of hot metal into the gurgling monsters head. Its body went limp and Shannon searched the bedroom in piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much. The room had several standard things, tissues, air freshener, a lamp... but only one thing of use to Shannon. A double-barrel shotgun sat innocently in the closet next to a few photo albums. It was unloaded, but there was a full box of shells on the top shelf next to some dirty magazines. \"Jesus, the husband keeps dirty magazines in the closet, the wife had 2 fuckin' pink dildos and a bag of marshmallows in the drawer next to the bed, and now I've even got a shotgun they had in their closet. God, I hope these people don't have any children living here...\" Shannon loaded the shotgun and left the corpses of the strange married couple laying next to each other in the bed with a blanket covering them. \"Anyway, thanks for the shotgun you two...\" She said in an oddly sincere tone as she closed the door back and went into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen wasn't as clean and orderly as the living room, but was still in fairly decent shape. All that was out of place were a few open cabinets, a bag of now rotten strawberries left sitting on the counter next to the sink, a half-empty can of whipped cream laying on the floor... Shannon was starting to slowly piece together what that couple's married life might have been like and found herself feeling a bit ill. Fortunately, an ice cold bottle of Budwieser fixed that and once she'd gotten a bit to eat she was ready to move on. She was about to walk out the back door, but noticed a large hole about 10 feet away from the pool. Something told her that blood trail that led into the woods wasn't from a zombie... \"Right, back out the front then.\" Shannon said somewhat nervously as she headed for the front door. Just as she was about to leave she glanced up at the door at the top of the stairs one last time and stepped outside. A level one zombie with a missing arm was now making its way across the lawn as its own blood poured from its wound. Shannon took most of its head off with a single blast from her new shotgun and made her way back down the driveway...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip back down the driveway was uneventful and Shannon soon found herself back on the road heading for the next house, which was about 50 yards ahead behind some trees. It wasn't quite as nice as the one she had just left, but still has its own sort of charm. The mailbox next to the driveway was knocked over with a large trail of dried blood leading down from it into the nearby ditch. Shannon was a tad unnerved by it, yet knew better then to let it get to her. She walked past it up the short driveway and made sure her shotgun was fully loaded before approaching the open door swinging on its hinges in the breeze. Shannon stepped up onto the porch and peeked inside a cracked window. The inside was a complete mess with more then a little blood covering the walls and floor, along with a mangled corpse or two. She walked over to the doorway and went inside once she was sure it was safe. Off to her right was the living room and to her left was a short hallway ending in a door, in front of her was what she suspected to be a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to move from one end of the house to the other she walked down the short hallway first and opened the door. Inside was a dark room with just a few thin slivers of light shining through the sealed windows. Shannon felt for a light switch on the wall and was relieved to find herself touching a lamp on a nearby table. She tried to turn it on a few times, only to realize this house had no power and was much more dangerous then the previous one. She closed the door back and opened the one she had seen when she first came in. Sure enough, it was a small bathroom with a lovely flower-patterned wall, a clean sink and a waterlogged corpse floating in the bathtub, at least that's what it appeared to be. With the only light coming from the open door behind her it was hard to see much of anything in the windowless room. Shannon closed the door back and looked over into the dimly lit living room. Was is really worth searching with so little light?</span></div></div>",

Today would be the day she got out of this godforsaken city, even if she had to kill every last one of these animals with her bare hands. She made sure she had everything with her and left her safe haven to venture out into the unknown. Things went smoothly until she got downstairs were a weak level one zombie was staggering about. It didn't really surprise her that one of the bastards had managed to get in considering she hadn't been able to seal the now broken glass doors. With one round from her handgun she dropped it and proceeded outside. The fresh air and gentle breeze was nice, but Shannon wasn't here to enjoy a clear sunny day. She had two objectives: Get out of the city. Kill all sons of bitches who tried to stop her. She walked past the parking lot and out onto the road. After a fews minutes of thinking she decided to head away from the city and take her chances in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had barely gotten half a mile away from the radio tower before she started hearing the moans echoing through the trees. Shannon knew the sound all too well... it was the call of a Siren, a female zombie that wandered aimlessly and could alert others. \"Damn!\" She cursed quietly as she got off the road and took cover behind a tree. She couldn't see any movement, but knew the bitch had to be close judging by how loud she sounded. After waiting a few minutes for the Siren to appear Shannon noticed the noise steadily grow softer. \"Its going deeper into the forest, probably away from the road too...\" She got back to the road and looked both ways. No zombies in sight, not even a level one. \"Should I keep going?\" Shannon thought to her self as she listened to the sounds coming from deeper in the forest. The Siren was getting farther and farther away by the minute. She could probably chase it down and kill it... if she didn't mind the good chance she had of getting lost. Of course, she wasn't so far along the road that she couldn't just turn around and go the other way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Shannon walked along the lonely road the Sirens haunting moan grew weaker and weaker until it could no longer be heard. It seems she had made the right choice in ignoring it. The sun was shining brightly and there were few clouds in the sky, but the many entangled branches of the trees kept the road cool and shaded while also providing just enough light to clearly see far ahead. If anything showed up Shannon would be able to spot it before it could get too close, which was a very good thing. For the better part of an hour she walked along without encountering so much as a single Beast or level one, then something unexpected happened. The moans of several Sirens began echoing through the forest from all sides, Shannon was surrounded. The first Siren from before must have been bait to draw survivors into the forest so they could be trapped. \"Shit, there must be a dozen of these things in here!\" She shouted as she began running as fast as she could up the road, trying desperately to get away from the symphony of voices lingering in the air. Unfortunately, no matter how fast she ran she didn't seem to be making any progress, they were still closing in on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead Shannon could see a wrecked car off to the left side of the road with a young woman sitting on the hood with her hands in her face. She seemed to be human (no blood on her or any obvious injuries) and in desperate need of help. Shannon began running over towards her as one of the Sirens poked her head out from behind a large tree on the right side of the road and began moving towards the woman on the hood of the car. Since she didn't want to alert more of these things Shannon didn't call out to warn the woman and instead began firing at the Siren as it drew closer to her. Two shots hit it in the chest and it began to bleed as it turned towards Shannon. It opened its mouth to scream just as one of the bullets connected with her head and she fell over without so much as a groan. When Shannon got to the woman she could see tears rolling down her face and it became obvious she had been crying alone here for quite some time. \"Help... me...\" She moaned softly without looking up at Shannon. Something didn't seem right...</span></div></div>",

Shannon wanted to get the hell out of there, but couldn't just leave this woman to die waiting on her husband, who was probably at the mercy of the Sirens. \"Look sweetie, we don't have time for this... but... if I help you find your husband will you follow me out of here?\" The woman nodded her head and once again pointed towards the forest. \"You... lead the way... I'll... follow...\" She said softly. Shannon nodded and began moving in the direction the woman had pointed. They walked only a quarter of a mile before Shannon felt the sharp pain of something being driven into her neck. She tried to scream, but could only make gurgling sounds as she collapsed to the ground. The last thing she saw was the demented face of a Mimic standing over her holding a bloodied piece of wood with the evilest expression on her smiling face. \"Goooottt you...\" It chuckled cheerfully.</span></div></div>",

The woman didn't have red glowing eyes, but Shannon sure as hell knew a zombie when she saw one. The rest of her handgun was emptied into the womans head as she began to get up. The body fell flat and Shannon began reloading her gun as the corpse began speaking again. \"I'm still... alive... hee hee hee...\" She taunted as she got back up while Shannon could only watch in stunned horror. \"You... can't get... rid... of me... so... easily...\" She spoke as bits of her head fell off and blood ran from her eyes. \"No, zombies die when you shoot them in the head... and you can talk... just what the fuck are you?!\" Shannon yelled as she fired another round right between the womans eyes. A fresh trail of blood ran down her face as it twisted into an expression of pure hate. \"SHE'S RIGHT HERE!!!\" The Mimic screamed at the top of its voice. \"KILL THE HUMAN!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moans grew slightly louder and Shannon fired two shots into the zombies neck in a vain attempt to shut it up. \"SHE'S HERE!!! KILL HER!!! KIIILLLL HEEEERR!!!!!\" The Mimic screamed through mouthfuls of blood. Finally, after exhausting all of her options Shannon fired her last few rounds into the womans chest. There were a few seconds of silence... and the sound of a fresh body falling to the ground amidst the moans of the Sirens. \"Good god, is that thing finally dead?!\" Shannon gasped as she slowly regained control of her shaking hands. \"That... that was some of the scariest shit I've ever seen in my life...!\" She wiped a few beads of sweat from her forehead and continued down the road without even bothering to reload her gun or search the car. For a while it seemed like she wouldn't make it, but soon enough the moans began fading again. When she was finally sure she was relatively safe Shannon sat down at the base of a tree next to a speed limit sign and rested for a bit.</span></div></div>",

She often wears camo pants along with a camo jacket over her plain white t-shirt.

She may seem a little loud and crude sometimes, but she won't take crap from anyone (including her friends and family).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitterwood city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitterwood city and its surrounding area is where this story takes place. It is a fairly large city that has its own airport, subway, and train station. There is a large mall located along the north-eastern edge of the city. The countryside surrounding the city is a beautiful landscape of forests and fields. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe areas<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChurches<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause the zombies were revived with dark magic they cannot cross holy ground. This means that any church the survivors come to will protect them from any and all types of zombie. Zombies cannot enter churches by themselves but can be knocked/pulled/pushed into one. If this happens they will be unable to move and lose any power they have until they exit (their eyes will still glow red while inside). Many churches all over the city have been fortified to offer more protection and often contain useful items that the survivors may find helpful like food or ammo. Some people have even left behind maps and signs that give directions to nearby safe areas. The universal symbol for a safe area is a triangle with a cross inside it and will also often have an arrow under it or above it pointing in the direction of the safe room. Keep in mind that while most other survivors are more then happy to let others inside there may be a few selfish or insane survivors who will deny entry to others and possibly even attack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon-holy safe locations<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral areas have been fortified to protect against zombies with varying success. Because these areas lack the holy protection given by churches they can be destroyed by zombies. Many of these places are damaged but still standing while others have been wiped out completely. Like churches, many of these locations have useful items left behind by other survivors and may not be all that friendly to newcomers. <br>\r\nThe symbol for this type of safe area is a circle inside a triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-supply locations<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany survivors discard excess supplies once they find improvements or are unable to carry any more. While a lot of these supplies end up being thrown on the ground or abandoned in hard to reach locations some people are kind enough to leave extra supplies in places were other survivors are likely to find them. These places are simply known as Re-supply locations. They range in size and scope from a few cases of bullets and a bottle of water in an empty trash can to a small garages worth of weapons, food, and medical aid. Important to note is that re-supply locations are NOT SAFE AREAS and in most cases survivors are just as vulnerable to attack as any other time. They are marked with a large R in a circle to let people know what they are. If one of these locations is cleaned out it is common courtesy to cross out the R symbol so no one will waste their time checking it for supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZombies are humans that were brought back to life with dark magic. Since they were revived with sorcery getting bitten, scratched, or injured by them DOES NOT turn you into one. However anyone who is killed by one DOES turn into one of them. They come in 2 types: normal and special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal: This type of zombie has 3 levels depending on how strong they are. When a person is killed they turn into a level one zombie (unless they become a special zombie). They level up by killing living creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel One: This level of zombie looks like a normal human except for its glowing red eyes. It moves slowly and has only half of the strength of a normal human. It can be killed with a headshot, a shot to the heart, or by burning it to death. Rarity:*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel Two: This level is as fast and strong as an adult human and has sharp clawlike fingernails along with pointed teeth. It is also more violent then a level one. This level can not be killed by fire or a shot to the heart like a level one. Rarity:**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevel Three: This level is extremly deadly. It looks like a monsterous human with glowing red eyes and a pentagram symbol on its forehead. Instead of fingers this level has long razor like claws that can cut through metal easily. This level also has several 2 inch long fangs in its mouth (which it can open twice as wide as a human). Its only weak point is its pentagram mark on its head. Beware, this level is extremly violent and has the strength of three adult humans. It is also vary fast. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial: This type has no levels, instead each type has a different ability. Only about 1 in 15 people who are killed become a special zombie (Any animals killed become Beasts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStalker: As its name implies, it hunts living creatures ruthlessly and will not stop until it has killed its prey. This type makes little noise and will ambush its prey. It looks similar to a level two zombie, but it is twice as fast and its claws and teeth are a little longer. It is vary good at jumping, climping, and swinging through trees and other such things. It can also crawl on walls and ceilings thanks to its claws. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiren: The siren wanders from place to place slowly. It is unique in that it can not run and is the only zombie that will not physically attack humans. It can be heard from about a mile away due to its loud moaning that sounds similar to singing. Its normal moan cannot harm humans, but if it finds humans it will use one of two special moans. The first is a loud five second shriek that draws other zombies closer. The second is a 30 second shriek that causes extreame dizziness and loss of balance. After using a special shriek the siren must rest for a minute before it can use them again. A siren is always female. Rarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSumo: A sumo is a large bloated zombie that stands 8-10 feet tall. It is fairly slow, but can move quick over short distances. It is extremely strong and could throw a car or rip a person in half if it gets a hold of them. Unlike all other zombies who simply kill their victims, the sumo will always eat them. A sumo is the hardest zombie to kill as it can survive for several minutes without a head and its layers of fat can easily stop most types of bullets. A sumo is always male. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyro: A pyro moves as fast as a level two zombie, but walks most of the time. It looks exactly like a normal human except for its glowing redish-orange skin. Its skin is hot to the touch and many of the things it touches burst into flames or sometimes explode. It is completely immune to fire. They are not hard to kill, but whenever one dies its entire body bursts into flames that quickly spread. When a human gets too close the pyro will raise its body tempature causing anything within a 5 foot radius to catch fire or melt. Pyro's hate water and are often found in places where they can stay dry. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimic: A mimic is the only zombie that doesn't have glowing red eyes...because it tries to disguise itself as a living human. It can walk or run and even perfectly immitate human speech. While they may seem human, there are several things that can give them away: A mimic can survive wounds that wound kill a normal human (If someone walks up to you missing half of their face or with most of their blood gone and ask for help, they are a mimic.), mimics don't have heartbeats, mimics will try to lead living humans into dangerous situations or to other zombies, and mimics are often found in small groups while pretending to be survivors. So when ever you find survivors in something like a sealed room with no food or water and they have been there a long time, they are mimics. A mimics weakspot is its upper torso, a headshot will only slow them down. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVampire: A vampire is a zombie who gets its name from its habit of drinking the blood of any living human it finds. It can run as fast as a normal human and is a little stronger then a normal human. It is easily spoted in a group as it has large fangs and is always deathly pale, but otherwise looks human. It can be easily killed with a headshot, a shot to the heart, or burning to death.<br>\r\nRarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimmer: The swimmer is the only type of zombie that can swim, but it can also walk on dry land. It has webbed hands and feet. It also has a large fin on its back. Its mouth is twice as wide as a humans and is full of long razor sharp teeth. This zombie will often wait for humans to come across rivers, ponds, or even swiming pools and shoot them in the face with non-fatal blinding ink. The ink is easily wiped off but the effects remain for about a minute. This undead is best killed while on dry land as they are somewhat slow while moving on dry land. They almost always appear in groups of 2-5 and only appear near water. Rarity:***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeathtouch: A deathtouch is perhaps the most deadly type of zombie that can be found, it is also the most rare. The walk slowly and are not very strong, but are very dangerous. A deathtouch is easily spotted as it is surroundings by a deep red mist. This mist is highly toxic and coming into contact with it can be fatal. Fourtunately the mist only extends about 3 feet from the zombies body. The zombies body itself is red like the mist and simply touching it is almost instantly fatal as its entire body is filled with a deadly virus. Deathtouches have no weakpoints, the only way to stop them is reduceing them to paste, which is very difficult as their skin is twice as strong as a normal humans and they can't be killed by fire. Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare: These are probaly one of the most fearsome types of zombie. They have the very eerie ability of absorbing all manner of illumination within a 30 foot radius. This veil of shadows remains over their corpses after they die, so no one knows what they really look like. Things like flash lights or even floodlights are useless agenst them as they absorb the light itself. All that is known about them is that they are vaugely humanoid, they have two legs and a head, but they have four arms instead of two. They also seem to have the strength and speed of an average human. The only things that are visible in their shroud of night is their 4 glowing red eyes. They are often identified right away as they look like large black clouds moving slowly over fields and streets. They often also allow other zombies to hide themselves in their black veil which makes it an extremely dangerous type to encounter, especially alone. (The other zombies eyes don't glow in the shadows like the nightmare's do.) Rarity:*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrier: These zombies look more like giant monsterous bats than humans. It has six human-like arms (but no legs) that it uses to carry other zombies (except sumo) to locations that they couldn't normally reach. They have two pairs of wings and stand between 8-10 feet tall. They can be killed with a headshot and its wings are very weak and can be easily burned or shot off. If it loses its wings it will crawl along the ground and claw and bite at any living humans it sees. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast: The name beast refers to all the animals that were zombiefied by the event that took place 5 days ago. These animals are all fast moving and ruthless. Birds that once sang happily outside windows now swarm and peck to death anything left alive. Deer that once avoided humans will now hunt them down and gore them to death. Fish that would just swim in the rivers and ponds now rip apart anything near them (except Swimmers). All zombie animals have glowing red eyes and can be killed with a headshot. Rarity:*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigger: A digger will find one spot it likes and remain there. It digs holes to hide in with its huge claws. It grabs people and will drag them underground. It can be killed with a headshot, but rarely sticks its head above ground. Its claws are razor sharp and can easily cut through metal. Diggers can also shoot tentacles from its mouth to snare prey. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlimer: The slimer is a nasty zombie named for its 3 different slime abilites. The first is the red slime attack. Red slime is acidic and can melt steel. The second is the blue slime attack. Blue slime is sticky and doesn't wash off with water, it wears off after about 5 minutes. Finally, there is the purple slime attack. Purple slime is highly flamable and will burst into flames in hot areas. It may also explode. The slimer moves slowly, but can spit slime up to 50 feet away. Slimers usually have slime dripping from their mouths. One headshot is all it takes to kill them, but their corpse will dissolve into a random type of slime. Rarity:****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You can not introduce any new zombies of your own, please use the ones listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Keep in mind the story begins 5 days after the zombies appeared, the survivors all start out alone in a location were they have managed to find shelter. There are no other people alive (except for the few other survivors that might be found later).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep this realistic, nothing cartoonish or stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Survivors MAY die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Cursing, violence, gore, adult content/situations, and nudity is fine. In fact most of those things are expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Sex is allowed with a few conditions:<br>\r\na. No sex involving beth as she is only sixteen.<br>\r\nb. No sex when there is the danger of a zombie attack.<br>\r\nc. This is a zombie story, not a porn story, if chapters start focusing too much on sex they will be deleted or edited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. All the characters live in the same city so they may meet and join up with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Finally, characters are not allow leaving the area unless they are rescued somehow, and they can't be rescued before chapter 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoteworthy Survivors<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following contributers have all made an addition that was good enough to impress me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigBangLang - Added a chapter that fit well with the overall story and provided an inventive new tool for killing zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMattsama - Began a great new storyline for Betty Winters that has a lot of potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorch - Took the time to read over everything before adding a chapter to make sure it was of the highest quality possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRissyRoo - Made an addition that did an excellent job of setting the mood and drawing the reader in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******2019 UPDATE******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHello folks, its certainly been a while hasn't it? Hard to believe its been ten years already, most of which I've let slip pass without any new updates or chapters. For far too long I've neglected what is quite possibly my biggest and most beloved interactive in favor of my newer stories, well that is soon gonna change. With the tenth anniversary of The Five Forgotten looming over me like a freshly reanimated corpse I plan to get back to it and make it better than ever. I still have some preparations to make, but life (or at least undeath) is about to return to this series... stay tuned.</td>",
