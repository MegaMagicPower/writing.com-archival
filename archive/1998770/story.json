Opening her blue eyes, she blinked slightly, sighing at the realization that it was yet another day. Hanyuu had managed to save her, and jumped to yet another dimension for a second chance. Or a thousandth chance. Or a millionth chance. However many chances they had taken to try and save Hinamizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika Furude let out a low groan, her ears failing to catch the deeper pitch. How much longer were they to play this game? Until the random numbers of the universe decide to align the stars properly and get all the particles rotating in her favor, it seemed. For now, however, it was to be her fate to repeat this sequence of events until whatever god there was above Hanyuu's standing decided to shine favor upon her. Letting out a yawn of boredom and resignation, she tried to sit up with the ease of old worlds, but something stopped her. The physical exertion of just trying to sit up was incredibly draining; she was exhausted, like she was completely out of shape! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her body, she found...</span></div></div>",

Managing to sit up after a few more tries, her head pounding a little from sleeping in a little too late, her indigo eyes blinked, trying to clear themselves of sleep. The headache was a bit more intense as the blood rushed from her head, and her breathing was a bit shallow. Whatever she had done the night before must've taken quite a toll on her body, as her arms were shaking and her skin was quite a bit paler than usual. Nothing that she couldn't have really brushed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika's ears perked up as she caught a low rumbling sound, akin to distant thunder or a low jet in the distance reverberating throughout her weak body. It shook her flesh down to the bones, sending her skin crawling with goosebumps, a shiver running up her spine as it started to build. Her blurry vision was straightening itself out as the sound became louder towards her middle, thin hands pressing against the sides of her belly as her eyes widened with shock. Letting out a soft grunt of discomfort, her middle began to groan deeply, like the sound of flesh stretching, and her body began to <i>expand.</i> Her belly starts to pour through the gaps between her fingers, growing with thick adipose as it's the first thing to start swelling from this strange reaction as it quickly turns into a butterball in her hands, swollen up with new mass as it rests heavily in her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...what's happening...?\" Rika managed to get out, her voice caught in her throat by the suddenness of the oncoming change. Her thighs plump up, her night dress snug against her fattening form, even her fingers porking up as her 11-year-old body is overcome by this wave of blubber that just seems to grow larger with every passing second. Gripping the bed as she began to round out, her chest even porking up and giving her a little early development, her body quickly surpassed that meager 70 or 80 pounds, plumping up into a fit and healthy 90, before plunging into a rather chunky area for a girl of her physical age. 100, 110, 120 all passed within a few minutes as she watched, entranced and horrified as her body porked up, rolls forming on her belly and her thighs swelling with fat. The bed creaked and groaned as the blunette fattened with abandon, easily three times her original weight if not more, her stomach folding over into cushy rolls while her arms quiver and quake with blubber, the feeling of new <i>cankles</i> almost surreal to her as they rest atop her fattened feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over, almost as quickly as it began. The quaking of her fat settled as the groaning vanished, the sound of stretching flesh disappearing as her body peaked out at its optimal weight...for now. Breathing shallowly, watching her meaty chest and belly rise and fall with every cycle, she groped her gut's swollen, round and rolled surface with plump hands, kneading it to verify its existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what....w-what the hell is happening...?!\" Rika gasped after a while, her cheeks and second chin quivering a little thanks to how full they had become. Before she could get her thoughts together, however, her processes were interrupted by a knock at her door. Quickly assuming her younger persona, she squeaked a little, hearing how her voice had gotten a little deeper. \"M-Mii! W-who is it?\"</span></div></div>",

Satoko's made a wonderful breakfast for yoooou~\" Satoko cried as she entered the room unceremoniously, clad in her green dress with black tights and looking rather cheery. The startled blunette tries to cover up her enormous figure but fails miserably, the blanket left on top of the bed far too small for her hefty body now. Rika's best friend, however, doesn't seem to pay any mind to what happened to her, almost making it seem completely normal besides the fact that Rika had grown fat enough to outweigh most adults. \"How are you doing? You felt pretty bad last night!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese girl shook her head a little, trying to remember the events from the night before. All she can remember is her stomach cramping up with something before Satoko gave her a glass of water and a bit of medicine...it made her feel quite a bit better afterwards. That can't have been the trigger for this sudden ballooning, could it? She blinked. Satoko wouldn't do such a thing, she loved her too much after they saved her from her uncle. Nodding at Satoko's statement, she gives a faint smile, nodding. \"That's right, nipah~ Satoko-chan gave me some medicine last night that made me feel all better. But...don't you think I should go easy on breakfast this morning, mii?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her swollen belly as it rests heavily upon her now-thunderous thighs, she motioned to it a bit more eagerly, trying to get Satoko's attention that she clearly didn't need a meal right then! Her gut, however, was clear to disagree, sliding in a deep, lingering growl that caused her flesh to quiver and jiggle on top of her lap. A crimson blush crept across her cheeks as Satoko grinned, the blond girl beginning to squish, knead and pat the rolls understandingly. \"I know it's been rough, Rika-chan, but Satoko can keep you fed and healthy! It's definitely hard to keep your appetite under wrap, it always has been. Now c'mon, let's get you out of bed and into the kitchen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatoko's small hands grasped Rika's pudgy ones as the blonde tugged with all of her might, grunting underneath the mighty weight of the newly fattened Rika. With Satoko's slim frame, hauling her out of the bed was a much easier task said than done, but they managed to after about 10 minutes of hard effort. The feeling of her bulk falling heavily around her was new, almost unnerving; yet, she felt a tingle up her spine that caused a rather delightful shiver to grace her chunky figure. Blushing darkly, and not just at the fact that her night dress was skintight over her obese form, she nodded at Satoko as her belly let out another pitiful, deep rumble. \"I-I guess breakfast wouldn't hurt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly noticed the wide grin on Satoko's face as the Hojo girl patted her swollen bottom, leading her into the Furude house's kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rika's eyes opened wide and her jaw dropped as she saw what was waiting for her. In this dimension, she must've been an impossible glutton! Stacks of pancakes towering high above the table, embroiled in a sea of warm maple syrup along with floating islands of french toast, with bacon shores and forests made of sausage. Mountains of biscuits, slathered with honey, butter and jelly of all kinds, not to mention a massive, golden sun made out of eggs! Her imagination was running wild as the entire thing coated the small table, and though her mind said she couldn't stomach it, her blubbery belly said otherwise. It rumbled deeply, sounding like an animal starved, demanding more food...more and more. This may not even be ENOUGH! Noticing a bit of drool coming from her plump lips, she managed to wipe it off with a ham-like arm, blushing deeply at Satoko and swirling a fat foot in circles on the floor. \"M-mii, this is an awful lot of food, Satoko-chan...a-are you sure I can eat it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? It may look a lot to someone like Satoko, but to Rika-chan, it's a smorgasbord that just fills up her belly! Especially after last night, she turned into a little piggy...\" the blond girl giggles, squeezing both sides of Rika's swollen belly. Blushing darkly, the shrine maiden moans softly for a moment as Satoko kneads them for a good moment, the blunette hardly noticing as the thin fingers trace her rolls almost lovingly. Even Satoko's feet find their way into this mix, the blonde's trim body pressing into the back fat and bulging rear of the shrine maiden, slim toes slipping underneath cankle and massaging the backs. Before Rika can get her wits about her again, Satoko is already leading her towards an armchair near the table for her to rest in as she gorges. \"Here you go, Rika-chan. A perfect seat for you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nipah...t-thanks. Ooooh, it smells so good...\" Rika's already grasping at the food, trying hard to bring herself a plate. Her tubby arms are too plump and thick at even this point to feed herself well, and her palms are too chubby and plush for utensils, besides the fact that she isn't used to this bulk quite yet! Huffing a little in frustration, she looks over as her best friend grins widely, holding up a stack of pancakes. \"Y-you were planning this all along, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatoko shook her head a little, a soft grin appearing on her face as she climbs up onto her obese friend's belly. \"Nooooo...I just think my pudgy friend needs someone to help feed her. After all, you've been growing so fast as of late, it's no surprise that you can't really feed yourself! Arms musta gotten so plump and chubby so quick, you had no time to adjust!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBegrudgingly, Rika admitted in her mind that her friend had a point. The adipose had piled on so quick, she had no time to get used to it at all. Even clenching her fists felt odd, and her porky toes were quickly proving to swell up rapidly enough with fat that she probably wouldn't be able to wiggle them at this rate. Sighing in defeat, she leans back in the chair, shifting her wide hips in order to get comfortable. \"F-fine. I-I just hope I don't get too much bigger from this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...I'll only feed as much as this belly can take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow Rika would regret those words in the coming hour. Satoko was gentle, but relentless, starting with the slabs of french toast bathing in syrup and powdered sugar, then digging into the rest of the mammoth breakfast laid out onto the table. Quickly, the food began to disappear into Rika's gut, the blunette's belly roaring in satisfaction as the first slices pass her plump lips. After that, it was almost entirely automatic, driven by a newfound gluttony that she didn't even know she could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the chair was quite a wide fit for a girl of even her prodigious weight, the 200 pounds of blubber surrounding her frame easily dwarfed by the armchair. This, however, was not to last. Her rolls quickly began to swell up with fat, whatever was happening to her body accelerating the process of turning food into ever more bulk upon her tubby frame. Pound after pound started to pack on, rolls swelling, belly rounding out, even her arms becoming thicker and fatter as the feast was stuffed into her gut. The ballooning shrine maiden was in utter bliss despite her original misgivings, the feelign of so much food being poured into her rapidly porking body quite the sensation, not to mention the growth itself! For some reason, it was...enticing. Warming. inviting. Watching her fat swell, every inch of her thicken and fatten and plumpen with new layers of thick, cushy adipose, the chair quickly starting to become snug around her widening hips, it sent another tingle up her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatoko, too, was well into this. The blond girl was feeding her with an efficiency almost entirely practiced, riding upon the cresting wave of Rika's blubberbound tummy as it flowed outwards like a pale river but never missing a beat, simply shifting her position to get the best feeding platform she could. The dozens upon dozens of platters marched unrelentingly towards Rika's hungry, devouring maw, even as the chair creaked and groaned while shrine maiden thigh and hip flesh began to bubble out over the sides, even her cankles thickening over her large feet with her dimpled knees swallowed up by ever increasing amounts of thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour was over before it started, it seemed, and the once two hundred pound Furude was easily another hundred....two hundred...perhaps three hundred pounds heavier. Whatever had happened the night before, it had taken an obscene toll on her body as her fat, round form spilled out of the broken furniture. WEighing in at a whopping quarter ton, some of her rolls were peppered with sweat, the effort of having gorged on so much food quite taxing for a girl who had just turned obese that morning. With her poor nightdress riding up on her now impressively-sized chest, her thick feet covered by cushy cankles and her ass more than likely able to drag on the floor, she was the epitome of a glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Satoko had many other plans...plans for her rapidly growing Rika. If she had her way, Hinamizawa might just have to be renamed after she was done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The timer on the clock rang loud and clear as Rika sat in a gluttony-induced dazed, her body stuffed and full, eyes glazed over with euphoria over what she just did. Satoko bolted upright from her cuddling position on Rika's massive tummy, looking over at the clock to see that it was 8am in the morning. They were late for class! Glancing back at the overstuffed blunette nearly comatose on the poor, overstrained chair, Satoko crawled up against the burgeoning belly and swollen chest, raising a trim hand and patting the shrine maiden gently upon a plumped-up cheek. The first few didn't do anything to the sleeping blob, but as she increased the intensity of the pats Rika awoke with a mumble or two, eyes crossed for a moment as she stared at Satoko. \"B-buuuh...Satoko? Wha's goin' on, mii...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're late for school, Rika-chan! Your breakfast lasted a little longer than I thought...I got a uniform from the school for you! It's supposed to fit anyone at least your size! Be right back, just lemme help you out of the chair first...\" Getting off the cushion that Rika's belly had become, the blonde latched onto the porky, ham-sized arms and started to tug, Rika groggily complying and planting her thick feet on the floor as best as she could. Unlike before, however, Rika was easily three hundred pounds heavier at the moment compared to her 200 surge from this morning, making it a LOT more difficult to haul her up, not to mention the chair squeezing her overly plush hips. Letting out soft grunts of effort, it isn't long before Satoko manages to haul the blubber-bound Rika up, watching as the blunette's massive belly drops to the floor followed by her fat-filled buttcheeks, clapping against her barrel-like thighs and leading to cankles covering her porky digits. The sleepy shrine maiden lets out a yawn as Satoko scampers away, free to explore her swollen rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of so much soft weight on her frame was strange, something she was totally unused to. Even now, after spending a couple hours as a two hundred pound girl, the feeling of being so ludicrously large for her age hadn't sunk in yet. Not to say that it was bad, she supposed. Gorging like that, feeling her fat swell and bulk with more calories, more poundage every minute, every part of her inflating with creamy adipose was an interesting notion to say the least. Those shivers up her spine as she continued on this particular timeline's Rika weren't entirely out of horror and shock, much less the cold. The warmth of her cankles against her porky feet didn't help too much either; it was a little intoxicating to find that even her fingers and toes were starting to be swallowed by cuddly blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long before Satoko came back, carrying with her a massive version of the sailor fuku uniform that they wore to school. Blushing a little bit, wondering if any shoes would fit her in her current state and getting that familiar tingle up her spine she beamed at Satoko. \"Welcome back, nipah. I'm feeling much better now that I'm awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! We should have enough time to get to the school, even if you do waddle slow~ Let me help you, Rika-chan,\" Satoko replied, taking off Rika's overly snug nightdress before managing to pull the uniform's top over her bulky chest and swollen tummy. IT falls down to cover most of it, which is a good thing as she tries to fit the skirt over as well. Rika lets out a squeak as it cinches her bulky tummy and falls over her enormous rump, managing to keep her decent despite how fat she is overall. Getting the hardest part over with, Satoko starts tugging socks on over Rika's fat feet and cankles, the fabric enough to keep them from totally swallowing her pudgy toes and make it easier for her to walk. The loafers, thankfully, only help her along and they fit a little snugly, just enough so that they won't slip off. Beaming at Satoko, Rika hugs her friend, smothering her in cushy rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Satoko-chan. Now let's hurry, Mii! maybe we can make it before first period is over...\" she giggles, wondering what this is going to be like, waddling about with that extra three hundred pounds. Satoko grinned, patting her on her enormous backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Now let's see how fast you can waddle!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got to the school, it wasn't too much into first period thankfully, but Rika was having a bit of a hard time. Her fat was a little slick with sweat, the hot summer day not doing much to help her situation. It didn't feel terrible, however, though she was glad that she wasn't sweating so much. Her breathing was a little labored as well, but...she had to wonder. Her waddling was quite a bit faster up here than she expected! Perhaps...maybe Satoko put something in her food to help her along?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Rika-chan! Almost there! I got something special planned for after school in the club! I bet you'll LOVE it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat special something Rika could only guess at, but right now, as her mind was slowly becoming used to the idea of growing so ridiculously large so quickly, she could only imagine what it was...and it excited her.</span></div></div>",

She was so large at this point, four or five hundred pounds, that she was lucky she could even fit in the desks or on the chairs at this point! They weren't too uncomfortable like she thought they were going to be, though. It was like everyone he considered a friend had taken the extra precaution to ensure that she was okay at school despite her ridiculous bulk. Even when her skirt nearly popped off the minute she tried to get up to use the bathroom today, the teacher was there to pin it back together! It seemed like everything was moving to make being this huge much more bearable, and it was.

They didn't even mind how huge she was; in fact, like Satoko, they seemed to be helping her growth along! At lunch they had dumped all of their extras onto her plate and even given her a couple extra snacks during the day. And Satoko gave her the belly rub when her belly was feeling too full to do much else, which Rena helped with. Right now, they were discussing what they were going to do for a punishment game today, something she was mildly interested in considering that Satoko had promised a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMion, of course, was trying to shove some of her own rigged games at the group, ranging from Old Maid to water tag, while Keiichi was shooting them down at every turn, knowing what exactly would happen if Mion got her way. The two were arguing rather heatedly, but it was a normal day at the club, competitive smiles on their faces. The orange-haired girl beside Rika had actually tried to get a feel or two, as well as try to take her away like usual! Even with her super strength, however, Rena wasn't going to get the shrine maiden to go anywhere short of rolling her along. Thankfully, Satoko and her own weight were keeping her enthusiastic friend at bay. She giggled slightly as her two older friends came to a head, butting their foreheads against one another and groaning in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then, why not a game of Old Maid? it fits perfectly! Besides, we haven't done it in a while!\" Mion argued, sitting back in her chair with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the last time we played it, you had it rigged so that I would lose ALL THE TIME! I got stuck in the one-piece swimsuit!\" The brown-haired youth snapped back, sitting back in his own chair with an equally frustrated huff. They had been at this for at least half an hour, and it was getting late. Rika was starting to think that Satoko might've forgotten about her special surprise for her, and besides that, she was getting hungry! On that note, she noticed something odd... Satoko had gone missing! Just as this realization occurred, the blubbery shrine maiden looked back as she heard a soft click, the doors to club room opening up to reveal... Satoko!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satoko-chan! I thought you decided to go home, nipah!\" The blunette smiled, pudgy cheeks blushing. Her enormous uniform creaked under the stress of so much blubber, her 500-pound figure straining every inch of fabric. Before she could get a response, however, her nose caught wind of something delicious and her belly growled loudly. \"E-eep! M-my tummy's hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde shook her head before grinning widely and tugging in her luggage: it was a huge serving cart, overloaded with leftover food from lunch that day, the wheels groaning as they tried to hold the weight of several meals' worth of gods! All of it was still fresh, steaming and warm, perfect for a picnic with friends... or one very hungry Rika. Obviously it was for the latter as Rena popped the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Satoko-chan! What's all the food for?\" Rena inquired, looking quizzically at the serving tray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled deviously, squeezing Rika's bloated back rolls as she moved into the middle of the room with a devilish gleam in her eyes. \"A brand new punishment game~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMion and Keiichi's ears perked up at this. \"Punishment game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm! It's called 'Shrine Maiden Stuffing~!'\" Satoko giggled before jumping back over and grabbing Rika's tubby paws. Hauling the blunette out of the chair, who was utterly embarrassed at the idea, her best friend sat Rika down in the middle of the room on a small seat of pillows, patting her huge, swollen gut. Mion, Rena and Keiichi looked at her incredulously, which she took as a sign to go on. \"This game is, of course, about feeding Rika! Since she's grown so big and there are so many leftovers, I thought of a fun way to get rid of them. And judging by the sound of her tummy, she's pretty hungry~ The objective of this game is to feed Rika as many leftovers as she can possibly take. If she eat the whole cart, and is still hungry, we all lose! If she's full to the brim with nothing left, she loses~ But here's the fun part. I've divided up the food into sections! Everyone gets their own little pile. If Rika eats your pile, you win! And I know how much she can eat, so at the very least, there is going to be one or two definite winners~ Now, if you feed her too much and she can't take anymore, you lose! And she loses. And if you have any food left over after she's done eating, you ALSO lose...~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMion and Keiichi gulped softly at the stakes, wondering what exactly the punishments were for this game. \"Alright, since it's your game, what are the punishments?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep MINE a secret. For everyone else, if you win... well, you get to choose the punishment! But I don't think Rika will be able to fit in a one-piece, Keiichi...\" Satoko giggled snarkily, causing him to blush as he remembers the last time he tried to do such a thing. Rena looked a little excited about this prospect, being able to play with the cuddly butterball that Rika had become, though the shrine maiden to be stuffed had quite a different idea. Either this was going to be very good, and she was going to get an uber-filling meal...or she might pop! The food smelled so good, and she was still quite hungry despite the amount of lunch she managed to get. She was already huge in this dimension's time...how much bigger could she actually get?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost didn't want to know the answer. Her outfit was already groaning softly at every movement she made, down to her loafers which strained over plump little feet nearly covered in hefty cankle. It was about ready to give at any moment. Yet the slab of blubber in front of her, her tummy, hungered for MORE. It quivered as it growled deeply, her soft, fatty chest stuffed into her shirt as her sleeves groaned softly at the ham-sized flesh of her arms. Keiichi and Mion looked at each other a bit oddly, wondering if this was right to do but...it was a punishment game, and one that did suit the club after all... \"Alright, it's a game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooood~! Everyone, stand near the cart with your hands on the first item of food in your pile. Anything will do, just make sure to grab the plate tight! Our little Shrine Maiden sounds like she's VERY hungry...\" Satoko giggled as she pat Rika's enormous, swollen gut, squeezing a roll and kneading its softness for a second. It gurgled in response at the oncoming waves of food, Rika's body seizing up for a second as it seemingly prepared to grow even fatter. She was going to wind up so much bigger than when she came in. The blonde placed her own hand upon the cart as she began the countdown, Rika's eyes widening with every number. \"Three....twooooo...oooooone...~ BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first plate was, predictably, Satoko's. Her best friend was incredibly swift as she stuffed a heaving eclair almost unnaturally stuffed to the brim with heavy cream between her plump lips, patting her tummy knowingly. Rika sank into her fat neck and chins as she chewed the delicious treat and swallowed, feeling it drop into her belly like a rock. A wave rocked her body internally for a moment, a warm heatwave splashing across her which caused her to pant softly.  Her body let out a groan, a feeling of fullness that she couldn't shake as her body began to swell. It didn't grow much by all means, but it grew enough. A dozen pounds trickled onto her already bulky frame, her clothes creaking, buttons popping off of her front as her soft rolls expanded and soft, fatty flesh seeping through the gaps. Her skirt moaned, seams popped on her sleeves as her arms started to become too fat for her shirt, and her sock tore slightly as her poor loafers strained underneath the load of even bigger cankles and larger feet. Her ass seeped across the floor, creeping across the cushions underneath her growing form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened even further. Whatever Satoko had done to the food...she was going to get a LOT bigger.</span></div></div>",
