Your only choice is to wait until they have gone to sleep before returning home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the school's stadium all you can think about is how if Chris had not blind sided you, you would have had more than a fighting chance of turning the tables and making John think twice before interfering in your business again. Next time things will not go so smoothly for him. Unfortunately, your daydreams of revenge are interrupted by a blinding pain as you notice for the first time the rather large bruise on your left side. Realizing how dirt and blood covered your face must be, you make your way to the closest gas station. The bathroom is filthy, but it contains a working sink with fairly clean water and plenty of paper towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clean your cuts as well as con be expected in a gas station bathroom. Looking at your watch you figure that Dave and Mary should be settling into bed soon enough. So you decide to head home now, but you'll take the long way just to be sure to avoid any unpleasant encounters at home. Still angry about the unfair beating you had just received, you push the door open much harder than intended and it slams into a person standing outside the door waiting to use the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am so sorry,\" you begin to stammer. The stranger is wearing a long black cloak and the hood is up. Cast in shadow you cannot make out any details of the face, and the cloak disguises the body type and sex. You see the stranger raise his or her gloved hand to silence your apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is quite alright. I shouldn't have been standing so close.\" The voice is so muffled you must strain to understand the words, and still you are given no indication of the gender of this stranger. He or she backs into the bathroom and closes the door. As you turn around to head home you can't help but notice that no new cars have pulled up to the gas station. Who was that and why is he or she at a gas station without a car? This person must have walked here, but from where - you've never seen this person or anyone like him, her, it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of the mysterious stranger consume your walk home. With home in sight you sigh with relief as you notice the lights are out. However, when you are two houses away you swear you hear the faint sound of footsteps a very short distance behind you. You spin around but see no one; instead you do catch a glimpse of a figure, a shadow darting behind a tree a couple of lawns away. Both the sound of footsteps and the shadow gone, you rush the rest of the way home and into your room.</span></div></div>",
