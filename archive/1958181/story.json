From warm ups to basic stunt practices you excel surprising yourself and everyone else on the team. When being instructed by Katy about stunt procedure and etiquette, you only need to be told once. You learn to keep your head up at all times and distribute your weight evenly. Your small size compared to the other girls makes it easier for them and for you too balance.  Even with the chants you are a natural not slipping up or getting tongue tied at all, much to the amazement of some of the veteran girls. You find yourself enjoying the training more and more, relishing the challenge of a new new stunt. Being lifted and cradled by the girls is pretty emasculating however and is something you struggle getting used to. You soon forget about the uniform though and don't become too worried when your skirt flips on some of the stunts, its just something you have to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the practice, Katy is so confident with your abilities that she lets you attempt a basic toss. Two girls come either side of you and launch you into the air, you pirouette spreading your weight between the two catchers and land delicately in their arms. When put down you are panting from the adrenaline and sheer enjoyment but all good things have to come to an end and training finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty approaches you at the end. \"Wow, all I can say is wow. I have never seen anyone pick up cheerleading as fast as you did. There's no doubt about it, we need you on the team Adam and we need you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving never been good at any sort of sport you are overwhelmed by this. \"Thanks Katy that really means a lot. Yeah I would really love to be on the team but umm...\" you trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" Katy says looking panicked by your hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just that I'll be a boy doing cheerleading. I really want be on the team but I can see a lot of bullying in my future if I do.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty brightens at this. \"You don't need to worry about that, during practice I came up with an idea that would solve both our problems. Its pretty odd to have a guy as a flyer, even one as small as you so Amelia and I thought it would be better if you joined the team as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback by this. \"How would I do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, we help you dress and act like a girl. We talk to the principle to clear it and sort out classes and I know she will, give you a makeover and lessons to be a girl and then you you would come to school as a girl and no one would be the wiser. No bullying, you get to do cheerleading and I get an all star flyer for football games and competitions, everyone one wins. What do you think?\" She says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are flattered by being called an all star but you can't help picking holes in her plan. \"But what about my friends and what would my mom say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends? You mean the guys that signed you up for cheerleading in the first place and anyway aren't they the weirdos who hang around the bike shed after class, you could do better Adam.\" She has you there, you never have been good at making friends, always falling in with losers and two-faced dicks. \"And as for your mom, Im sure she would understand, maybe she would encourage you to help out a sports group in need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how would I pass for a girl?\" you say now scrapping the bottom of your excuse barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty smirks at this. \"Um Adam, don't take this the wrong way but I don't think it would be hard at all for you to pass as a girl. Your face is androgynous if not feminine and your small frame is just right for a girl.

I agree with all your saying, I really do like cheerleading and I want to help out but having to act and dress like a girl everyday to do it. I just couldn't, I'm really very sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty visibly slumps at this, you can see the disappointment in her eyes. \"Oh okay, I understand. Its your choice after all, I guess we won't have a cheer squad this year after all. No hard feelings.\" She turns and trudges off to the changing rooms. \"Oh and you can keep the uniform, we won't need it and besides you look cute in it.\" She says over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel terrible, the worst you have felt in your life. Not only are you denying yourself something you really enjoy but also denying it others. You too head for the boy's changing room and change, almost reluctantly back into your normal clothes. You put the uniform in your bag as a keepsake and head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm home\" you yell as you enter your house. You fling your bag next to the door and take off your shoes, glad you can relax after the strenuous training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great timing Adam, dinners on the table.\" you here your mom's voice come from the kitchen. You walk on though to the dinning room and see your two sisters already at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour older sister Erin greets you with her traditional \"Sup dork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your year younger sister Lilly opts for a more pleasant \"Hey Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your seat next to Lilly without saying anything and wait for your mom. Its not long before she joins you and you all dig into your food. Talk over dinner is mostly about Lilly's upcoming hockey game and also features another one of Erin's classic feminist rants. Just one year of doing sociology and gender studies and she thinks she knows it all. You don't contribute much, only offering the occasional \"uh huh\" or \"okay\" as your mind is still on the cheer team. The guilt you feel is almost unbearable but thinking of living in girl's clothes helps it dissipate a little. At the end of dinner you offer to clear the table and help with the washing, perhaps to alleviate some of the guilt. Lilly washes while you wipe and Erin just lounges at the kitchen table on her phone. Just as you are drying a plate the phone rings and your mom answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, well hi principle Granger, how can I help you?\" your ears prick up at this and so do Lilly's and Erin's. All production in washing up comes to a standstill. \"I see, well that's just terrible, the cheerleaders at the sports games always livened things up.\" your mom continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly gets back to washing. \"Granger probably wants donations.\" she says relived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't budge, still holding a plate in your hand, ears straining to hear more of the conversation. And then came the words every child dreads to hear their parent say. \"Oh he did, did he?\" you mom says. Erin and Lilly gaze at you grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busted dweeb.\" Erin says triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace wondering what you did wrong and how could the cheer squad be involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, its a little unorthodox but I can see the merits to it and I think it will be the best for him if what your saying about the people he hangs out with is true and if it helps the teams in the process, I see no reason why not. You have my full support principle Granger.\" A pause ensues and Erin and Lilly are both falling about with laughter silently. You remain still, filled with dread, hoping against hope what is happening is not what you think is happening. <br>\r\n\"What's that?\" your mom continues. \"Ms. Wilkes thinks it would be good for Erin too? That's great, I'm sure Erin will be delighted you said that and that offer is very generous.\" Erin stops laughing and looks confused now. Ms. Wilkes is Erin's sociology and gender studies teacher. \"Okay okay, let her know we will start immediately and she can come and help tomorrow. Aren't we lucky we have the weekend eh?\" your mom laughs. \"Okay bye principle Granger and thank you.\" The phone goes down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately all you Erin and Lilly get back to work looking busy as possible. Your mom walks in with an odd expression on her face, something that can only be described as a mixture of pride and mild disappointment.  \"That was your principle on the phone as I'm sure you all know. She had some interesting things to tell me and put forward a few dramatic changes that I whole wholeheartedly support.\" She pauses to collect her thoughts. \"She tells me that you tried out for the cheer squad today Adam.\" Lilly stifles an amused snort and your mom scowls at her and all signs of her mirth disappear. \"She tells me that you refused to join the team despite knowing that it was short on numbers which is shameful even if you were signed up as a joke.\" She says scoldingly and you look down at the floor. \"However\" her tone changes to pride, \"she also told me that from watching you from her office window, that you were one of, if not the best cheerleader she has ever seen and being that good without prior practice is incredible. Apparently she was amazed that you were a boy. This is why you turning it down was so inconceivable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your voice now. \"But mom they wanted me to go to school as a girl.\" Erin, stiffens at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Principle Granger told me about Katy's plan and approves of it. Apparently your new so-called friends are not the A-students that you would have me believe them to be. I'm told they're slackers, troublemakers and smokers.\" Your mom's becomes menacing \"If I find out that you so much as touched a cigarette young man you'll be in more trouble than you ever thought possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never smoked\" you say panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its a just a matter of time before you do hanging around with those scruffs which is why I think Katy's idea is best for you.\" Your jaw drops. \"It lets you have a new start away from bad influences which will help your school work, it will let the girls on the cheer squad have a team and from what I'm told you rather enjoy cheerleading too.\" Lilly looks like she is about to laugh again but manages to hold firm. \"So from this day on, your going to live as though you are my middle daughter, not just at school and in cheerleading but full time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? How can you do this?\" you exclaim, not believing what you just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite easily after being told all the advantages, this will be best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But but\" you stutter but your mom ignores you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin speaks up now. \"I agree completely with your decision mom its just what he needs.\" you glare at her \"but where do I come into this? I heard you mention me on the phone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I almost forgot the other benefit of this arrangement. Ms. Wilkes has expressed that she is extremely pleased with your progress and called you a perfect example of a modern, assertive and independent young woman...\" Erin smiles proudly at this. \"and she tells me that Adam's change would be help her research in understanding reversing gender roles in society and hopes that you would like to document some results and also help guide his transformation in return for a recommendation for a scholarship to any Ivy league university of your choice, apparently she has some pull with the acceptance offices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin almost leaps out of her seat. \"Yes I'll do it\" she shouts happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good well its settled then. Adam, for the rest of your time at high school, you will go as a girl. Every aspect of your life will now be that of a girl's and I think we better start as we mean to go on by making you look more presentable for our shopping trip tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shopping trip? Why?\" is all you can muster. You are in shock, you must be dreading, something like this can't be real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't have you wearing any of your sister's clothes for the next couple of years, it wouldn't be fair to them, besides both their clothes would be too big for you.\" She's right there. Erin is quite tall at 5 ft 10 and Lilly is 5ft 8 but built much bigger than you from hockey practice and exercise. \"So Lilly, would you mind finishing the dishes dear while your sister and I make your new sister look more appropriate?\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But you can be that boy that's in the cheer leading squad, wears a girls uniform, and performs the girls parts in the cheer leading routines. You're going to be in the cheer squad and that's final. I think being a girl would be less humiliating for you as long as nobody finds out. Would you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to agree she was right. As long as nobody found out, you were much better off this way. \"Fine, whatever\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Erin\", Mom said, \"I'll let you get started with him, excuse me, <i>her</i>, while I go do some work around the house. I'll check in with you later. Now Adam, unless you want everyone finding out about our little secret, you will listen to everything Erin says. Erin, I give you full authority over him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Erin said excitedly. \"C'mon little sis, let's get started!\" You cringed at her calling you that. She led you up to her bedroom, and shut the door behind her. \"First, strip\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" You refused. \"I am not taking off my clothes in front of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I could just tell Mom someone wasn't cooperating...\" You reluctantly pulled off your clothes, embarrassed. \"Now, head to the bathroom, take a shower, and use this cream, but don't use any on your face. Only use it on your arms and legs. You did as instructed, the cream burned your skin, and you saw all your hair wash away in the shower! You came out body hairless, with a towel wrapped around your waist. You headed back outside to where Erin was waiting. \"Wonderful! No more pesky hair to ruin the look. Now, lose the towel.\" Reluctantly, you dropped the towel, exposing yourself completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Erin has some clothes picked out for you already. \"These are compression panties\" She explained as she slid them on you. \"They'll help you hide your member\". She tucked it inside, and surprisingly, your butt area looked feminine. Next came a bra. She applied makeup to your face, and since your hair was already long for a guy, she straightened it out. Looking in the mirror, you could almost fool yourself into thinking you were a girl. Next came the clothes. There were two outfits. One was a skirt and blouse, the other was a casual summer dress.

But a few '<i>friends</i>' had written your name on the list. The same friends that ensured your life was a living hell in any of the other sports teams you tried out for. But options were getting harder and you needed to pick a sport element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought had been to scrunch up the mocking note. To dismiss this petty bullshit, and find some other activity. As you walk away, you realise you could use this to your advantage. All the rest of the team applicants were female, so you'd be in a prime position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of your friends were going to be mocking the other cheerleaders, as they still wanted to date them, themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed to the gym, you felt your doubts growing. Would this just turn the other half of the school against you. Would the girls think <i>you </i>were mocking them. Would they want an outsider in their ranks. As you got nearer, you realise you could use this to explain it was a mistake. That it wasn't you who applied, surely they wouldn't make you do a try-out for the squad, against your will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk across the courtyard was the hardest, groups of giggling girls were heading in the same direction, and no other boys. Your destination was clear to anyone with eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of all of you, the new gym loomed high. The building looked out of place, because it was. The fire that had destroyed the previous one, was a school disaster, almost causing the school to be closed. The death of the students painfully recent. In fact, it was the cheerleaders who perished there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers had never been as high since the fire. And, of course, the stories of ghosts and strange unexplained occurrences, were being fed by students eager for scares and excitement. Students eager to cuddle up to, and comfort jittery girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls brush past you, as you slow to a stop. Sniggers quickly hidden behind slender hands, and furtive glances seem to be their secret form of communication. Although the message was quite clear to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps attracted by the noise, Miss Hardbroom appears in the doorframe. She scowls at your briefly before comprehension dawns, and with a quick glance to her sheet of names, she spares you a curt nod of the head. At least it ended the giggles and sniggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a rather imposing figure. Her tight sports clothes leave nothing to the imagination, showing off her svelte figure rather well. You try desperately not to ogle her well presented bust. The girls held high and firm, despite their size, a testament to the virtue of exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously you approach her, the fear of getting an erection means your blood courses loudly in your ears, as you try to focus on anything else, on everything else, than all the nearby female flesh. All preparing to change clothes and get sweaty and competitive.</span></div></div>",

Running your fingers over the material, you find that it comes with some built in support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to really pull hard to get your arms inside the sleeves, and slip it onto your shoulders. The stitching, pattern, and the built in support all combine to make it look, as if you have your own very modest bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick at it, trying to stop it pinching, and smooth out any wrinkles. Looking in the mirror, it's a convincing reflection you see. Your raven hair, looking just a little to short.

But, you find only your reflection, and your own reflection staring back, fear and embarrassment battling on your face. Quickly you snap your head left and right, but there's nobody else there, and nowhere else that look could have come from.</span></div></div>",

There's a buzz in the air, an excitement, the girls are eager to get on the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whistle blast silences the chattering, as everyone looks over to the impressive figure of the teacher standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for ten girls to form the squad, and I'll have the final decision.\" She lets the whistle fall down.

When Miss Hardbroom does her stretches you're afraid to look away and miss the start of the try-out. Her body ripples as she stretches, she must be in her mid-twenties, and still has a gorgeous body. You keep noticing the shimmying, and teasing from her chest as her sports bra smothers it's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow loudly, oddly certain that everybody must have heard that. You need to forget about her sports bra, and those breasts held in that lycra embrace, each intimate detail of her perfect nipples held and revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit...., she's started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start copying her moves, the kicks, the waves of the arms, the balancing. There's even a smile on your reflected face. You're enjoying this, really just enjoying it. Better even than that you see that you're not the worst. Already you can see other girls -<i>damn it-</i> just others, who are flailing like landed fish. Who can't tell their left from their right, and look like they can barely balance with both feet on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk forms, as you see some of the girls are unprepared. Their own titties flying wildly despite their best efforts, their cheeks turning deeper and deeper red as their embarrassment builds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeirdly, you feel satisfaction as they fail, concentrating on imitating her gestures is working. And you're not thinking on ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Concentrate on the work!</i> You berate yourself.</span></div></div>",

You were always short and slender for your age with gentle blue eyes and longish dust blond hair. You were often mistaken for a girl, you had become used to it. You were athletic but not enough to join the football team as you hoped. It crushed you to hear the coach say you looked too feminine to be a football player. When you received the note to report to cheerleading practice, you feared it was just an attempt to add insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well get this joke done and over with...\" Sulking, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the gym, you were greeted by the cheer coach, Ms Sarah Stone who grinned upon seeing you approach. \"Ah, <i>Miss</i> Cire.\" giggling, she said. \"You are right on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha.\" Humorlessly, you said. \"Have your laugh on the <i>feminine</i> boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"I heard about what the football coach said to you.\" Turning serious, she said. \"My girls and I all agree that it was not right or fair that he treated you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you want to see me?\" Curious, you asked. \"Do the girls need help with coming up with a new cheer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. You had been helping the cheerleading squad come up with the most spectacular cheers which have won them championships throughout the state since you were only seven. The squad had often regarded you as one of them even though were were a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" Bemused, Sarah said. \"The girls and I had a long talk and we have come up with a plan that will put you onto the footfall field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to make me a male cheerleader?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" Grinning, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned hearing a number of girls giggling to find you were surrounded by the entire cheerleading squad from the Frenchmen to the Seniors. All of them were wearing their cheerleading uniforms. Among them was your twin sister, Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's going on, sis?\" Nervous, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled kindly. \"You have always really been one of us, Cire.\" Calmly, she said. \"You have done so much for us and now we want to do something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By making me dress up as a girl and a cheerleader?\" Worried, you asked. \"You know that if I am placed on the roster, I will have to dress up as a girl all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone sees you as a girl anyway.\" Firmly but kindly, Sarah said. \"That and I know you are safe around my girls due to that malpractice incident when you were ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed terribly, turning to Emily. \"You told them?!\" Tearfully, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They figured it out on their own.\" Defensive, Emily said. \"Being neuter does not make you any less of a person.\" She then smiled. \"Besides, you are too cute to be a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed further at that. It was supposed to be a hernia operation only the surgeon got your papers mixed up with another patient with the same first and last name. As a result, you received a partial sex reassignment surgery as the nurses discovered the mistake half way through the procedure. The lawsuit that followed gave your family a fine settlement but it still left you looking more like a girl than a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the coach did was wrong, Cire.\" Firmly, Sarah said.  \"Let us turn a curse into a blessing by putting you on the squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, hoping to find some avenue of escape but the girls all had you surrounded as Emily held up the cheer uniform in your size in one hand and a pair of white panties with a matching padded bra in the other...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There, Sarah instructed you to remove your clothes and step into the shower. Seeing you blush, she giggled, \"We're all <i>girls</i> here, Cire. There is nothing you have any of us have not seen in the mirror thousands of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you stripped down to the skin and stepped into the locker room showers where you found feminine shampoo and body wash waiting for you. With a sigh, you showered yourself and toweled dry. Since the incident, mom had insisted upon you using such products so it was really nothing new. Still, you were surprised by how soft your skin and hair had become from using what they left you once. Having not yet hit puberty, even at your age, you had no hair anywhere other than on the top of your head which made you look more girlish. Upon stepping out, still blushing, Emily gave you the panties which were easy enough to put on then you were instructed in how to put on the padded bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The padding is made of silicon, the same material used for breast enhancements so they will feel real.\" Serious, Emily explained. \"We have ordered breast forms for you but they have not come in yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis startled you but your need to get dressed was more pressing to your mind at the moment and you quickly put on the cheerleading blouse and skirt which had sewn in bloomers top hide your panties. It was all a perfect fit and, turning to a mirror in the room, you looked just like one of the girls getting ready for practice. Emily handed you a pair of pink ankle socks and girls sneakers in your size which you put on and sat down on one of the benches next to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good.\" Smiling, Sarah said. \"Now to complete the look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not like the sound of that and cringed as Emily approached with her large makeup kit in hand. \"Just relax, Cire.\" Calmly, she said. \"The idea of makeup is to look as if you are not wearing any at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't get it...\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled as the other cheerleaders giggled. \"You will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the makeover started with Emily giving you a foundation brush loaded with a powder that matched your skin tone. \"Soft circles or it won't look even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're making me do it?\" Surprised, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to know how to do this yourself as you will need to do this every morning.\" Serious, Emily said. \"Trust me, you'll look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, you began to apply the foundation to your face, using the mirror to guide you as Emily and Sarah coached you through it. Next came some blush, mascara, lip liner, lipstick and lip gloss as well as eyeliner and a shot of perfume. Emily then began to work on your hair, brushing it out until it shined the added two butterfly clips to keep it out of your eyes. When she finally announced that your makeover was done and you looked into the mirror in shock. What greeted you was not a feminine looking boy but a blue eyed, dust blond teenage girl in a cheerleading uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is- Is that really me?\" Almost whispering, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is really you, Cire.\" Kindly, Sarah said. \"You make a beautiful girl.\" She placed a light hand onto your shoulder. \"Welcome to the squad, <i>Miss</i> Masters..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as the cheerleaders cheered and escorted you out onto the field where the other cheerleaders cheered as well. You were given a number of compliments and hugs, making you blush further before Emily motioned to the field. \"The football team is beginning their practice.\" Smiling, she said. \"Let's introduce them to our newest member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that, not seeing Sarah shaking her head. \"No, I want to save that for their first home game next week.\" Serious, she said. \"Cire may know cheerleading in and out but she has no idea how to act like a young lady out of uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheer captain, Rachel Stone, a near mirror image of coach Sarah became thoughtful. \"Cire is going to need a small wardrobe to start her new life.\" Serious, she said. \"Dad owns a clothing surplus store here in town, we can get her a good deal on the latest fashions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Porter, Emily's best friend got into the spirit. She was near Emily's size with shoulder length red hair and green eyes. \"My mom has a shoe store in the local mall.\" Excited, she said. \"She is also a female etiquette coach, she can help Cire learn to present herself as a proper girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned to you. \"What do you think, Cire?\" Kindly, she asked. \"I'd rather have you wait before revealing yourself to the football team, slowly having them see your transformation build up to the home game but the choice is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I might as well practice with the rest of you today since all of you went though so much trouble for me.\" Nervous, you said. \"Still, I'd rather wait for the big reveal too as I'm still not sure about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled as Emily and Susan giggled. \"You're no trouble at all, Cire.\" Kindly, she said. \"I promise you made the right decision.\" She then turned serious. \"Alright, girls! Get into formation, we have a new cheerleader to break in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed more at that, if it were even possible as practice began and you were run through the drills. Practice was hard and tiring but it felt good to be a part of a team, even it was though a team of the opposite gender. When practice ended two hours later, Sarah ordered everyone to hit the showers. That was when you realized you had no clothing to wear other than your old clothes which Emily had put into a bag. She let out a giggle seeing your worried expression. \"We got you a set of clothing to wear after practice... <i>sis</i>.\" Grinning, she said. \"Relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very uncomfortable showering with all of the girls and washed yourself as quickly and neatly as you could. The other girls found it bemusing and giggled at your obvious sense of shyness. Coach Sarah was waiting for you as you toweled dry with a set of clothing for you to wear. \"Just try keep an open mind, Cire.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"You are one of the girls now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a weak smile and turned to the clothing to find it was a pair of pink and lace panties with a matching bra and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You always found it strange that the button and zipper were on the side but you had no difficulty putting it on. The socks that came with the uniform went up to your knees and were a bit harder to put on but you managed. After putting on the blouse, you looked in the mirror. A cute, shy little school girl stared back at you. \"This is going to take some getting used to.\" Sighing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine.\" Kindly, Emily said. She was also wearing the school uniform. \"Let's go clean out your locker and get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and followed Emily back into the school where you both walked through the crowd of students all getting ready to leave for the day.

You turned to Emily who grinned, obviously enjoying your awkward situation. \"This is Cire.\" Honestly, she said. \"She's my twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ryan Sands.\" Smiling, the boy said. \"I kind of stay in the crowd as my older sister, Bree is known as the gossip queen here at school.\" He blushed. \"I never noticed you before now but... you're really cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked at you, her bemused grin turning into a more sinister one. \"Well, my sister is a bit shy so she tends to blend into the crowd too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we have something in common.\" smiling more, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not help blush as you discretely threw Emily a dirty look, one Ryan did not see, before forcing a shy smile. \"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan took a cautious step forward. \"Maybe... Maybe we can get together sometime and have a soda or something.\" Shyly, she said. He offered you a small folded piece of paper you suspected had his phone number on it. \"Call me, if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated but Emily took the paper and pushed it into a pocket in the folds of your pleated skirt. \"She'll think about it, Ryan.\" Winking, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed further at that, not knowing how irresistibly cute it made you look. \"Yeah... I'll think about it.\" Not knowing what else to say, you softly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled, blushing in tune with you. \"Okay.\" Stepping back, he said. \"I look forward to your call... Don't keep me waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he hurried off, vanishing into the crowd while Emily giggled. \"Thanks for your support, sis.\" Sarcastically, you said. \"I don't need a boy swooning over me on top of all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to a girl's world, sis.\" Bemused, she whispered. \"I have to admit that I'm a bit jealous. You've only been a girl for a few hours and you're already sweeping boys off their feet without any effort.\" She giggled. \"This is going to prove interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree Sands is the senior gossip queen.\" Smiling, Emily explained. \"It won't be long before she learns that her little brother has asked out the new mystery girl in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the color draining from your face. \"She'll make the entire school curious about the 'mysterious' new girl.\" Nervous, you said. \"What have you done?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Cire.\" Smiling, Emily said. \"I just started a rumor that will help the school accept you as the girl you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"This is all beginning to scare me.\" Uncertain, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled. \"If you think this is scary, just wait until mom gives you 'The Talk'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, wondering if you had made the right decision. With all that had happened, you knew that it was already too late to back out. You walked with Emily to mom whop was waiting for you in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was tall and slender but muscular with long forest brown hair and emerald green eyes and a body models would kill for though she did not flaunt it as others might. \"There are my girls.\" Teasing, she said. \"How was your day, my angels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled as you blushed. \"It was eventful, mom.\" Softly, you said. \"But I'm guessing you already know most of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom motioned for you and Emily to get into the car where you all put on your seat belts and mom drove away from the school. \"I will admit that I spearheaded the effort to start your journey into becoming a cheerleader.\" Calmly, she said. \"Only no one is going to push you into becoming legally female.\" she frowned. \"This is just to teach that arrogant football coach, Rusty Rune a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy hit on me just before we left the school.\" Frowning, you said. \"He gave me his number and is older sister is the school gossip queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"My little girl is growing up.\" Teasing you again, she said. Seeing your face harden, she sighed. \"No one is going to force you to call him but, if this boy is determined, giving him the cold shoulder will not detour him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel 'The Talk' coming on.\" Wincing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"There are a lot of things girls need to worry about that no boy will ever understand, Cire.\" Calmly, she said. \"Because you were born a boy, you don't need to worry about getting pregnant but there other issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mom explained the various issues you would face being 'female', you began to gain a better understanding of how deep you had fallen into a girl's world including the fear of getting raped among other things.

The man easily towered over you and seemed forbidding with his crew cut black hair and rock like build. Only his baby blue eyes and gentle smile told a different story, you could not help shyly smile back. \"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my son, Cire.\" Serious, mom explained. \"I'm sure your wife briefed you on the situation at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"She did indeed.\" Turning serious, he said. He turned back to you. \"My name is Rodger Stone. I understand that the decision before you is a difficult one but I think I can find a style that will please both the boy and the girl within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started then.\" Calmly, mom said. \"We have a few other stops to make before we go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger nodded. \"This way then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were led by the hand to the teen girls section of the store where you were shown a number of jeans, shorts and skirts. You could feel the warmth of your blushing as mom had you try on one outfit after another. this included swimsuits, one piece and two piece which made you blush even more. The only thing that made it all bearable was that mom and Emily both asked how you liked the outfits. Reluctantly, you had to admit that you liked how many of the outfits looked on the teen girl you saw in the mirror. within an hour, you had built a small wardrobe. All that was left was to try on a few dresses which you had saved for last. It was mostly because you did not like the thought of having to wear one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all girls like wearing dresses.\" Smiling, Emily said. \"Still, they all own at least one so you need to pick out a few for your closet if only for appearances.\" Then she thought, <i>\"Or you decide to become a girl for real.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you picked out a dress at random and stepped into the changing room to try it on. You did not catch mom and Emily's bemused smile as you closed the changing room door. The dress was white with three tiers and a lot of frills. The inner fabric was very soft against your smooth skin, which made you shudder slightly as you pushed your arms through the short puffed sleeves. Only as you tried to reach the zipper in the back, you found it was out of your reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I can't reach the zipper!\" Blushing, you called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and mom entered smiling. \"Let me help.\" Softly, she said. \"It takes a little practice, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the zipper closed then pulled you out of the dressing room to face a mirror where your entire face turned red from your blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a wedding dress!\" Shocked and embarrassed, you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Emily laughed as Rodger unsuccessfully hid a smile. \"It's actually a flower girl dress, Cire.\" Correcting, you, he said. \"Still, it looks rather stunning on the girl in the mirror, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned, pouting at your reflection. \"Are we done yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"I think we're done.\" Calmly, she said. \"i picked out a simple white dress for you to try on later, if you want.\" She turned to Rodger. \"We're ready to purchase our order, Mr. Stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodger shook his head. \"My wife and I agreed there will be no charge.\" Smiling, he said. \"It will be worth it to see that arrogant coach knocked down a peg or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded in agreement then had you change into a pair of skinny jeans and a loose fitting blouse before leaving the store with your new wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to now?\" Sighing, you asked. \"It's been a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, Cire.\" Kindly, mom said. \"We are now going to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just trust me when I say you will need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you followed mom and Emily into the store to find Susan waiting with her mother, a near mirror image of herself waiting for you who introduced herself as Terry. \"Welcome to our store, Cire.\" Smiling, Susan said. \"You look great!\" She giggled seeing you blush. \"I can't wait to show you the latest fashions in footwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are shoes really that important?\" Wincing, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shoe fashions really do not change that much from year to year for boys.\" Serious, Terry said. \"For girls, especially teenagers, they are often judged by the shoes they wear and how they compliment their chosen outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without training, you will likely stick out like a sore thumb just for your shoes.\" Softly, Emily added, \"That is why they are so important to girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"It sounds a bit high maintenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Susan giggled as mom and Terry smiled. \"Welcome to our world, sweetie.\" Bemused, mom said. \"Don't worry though, we'll help you ease into your role.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your education on shoes began including how to walk in heels. Just as you thought you got used to them, Emily placed a book onto your head. \"Walk without knocking the book down.\" Serious, she said. \"Proper posture is a must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were again struggling to keep your balance while balancing a book on your head and each time the book fell, Emily or mom would give you a painful whack on the rear. \"Ow!\" Irritated, after the fourth whack, you yelled. \"Must you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily had to go through this too, Cire.\" Firmly, mom said. \"I had my turn when I was her age and now its your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to last forever though it was only really about a half hour before you were able to balance four books on your head back and forth across the store. Mom and Terry applauded you with Emily and Susan quickly following. The books were taken off your head and you were given back your pink sneakers. \"I'm done with this.\" Grumpily, you complained. \"Can we go home now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I know this is wearing on your patience, Cire.\" Gently, she said. \"Please just allow us a little more time. I promise we are almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at mom. The embarrassment of having to be a girl and a cheerleader for most of the school year was bad enough. On top of that, you were sore and tired from cheerleading practice. Now, your bottom and feet were sore from learning how to walk in high heels with proper posture as they called it. \"I don't know how much more I can take in one day, mom...\" Tearing up, you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are having a rough day, Cire.\" Gently, mom said. \"I'll tell you what... If you agree to go into one last store with us, I will buy you something very special. A little something extra, just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of something special intrigued you but you were a little worried about the surprise mom had in store for you at home. You moaned, not knowing what to do. finally, you sighed and gave a silent nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Cire.\" Smiling, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shoes are on us.\" Kindly, Terry said. \"Consider it compensation for your sore rear and bruised ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom hid a grin while Susan and Emily tried hard not to laugh out loud. You however, were still pouting, wishing for nothing more than for the day to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext mom and Emily dragged you to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then carefully applied the glue to your bare chest and the beast forms before firmly pushing them into place. You winced, feeling her hands against the breasts as if they were really yours but before it got to bee too weird for you, she released them and handed you a pink bra with a yellow bow on the front and white lace on the trim. \"I'm a bit surprised.\" Looking at you, she said. \"I ordered mid B cup breasts but, on your small frame, they look huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're heavy...\" pouting, you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced as even touching them sent unfamiliar chills up your spine. Gwen walked you through putting on the bra before having you put your blouse back on. \"The bra will give you a bit of a trapped feeling but that will pass as you get used to wearing it.\" Calmly, she said. \"The sensitivity of your new breasts will pass as well as you get used to how they feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great, honey.\" smiling, mom said. \"We already got you a sufficient amount of panties, bras, and nightgowns so we are done here.\" She then took your hand and pulled you towards the door. \"Now for that extra something special...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, happy your day was almost over but you were also a bit fearful of what mom had in mind.

They were cute, too cute for your taste. You looked at the other selections and pointed out a pair of earrings that had a tiny boy and a tiny girls side by side. \"I'd like to have those.\" Softly, you said. \"The girl and boy earrings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting choice.\" Bemused, mom said. \"May I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw mom a look that told her she knew why but because Emily and the young saleslady seemed to be waiting for an answer, you replied, \"I'm a tomboy.

You closed your eyes, expecting a painful pinch but felt nothing but a little pressure. Before you knew what was happening, the saleslady announced she was done. You looked into the mirror next to the chair and gawked at your new look. You now had a tiny silver girl on your left earlobe and a tiny silver boy on your right. Though you were hoping they would have been placed the other way around, you smiled and said, \"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it, sweetie.\" Hugging you, mom said. \"Now we can go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you all left the mall. You and Emily helped mom load the car with your new small wardrobe and mom drove you both home. The ride was quiet but not really uncomfortable as you were lost in thought over the events of the day. You woke up this morning as a sad and depressed teenage boy. Now, you were going home as a confused, shy and cute teenage girl. <i>\"Curiouser and curiouser... how deep does the rabbit hole go...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a strange way, you felt like Alice in Wonderland, falling deeper and deeper into a strange world, a girl's world. You began to wonder if there would be any way out for you once it was all over. You wondered if you would really want to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom... What if I get to like this?\" Nervous, you asked. \"Being a girl, I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will cross that bridge when we get to it, honey.\" Kindly, mom said. \"Right now, I think you've had enough adventure for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning home, mom asked you to unlock the door while she and Emily started to gather your new belongings. You eagerly walked up to the front door, hoping to find some form or normalcy, and thrust the key into the lock. Only, as you opened the door, the inside lights came on, forcing you to let out a high pitched shriek as you heard a chorus of female voices yell, <b>\"Surprise!!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled behind you, carrying one of the boxes. \"I guess you forgot that little surprise I mentioned was waiting for you at home.\" Bemused, she said. \"The entire cheer squad came here to celebrate...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Waiting for you there were all five cheerleaders from your class with coach Sarah Stone, all wearing casual dresses and flats. You and Emily made it a full squad of seven.

You knew her as Bree West, an all over tomboy who had more than once stood up for you when the boys picked on you for your feminine looks. \"I see you finally found the courage to try out, Cire.\" Teasing, she said. \"I'm glad you made the cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed more at that but found yourself softly saying, \"Actually... so am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Grinning, Bree demanded. \"Speak up like a mother bear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis irritated you after all that had happened and, before you could stop yourself, you blurted out,  \"I'm glad I made the cut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBree smiled. \"That's more like it!\" Tussling your hair, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed more, not believing what you had just done and turned to the last girl. She was short and slender with short black hair and blue eyes. She smiled shyly at you, which you returned. Her name was Amy Smith whom had a slight weight issue the year before. You had more than once stood up for when she was picked on and showed her how cheerleading could change her life. \"You helped me regain my spirit and confidence.\" Smiling, she said. \"I'll do all I can to do the same for you.\" She surprised you with a warm hug. \"Welcome to the squad... and womanhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not know how to react to that so you merely smiled. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of the boxes have been unloaded.\" Taking your arm, Emily said. \"It's time for you get ready for the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped remembering that everyone was wearing dresses. \"That dress mom bought for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled, holding up the simple white dress. \"Yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't keep us waiting, girls.\" Teasing, Sarah said. \"Let's get this party started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Emily half carried, half dragged you up the stairs to your bedroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were peal inlays around the collar which dipped low enough to show a modest amount of cleavage. You were wearing white flats but no stockings to hide your legs. Fortunately, they were naturally smooth and silky thanks to mom insisting upon you using feminine hygiene. Mom and Emily were right behind you, wearing similar dresses but everyone's eyes were fixed upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look absolutely stunning, Cire.\" Gushing, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th- Thank you.\" Blushing, you said. \"It- It wasn't easy to look this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed, confusing you before mom placed a gentle hand onto your shoulder with a kind smile. \"We all know it was not easy for you to turn out this way.\" Bemused, she said. \"However, to the unsuspecting boy or girl, you are a real knockout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could look as good as you.\" Smiling, Susan said. \"You make it look effortless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad for being born a boy.\" Grinning, Bree said. \"You still need some work though.\" She giggled, seeing worry on your face. \"Don't worry, we'll show you the ropes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sitting down, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled. \"For starters, close or cross your legs when you sit.\" Pointing, she said. \"Unless you want every boy to get a clear view up your dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a short yelp before quickly crossing your legs as the girls laughed again. \"There is a lot you need to learn, Cire.\" Smiling, Emily said. \"We'll be giving you a crash course though the entire party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honored...\" Sighing, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Don't you fret, honey.\" Cooing you, she said. \"We'll make it fun for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked to the door and opened it. \"Gentlemen, you are just in time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around to see a number of boys walking in wearing suits. \"You invited some boys to the party?!\" Whispering, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to run but Sarah and Emily had a firm hand onto your shoulders. \"Relax, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, Sarah said. \"These are the cheerleader's boyfriends, you are going to be seeing a lot of them. They were invited to meet the mysterious new member of the squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going to spark a conversation with you at some point.\" Serious, Emily added. \"It's best if you are introduced to them with us around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cire, we invited one boy you might know.\" Smiling, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped seeing Ryan Sands walking in. He spotted you immediately and blushed in tune with yourself. \"You look breathtaking, Cire.\" Stunned, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled as you blushed even more. \"Thank- thank you...\" Nervous, you replied. \"You look rather dashing yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCire walked up to you and took your hand into his. You could feel your heart racing as he gently kissed the top of your hand like the gentlemen of old before asking, \"May I have this first dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed even more and turned to mom to find her struggling not to laugh at your awkward situation. It was clear to you that she was enjoying this. Only you had to answer him or risk hurting his feelings. With a sigh, you nodded in agreement and began to dance around the room with him with the others following while a slow love ballad played on the sound station...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah was dancing with her husband and mom was watching from the snack table with a bemused grin. You could not help blush as Ryan placed his free hand against your side as he led you around the room to the beat of the slow music. Your heart raced, you did not know what to do or say. Sure you looked exactly like a girl, with your short stature, narrow frame and rounded shoulders. Even if he were to see you naked... <i>\"Don't think about that!\"</i>  blushing, you thought. <i>\"It's not like I'm going to fall for him. Just smile politely, and dance.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and blushed further as Ryan shyly returned your smile, thinking you were smiling at him and slowly lowered his hand from your side to your hip. You jumped slightly as you felt an unfamiliar chill run up your spine along with an odd warmth beginning to build in deep within your nether regions. You had an idea of what it meant. Worse, the warmth seemed to then start building inside your breast forms as well. You remembered aunt Gwen telling you that the breast forms she gave you had sensors that allowed you to feel with them. You began to realize that they not only looked like real breasts, they acted like them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is this guy actually turning me on?\"</i> Frightened, you thought. <i>\"How is that even possible?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, you slowly pushed Ryan's hand back to your side in fear the strange feelings might overwhelm you. You sighed, feeling the sensations slowly subsiding then whispered to Ryan, \"Slow down, champ. The party is just starting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan blushed terribly, his eyes offering his apology to which your eyes gently accepted. You caught mom's eye, she was smiling as if struggling not to laugh. She had seen what had happened and seemed to enjoy every minute of it. Eventually, the song ended and everyone parted for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a drink?\" Still blushing, Ryan asked. \"Maybe we can find somewhere private to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, again, frightened that the thought actually sounding flattering. \"Um... a drink sounds good.\" Softly, you said. \"Just... we stay where the party is, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded, looking embarrassed. You touched his hand, bringing the sensations back, causing you to tremble slightly. \"I'm not offended, Ryan.\" Trying to sound reassuring, you said. \"You are a fine dancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled, his blush growing. \"So are you... I'll get us some drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ryan walked to the snack table while you walked out of the room with mom following. She found you holding onto a table, quietly gasping for breath, begging the strange sensations to subside. \"What's wrong, Cire?\" Worry in her voice, she said. \"Did Ryan's move make you feel that uncomfortable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking and teary eyed, you quickly explained what had happened during the dance. \"It was overwhelming, mom.\" Quivering, you said. \"How could I be falling for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"You are just reacting as any other person would in your situation.\" Calmly, she explained. \"It's just your fear getting the best of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Wincing, you said. \"I have never felt this way before... I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it.\" Firmly but kindly, mom ordered. \"No one is going to try anything cute while the cheer coach and I here. You have nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking as Ryan turned the corner, looking concerned. \"Is Cire okay?\" Wincing, he asked. \"I didn't do anything wrong, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled politely at Ryan. \"You have nothing to worry about, young man.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"Cire is just...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He placed the two cups of punch he was holding onto a table. \"Turn around, I might be able to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, you turned around and Ryan began to gently massage your shoulders in a way that nearly made you melt on the spot. Your knees began to shake and Ryan guided you into a chair as he continued to massage your shoulders. You saw mom smiling like before, trying hard not to laugh at your situation. A low moan escaped your lips as you felt your body relaxing. It was unnerving to you that Ryan seemed to have so much power over you but the way he was so easily relaxing your body made you hesitant to ask him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn this, Ryan?\" Bemused, mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is a masseuse and taught me all sorts of techniques in case she needed a massage herself.\" Smiling, Ryan replied. \"I thought everyone knew with my sister being the gossip queen and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ryan stopped and you turned, somewhat disappointed to find the girls and their boyfriends peering into the room. All of them had bemused to amused smiles on their faces causing both you and Ryan to blush profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like my twin sister is growing up.\" Teasing, she said. \"One dance and you two are already an item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"Cire was having a rough day so Ryan was kind enough to massage her stress away.\" Smiling, she explained. \"Only I think she's a bit disappointed that he suddenly stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought giggles and laughs before a tall, muscular boy with short brown hair and green eyes approached. You knew him as Emily's boyfriend, Frank Jones. \"First day as an official cheerleader and you are already sweeping boys off their feet.\" Grinning, he said. \"He then carefully whispered. \"You transitioned nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him, you blushed even more. Frank knew you were a boy, having dated Emily for a while and guessed that they told him you had transitioned from male to female due to the malpractice incident. \"We- We're just friends.\" Lamely, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... just- just friends.\" Blushing, Ryan agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you are.\" Smiling, Frank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked off, the second boy walked up with Susan at his side. He was near her height with longish blond hair and brown eyes. \"I'm Ty Rodgers.\" politely, he said. \"Susan told me a lot about you.\" he smiled. \"I never thought I would ever see such a shy tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's only shy when she has to bring out her feminine side.\" Grinning, Susan said. \"It makes her feel a bit out of her element.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded at that as it was pretty much true, making Ty smile. \"You got nothing to worry about with us around.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"We'll keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a weak smile as the next boy walked up with Amy. He was tall and slender with unkempt black hair and green eyes behind a pair of large round glasses. \"The name is Dan Harbor.\" Politely, he said. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Cire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th- Thank you.\" shyly, you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan smiled. \"No need to be shy around us.\" Calmly, he said. \"We are all an extended family here, look out for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan is the team kicker.\" Smiling, Amy said. \"He's also the backup quarterback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked back to the party as Bree walked up with a tall and muscular man holding her by the arm. He had longish brown hair and piercing green eyes. \"So this is the mysterious shy tomboy Bree has been babbling about all afternoon.\" Making you blush again, he said. \"You seem physically fit but you need to gain some confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my boyfriend, Karl Flint.\" Smiling, Bree said. \"He's the quarterback of the school football team and physical motivator at the local gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It- It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Shyly, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl nodded. \"I can work with you.\" Serious, he said. \"Come to the gym this weekend, I'll turn you into a real tigress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled at that. \"She'll be there.\" Eyeing you, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can all use a workout.\" Hearing the girls' giggles, Sarah said. \"We'll all be there this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stopped giggling as Emily carefully whispered in your ear, \"If you laugh at who she targets in training, you are next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at that and discretely gave her a nod that you understood as the last boy approached with holding Fae by the arm. He was near your height with short black hair and blue eyes. \"I'm Erin Arron.\" smiling, he said. \"Yes, I heard all the jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin is the running back for the football team.\" Smiling, Fae said. \"he doesn't talk much but, once you get him started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the idea.\" Giggling, you said. \"I can be a chatter box myself at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...?\" Sarcastically, Emily asked. \"No....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, including yourself, laughed before you all returned to the party...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cheerleaders and their football player boyfriends welcomed you to the cheer squad and said their goodbyes as they left until only Ryan was left. He took your hand into his own, looking you in the eye which made you blush. \"I had a great time, Cire.\" Smiling, he said. \"Maybe we can get together again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... maybe we can.\" Giving a nervous smile, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause. You knew Ryan was hoping for a kiss but you were not certain you were ready to go that far just yet. Just as Ryan was about to release you and walk away, mom gave you a discrete shove forward. A yelp escaped your lips, causing Ryan to turn your way just as your lips made contact with his own! Knowing you were now committed, you pulled him into to you and gave him a kiss deep enough to leave some of your lipstick on his lips. Upon releasing him, he stumbled back a step before looking at you, stunned. \"Wow...\" Whispering, he said, blushing. \"What a kiss...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved forward, hoping for a second kiss but you stopped him. \"That was for being a gentleman, Ryan.\" Firmly but kindly, you said. \"You'll have to earn that second kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan walked away in silence, an odd smile on his face. You watched him walk away towards the bemused faces of the other cheerleaders and football players before closing the door. \"That boy is in love...\" Grinning, Emily teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to shove me, mom?!\" Embarrassed, you demanded. \"I thought you said you were not going to face this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit I gave you a little nudge.\" Smiling, mom said. \"Only you have to admit, you were tempted to give him that kiss. i just helped you out before it became too late to make that decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me that you won't do that again.\" Annoyed, you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"I promise...\" She then smiled. \"Why don't you go upstairs and put away your new wardrobe. I helped by making room for it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. \"You took all of my clothes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have new clothes, honey.\" Calmly, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up the stairs to your bedroom and opened your wardrobe. Everything was gone, every last piece of your male clothing had been taken away! You checked your dresser drawers to find all of the clothing there gone as well!

Something had to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think making me one of the girls was the answer...\" Crying, you said. \"I don't feel like a girl, I don't know how I feel!\" You shuddered. \"Worse, mom made me kiss that boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only your first day, Cire.\" Softly, Emily said. \"I'm sorry everything moved as quickly as it did and I promise I will talk to mom about tonight.\" She sat down on the bed next to you and took your hand into her own. \"Just promise me that you will give this a chance. We are only doing this to help you, to give you a reason to hold your head up high again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, still sobbing. You were frightened and uncertain. Your entire world got turned upside down in less than a single day and mom pressuring you like she did was not helping.

What kind of dress wouldn't come off, even going so far as to be resistant to a knife? Unless you were having just a very bad dream, this was practically supernatural stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?!\" you cried to yourself, not sure what in the world to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family was all out, gone for weeks still. You briefly considered the idea of calling them, or perhaps someone else you knew well. Yet, what would be the point? If you called someone about this, they'd think you were crazy.

From your now delicate hands, the changes were slowly crawling up your arms, smoothing out skin as it crept along. Whatever muscles you had (which wasn't a lot mind you) were slowly getting smaller, to the point where they weren't too noticable. What armpit hair you had was slowly falling out too, just falling to ground as it felt smooth and clean skin in its place.

Frankly, you wondered why you were doing it. Perhaps it was to gain some kind of security against whatever was happening. You ran straight to your bed, rolling on it a bit as your mind wrestled with whatever was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, with your arms all smooth and that of a girl, a new sensation was starting from your feet, causing you to look up at them from your laying position on the bed. You whimpered a bit as you could see them becoming smooth and smaller, just like your hands, looking very out of place against your legs, though that seemed to be likely next on the list, as it began to creep up from your feet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop!

Of course, your legs weren't fully done, as your skin and muscles were done, but certain other features were on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, your torso was wracked with changes next, making you cry out as you felt the twisting and turning. Things such as your waist caving in, your stomach flattening, and even the new arch in your back was enough to send waves through you. As with before, the hairs on your chest just fell out, joining all the others as you were pretty much hairless beneath that on the top of your head, as least for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this can't be real....this can't be real....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept repeating it like a mantra.

However no matter how hard you tried your hair refused to cut. It only continues to grow as it cascaded down your shoulders until it touched your hips resting right above your butt. Worst of all it was changing color as it grew. The dark brown hair you had was getting lighter. Much lighter. Soon you had beach blonde platinum hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your face finished changing only one thing remained. At this point all you wanted was for the pain to end.

Little did you realize it was your organs shifting around.

You were caught in that line between believing this and not believing it. It felt so real...but the last thing you wanted was to accept it. You couldn't even tell how old you were now. Certainly seemed considerably higher than the teenager you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though...you felt another shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what now?!\" you cried out finally, wondering what more this damn dress could do to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this shift actually wasn't on your body. You didn't see anything new on your body outside of what was already done to you, confusing you as to what you just felt. But then, right at that point, you heard creaking around your bed. You looked over, and your eyes widened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Oh no!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings around your room were beginning to shift. Your bed seemed to be widening bit by bit, while things like your gaming consoles and such seemed to be vanishing, causing quite a considerable shock to you. You happened to glance by your closet, where some major changes were happening. You waddled over to it, beginning to see every t-shirt you had transform into an assortment of blouses, dresses, and even smaller tops. Numerous kinds of bras were beginning to pop up, everyone of them enormous. In your dresser, your pants and shorts were all changing into skirts and other tight legwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even your shoes, the ones you just wore today, were transforming into a pair of high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get out of here!\" you cried as you saw that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all this made you feel very unsafe in here. Almost nothing was familiar as the room kept on shifting, any semblance of a teenage boys room slowly melting away. You didn't even want to see how this would turn out. Your room was still changing, but you didn't want to see the final result.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t care anymore, you wanted help, you NEEDED help. However as you walked towards the door you saw things around your house beginning to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a family portrait. It was of you, your parents, and your older sister. The picture began to change as you saw your image twisting and turning to match the body you have now. You seemed a couple years older than your 18 year old sister which put you somewhere around 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking you turned around and looked around to find everything else shifting as well. You grabbed a photo album which showed pictures of a beautiful little girl growing up to a gorgeous young woman. You pictures of this woman as she seemed to a live a life of the sexy, popular girl. Pictures of Prom dates with handsom young men. Pictures of her in cheerleader outfits and then dance outfits. Pictures of her in bikinis on the beach. Even your car outside had changed into a cute yellow convertible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to your phone you saw it had changed to a pink iPhone with glittery background. Your new background picture was a selfie of yourself on the beach. You thumbed through all your contacts not recognizing any of the names expect your family. You even checked your Facebook to confirm your new identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKayla Emerson.\u201d That was her name. This woman\u2019s body you had now. She had hundreds and hundreds of friends on Facebook and you found out what her profession was shortly after. She had an instram account with hundreds of thousands of followers. She was an Instagram model. All her pictures were of her trying on bikinis, lingerie, and sexy outfits like the one you were wearing and doing seductive poses. To make things worse there was even a picture of you in the latex dress you had on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your phone buzzed as a message came though. It was from your sister: \u201cJust saw your ur latest pic lol. No wonder so many guys donate 2 ur online account. When R U gonna get a real job?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through your phone you found similar messages from her. All your replies were super girly responses with tons of emojis and the a particular love of the phrase, \u201cUr just Jealous.\u201d Followed by a winking face. To which she would reply \u201c at least I\u2019m not still single\u201d followed by a tongue and cheek face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the phone you couldn\u2019t look at it anymore. You began walking in circles trying to catch your breath. All<br>\r\nOf this was too much you felt like the world was spinning, like you couldn\u2019t breath....Your mind had finally had enough as you found your fainting for the first as you fell backwards onto the couch. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was earlier in the day that you had put that dress on, and the sun seemed to be setting at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's....almost evening,\" you said drowsily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened a bit as you heard that familiar sultry female voice. You raised your head up, your view suddenly obscured by two large breasts. Getting up further only confirmed it. You were still a woman, apparently 21-year old Kayla Emerson. An Instagram model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....\" you sighed, your head still pounding a bit though not as bad as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in the world did this happen? How did putting on some dress turn you into this woman? Nothing about it made sense. This was something magical and not in a good way. You weren't even sure if you liked this Kayla person. She seemed pretty self-assured, perhaps more than you typically liked in a girl. At the very least though, it'd probably help to get out of the dress. You wondered how you weren't suffocating in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that and a sigh, you walked back upstairs, straight back to your room. It had finished changing by now, into one definitely that of an older girl. You didn't care to explore it at the moment though. You just wanted something to ease your mind a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but you did find at least something a little nicer, a top and a jean skirt. It was probably the best casual clothing you could hope for at the moment, and it wasn't as tight as the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....now what?\" you wondered, looking at the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could just lounge around here. Perhaps best to just stay here for a bit since you had the house for a while, or perhaps get a little fresh air, though that might expose you to neighbors. </span></div></div>",

While this new body was definitely going to take some adjusting too you at least had time to think about what caused this change. You spent awhile examining the dress you put on earlier to find out very little about it. There was no tags, no labels, nothing. Just a black latex mini dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot getting any answers there turned to the internet for help. Searching everything from curses on clothes to science in gender transformations. Nothing but rumors and old stories turned up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot getting anywhere with answering why. You decided to answer more of what, in regards to yourself. Just who was Kayla Emerson and what type of girl is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour answers didn\u2019t yield the answers you hoped. One thing that you noticed was odd was how she had no pictures of herself online pre-high school. Going back to your family albums you noticed something odd. The early photos of Kayla she looked much more like you, if you had been born a girl. She had the same dark brown hair, similar facial features. All in all a cute but normal girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up she aged like any girl would. She was pretty and cute. Her curves were also no where near as extreme as yours now. Her butt wasn\u2019t as big and round and her breasts were average C cups at best. No where near the huge DD cups hanging from your chest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she went from a normal girl to a sex bombshell in a matter of weeks.\u201d You said looking at her history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding more information you went back to your room you went on her computer as you typed in her password. \u201cSexy4ever\u201d Blinking a bit you wondered how you knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing your computer you found a folder named \u201cMy Summer Transformation.\u201d Curious you opened it. Inside were several video files. As you clicked the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as you saw a Video of Kayla still looking her normal self. She was talking with a doctor who was messing with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want it permanently bleached? It will dye your roots and everything. You will be a platinum blonde forever?\u201d The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next video was of Kayla standing in front of a mirror, now Platinum blonde examining her body in a mirror. A friends voice was in the background but you could see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big are you getting?\u201d The friends voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull DD\u2019s. Perfect, perky and round.\u201d Kayla said back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next video was similar but with her butt, another video had her visiting a tan salon to get her skin the perfect tone it was now. The series of videos seemed to document her complete change from a nice and normal girl to the total sex bombshell she was now. Workout videos on how to attain the perfect sexy body, diet plans, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. You saw her old report cards in the family albums. She got good grades just like you. All the way through high school. She could have gotten into college. Gotten a good career. Why did she do this to herself? Change herself into this sex object. What happened in her life to cause this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to know more only to suddenly interrupted but the sound of a doorbell. Who could that be? Your family was still out of town for weeks. </span></div></div>",

Still, you were kind of worried if someone would this suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, everything was suspicious now. Kayla's backstory, and the fact that you were her now. None of it made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess....maybe I should open....\" you muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you slowly began your way downstairs, still getting used to the new motion of your legs and hips in the meantime. Man, your butt just didn't want to stay still did it? Sighing at it, you began to approach the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla?!\" you heard a feminine voice call out. \"It's me, Sharon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon? Now that you hear that, that was one of the names on Kayla's contacts list. Hers was near the top actually, possibly indicating she was a more significant friend than probably a bunch of faces she's never really seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, guess this was a sign to open up the door. With that, you grabbed the handle and opened it, revealing a girl around your age. Pretty cute one too, with brunette hair and a really good body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you a while,\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you laughed sheepishly. \"Just....had a nap a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly a lie, all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good,\" Sharon smiled. \"I'd hate for you to sleep through this.\"</span></div></div>",

Ever since Brad and I broke up I\u2019ve been just super depressed. When you suggested a girls night of hanging out with drinks and painting our nails I remembered exactly why your my best friend.\u201d She said to you with a super big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name Brad was familiar. You remember seeing a picture online of a big strong guy named Brad. You hoped it was the same guy she was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw your new pic by the way. I love it! Super cute and sexy dress! Where did you find it?\u201d Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...it kinda chose me, I guess.\u201d You said not really giving away what you meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan laughed at your answer as she poured herself and you a glass a wine as she sat by you in the couch reaching into her purse and pulled out several vials of nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of going blue, You said earlier you wanted pink right?\u201d She said holding up a pink vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t really disagree with anything at the moment. If you tried to back out or push Susan away it would act really suspicious. You had no choice but to act your best and try to act like Kayla would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed with Susan and chose he pink color as Susan reached over and grabbed your hands. She began painting your long nails the bright pink color as she began chatting with you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...any luck with Jason?\u201d She said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm....what do you mean?\u201d You said in a shy way to try and hide the fact you had no idea who Jason was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on....He carried you back to your car and drove you home after that party. You were so Drunk you had lost your shoes.\u201d Sharon said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....that was a wild night.\u201d You said a fake laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...:I know how badly you are lusting after him. Not that I blame you, the man\u2019s gorgeous. He is a model too.  I think you might be the one who makes the first move for once.\u201d Sharon said as she finished your fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Sharon moved to your feet. Painting them the same shade of pink. You were trying your hardest to ignore the strange feeling and not seem weird about anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came time for Sharon\u2019s turn you were terrified but for some reason your hands operated on autopilot painting her nails perfectly with ease. It seemed that in this body certain girly behaviors acted like muscle memory to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nails dried and gossip was over Sharon had finished almost the whole bottle of wine herself as she began <br>\r\nTo suddenly take her clothes off revealing a bikini underneath. Puzzled a bit you looked at her as she looked back at you strangely too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said we could go in your family\u2019s Jacuzzi?\u201d Susan said wondering why you were still dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her blankly for a bit not even realizing there was a hot tub outside now, in your back yard. \u201cOh sure...I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d You said terrified of wearing almost nothing in front of another girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...no one is here right? Why don\u2019t we just go nude?\u201d Susan said with a wink as she motioned to take off her top to you as you suddenly froze with fear. </span></div></div>",

You felt like you were on the verge of yelling in frustration, yet somehow kept yourself from doing so, trying to keep yourself somehow mentally sane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery fiber of your being just wanted to say \"No!\" to Sharon's question....yet came the question of whether this is something Kayla would do. Perhaps so, given everything else so far. You couldn't do anything that might be suspicious, yet being nude in this situation wasn't something too appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end though, you felt as if you really didn't have too much of a choice. Guess you would just have to grin and bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure....why not...\" you faked a small smile, grabbing the underneath of your top to pulling it up and over, showing your huge bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're talking!\" Sharon laughed a bit, her own large breasts flaunting a bit as she proceeded to pull her bikini bottom down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like it was the first time you had seen a woman naked, but still, seeing one in this situation just made you feel strange. I mean, you couldn't deny that Sharon looked hot all things considered, but the awkwardness of the situation didn't leave much room for enjoyment. Still, you tried to deal with it, eventually pulling your bra off before going for your own jean skirt and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left both of you very much nude, though Sharon seemed to be having more fun with it than you were. Oh well, as long as she wasn't suspicious of anything. She just smiled and laughed, putting one arm over you as you walked alongside her to the backyard. Seriously, feeling your large breasts and butt out in the open like this gave a feeling like you never had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your hips had a natural seductive sway to them. As you stepped outside naked the cool air immediately made your nipples harden and stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping into the hot tub felt amazing though. Your skin was much more sensitive now. The hot water and bubbles caused a pleasureable tingling sensation all over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the both of you were in the tub Sharon stretched out and looked over to you. \u201cThat\u2019s for having me again. I know you have heard my stupid rants about boys before it just means a lot to have a friend that\u2019s going through what I am. Ever since you convinced me to have the procedure My emotions are just harder to control. I don\u2019t regret it one bit though. Can you believe that just one year ago this was me?\u201d Sharon said as she pulled out her phone and showed you a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture was of a short chubby girl standing next a cute but skinny brunette. You recognized the other girl as Kayla before she had any work done on herself. Apparently Sharon was her highschool BFF, but had recently gone through some kind of procedure to change herself like Kayla did. The how and why of that question still eluding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...it\u2019s crazy right?\u201d You answered back trying to be as open but vague as possible. You were trying to ignore the the large breasts floating in front you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...Can I asked you a personal question? Do you ever regret getting the procedure? I mean you gave up that scholarship to Standford and everything. I know the trauma after the accident must have been horrible and the money you got from it helped. I\u2019m really grateful that you paid for mine too. I\u2019m just curious if you miss the old you sometimes.\u201d Sharon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to answer this question. What trauma? What accident? You had no idea. What would drive Kayla to seek such a drastic change to her body. You had to answer the most vague way you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....sometimes it\u2019s hard looking at old pictures and wondering who that girl is. I feel like I don\u2019t even know myself sometimes. Like I\u2019m in the body of a stranger.\u201d You said with an obvious hidden meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean. How are you dealing with the side effects? I know they said increased libido and mood swings were bound to happen it\u2019s just hard for me to deal with. I\u2019m thinking about sex more and more and my emotions are getting tougher to control. I\u2019m just glad you are already in stage 3 while I\u2019m still in stage 2. When my hair starts to change and my breasts start to round and grow like yours I\u2019m going to need a friend to help my through it. By the way aren\u2019t you supposed to enter your final stage, stage 4 any day now?\u201d Sharon asked as she lifted one of her breasts examining it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStage....Stage 4?\u201d You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah remember? At the last minute you decided to do the full four stage process. The doctor advised only doing the three stage like me. You said you wanted the full complete Barbie body though. Your breasts should get another cup size or two larger and get even rounder. Yours legs should lengthen a bit and your hips should widen more to give you a serious hourglass shape. Your skin is going to have a more natural tan and your hair should turn total Platinum, basically bleach white but with the natural silver shine you requested as it grows to your ankles.\u201d Sharon explained to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....Umm....Yeah I had almost forgotten.\u201d You said with. Fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReall? You were so excited when they gave you all those injections. You couldn\u2019t stop talking about all the skirts, dresses, and heels you wanted to wear. You said you were going to be the sexiest girl in the whole city.\u201d Sharon said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of becoming even more feminine terrified you. This body was already too much, how much more could you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I know your goal is to become the hottest girl online. You have amazed even me with the amount of followers you have. Just promise me no matter how much more you change our friendship won\u2019t.\u201d Sharon said holding out her hand for a pinky promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember seeing lots of photos of old Kayla doing pinky promises with Sharon all the time. Leaning forward you gave her the promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice are we still on for tomorrow? The weather should hold so if you want to do that bikini shoot for your page on the beach we should be fine.\u201d Sharon asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sounds great.\u201d You said agreeing with little choice. You knew you couldn\u2019t go back on your word. </span></div></div>",

She seemed a lot happier than when she came in, which was good you supposed. She smiled and gave you a friendly kiss on the cheek as she left. You actually did the same, if nothing else than to keep appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she left and you were on your own again, you couldn't be more frightened. Everything was moving so fast, and now according to Sharon, you had even more of a transformation in your future. Hair that went to your ankles? Breasts even bigger than you had now? You weren't sure how any of those could be lived with. You could barely see anything over your breasts as they were now, and your hair felt beyond control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy,\" you cried out, hands in your hair. \"How could anyone do this to themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt brought back what she heard from Sharon about Kayla. Something about an accident and trauma? What was what about? And whatever it was, how could it lead to such a questionable lifestyle choice? Ugh, way too many questions to deal with at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, one way or another, it was doubtful you were going to figure out anything worthwhile tonight. Perhaps it was best to just get to bed and sleep on it the best you can. You got yourself a little dinner, not too different from your normal stuff, before it was dark outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...guess I might as well turn in,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting through as normal a night routine as possible, you found some night clothes for Kayla. Though, they were really tight, especially the top. Heck, a small part of you wondered if just going topless was best for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope...nope nope. I'm not going down that road,\" you said with resolve as you settled into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your night was somewhat restless, just trying to get comfortable in this alien body. Felt like forever until the sun was rising the next morning. Boy did you feel dead, though that actually wasn't too different from the norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.....\" you yawned as you stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you had hoped it was just a weird dream, but one feeling of the huge mounds on your chest quickly dissolved that. Great...and now you had whatever today had in store for you.</span></div></div>",

After you had gotten yourself out of bed you saw the blonde mop of mess you called your hair. Yawning you suddenly heard a loud squeal come from the other room. Rushing out you thought something was wrong but instead you saw Sharon jumping up and down with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in Stage 3! Look!\u201d Sharon said running up to you excited to show you something. Kneeling down she showed you her dark brown hair: In the middle there was several strands that had turned a bright yellow blonde:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...wow...congratulations!\u201d You said trying to sound sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! I\u2019m super excited! I won\u2019t have to shave anymore, my hair will be waist length and blonde, My boobs will be bigger and rounder, my waist will be thinner and hips wider and my butt will get bigger and rounder. My skin will get a nice deep tan. I will be a sex magnet for any guy who sees me! It\u2019s just the changes are going to be extreme and painful So I\u2019m nervous.\u201d Sharon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be here to help you.\u201d You said with a rather sincere tone. Much more than you anticipated in fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we still on for the photo shoot? I picked up the bikini\u2019s you asked for yesterday.\u201d Sharon said as she grabbed a back and pulled out a white and black bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon handed you the white one as you held it up. Your eyes widened as you realized it was a micro bikini. Two small cups barely big enough to cover your nipples and bottoms that were basically a thong behind with a tiny patch to cover your womanhood in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are the skimpiest ones legal in our state. Just like you said.\u201dSharon said as she began to undress and try hers on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to your room as you undressed and tried on yours. It was like being naked again last night. It barely covered your private and left nothing to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were this close to having a panic attack. You couldn\u2019t take pictures and post them online in this! You couldn\u2019t let anyone see you almost naked. Being this stripped down in front of another girl and a fiend was one thing, this was a whole different level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t do it....Your male mind refused to give in to this idea. You rejected the entire concept of this body let alone this life and everything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to walk outside and reveal the truth to Sharon when all of a sudden an intense wave of heat and pain hit your body like a tidal wave flooring you to your feet. You collapsed on the ground letting out a loud moan as your gripped yourself in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head began to pound as images flashed in your mind. They were memories. Not your but Kayla\u2019s. You saw Images of Kayla pre procedure. She was in this same room rolling on the ground in agony like you are now. She was ripping her shirt off as her normal C cups were pulsing and growing. Her bra stretching and threatening to rip. Until it did. They grew larger and rounder until they reached your shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next image you saw was of Kayla right after. She was standing in her room her new huge boobs looking way too big on her small skinny frame. She was on the phone crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I wanted! I said I wanted the basic one stage treatment! What! What do you mean I signed for the full four stage! That will turn me into a total Barbie sex object! I said I wanted the simple treatment! I told my friend about this too what did she sign up for? What the hell is going to happen to me? How do we reverse this? I swear I would find out who lied to me and.....\u201d Kayla said getting cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla fell to her hands and knees moaning as her small flat butt began to expand. Ripping her jeans as she moaned and cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry forgive me, I can feel the new desires creeping into me.\u201d She said crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the memories faded back as you were brought back. The feelings in your own body subsided for now. Standing up you began to realize something looking at yourself. \u201cKayla never wanted this for herself, someone lied and tricked her. The procedure overwhelmed her body and mind making her forget her old life and desires. The one person she trusted and told her secrets too also fell the same fate. Is that why you were put into this body? You were supposed to find out why tricked Kayla?\u201d You couldn\u2019t know for sure but you were beginning to think you were given this body for a reason....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon entered the room hearing your moans as she covered her mouth looking at you. \u201cOh my god! You\u2019re beginning stage four! I\u2019m so jealous you look so hot!\u201d She said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the mirror you saw your hair had turned a pure white with shining silver streaks. It had also grown to your ankles and looked like a mane of pure platinum silk flowing behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...I do look sexy.\u201d You suddenly said out loud. You blinked suddenly wondering why you just said that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know that while you were given glimpses of Kayla\u2019s memories at the same time her body\u2019s natural desires and feelings were beginning to take hold...</span></div></div>",

Was there really a grand conspiracy around? Was there really a nefarious backstory behind your transformation into this girl. You had to admit, it did give you a tiny bit of relief. Kayla wasn't a girl who threw everything away just to be good looking. Someone was playing puppet master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps your role was to figure out this mystery and help Kayla out. You had to admit, it was better than nothing. The thought at least helped you tolerate the idea of Stage 4 beginning in such a fashion. Your hair was so long now, almost impossible to maintain with its length. Obviously Sharon seemed to have no problems with it, but that didn't surprise you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, it made you wonder if Sharon was also due to go into Stage 4 sometime. You wouldn't be surprised at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we are!\" Sharon smiled as she parked the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you followed her outside, getting to a good spot at the beach. Funny, you normally liked being here, but now it felt like you were here for all the wrong reasons. Somehow your body still had this somewhat confidant stride to it, despite how odd it was.

That\u2019s half he reason you made us get these bikinis. You haven\u2019t been able to shut up about Them for months now. Especially now that\u2019s your stage four all you wanted to do is show off to them.\u201d Sharon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose names were so familiar. Where had you heard them before? You tried to remember as it suddenly came to you. In Kayla\u2019s photo albums there was several pictures with twin guys who were in the same class as her. The surprising thing was in those photos they were nothing special. Both Matt and Scott were really skinny nerdy guys. They were really nice but you never thought they were the type of guys Kayla would obsess over. However the strangest thing of all was whenever the thought of Scott would come up your body would suddenly get very warm, and a strange tingling feeling would spread out from between your legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to reach into Kayla\u2019s memories you tried to find something to explain why your body was reacting this way. Closing your eyes you suddenly felt something as another flashback began to come to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw several images flash into your mind. Images of younger pre operation Kayala and the twins and Sharon all hanging out together. Kayala and Scott even went to a dance together one year. However it was pretty obvious that she friend zoned him hard. Then more images. Images of a Kayla crying and moaning as she struggling with a changing body and of Scott holding and comforting her, last tan image of a vulnerable Kayla struggling to deal with her increased desires pouncing Scott kissing him furiously only to have him push her away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images stopped as you were brought back as Sharon pulled up to the twins house. Before you had a moment to respond Sharon had already parked and was pulling you to their door. You were trying to compose yourself and think of a plan when the door suddenly opened as you froze. Scott had answered the door but not the same one from your memory. This Scott was built and had an incredible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG Sharon and Kayla? I barely recognize you two! You just be what stage three Sharon? Wow Kayla are you already Stage four? I\u2019m stage three myself So is Matt! Come on in!\u201d He said with a smile hugging you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely able to move as you were pulled inside the house. You didn\u2019t know how to react in a party let alone one like this. Apparently the twins had undergone the procedure some time ago too. To make matters worse every time you looked or even thought about Scott your body would start to heat up. </span></div></div>",

Curious, you looked closer to find a number of girl's clothing in your size including undergarments in the first drawer of the dresser. All of them had a tag that read: <i>Made for Renee</i>. This confused you as you did not know anyone your age by that name. Looking back at the clothing in your size, you pulled an item off the rack and saw that it was a simple dress. It was white with pink trimming on the hem, collar and sleeves and an ivory ribbon sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration, you thought, <i>\"Why not? I'm bored anyway and who is really going to know?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further deliberation, you stripped down to the skin and slipped into a pair of white cotton panties with a pink bow on the front. It felt much softer than your regular panties and you could feel the lace and elastic gently hugging your legs and waist. Next, you slipped into a pair of white stockings that went up to your thigh. They came with strange straps that you guessed clipped to the panties so you did so. You then, with a struggle, managed to put on a training bra. You figured if you were going to do it, you might as well go all the way. Finally, you slipped on the dress like you would a long shirt and managed to close the zipper in the back before tying the ivory sash into a workable bow at the small of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I look like wearing all of this.\" Curious, you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to a mirror and blushed. With your hair kissing your shoulders, you looked very much like a girl. You giggled, though you did not know why and began to make a few funny poses in front of the mirror until Mike's voice reached you from the open bedroom door. \"You really should not have done that... sis.\" Flatly, he said. \"Mom and dad tried that on me when I was your age which is why I hid it all in their closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Mike concerned. \"What do you mean?\" Your voice now higher than normal, you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"Mom...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mother, Michelle, is an extremely beautiful woman, with D or DD sized breasts, an hourglass figure, a big butt, slender legs and a extremely pretty face face.<br>\r\nFrom what Randy had heard from his brother, a lot of men, and for some reason, some woman drool over his mother.

Randy looks at it, confused.<br>\r\nWhat's the point of this?<br>\r\nIt's not really doing anything, but it looks kind of cool anyway, to Randy. He then looks outside the closet. The closet isn't in his parents room, being locked in another entire different room.<br>\r\nSo, why is this bra in here? Randy shrugs. He doesn't really know.<br>\r\nHe looks deeper into the closet, and decides to look at other pieces of clothes, which for some reason looks like his mother's clothes.<br>\r\nRandy steps into the closet when suddenly.....</span></div></div>",

He looked back down, seeing the bra...rumbling or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is that?\" he asked, placing a hand on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right as that happened, the bra suddenly clasped to his chest, almost constricting him with how tight it was. He cried out a bit and fell to the ground, clutching his chest as he did. As he was rolling on the ground a bit, he heard ripping, feeling as if his t-shirt was coming apart. When he came to and looked at it, he was horrified to see that he was right. His shirt was splitting apart, beginning to fall to the ground in tatters as his torso was exposed. It wasn't too long before he felt the cool breeze on his exposed skin, nothing but the bra on his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! W-What is going on?!\" he cried out, beginning to get afraid of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all though, rather it was just the beginning. Randy soon felt the bra rumbling again on his chest, and it was starting to feel itchy. Each breath into his chest felt like it was expanding something, but he couldn't see what. He started taking deep breaths, wondering why he was feeling short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is....Augh!\" he cried when he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo mounds were growing on his 8-year old body, taking a small step larger with each breath he took. More and more they grew, going past A-cup size easily. He began to feel the weight soon enough, making him lean forward a bit as they reached B-cup. That wasn't all of course, as they continued to grow and push the bra out. Before too long, they had reached DD-cup size, perfectly the size of his mom's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what is going on? Why are mom's.....?\" he could barely even finish a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't help that, in his fright, he tripped over something...</span></div></div>",

But that's not the point here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing in pain, Randy turns his attention to what he tripped over whilst in the closet. He sees that he tripped over a pair of black-high heels, one of them now knocked over. Looking at them, he notices that the fallen over one is the left foot heel, which is touching his left foot as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, the left high heel seemed to jump onto Randy's left foot whilst the right did the same with the right foot though the shoe size is very big for Randy, who has small feet. Gasping in horror, Randy hears ripping as strands of his grey socks fly out of the heels like they're some kind of dog ripping apart pillows, leaving him barefooted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to get up but still managing to do it, Randy looks down bewhildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is.....Argh!\" Randy starts to question when suddenly pain shoots through his feet.<br>\r\n Randy looks down to see that his feet are expanding greatly, filling up these high-heels. When it appears to have finished expanding, the heels suddenly disappear, leaving Randy with large feet, exactly like his mother's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even able to question what's happened, pain begins to shoot through Randy's body. His vision blurred, Randy sees that the floor of the closet seems to be getting smaller with each passing second. Soon, Randy's head is able to barely touch the ceiling, exactly like his mother as she enters the closet. Randy is the same height as his mother, which is 5ft 9 inchs. He was previously 4, 5. His shorts that he is wearing look like they're going to burst due to how tall he is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Randy sees that his large feet are now normal, due to the fact they didn't change at all when he was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why....\" Randy goes, confused. \"Why am I....the same height as mom....?\" he stuttered, still unable to finish a sentence. He tries to exit the closet but the door is stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to not being familar with his new height, Randy falls backwards, touching something.....</span></div></div>",

He actually regained his balance against the wall. However, when he did, he felt something on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he said to himself as he turned around, learning to balance a bit better on his longer legs. In the darkness of the closet, he tried to see what it was. It seemed to be...some kind of hair? To anyone else, it would be a wig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this thing?\" he asked himself, reaching out to touch the thing and take it off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair was really life-like, as if it was real hair. It was really long too, long and brunette like his mom's. It seemed to work like a cap or something, but Randy never had really seen something like this. Still, despite how odd it was, he seemed to be feeling the urge to try it, just like the bra and heels. Right when he did though, he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what is wrong with me?!\" he cried to himself. \"Why am I being so weird?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his vantage point, everything seemed weird. Looking at his body, it looked like someone stretched out his 8-year old body. He still looked rather prepubescent, the exception being his large breasts. While he was a bit bigger, he didn't really have any womanly fat formed, something that would likely change at some point but he wasn't aware of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Randy turned his attention back to the wig. Looking at it, he honestly like the shade of brown. It was the same brown he had as well, inheriting that from her. The urge to try the thing was strong, even though he knew something odd had to be happening for him to be like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, apparently the choice was taken out of his hands. To his shock and horror, the wig began to move on it's own, frightening him like it was some kind of magic trick. The wig rushed right to his head, smothering his face briefly as it climbed up his head, letting him breathe again. His hands rushed to grab the band where the wig surrounded his head, adjusting itself over his short hair. Once he grabbed the band though, he tried to pull but it just wouldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, his head felt a surge of pain when the wig suddenly compressed, as it trying to force itself in. Before he knew it, Randy felt the band his hands were on suddenly fade away, feeling skin in it's place. Still panting from slight exhaustion, his hands tugged on a small piece of hair, and he immediately cringed when he felt it tug on his scalp, putting his hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, his fear even more so, he ran his hands through the hair. It was nice and straight, going down to his waist, and it really felt like his own hair instead of some item. It was really his mom's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....\" Randy cried to himself. \"I have mom's hair! Why am I like mom?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fright was becoming worse, yet he still couldn't open the closest. He was still stuck, no matter how much he cried for someone to let him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

His underwear hasn't ripped yet, though it seemed like they're close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Randy feels a bit of material near his feet. He looks down to see that a blue skirt is nearby, touching his feet. Blinking, Randy suddenly sees that the blue skirt is climbing up his legs by himself. What's also startling to see that when his legs come out from the bottom of the skirt, they look more and more like his mother's legs. Long, smooth and filled with womanly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the skirt stopped around his crotch area, Randy stands still in fear of what might happen. Then, a sudden pain rips though his hips and ass areas. <br>\r\nFirst, his hips expanded rapidly to the point of being the bottom half of an hour-glass figure.<br>\r\nAnd then, secondly, his ass expanded rapidly at the same time as well. Once it had finished, Randy's large ass filled with womanly fat looked like someone had managed to stuff very round watermelons up the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the skirt, satisfied that the changes to Randy's ass and hips have been completed, it then proceeds to tear itself, leaving Randy just in his (pushed to the limit) underwear and changed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking a little, Randy steps back and knocks something onto him by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?</span></div></div>",

The sounds of two men arguing over something in the parking lot. He went to investigate which is where he saw it. There were two men in suits one holding tightly onto his briefcase. He recognized him, it was Professor Donaldson, his science and physics teacher. He didn't recognize the other man. Only that he wore a dark suit and coat. He looked like some kind of agent with very finely tuned professional looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles heard them arguing over what seemed like the professors briefcase, the dark suited man wanted it but the professor seemed to refuse. They continued to argue for a few minutes, over what miles couldn't tell. Just when things seemed to be calming down the dark suited man turned to walk away. However as soon as he had turned from the professor he reached into his coat and pulled out a silenced pistol and shot him point black in the head.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe professor fell down dead before he touched the floor as Miles stood in shock covering his mouth to prevent a scream. He quickly reaches for his cell and dialed 911. He watched the dark suited man pick up the professors briefcase when all of a sudden he paused. Something had caught his eye and that's when his head turned and looked straight at miles....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause as the 911 operater asked Miles why he was calling. However miles was frozen in fear. For almost a minute there was nothing from either person as they each debated in what to do. When the dark suited man began walking toward Miles gun and briefcase in hand Miles tried to run but his legs were frozen in fear. He thought this was it for him when all of a sudden sirens came in heading towards their direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily his 911 call had alerted the campus police who were headed straight for them. The dark suited man looked around before holstering his gun but not before using his fingers to point towards his eyes then to miles as if to say....\"I will remember you and finish this later.\" Before dissapearing into shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream suddenly ended as Miles woke up sweating as he looked around not recognizing where he was. It looked like some kind of white room...as he wiped the sweat off his brow his eyes widened. There was something wrong with his hand. His nails were longer and there was long hair framing his face....</span></div></div>",

He had only enough tension to barely move his limbs but was tied down tight.  Looking around he tried to understand his surroundings. He was in some kind of hospital room. However there were no windows and only one door. He looked around for anything to help him as he saw something next to him. It was his own reflection in the shiny cabinets by his bed....or at least what he prayed wasn't his actual relflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was wrong with his look. His whole body seemed thinner, his body hair had vanished, save the hair in his head which almost touched his shoulders. His nails were longer and his face was defiantly more feminine. His chest was still flat but his nipples were much more sensitive. He could also still feel his member but only just. Miles guessed he was in the half way stage of whatever crazy experiment they were doing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust has he was struggling to get out suddenly the door to his room opened as three people entered. The first was someone he recognized, it was the FBI agent who injected him. He recognized her almost immediately with her uptight looks and tied back black hair. The second and their were new, a doctor and nurse carrying several trays of needles with odd liquids in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to his bed the agent placed her hand in him gently. \"Hey there Miles, I know you are probably freaking out right now but trust us this is for the best. The initial injections went well and your body has adapted and is ready for phase two. These two lovely people are going to finish sculpting your beautiful new female body and once your ready we will be ready to re introduce you to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles wanted to say something, scream, yell, curse, anything! But as he opened his mouth the nurse came over with a needle and quickly injected it into his arm. Almost immediately, his body relaxed from the tranquilizer however he could still feel everything done to him. He was now just unable to speak or move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the female turned from Miles she looked to the Doctor who was holding up two different needles with different colored fluids in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you would chose a body type for the patient based on his initial test results. I have here the two best matches for him.\" The doctor said holding up the needles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one will result in a higly sexualized body type. Voluptuous, curvy, large bust, and hourglass shape. The other is the athletic style. Thin toned, very lean muscle. Which one would you like to do?\" The doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment he agent looked at both options and pointed at the.....</span></div></div>",

Your future testimony will help shatter a dark and deep criminal organization. Please just trust in us that this is the best way to keep you alive.\" She said placing her hand in Miles' head for a second before turning around and leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was finishing imputing some data from the computer which seemed to be connected to a machine that was feeding liquid in Miles' veins. As he walked over with the needle he injected it into the machine which soon started feeding it into Miles' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles was desperate but unable to move or resist as he could feel the liquid entering his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The transformation will be a bit jarring and take a few minutes. Afterwards we will sedate you and you will wake up a whole new person with a new life.\" The doctor said as he moved down and stripped off his last remaining clothes leaving his body naked and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to document all physical changes and any abnormalities.\" The docitr said as the nurse stood over with with a clipboard to document and supervise his change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Miles to feel the effects. While unable to move he still felt everything being done to him. The first thing he felt was a tickling sensation as his hair started to grow again this time cascading down his shoulders and to about his mid back. It also started to change color turning a dark Raven color and also became wavy in style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he felt his body pulsing as his muscles and body fat began shifting around and redistributing themselves around his body. His legs grew thinner and his feet smaller. His thighs grew thicker and his butt started to swell larger elevating him a bit off the bed. Next his stomach started shrinking as it sucked in all the excess fat leaving behind a toned and thin waist. His hips soon started expanding as it felt someone was pushing out his bones as they formed an hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext pecs began slowly swell as all that excess body fat began traveling upwards building under his chest. Miles knew what this meant as the flesh underneath his pecs began to swell and rise slowly as they formed his new breasts. He watched as they rose slowly as he heard the nurse counting in the background as they grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-cup.....B-cup.....C-cup....D-cup....\" She said before coming over with some measuring tape as they finally stopped growing. \"Let's see....36 DD cup, very nice, and not saggy at all, perfectly proportioned.\" She said as miles had trouble seeing past his new womanly assets now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddbely felt a turging sensation between his legs as he feared this part the most. His once proud member was shrinking away and slithering itself back up inside his body leaving behind a new wet and warm slit. Lastly his face began to shift and change as his features became totally feminine as he saw himself in a mirror beside the bed. He now looked exactly like the picture the doctor had showed them. A beautiful and very sexy young woman with ling dark hair and a nice large bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://redblow.com/stuff/big-boobies-vol-3/big-boobies-21.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://redblow.com/stuff/big-boobies-vol...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the change subsided the nurse came over with another needle and quickly injected into Miles' arm as darkness quickly enveloped him as he passed out before he could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The delicate digits of her hand pressed against the soft plumpness of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she took her hand off her mouth and looked down.   Dressed in a silk nightgown, her eyes were met by two large breasts which sat almost mockingly above her rib-cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d the quietly mouthed to herself.  Terrified, she slowly sat up, and felt her knew body parts move with her.  A large clump of hair dropped to her shoulders, and covered her view, but beneath her head, her entire body seemed nearly hairless.  None on her arms, or legs or chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, with a mix of curiosity and caution, Miles lifted the bottom of the nightgown, the fear of what she\u2019d find immediately caused her to press her legs tightly together, which gave her confirmation to what her eyes were about to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer manhood was missing, replaced by a slit, with some lips, on what seemed to be a mound.   Slowly, she brought her dainty hand to touch it, only to have an instant shiver erupt on her spine.  This caused her to let out a high-pitched \u201cyelp\u201d and stand up in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Miles could deduce that he was in some type of dorm room.  It wasn\u2019t that big.  There was a desk, a bookshelf, and a closet next to her bed.   A window to the outside provided a background of sounds of life on the campus.  On the back of her door was a mirror.  The mirror showed a gorgeous woman starring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Miles walked towards it, with the reflection copying her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Miles said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Miles jumped back as the door handle started to turn.

I'm here today's drop off your papers you will need for your new identity. I have your new driver's license, social security card, student ID, and some papers on your background and new family history that you will want to read.\" She said setting the folder on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles was stunned as he she had to take a deep breath. She still couldn't believe this had happened to her. \"Why did you do this to me? Why am I a girl? You couldn't just relocate me like other people?\" She asked frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Jones Looked back to her and sighed before offering her a seat. \"You see the thing is Miles what you saw, we think it is tied to a much larger case involving a large and powerful corporation. We don't have all the clues yet but ignore suspicions are right the information your professor died for could have proved the company's dark secrets and finally exposed them to the public. You have to understand the lengths this company will go to keep its illegal research and development is limitless. If they could locate you it would only be a matter of time before you were killed. They could stage it anyway they like, with the amount of money and resources at their disposal almost anything is possible. Even your basic appearance would have been enough for them to eventually hunt you down so we did the only thing we could. Buy giving you this body and new identity we have wiped Miles the single college student off the map and given birth to Andrea Simmons. Young college girl with a bright future in journalism and polical science.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles...or rather Andrea now took in everything with a heavy heart but deep down she knew there really wasn't another choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now how am I supposed to build a new life? I have no idea what it's like to be a girl...plus I still feel and think  like my old self so what about my future how long will I be like this? Am I supposed to start dating guys now?\" Andrea asked.</span></div></div>",

Your name is Andrea Simmons, you are an only child and junior here at this university. You are majoring in journalism with a minor in political science. You hope one day to be a serious journalist covering major political stories. You maintain your body by doing Yoga at least three times a week and eating a balanced healthy diet. You are currently single but don't be surprised if many guys start trying to ask you out. You are a recent transfer to this school so you don't have any friends yet but I'm sure a girl with your looks can fix that. Any other small life details are either in that folder or you might have to get creative on your own.\" She said as Andrea followed along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what about my body? I have no idea how to keep care of a female body or maintain this appearance, am I just supposed to learn over time?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good questions Andrea luckily we have already thought ahead. After your initial transformation we went ahead and installed all the necessary S.A.M.'s into mind.\" She said as Andrea looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a S.A.M.?\" She asked confused at what they did to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simulated Actual Memory. It's a new technology that allows basic memories of certain basic muscle skills and memories to be implanted into the host, giving them all the needed skills to perform a basic task. The S.A.M.'s we used in you were all the basic female body  maintenance  skills. Things like how to do your hair, wear a bra, shave your legs, handle a period, put on makeup, know basic clothing styles , etc. These basic skills are pet of your memories now and you should fine performing them much easier. You will still need some practice for repetition but in no time you should be able to act like any other girl your age. Now before you ask S.A.M.'s are very basic so they can't teach you to be a master at  calculus or gymnastics or things like that.\" She explained to Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now last question what about me? I mean I was a guy and I still think like a guy, I still like the thugs I did as Miles, am I supposed to change that? Am I supposed to try and date guys?\" She said looking at her reflection as the idea of kissing and touching a guy crossed her mind for a second as she shook the thought out if her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Andrea that's the one thing j can't help you with, all I can do is give you some advice. You are who you choose to be...if you want to try and rebuild yourself as a totally new person this is your chance. If you want to stay the same person you were before you can do that too. As far as your body is concerned whatever you liked before should stay the same but new female hormones and estrogen runs through your body now so don't be surprised if certain girly thoughts or desires start to creep into your mind.\" she said comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last thing Andrea here is your new cell phone, my number is plugged Into under the contact Peggy, that's not my real name but an Alias we can use if there is an emergency. Lastly this goes without saying but you CANNOT for ANY REASON tell people who you were! Remember your safety is at jeopardy here.  She said as she stood up and began to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left Andrea took in a big sigh as she looked around her room a bit more. She found her closet full of different items of many kinds of styles ranging from modest to rather slutty and revealing. Same went with her shoes and underwear. There was also a purse in it with an evelope in it containing a credit card and a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. \"This card has a monthly limit of $5,000 that is your budget each month do not go over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at everything she had Andrea help quite set up as she debated what to do next.</span></div></div>",

As she got ready to leave however she suddenly felt something in her mind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea wasn't able to explain it... It felt like a nagging in her mind, like the feeling when you know you have forgotten something but can't remember what it is.

To her it seemed like only a moment had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Randy asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around and running her hands up and down her body she shrugged. \" I feel the same....thank you though ....\" She said before leaning in and kissing Randy on the cheek before Walking off the stage as her hips swayed  seductively  as she walked without even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd  applauded for a moment as Andrea shrugged it off. She was still thinking about this being her first day as a female. However something now was telling her that she liked the feeling she got when everyone was looking at her.

A true Genius when it came to S.A.M. Development. He helped grow their usefulness to new levels but his desires soon began to cross ethical boundaries. He swore he could start to influence actions and maybe even control people through S.A.M. Implants combined with hypnotic suggestions. The FBI soon shut him down confiscated his research after a few female interns were discovered.....unmm....pleasuring him in his office. However he managed to steal a prototype S.A.M unit that was designed to administer programs through the occular nerves. I guess he though running this far he was safe but when several students started claiming they had been raped here recently all of which had no memory of it....I knew something was wrong....are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea had calmed down but she still felt dirty....she had no idea her first sexual experience would be so violent even if they didn't go all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm okay but my body still feels strange....\" She muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those eye drops neutralized the suggestions but their effects won't fully wear off for about a day. Once you wake up you should be fine. Agent Johnson said as she escorted Andrea back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea hoped she was right but she couldn't help but shake the fact that with all the changes her body went through that maybe those suggestions would have some lingering side effects on her....</span></div></div>",

She was plagued with nightmares of that man touching her and worse the desires she felt in return. She hated how easily it affected her and how willing she seemed to give up her body to a total stranger. She had just become a woman and now it seemed that she lacked any real self control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to beat herself up about it too hard Andrea thought she could spend the day relaxing and trying to understand her body and how to just act and be a normal woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up she grabbed a towel and went to take a shower. This was the first time she would fully get a chance to see herself naked and examine herself. Once in the shower Andrea cleaned herself normally as her hands suddenly went up to touch her large breasts as she was greeted with a sudden shock of pleasure. She had to bite her lip to keep from letting out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" She thought. She had touched herself before but never got a reaction like that. It was usually just a slight pleasurable response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her hand downward her soapy fingers barely grazed her slit as soon another intense wave of pleasure struck her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before she knew this was not the typical reaction, it seemed like her body was much more sensitive than she was used to. Shaking it off she went to finish cleaning herself when she noticed her hair was tickling her shoulder blades now. It barely seemed to touch her shoulders before. It couldn't have grown this long overnight right?</span></div></div>",

She had no idea why she decided on such a short skirt and tight top as well as a paintbox three in heels. She had no experience in heels but luckily her S.A.M. Implants gave her a natural walking memory making it much easier. Her body felt much more sensitive than she was used to as she felt herself constantly tying to her keep her hands off herself. However as she walked and got more and more stares from guys the urges seemed to only get stronger. She kept tugging at her clothes as her bra was starting to feel a little tight almost like her breasts were still growing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tugged at her bra she wasn't looking as she walked straight into two frat guys on their way to the gym. One was blonde and clean shaven while the other was dark haired with light beard. Both were well toned guys and well known on campus. As she fell over her ass and tits were clearly visible as both guys got a good look before looking to themselves with a smirk as The blonde guy knelt down and offered his hand to Andrea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there let me help you up.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking Andrea gave her hand to him. \"Of course thank you.\" She said almost like a programmed response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the two guys her body seemed to be pulsing with desire just by looking at them as she felt herself getting wet as dirty fantasies popped into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you heading?\" The dark haired guy asked her his eyes glancing down at her large cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.......unmm....no where really.\" She replied, no really sure how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Chad and this is Bryan, we are both Aplhas, are you new here?\" The blonde guy said introducing themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah....just transferred.\" Andrea replied trying to keep her mind on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are having a party tonight you should drop by, our house is the big one across campus.\" Bryan said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would love to!\" Andrea said even before she could think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys smiled to eachother as they continued in before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way I really like that outfit make sure to dress sexy tonight if you want to impress everyone.\" Chad said winking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course no problem!\" Andrea said agin not even thinking before she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guys left Andrea's mind cleared as she just realized she agreed to attend a frat party and dress sexy for them. Her normal kind was screaming at her but for reason it was getting harder to concentrate. Tugging at her bra again it was feeling tighter again as she didn't even realize her boobs were slowly getting rounder and perkier.</span></div></div>",

As she stumbled a bit and looked up at the guy she ran into her heart almost skipped a beat. He was way nicer looking than those earlier jocks she bumped into. He had long and tall build with well kept dark chocolate colored hair. He was wearing dark jeans and a nice button up shirt, unlike the frat guys all wearing their polos and cargo shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there I'm Jack.\" The guy said helping her up smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Andrea....\" she said trying to keep her mind focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bump into like that would you like a drink?\" Jack asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please!\" Andrea said as her mouth suddenly spoke for her again before she could think. This strange compulsion was starting to get to her as she was slowly realizing something must be wrong with her. She couldn't stop herself from thinking about this guy she just bumped into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing jack into the party the two talked and drank for a few awhile together. She learned he was a senior and not part of the frat but got invited by a friend. The whole time they talked she wanted nothing more for him to just take her somewhere private as her inner mind kept trying to come back and tell her to slow down....</span></div></div>",

Listening to it she suddenly heard the familar voice of Agent Johnson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea please you have have to call back ASAP! I came by your place but you were gone! We ran your blood and discovered your Body S.A.M and mental S.A.M. We're over working in the sexual and submissive aspects of you. I'm sure you've probably noticed increased breast size or a desire to obey but you have to resist! You body is going to keep changing until it reaches maximum sexuality and your mind becomes lost by the desire to obey! No matter what you do do not have sexual intercourse in this state! If you do the physical changes will be irreversible! Please call me back and we can get your treatment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the message it was a like a snap back to reality.....Andrea realized where she was as her thoughts returned to normal. Looking down she felt the bikini top straining at her growing breasts. Looking around panic began to set in as she realized her body wanted nothing more than to be taken by this guy regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around she saw a bathroom and ran into it locking the door. She was panting trying to resist her bodies desires as she heard Jack return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where did you go?\" He asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here just....changing....\" She said looking at her relflection. She was looking totally different from before. Her entire body looked to be sexually optimized. Her breasts were now huge perfect perky tits with no sag and perfect rounded shape. Her body was tan, lean, and her long dark hair cascaded down her body. She looked like the kind of porn star or wet dream guys fantasizes about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Round-Fake-Boobs-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't you undress and come out and show me that perfect body of yours....?\" Jack asked  seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his request Andrea fought the urge to strip and go out there....she knew if she did she would go all the way and stay like this forever.

She was at the perfect balance point right now and she had to make a choice.....to stay or to leave....</span></div></div>",

As he moved in closer he quickly slid himself inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea gasped at the pleasure. It was unlike anything she had every felt before. She wanted nothing more than this feeling to last forever however just when she was about to lose herself forever........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack you son of a bitch!\" A loud voice yelled behind them as Jack quickly pulled out and spun around to reveal his girlfriend Jacqueline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea felt the pleasure leave her body as a dissapointing feeling took over her.

Andrea spent the night in a hospital room as they injected her with several strange serums trying to reverse the side effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally came Andrea awoke as she stood up walking to a mirror as she was greeted by a familar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Round-Fake-Boobs-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was a still that of the busty porn star. Her huge tits held perfectly in place with no sag and her entire body screaming to be listed after. Afraid Andrea backed away however she did notice something different. Her mind didn't seem as close as before. She could feel the familar desires within her but they did feel more contained. After a minute or so there was a knock at her door as she grabbed a blanket to cover her. Agent Johnson stepped through as she looked over Andrea with both judge mental and worried eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave us quite a scare....we thought the side effects had taken you for good but luckily that little slap brought you back long enough to come back to us.\" She said to Andrea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...:my body I still look so extreme.....\" Andrea replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Johnson sighed and looked at her. \"We'll there is good news and bad news....the good news is we reversed the mental influence to stop the submissive desires. You should be able to think for yourself again. However because you changed so much and with the little bit of sex you had we couldn't reverse any of the physical changes. This means you are going to have o deal with this body from now on. You will probably also experience a heightened sex drive and desire to wear revealing clothes but at least people won't be able to control you anymore. Now it becomes about whether you can control yourself.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more speeches Andrea was dropped off back at her room. She wa wearing a plain t shirt and sweat pants and she could already feel it inside her. Her body was telling her to shred these clothes as they felt hit and  itchy. She could feel the burning sexual desires still there within her but at least now she could try to control them....</span></div></div>",

There were small periods where she would feel in control again. It Randy was quick to flash his medallion into her eyes again removing her ability to control herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour Andrea got out of the car with Randy as they reached their destination. It was a nice large house out in the woods somewhere. Obviously built for privacy it reminded Andrea of a honeymoon lodge or bed and breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked up to the house together and went inside they were greeted with the sight of another woman. She was a very sexy and busty red head, wearing only lingerie as she opened the door for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master I'm so glad you are back!

I see some modifications have already been made but I know we can do better. Once I'm done with you my new buyer will have the perfect obedient wife he has always wanted.

Inside she was told to sit in a large chair as Randy went and found a strange looking  silver collar. Looking back at Star Andrea noticed she was wearing one just like. Without even noticing the collar wa suddenly attached to her neck as it made a small beeping noise when it locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the collar was attached Randy made a huge sigh of relief. He suddenly seemed exhausted like he had been running all day. Sitting down he took off the medallion he used to control her as Andrea suddenly felt her actions and words become her own again.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sick bastard! What the hell is........is......\" Andrea's words were suddbely cut short as she fell to her hands and knees and began moaning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.....is.....happening.....to me.....\" She cried out as her body felt like it was being engulfed in the most intense sexual pleasure imagineable. It was so intense her body was shaking and unable to move as it paralyzed her with ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her in the ground Star suddenly raised her hand. \"Master can I answer please?\" She asked as Randy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our obedience collar. It keeps us in line and makes sure we don't disobey the master. If we are good and listen it stays quiet but if we are Naughty and don't listen or talk out of turn it zaps us with pleasure until we are good again.\" Star said with her bubbly voice l.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea couldn't take it anymore. The pleasure was too intense to the point of being painful.....it felt like being stuck at verge of orgasm times 100 but never stopping....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....stop....I'm sorrrrryyy....\" She moaned as the collar suddenly beeped as the feelings stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy clapped for her gently. \"You see you can be a good girl too Raven....that necklace only controls people temporarily and requires a lot of mental energy from the wearer to maintain. However with the training you will get here you will become and wonderful and obedient as Star here with no need for any mind control.\" He said as he painted her head and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea couldn't believe he spit she was in. She had her free will back true, however she was still no less a slave and now stuck here.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You both take a seat at a table putting your bags under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosen up as the night progresses, enjoying the atmosphere. The best man's speech is particularly funny and the dinner is delicious. After dinner, music begins to play and the newly weds have their first dance and after that, others join the floor. You sit and watch with Rebecca, clapping and laughing, just generally having a good time. You have completely forgotten you are wearing girls clothes and that to the rest of the world you look like one so when two boys around your age in smart suits approach you and Rebecca you are taken back slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Max and this is Ben.\" The lead boy says as he stops in front of you both. He is very tall, around 6ft 3 and also handsome. \"We were wondering if you two would like to dance with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca giggles at this and looks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm I don't thi....\" you start but Rebecca interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Think there is reason why we shouldn't, right Keira?\" She says, kicking you under the table. \"We would love to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Max says looking relived.

Max leads you out to the dance floor then turns to face you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\" He asks grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, sure\" Knowing he means you letting him take the lead. He takes your hand again and wraps his other around your waist. You jump slightly as he does this. You look to the other females dancing and imitate them by putting your hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts moving and swaying and you are away. You have no difficulty keeping up as Max leads well and allows for your inexperience. You have major trouble looking into Max's face but looking around isn't fun either. You pass your mom and your aunt Susan who are also dancing and they both give you an odd, knowing look making you even more self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes of dancing you calm down a little and relax into Max's arms around you. Max notices this and sees it as an encouragement and dances closer to you, so close that you can feel his warmth. Not sure how to respond you move closer too. The music changes to a slow dance and Max dances slower now with more intimacy and purpose in his swaying. To your amazement, you find you are enjoying yourself. The music, the way you can relax not worrying about leading your partner and even just the closeness of another, even if it is another guy. Feeling more and more secure in Max's arms you follow Rebecca's advice and let go, matching Max's intimacy, looking into his eyes and not withdrawing when he presses his body against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time, dancing and swaying so when you look up from nuzzling Max's shoulder and see the dance floor is empty aside from you two, you blush heavily and glance around at those seated. Rebecca is sat with Ben at a table, talking, Rachel with her new husband but your mom and aunt Susan have their eyes fixed on you. Aunt Susan has a smirk on her face while your mom has a look of concern. How are you going to explain this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the music comes to an end and Max stops. You look up at him and see unmistakable affection in his eyes, he is smitten with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing Keira\" he says still embraced with you. \"I have to go now but I really hope we can see each other again.\" He releases you and rummages in his pocket producing a napkin and a pen. \"Here is my number, please call me, maybe we could hang out or something.\" he hands you his number. \"Bye\" he says turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye\" you say breathlessly. You watch him walk away, confused at just what happened but are soon brought back to reality as you realize you stood alone on the dance floor. You turn and trudge towards Rebecca who is waving off Ben who also appears to be leaving. You slump in the chair next to her and she immediately starts talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened? Spill\" she says eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, you made me dance and we danced.\" you say defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think more than that happened, I think you enjoyed it, I think you enjoyed Max\" she says giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off, I just did what you said and relaxed so it would go easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't tell you to snuggle close to him or dance with him for two hours straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really two hours\" you mumble to yourself. \"Erm I mean, the more time up there the less time we would spend talking so less chance of me being found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca doesn't look convinced. \"Sure, thats why you did it\" she says sarcastically \"So did Max give you his number or not?\" she asks slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He may have done\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha I knew it, are you going to call him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Rebecca continues to mock you and make you question your motives but thats really it. The bride and groom leave with Rachel being carried to the exit. Before she leaves though she gives you a cheeky wink. When it all finishes, you reluctantly join your mom and aunt Susan and take a car home with them and Rebecca. To your surprise your mom doesn't talk about your dance almost as if she is acting like it didn't happen. Your aunt Susan stays at your place for the night with Rebecca too. Rebecca shares your room taking your bed with you on a camp bed. She helps you remove your makeup and then you both go to bed. Being too tired to get changed, you sleep in your bra and panties and are soon away with your dreams  </span></div></div>",

You ran into the bathroom and groaned in agony. You hunched over the toilet, as you felt your body shrinking. You watched your arms as they became slender, and the body hair receded into your body, as your legs followed suit. Your hands began to shrink and you observed your nails growing. You stared into the mirror, seeing your hair grow longer and your face soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" you asked, as you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke on the floor of your bathroom, and stood up and stared into the mirror. You looked like you, no long hair, no long nails or slender arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some dream... What did I eat to have that dream?\" you asked, laughing it off. \"Must've been freaked out by that chant Sarah did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got ready for work and headed into the office building and sat at your cubicle. You scratched your head as you started to work when a head popped over and looked at you. It was Becca, your co-worker, who smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with your nails?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you,\" you started as you looked at your nails, which were now longer and painted pink. They weren't like that when you got here... \"Oh, right... It was a prank from my girlfriend, ex-girlfriend. She still had a key to my apartment and decided to get me back for dumping her by doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. And why didn't you remove it before work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't have nail polish remover and I was running late, so I couldn't pick any up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, use mine.  always carry the feminine essentials.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said, taking the bottle. You got a tissue and started to rub the remover on your nails. But it wasn't working. \"The hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically scrubbed at your nails, but the polish refused to come off. You sighed and put the bottle down and decided to get back to work. You started to type on your computer and saw that your nails were back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

It was like she lived with you but never appeared. Thumbing through your smartphone you suddenly saw a photo album labeled \"selfies and instagram pics.\" Opening the album you were suddenly greeted with a sexy picture of a smoking hot brunette with huge boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i4.fuskator.com/large/kUjRKK7p0MU/Brunette-Talia-Shepard-with-Fake-Boobs-Wearing-Bodysuit-7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i4.fuskator.com/large/kUjRKK7p0M...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw several other photos all just as revealing on the album as you were shocked. You had no idea who this girl was but if this was Hedi you definitely wanted to meet her! Strangely after the album you found a video recorded on your phone that was labeled. \"To Jake from Hedi.\" A sudden sinking feeling hit your stomach as you began to suspect something terrible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the video the girl from the photo was sitting on your bed wearing a tight black mini dress that showed off her big boobs and long legs perfectly. Smiling as began to speak to specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Jake! It's me Hedi! I'm sure by now you have noticed all my things around your place and you have begun to suspect the truth. Well let me start off by saying your fears are correct. We are in fact the same person! Well in truth we just share the same body. We honestly couldn't be farther from the same person. In a way I am the version of you that you always wished you could be. Sexy, confident, strong and assertive, not afraid to go after what they want. I know this is a bit of a shock Jake but trust me this is no joke. You are probably asking yourself how this happened in the first place? Well I'm not an expert but what I will say is don't be so quick to dismiss other peoples beliefs. Now comes to the tricky part how do we live together and what do we do going forward? Well if it was up to me you would be long gone Jake. I have all your knowledge but also the body and drive to make your dreams come true. You are just holding me back Jake. So the way I look it at you would be best off just letting this go and surrendering to me. Right now I can only come out at night but with each change I get stronger and stronger. Soon I will be able to come out during the day and even more I will be able to slowly turn you into me over time. I know this seems a bit one sided but you will soon see it my way. In fact now that you are aware of things you should be able to maintain your conscious after you change. Of course I will be in full control of the body so you will be more like a passenger able to watch and feel everything I do. You might hate this now but once I show you all the things I can offer I know you will give in. Oh and one last thing.....Don't try and do anything stupid or I can make your life a living hell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video suddenly ended as Jake stood there dumbfounded. He was Hedi all along?! Worst of all she was after full control over his body. He had to think of a way to get rid of her. Was this a curse? What did he ever do to deserve to this? Who could help him, who could he even tell? All these things were running through your mind when there was a sudden knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over you answered the door as Becca was standing there. You were a bit stunned to see her as you hadn't asked her to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jake good to see you. Hedi said to come over right before sundown. We are going dress shopping together tonight before the bar.\" Becca said walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was freaking out. Looking out the window it was nearly sunset. \"So....Hedi invited you over?\" You asked trying not to stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course. We had such a great time together last night she invited me out. You never mentioned you had such a beautiful and empowered sister! She is so awesome. She told me how sexy I am and how I just needed a small wardrobe change and a makeover.\" Becca said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my sister....right. Sorry it's just we are...on different schedules...I'm glad you had fun. Did she mention anything about me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit. Said you had recently been through a breakup and you had been a bit depressed recently. You should come out tonight and join us! Get yourself back out there.\" Becca said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh maybe I'll think about it.\" You replied. Getting nervous the sun was finally going down as a tightening in your gut sudden happened. You had to make a choice. Run off to the bathroom change there to keep your secret or say screw it to Hedi and just change right here right in front of Becca.</span></div></div>",

You ran to the bathroom and locked the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped to the floor as the same feeling as the night before came over you, but this time you fought to hold on. You felt hair explode from your scalp, and looked at your hands, which became daintier and feminine, with the nails growing out. You tried to pull yourself up, but your legs were busy slimming themselves as your anatomy was sucked back into your body, replaced with it's feminine counterpart. You finally stood up once your feet shrank a bit and you looked in the mirror as your chest expanded and your face morphed, from your face, into Heidi's the same face from the video. Her perfectly made up face finished forming and she made an evil smile as she looked in the mirror. She opened up a cabinet and pulled out a robe and put it on. You couldn't do anything but watch as she teased her hair a bit while making faces in the mirror, likely a little nod to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped out of the bathroom and glanced down the hallway. She walked into the living room and Becca smiled when she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi! Is Jake alright? He seemed out of it.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No! I'm trapped inside Heidi!\" you tried to shout. But nothing came out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's alright, it's just that he's still sick, probably his dinner last night.

He could see, hear, and feel everything the same way Hedi could, he simply had zero control over his movement. He could speak but only Hedi could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Heidi got dressed she picked out a skimpy black mini dress with three inch black heeled sandals. Her huge perky tits pushed out the dress showing a large anoint of cleavage. She did her makeup, put on her jewelry, and did her hair as she looked into the mirror seeing a sexy woman any man would die to sleep with. She blew herself a kiss and winked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we look good Jake? It's kinda ironic isn't it? The hottest girl who have ever seen naked happens to be yourself. Tonight is gonna be so much fun. If your lucky you might even get to experience just how amazing sex as a woman can be. Hell I would even settle for Becca out there. Part of having you inside me means I can go either way.\" Hedi said with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi don't do this please!\" Jake called out inside Heidi's mind but he was quickly tuned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi came out of the room as Becca looked a bit stunned. \"Holy shit you look hot!\" Becca said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thank you.

To make matters worse, Heidi could knock it back with the best of them and so your ability to observe was slowly diluted by inebriation and intoxication.</span></div></div>",

He could feel every touch and kiss but couldn't say or do anything about it. He wanted to tell Becca to run but Heidi remained firmly in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the party finally died down both girls took a cab back to Jake's place as they were both pretty drunk as they walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that was amazing!\" Heidi said as laughed and stumbled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!

She stripped from her clothes and changed into a sexy nightgown before laying down in your bed. The transformation started to reverse, which was much less painful for Heidi. She simple lay there, sleeping as the arms bulked out and grew hair, her hair started to recede back into her skull, until it was back to your length. Her nails shortened and her hands and feet grew as her breasts receded and her womanhood was replaced with your manhood. Her face shifted until it was your face again and you were back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later you woke up in a cold sweat. You looked at yourself, and remembered that Becca was in the living room. You quickly traded the nightgown for some of your clothes and you tiptoed into the living room.

Guess you had a fun night, huh?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Becca said, looking guilty. You knew why. \"Where's Heidi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's out. She likes to wake up early and run errands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you by any chance give me a ride? We had to leave my car at the club since we got a little drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.

She was still dressed in her party dress but seemed to try and cover herself whenever you glanced over to her. She was no where near this shy with Heidi last night. You couldn't believe how different she acted around Heidi compared to you now. After you dropped her offf she paused for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen..Jake, I'm sorry if you are offended, your sister and I just....well we just had fun last night is all. Please don't think of me differently.\" She said as she got out of the car and left before you could respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit hurt seeing Becca had very clearly made her feelings towards you known before. You were the one who actually turned her down months ago when you were still dating Sarah before she started going nuts with all the crazy Wiccan stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right then you realized it....\"Sarah!\" You said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat crazy chick must have cursed you or something! That was the only explanation to what was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in your car you drove off quickly to her house racing like a bat out of hell. You were furious and demanded answers. You couldn't let Heidi just control half your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile you arrived at Sarah's . Getting out of the car you stormed over to her house and pounded on the door. After a few minutes Sarah opened the door in her bathrobe as she yawned and brushed her long red hair out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake? What the hell do you want? You didn't leave any stuff here if that's what you want.\" She said rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know exactly why I'm here....don't play dumb. You cursed me did you? Do you have any idea what you done to me?\" You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about Jake? Keep your voice down, come on inside.\" She said bringing you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out your phone you found a picture of Heidi and showed it to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i4.fuskator.com/large/kUjRKK7p0MU/Brunette-Talia-Shepard-with-Fake-Boobs-Wearing-Bodysuit-7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i4.fuskator.com/large/kUjRKK7p0M...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is super hot congrats Jake so why are you complaining?\" Sarah said yanwning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my new girlfriend this is me! Or at least she shares my body. This is Heidi, she is like my dark side come to life. I transform into her now every night once the sun goes down!\"  You yelled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...are you being serious? You aren't drunk or high right now?\" She asked a hit shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I'm kidding? How do we fix it? I knew you liked all this Wiccan magic crap but I didn't think you would ever actually curse me!\" You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jake....if what you are saying is true I'm so sorry. I can't believe that spell was real....\" Sarah said still a bit in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...are you saying you didn't know what was going to happen?\" You asked even more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....no not really. Listen Jake I only recently got into my Wiccan beliefs after some digging into my family tree. I found out I actually defend from a family of real witches who were persecuted for their practices and driven into hiding. It meant a lot to me to have something of a unique history so I wanted to embrace it. I looked up everything I could find online and I wanted to share it with you. However deep down I Thought it was all crap too and when you left I hated myself too for driving you away so I....Tried one of the curses I had read about. I had no idea it was real!\" She said tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what kind of curse is this? How do we reverse it.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing you to her computer she pulled up the website she found the curse on. It looked like a lame fan site for witches to you but you had gotten past ignoring beliefs you thought were crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is. The  curse of dark femininity or succubus curse\" Sarah said reading it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This curse was used on the scorned lovers of witches who would leave them after discovering their true nature. Often a husband or lover would leave their spouse when they discovered their lover was a witch. As punishment the witch would curse their spouse to turn into a dark female reflection of themselves at night. In order to teach them a lesson in never breaking ines heart. Oh.....Ummm...I didn't read this last part....\" Sarah said looking up as you glared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However this curse was quickly abandoned as the female sides grew too powerful to control. Eventually overtaking their host permanently. The only known cure for the curse was a special potion which could only be made under the light of a full moon and then had to be immediately drunk by the female side of the cursed. We strongly encourage all our young witches to NEVER attempt this curse. Cursed females grow stronger by fulfilling their sexual desires and by corrupting young innocent women who are  unable to resist their sexual aura. If a cure cannot be made in time the only escape from this curse....is death...\" Sarah said covering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like a truck had just hit you. You never thought such a thing was even possible let alone could ever happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jake I'm SOOO sorry! The second part was on another page. I just thought it would be funny to have you grow tits at night for awhile. Please let me try to help you!\" Sarah said as you looked up to her in total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you we do? How do we make this potion?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....the recipe isn't on the website. I can do some research in the mean time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done more than enough....\" you said standing up before storming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back in your car you drove off both furious and terrified. Was all that true? It was this more BS she made up? You had no way of knowing for sure. All you did know was you could feel Heidi inside you trying to get out again. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sleeping pills, since you figure that you can knock her out if you take them right before you transform. You know Heidi is watching, but it doesn't matter if she's chained to a bed.

You took the keys and left them at an angle that only you can reach, as Heidi is a little bit shorter than you, and so when you wake up, you can grab it with your foot. You looked at a clock and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's do this.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou popped a sleeping pill and then bound your mouth, since Heidi could scream when she awakens.

Your pale white skin began to tan as your hair grew darker and cascaded down your neck. You shrunk as your body reformed. The whole time you were groaning and trying to ignore the growing pleasure but you couldn't deny it as you let out a loud moan right as your face reformed and Heidi took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi examined herself on the bed.

I'm disappointed....You are gonna need to do better than this.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting and turning Hedi suddenly used her slimmer body and frame to slip her hands out of the handcuffs. Jake had only tightened the cuffs for his size not hers....A mistake he overlooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce free Hedi got herself dressed and ready putting on a tight black blouse with no bra so her nipples were poking through. She slid on a matching black thong then grabbed a sexy jean mini skirt which was so short it barely touched her thighs. She finished off with a pair of three inch heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror Heidi gave a small wink to Jake who was stuck inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Jake I was willing to try and work together with you.

Jake was beginning to realize he may have just made a serious error...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi took off in James car and went over to pick up Becca's place.

Did...did Jake tell you I called?\"she said a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You don't think I was blowing you off? Especially after how amazing you were last night.\" Heidi said with a seductive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca let Heidi in as she seemed a bit nervous covering herself a bit more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Heidi asked.

Like what kind of changes? Let me guess....You noticed you didn't have to shave at all? Perhaps your hair was a bit longer and brighter? Maybe even your boobs seemed a bit bigger Heidi said in a sly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca took a small step back. \"Hhhooww did...did...yyoou know?\" Becca said stuttering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my gift sweetie.....so bring out the best in others. What they really desire....if you want I could give you even more....\" Heidi said moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...could....how?\" Becca said shyly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi moved in closer as she suddenly slid down Becca's robe and took off her towel revealing her short blonde hair. Pushing her onto her bed Hedi slid up between Becca's legs and began to miss her womanhood gently as Becca moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Heidi continued to kiss Becca's most tender spot Becca was unaware her body was actually changing. Her skin was starting to get more tan getting smoother and losing its blemishes. Her bright blonde hair was growing longer past her shoulders. As the changes got more intense Becca did start to notice as she looked down to see her stomach sucking in as her body was getting leaner and skinnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me?\" She moaned. Part of her knew this was wrong but she couldn't stop. The pleasure was ok intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving you the body you have always desires.\" Heidi said as she  continued to kiss her downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca couldn't resist only moan as her whole body was shifting. Her nails grew longer and turned pink. Her butt exoanded and her frame grew a perfect hourglass. Her lips grew more lucious and pouty as her face reformed. Lastly her small modest breasts began to expand. Growing larger and turning perfectly round as they soon blocked the view of her body. When all was said and done Heidi had turned Becca into a sex symbol of near perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ce/7f/8e/ce7f8e0dcbf18c04d196eba2bc97aaf2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca slowly stood up as she stared at herself unable to keep her mouth closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this me? What did you do to me?\" Becca said stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given you the body you always wanted. A perfect sexual object men won't be able to stop looking at. Also most important this body makes you  subservient and obedient to me....is that okay with you?\" Heidi said with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. Whatever you say....\" Becca said almost absent minded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Hedi Jake was screaming. This was exactly like he feared. She had corrupted Becca and turned her into one of her servants. The difference was shocking just how much Heidi was able to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld Becca: <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZVqTGjVYFwU/UOzAHQQkmFI/AAAAAAAABZs/xgiuMQlVPmM/s1600/54.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZVqTGjVYFwU/UO...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Becca: <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a6/12/46/a61246302c53a1d0e9f1bd17bb533feb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do tonight?\" Becca said with a seductive smile.

Heidi was immediately scoping the place out, checking out every available guy, trying to find the perfect male specimen to really get back at Jake for his actions. Naturally, they didn't have to wait long until they were approached by two good looking men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ladies.\" one of the men said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi grinned as you felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello yourself.\" Becca purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to dance?\" the other man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else would we be here?\" Heidi replied as Becca selected her man and the two of them walked out onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, you were screaming for Heidi to stop, but you had even less control, on account of the sleeping pill gambit, which only succeeded in making it so you were struggling to maintain consciousness in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dancing, some touching and a lot of making out, Heidi asked the million dollar question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna get out of here?\" Heidi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca and her man agreed and they all left the club, and Heidi smiled as she heard your anguished cries in the back of her mind.</span></div></div>",

It only took minutes before clothes were being pulled off like they were on fire....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeidi took her man to your bed as she threw him down as he quickly pulled his clothes off. Heidi wasted little time getting naked as she climbed on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready for he ride of your life.\" Heidi said out loud but also in a way she was really talking to Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to call out one last time in vain as Heidi impaled herself on the man. The feeling of him sliding up inside your body caused waves of pleasure you didn't think were possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her mind you were powerless to do anything but moan in pleasure. She wasn't kidding at all. This was almost too intense to handle as you lost all sense of time as Heidi had her way. When the climax finally came your entire body felt like electricity was coursing through you as you gasped being almost paralyzed by pleasure........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime in the middle of the night both men left as Becca fell asleep on your couch. When light finally came through the window you awoke in your body again to a shock as you looked over yourself. You were back again for now as last night seemed almost like a nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you remembered Becca as you came out to find her back in her normal body....You were confused. Hadn't Heidi turned her into a sex bomb like herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca's eyes slowly opened as she awoke to finding herself laying naked on your couch as she freaked out grabbing a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Jake! What the hell is going on why am I here and naked?\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember anything? You....went out with Heidi last night?\" You said not wanting her to know the truth yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did? All I remember is her coming over to my place....I thought I had fallen asleep...\" Becca said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided it was best not to reveal anything for now. Until Sarah comes up with a plan to reverse this you just needed to keep yourself distant from her and everyone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped off Becca again after another really awkward ride. You could tell she knew something was off but she refused to say anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home you began to pack your suitcase. You had to get out of town, anywhere where Heidi couldn't currupt anyone else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going Jake?\" A voice said in your mind as you packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere.....I don't care...I won't let you control my friends anymore....\" you said shaking her thoughts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The damage is already done Jake....She embraced herself just like you did....She will return to that form nightly now and be your seductive servant....If you give in fully I can make her that way permanently....\" Heidi said with an evil laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!\" You shouted. Your stubbornness was still too strong to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't let you leave town Jake....tonight is the charity ball. VIP only. I managed to get two tickets tonight so Becca and I must look our best. How else will we be able to attract rich husbands?\" Heidi said in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never let such a thing happen...\" you said finishing your packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you shouldn't have left those sleeping pills just lying around....did you know if you take them with food they take longer to kick in?\" Heidi said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly began to feel a bit woozy as you rushed over to the table and saw an empty bottle of sleeping pills...Heidi must have taken them with some food right before she changed back! They were only just kicking in now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to fight back as your eyes grew heavy but once again you underestimated Heidi and she played you like a fool.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you collapsed you fell into a deep sleep. When you finally awoke it was to the sound of the doorbell ringing. You got up slowly shaking off the after effects of the pills as you looked outside. Still some daylight but sunset was soon. Maybe there was enough time to get out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your bag as you answered the door to see Becca standing there holding some bags which seemed to have clothes in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm High Becca? I'm sorry I have to go Heidi is out of town tonight so...\" you said trying to rush before Becca suddenly let herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Jake but I need to talk. I think something in wrong with me. I went out today and bought these and Inhave no idea why! They are not even in my size!\" Becca pulled out two beautiful and sexy ball gounds from her back. One white the other black, along with matching four inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also kept having these strange thoughts all day....dirty thoughts....Something is wrong, and I think Heidi is behind it....\" she said feeling a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...Becca Heidi isn't what you think....she is......\" As you talked you were suddenly interrupted by Heidi crying out and falling to all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside you saw the sun was barely setting so you were confused. There was still another hour or so if daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh did I forget to mention that she will change at first sunset? It's kind of an insurance policy in case you decide to do something stupid. Don't worry though once she is done she will most likely want have her way with you. I think you deserve something for being such a trooper.\" Heidi's voice said in a sarcastic laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was in all fours panting as she seemed overcome with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's.....happening to me?\" She cried out as she began to tear and rip at her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't just leave her here....could you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, your phone rang. You quickly picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Sarah. I've got good news and bad news.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, I can make the potion, the bad news, the next full moon isn't for another week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be too powerful by then.

I'll get back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you hung up the phone and sighed. You walked into your room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca was on your bed and you couldn't seem to resist. Maybe it was Heidi, or maybe the magic had given Becca sexual magnetism but... you started to undress and walked over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca.... I...\" you started. She put her finger to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began kissing you and you quickly fell prey to her machinations. You were helpless as she managed to find every erogenous zone and you felt absolute pleasure. She moved over your entire body and at the moment of maximum pleasure, it began and it was swifter and less painful than it had ever been. In a matter of seconds, it wasn't you and Becca in bed, it was Becca and Heidi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mistress.\" Becca smiled. \"Shall we continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, we have a charity ball to go to.\" Heidi glanced in a mirror as she went to get their dresses from the living room.</span></div></div>",

Once they were ready they took off together looking like movie stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So mistress what is our plan?\" Becca said as she added some more makeup to herself in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out Jakes phone Heidi pulled up two pictures of very two very handsome young men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are our goals. Eric and Aaron Samson. Sons of Derek Samson the wealthiest man in the city. They are both single and it has been known for years their farther has threatened to cut off their inheritance if they don't get married soon. We will seduce them and make them fall for us. After the ball they will come seeking us and within days they will be head over heels for us. Once they finally fall for us we will be strong enough to finally take over our bodies permanently.\" Heidi said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god! My other half is so shy and weak and ugly. She disgusts me I hate even sharing a name with her.\" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good point my dear. You are far  more than that girl ever deserves. You are a goddess, and angel compared to her.....that's it! From now on you will be known as Angel.\" Heidi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it! Thank you mistress.\" Angel said with a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one more thing....A personal matter I must see to....Someone naughty seeks to spoil our fun...I need to make sure that doesn't happen...\" Heidi with a dark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce arriving at the ball Heidi and Angel got stares everywhere they went. Since they were unknowns to the group manu people assumed they were simply daughters of wealthy entrepreneurs like most of the people there. The Samson Family was hosting the event with Derek Samson giving a speech at the beginning of the event. His sons were at the head table talking and greeting family guests as Heidi and Summer planned their move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid way through the event both girls made their way over their table where both brothers waste no time in spotting them. To them they were easily the most beautiful women in the room. Both girls have the brothers a seductive smile which was all the invitation they needed. Both brothers soon got up and introduced themselves, the eldest brother Eric made his interest in Heidi clear while Aaron went to Angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long hours and glasses of champagne the two girls had the brothers clearly infatuated with them. They danced several times and even sat and ate together at their table. Their plan was going perfectly. As the night grew closer to an end Bith brothers were getting ready to leave but they wanted to make plans for a double date tomorrow night. Both girls happily agreed and they each shared a deep and passionate kiss with their respective partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing left for Hedi to do....Seeing her target Heidi told Angel to stand gaurd over the bathroom as she followed a girl inside....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the ladies room Heidi saw a pretty redhead in an orange dress adjusting herself in the mirror as Heidi grinned a bit seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known you would be here....Even the black sheep of your family can't be seen not attending a family held ball. Tell me....What did your brothers and father think when you told them of your mothers true family history....Sarah?\" Heidi said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her mind Jake was suddenly stunned. His ex Sarah was the younger sister to the Samson brothers! He never pieced it together since her last name was Forester. That was when you remembered Sarah told you once she took her mothers maiden name years ago and that she had a bad relationship with her family. You suspected it was family drama if the usual type not this....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Wait....You are that chick that was dancing with my brother all night. Listen if you are some gold digger or something don't worry I don't care about my family fortune I won't get in your way...Just don't get your hopes up Eric and Aaron tend to blow through girls like you every month\" Sarah said to Heidi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...that hurts Sarah, you don't recognize me. Jake showed you my picture after all and without you...I wouldn't even exist.\" Heidi said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widened when she realized the truth. \"Heidi.....? Is that you?\" Sarah said backing up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the flesh! I just wanted to stop by and thank you. Without that reckless use of magic you performed I would never have come to be. Jake is just so weak and useless I am everything he has always wanted to be. I just wanted to thank you, and to give you a little gift....Heidi said stepping closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is....there is nothing I want from you....\" Sarah said suddenly panting a bit. Something was wrong....She was starting to feel hot and heavy for some reason....She couldn't seem to move away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but there is...I can see it in you now....Those secret dark dark desires you keep locked away...\" Hedi said as she moved up closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what....are you doing to me?\" Sarah said gasping. Heidi had grown so strong now even she as a witch was vulnerable to her sexual aura now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just giving you the form you truly deserve....\" Heidi said as she leaned in and kissed Sarah deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was unable to resist as she felt Heidi's  tongue being shoved in her mouth. She was powerless to resist as she felt herself kissing back as felt a warmth flow through her body. As they kissed Sarah's ginger hair was beginning to darken and turn a deep fire red color.....The change had already begun....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hair turned color Sarah's nails began to grow when there was a sudden knocking on the door....This interruption broke the kiss as Sarah regained herself for just a moment as she suddenly pushed Heidi away and ran out the bathroom before the change could be completed.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn....no matter....the gift is still given my dear. Within the week it will spread all over.\" Heidi said wiping off her lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the restroom Heidi saw Angel standing there with a line of women waiting to use the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mistress they grew to numerous to hold back.\" Angel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter within the week she will be like you my dear, perfect body and perfectly obedient. Now come let us go home...\" Heidi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls soon left the ball and returned to Jake's. Angel spent the rest of the night pleasuring Heidi as they fell asleep naked together on Jake's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You awoke to find a naked Becca sleeping on you both of you back to your normal bodies. With one major exception, you noticed Becca's normal short hair had grown slightly down past her shoulders. You realized there was no way out of this now. You had to explain to her what was going on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slowly opened as Becca looked down to you as her eyes quickly widened as she  suddenly jumped out of bed and looked to you with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake....why are naked together? Why can't I remember anything about last night?\" She asked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour you sat Becca down and explained things. Starting with the curse and Heidi and how you both the same person. You explained how Heidi had corrupted her and turned her into Angel. You explained how she was trying to seduce the wealthy brothers and spread the curse to Sarah who was their only hope right now of turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Becca asked. You were a bit surprised at well she took it. Maybe part of her knew all along and now she was just forced to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah says she can make the potion by the end of the week.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the rate they are growing I don't know if we will make it a week. I mean I can still something deep inside me that is telling me to jump your bones and obey you.\" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you talked there was a sudden knock on your door. When you opened the door you were a. It taken back at what you saw. A huge mass of red hair attached to a woman standing in your doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f0/3a/78/f03a783b03a545ffc919cf387c9e247b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the hair back it was revealed the floor length mass of hair was attached to none other than Sarah. It was a serious departure from her shoulder length ginger hair from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I know....we have to talk.\" Sarah said as she tried to handle the mess of hair as she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Heidi infected me with her curse last night. I managed to break away before it fully overtook me but now it's affecting me....\" she said pointing to her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up to this and no matter how many times I cut it, it just grows back. I'm afraid at this rate it will spread before I can make the potion. However we have another problem.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have enough ingredients to make enough potion to cure all three of us. If we all want to be free of this curse I am going to need to find a special ingredient.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just buy it online or something?\" Becca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't sell this thing on Amazon...I need powdered Elf Root. It's a special ingredient I need to make more of the potion. The problem is there is only one place in town to buy it and well....I can't go there alone.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only place it is sold is another witch who lives in secret here in the city. She is bartender at a strip club downtown. Last time I was there I kinda....well made a scene. I need you two to come with me as backup tonight so we can talk with her. She will listen if we explain the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we follow you? The second the sun goes down Becca changes. I am not far behind her.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well luckily I have something that helps with that.\"  Sarah pulled out two green pills from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pills have a special magical herb that resists curses in them. Take them the second the first change happeneds to you tonight and it will slow the transformation down by at least an hour.

I'm short enough powdered eld root to make the proper potion in time. Please I know you have a secret stash.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you would know that! That's why you got kicked out of here last time trying to steal from it! Why should I even care? I could just leave you to your fates. I'm sure all three of you will make excellent sex objects and trophy wives.\" Lady Moonfall said with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca soon fell out of her chair as they talked as she let out a loud moan. \"Oh god! It's starting!\" She cried out as her nails and hair were starting to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint you popped your pill as Becca struggled to fight off the change. Luckily the pill seemed to be doing its job as Becca was able to stand again. She was still changing but at a slower rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are luckily child....Had this problem been your own I would have left you deal with it alone.

I am running a business, an underground black magic business but a business none the less! I sold the last of my elf root yesterday. Fortunately for you it was sold to an old friend.

That pervert' you know he is just going to make another  potion with it!\" Sarah stood up furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His carnal desires are not my concern. Also in your present stage you should know a little about where he is coming from. Your concern should be finding him before your little counter curse wears off. You my dear seem to be running out of time too...\" Lady Moonfall said pointing to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked over and saw her changes were still continuing. Her nails had grown lighter and were now painted a deep shade of red. Her toenails were the same. Her lips were also looking a fuller as they seemed to have a deep res lipstick on them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to Sarah you suddenly felt a familiar heat washing over your body as your hair was starting to darken and grow longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little trick is only delaying the inevitable Jake! I'm still coming out!\" You could hear Heidi's voice inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen we are running out of time were is this Jarvis?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I know him there is only one place he would be....The convention center for the pop concert. Jarvis is a pervert, a disgusting cockroach....He finds young women and slips them a special potion derived from a lesser form of the curse we have. It changes the girl into a complete sex bomb and fills them with incredible sexual desire. After that he has his way with them and then abandons them. The potion wears off by morning and the victim looses all memory of the sexual assault they suffered. He is supposed to be in Jail but I'm guessing he got out early....\" Sarah said shaking her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wherever he is we have to hurry there isn't much time for us!\" You said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca nodded as she panted leaning up against a wall.

As she leaned in and kissed Lady Moonfall deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kissed Lady Moonfall began to change. Her body began to grow younger as her wrinkles vanished. Her skin tightened up as her breasts lost their sag and grew larger. Her white hair grew longer as her skin took on a a nice tan. Within minutes she had turned from an elderly woman to a snow haired sex goddess writhing ok the floor in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god it feels Soo good!\" The Moonfall said writhing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear sweet Luna, your age is no longer your enemy, enjoy this gift, now the ring please.....\" Heidi said as she took the ruby ring from Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the ring on Heidi suddenly felt an immense rush in her body as her eyes glew red for a second. As she left the bar Becca was strip dancing for a gaurd while Jimmy was dancing for several men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca come my sweet. Jinny why don't you stay here tonight and please all these men in whatever way they desire.\" Heidi said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say mistress.\" Jinnny said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed like a suitable punishment for Jarvis as the two women left the bar and returned to Jake's house. Their mission a success for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came Jake awoke to find a naked Becca laying next to him back in her normal body. Not surprised anymore he got up slowly as he noticed the good ring on his finger. He tried to pull it off but it seemed stuck by some kind of magic and refused to come off. After getting dressed there was a knock on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door he saw Sarah standing there however something had definitely changed. Her red hair was now a deep fire red color that almost touched the floor in length. Her lips and nails were the same shade of red and she was dressed much sexier than normal. She was wearing tight white tank top with no bra underneath and a black mini skirt with matching heels. Sarah never dressed like this before as you were a bit stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah why do you?\" You were suddenly interrupted as she barged in and pushed you against a wall kissing you deeply as she suddenly pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry....the curse has grown stronger I'm struggling to hold back every second now....My clothes, they change on their own now. Whatever I wear shifts into a more sexy outfit\" She said backing off a bit regaining control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the potion?\" You asked helping her sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started it last night. It is brewing in a secret location. I can't tell you where so Heidi won't find out. It should be ready by the full moon in a couple nights. There is just one last problem.

Like some spell to get them to give you access?\" Becca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not messing around with any other spells after this.\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're screwed huh?\" you asked as you raised your hand to scratch your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Becca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ring!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"If Heidi has that... We're in more trouble than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked. \"She must have gotten it last night. That's right! She got it from Lady Moonfall when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a powerful magic device. Usually it's used to amplify spells of the wearer, but in Heidi's hands, it's the worst magical weapon ever created.\" Sarah said. \"That first plan doesn't seem so bad anymore. My brothers won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Becca asked.</span></div></div>",

They will have to devote themselves fully to their dates tonight.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see a better option as you agreed. Hearing someone behind you turned around to see Becca. Her clothing had changed too. She was wearing a pair of tight short shorts along with a low cut blouse and matching heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....Jake my clothing just changed?\" She asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained the plan tonight to her as Becca seemed less than thrilled. \"I can't hold her back anymore....Angel is so strong now I can barely resist my desires even now. If I give in like this I don't know if I will come back...\" Becca said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was a risk for all of you. Sarah was desperately trying to keep her hands off of herself and you. However you didn't see any other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is just one thing....one last thing we have to do tonight. To make this plan work. I'm not sure how to put this....I need you to fuck me as I transform....\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You said a bit taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brothers would never let me in even like this they can recognize me....However if you have sex with me right before sun down my body wil completely change. They will never recognize me and I can slip in.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I change before sundown too!\" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...which means you need to use Angel to hold me down a you fuck me then you.  will most likely have to have a threesome with the two of us once I'm done changing....\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uhh...are you sure, wait why would I need to have you held down? You said a bit stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because my inner self will try to resist....The more you have sex with me the more I will change. I will try to plead with you to stop even though the pleasure will be overwhelming....I will say anything to prevent myself from changing. You MUST IGNORE this! You are not to stop until I look nothing like myself. Huge mountainous tits, giant bubble butt, long legs that go for days, pearl white skin that is totally smooth, large plump lips, totally hourglass shape. You must continue until I look like a complete sex doll that not even you would recognize. Resist the urge to stop at all costs. No matter what I say.\" Sarah said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we are done I will leave before Heidi comes out. She and Angel will go to my brothers and I will slip in after them posing as one of their friends.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this? Won't the changes be permanent?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...until we take the potion. I am taking a huge risk here but it is worth it to correct my mistake.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a deep sigh you nodded and agreed. \"Okay I agree.\" You said. Part of you liked this idea which you could tell was Heid's dark side inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were spent going over the layout of the penthouse so Sarah could plan her escape. Once she got the pills she would wait for Heidi and Angel to take her brothers to the bedroom and slip out through the emergency exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset was closing in as Sarah took you to the bedroom. Getting on your bed she took out several pairs of fuzzy play handcuffs as she began to strap herself to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You said with a sarcastic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't tell me you never fantasize about stuff like this?\" She said with a laugh as you finished strapping her ankles down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe....but not like this....last chance are you sure?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....don't stop until I am totally different. Remember to ignore everything I say.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you suddenly heard the sound of Becca crying out in pain and pleasure. Within minutes Angel walked into the room naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Angel...why don't you help our friend Sarah get undressed?\" You said trying to think like Heidi for once. Just this one time you had to embrace your inner dark side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel have a devilish grin as she began to tear off Sarah's clothes as Sarah began to look really nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen....uhh....Jake I made a mistake we don't have to do this...I changed my mind. We can find another way in.\" Sarah said sweating nervous as Angel pulled off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sarah it's too late for that....\" You said knowing this was a test as you began to undress.</span></div></div>",

Once they had left Sarah got up and uncuffed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she almost fell over. Not only was her center of balance way off now due to her massive new breasts her feet seemed to have changed shape. They refused to stand flat footed forcing her to walk on the balls of her feet as if she was in high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit....maybe I had them take it too far...\" Sarah said looking to her body. It was more extreme than even she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed she went off following Heidi and Angel to her brothers penthouse. The whole one she was struggling to resist the urge to touch herself. Her body and mind were screaming for sex as she buried those desires as deep as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Heidi and Angel arrived at the penthouse a butler brought them upstairs where Aaron and Eric were  waiting for them. The ring on Heidi's finger was beginning to glow a soft hue of red as they entered and saw their dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah arrived shortly after as the butler a man she had know her whole life didn't recognize her. She explained she was with the other two girls for a party. She was soon granted access as she went up. However she didn't go to the front door. She used the side door using her emergency code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying on the girls her brothers were already head over heels for them. They seemed almost obsessed actually as Sarah feared Heidi's power was already too strong to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to master bedroom she found a painting of the first building her farther built. Moving it a secret dosage was revealed behind it. Using the code stolen from her father she opened it as she saw several magical items in jars inside. Looking through the stash she found a small set of pills as she quickly stashed them between her huge tits and closed the door. Slipping out unnoticed Sarah smiled as she was pleased at how easy that was, almost too easy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Heidi and Aaron already had taken their men to their rooms. Clothes were off in seconds and before long Heidi and Aaron were having incredible sex with Eric and Aaron. As Heidi was about to climax her ring was glowing a deep crimson as she smiled with an evil grin....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came Jake awoke in his own bed. To his surprise Becca wasn't there even though he saw the dress and clothes she had on earlier on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up slowly Jake rubbed his eyes as he noticed was off about his hands. They were smaller, smoother, more than and had long sharp black nails! They were Heid's! Freaking out for a moment Jake saw the rest of his body was still his own but there at the end of his wrists were the same hands Heidi had last night. He feared Becca was experiencing something similar as there was a knock on his door. He hoped that was Sarah with good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door Jake got his first look at Sarah's new body. She was wearing only an incredibly tight sports bra and yoga shorts. She was barefoot but standing on the balls of her feet. She was panting seeing you desperate to contain her desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Sarah! Are you okay?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....problem....gotpills....but....when....got...home....potion.....go ne....stolen!....please....need....sex....body....too....much...need...release!&amp; #34; Sarah said panting in between breaths and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious now that her plan had a serious draw back. This new body was too strong for her too handle. She could barely talk now. You could listen to her and have sex. That would most likely clear her mind enough for awhile to explain how the potion was stolen or who might have taken it. However it also most likely spread the curse in you causing more of you to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could refuse and just bring Sarah along like this and have her be in a constant state of sexual desperation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sex had caused the change to spread up your arms which were now female as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you decided to look for Lady Moonfall and hope to bargain with her. She was the most likely culprit for the theft of the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was Sarah's solution might have helped but it was clearly only a temporary one.  She was already struggling by the time you left. On the car ride downtown she would reach over and grab your manhood or touch her breasts in hope of release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think Becca is? It's not like her to just disappear like this.\" You said looking over to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....don't know....whatever the reason I'm sure it's bad....Remember she has been under Heid's influence the longest....Ohhh.....Ugh....I....want you....so bad.....Curse this stupid body!\" Sarah said moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrived downtown Sarah couldn't barely keep her hands off you. You tried to push her away but that only made things worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Just let me give you head! Anything I swear!\"  Sarah begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah please control yourself!\" You told her. You knew if you gave in again it would only spread the changes farther in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Sarah said tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see much way around it. Nodding as you found a quiet place to park you let Sarah jump over as she unzipped your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was finished Sarah felt better as the two of you left the car. You almost tripped however as you looked down. Your tennis shoes had vanished! Replaced with a pair of sexy black heels and inside them was a familiar set of feminine feet. The changes had already spread to your feet and were now working up your legs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading the bar you were able to slip past the bouncer this time as you found Lady Moonfall was no where to be seen. No one had seen her all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did she go?\" Sarah said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around only to find a note written in her desk. It said \"If you want the potion find me at the club tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn her! She must want to make a deal to try and cure herself too! There isn't enough potion for all of us though. She can't finish it alone without my final spell so she needs us....\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan?\" You said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only one option....We can't let Heidi take control again, but I won't be able to help you after this it will all be on you....\" Sarah said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I have to do?\" You said scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me do you again....This time more and more until you have fully turned into Heidi's body. I can cast one final spell to shield your mind. It will give you full control of your body for the next two days until the full moon tomorrow night. However all my protections will be gone. I will be little more than your sex puppet like Angel. You will have to make me take the pills and find Becca on your own. Then it will be on you to give us all the potion and make the best chcocies for all of us. I'm sorry Jake....I never meant any of this to happen. This will be my final gift to you.\" Sarah said as she suddenly pounced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much word to disagree. You let Sarah do her business on you again and again. Each time your body changed more and more until you had fully changed into Heidi's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly standing up it took awhile to get your self under control. While you were now in control of Heidi's body her desires and feelings were still pounding at your mind. Your clothing had changed into a sexy black dress as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked up to you with an almost blank stare. Her eyes had turned into a bright red color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Sarah, we have to go the club.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my mistress....\" Sarah said as clothes began to change into a red dress to match yours.</span></div></div>",

There was a bookshelf there as she pulled a certain blue book as the shelf revealed a secret trap door underneath her desk. Taking you down she revealed a hidden stockpile of magical potions and ingredients. There tied in a chair was Becca, or Angel as she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Moonfall led to you two magical circles painted on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand there and remove all your clothes....\" she said as she moved to the other circles and began taking off her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting a bit more nervous now as you slowly started to take off your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing....before we begin I have one demand to make.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?

You saw what looks like waves of blue energy leaving your body and flowing into Moonfall's while waves of red energy were leaving her body and pouring into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was agonizing but eventually it ended as you were left panting on the ground. Strangely you felt a bit different as you could no longer feel Heidi in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Moonfall was on her hands and knees as she was grunting and moaning. Her body began to pulse and grow as her silver hair began to darken and shrink....Body hair was sprouting on her as muscle began to grow in her. She was becoming.....a man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a deep laugh as her voice lowered lady Moonfall seemed to revel in her changes as she slowly turned into a man.

Didn't you want to go back to your normal self?\" You asked panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonfall only laughed as he looked to you. \"This IS my true self FOOL! You think I needed your help removing that stupid succubus curse from that amateur? Please I cured myself of that the following night. However I did see a great opportunity. You see I was I was cursed with that female body decades ago from a former lover,  a witch who's power makes your friend look like a joke. The only way I could hope to remove it was to find a willing subject to transfer with so I could take their essence. Luckily your situation was exactly what I needed. I took all the male essence from inside you and gave you all the female essence within me.\" Moonfall said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about our deal?!\" You said panting. Something was wrong with your body....you could feel something inside you was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....I deal is a deal. Magical deals cannot be broken.\" Moonfall said as he walked over to his car it and grabbed to small vials of dark blue liquid. He suddenly opened and poured them on both Sarah and Angel as steam began to rise off their body as they moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah suddenly looked around a bit confused as she seemed to be remembering herself. Becca was doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel something was about to happen to you as you cried out. \"What's going to happen to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My female essence and Heidi's are mixing within you now creating something new. A whole new body for you. I'm honestly sad I can't stay and watch. All I can say is that if you are about to become probably the most sexual woman alive. The closest thing to a sex goddess mortal men can understand.\" Moonfall said as he left you alone with your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rushed over to free Becca as you began to toss and turn trying your best to hold back the change </span></div></div>",

Yawning you slowly awoke as your eyes opened to a new and unfamiliar sight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo huge mounds of flesh were blocking the view of your body....They were even bigger and rounder than Heidi's as you slowly sat up. Looking down at your hands you saw your skin had turned into a perfect bronze. Your fingernails were painted a bright silver color too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of what had happened with Moonfall began to return as you suddenly stood up in a hurry only to almost fall over as you fell back onto the bed. Your new center of balance was way off and to top it off something was wrong with your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see them and your toenails were painted the same silver. However you were unable to bend them flat. Something in your foot was preventing you from standing normally. Your feet seems locked in the upright position as you were forced to stand on the balls of your feet like you were in heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking several minutes to regain your composure and your ability to stand you stumbled over to a mirror to see your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned at the reflection staring back at you. The woman in the mirror was some kind of sexual fantasy coke to life. All the most sexual features of Heidi and Lady Moonfall and mixed together to create something even sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair was now a bright white color that had grown almost as long as your body as the tips almost touched the floor. Your hips and curves were now shaped to that of a perfect hourglass. Your long legs were perfectly defined with your tiny waist and flat stomach. Your huge breasts were perfect globes with no sag and perfect round shapes. Even your face was different with larger more lucious lips and more refined features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoonfall wasn't kidding you truly looked like some kind of sexual goddess....You looked around for Sarah and Becca but didn't see anyone as you decided to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a pair of gym shorts shorts and t shirt from your male self you slipped them on as you stumbled around the house still getting used to your new way of walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever after a few seconds you noticed your clothes were beginning to glow. Your gym shorts suddenly shrank and tightened turning into sexy yoga shorts while hit t shirt shrank and formed around your breasts turning into a custom made sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured this was part of the spell as you heard your front door opening. You heard family voices as you stepped out to see Sarah and Becca coming inside. Their bodies were still changed however both of them sexier than ever. However their voices and attitudes seemed to be normal as they talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned and saw you as she was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca hurry she is awake!\" Sarah called out as the two girls rushed over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down with you Becca and Sarah seemed relieved that you were okay and still yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How king was I out?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days....\" Sarah said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days what about the full moon and the potion? What happened?\" You said confused as to why they were still in their changed bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright it's alright we took care of it. Becca and I made a choice together. After you sacrificed yourself to save us we could just stand by and cure ourselves and leave you like this. What was worse was the change had made you into a completely mindless sex object. We tried taking you home but all you wanted was sex and pleasure. I had to use a sleeping spell just to knock you out. After some research I figured out our potion could still be used to save you if we made a sacrifice of our own. By changing the ingredients a bit we turned the potion into a cure for you. However it was only strong enough to free your mind. We have been waiting to see if it worked for days now. After what Moonfall did we felt it was only right. Our bodies may be changed but now all our minds are free. We are in this all together the three of us, either all of us return to normal or none of us do.\" Sarah said with Becca nodding in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan then? All of us are stuck with these bodies for now. We can't even dress normal it seems.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unfortunately there is only one person who I know can fix this and he vanished last night. Moonfall has disappeared to the magical underground and who knows when he might resurface. So we have two choices and neither one is good.\" Sarah explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they?\" You asked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's kind of a blue pill and red pill choice here girls. Only with vials.\" Sarah said holding up a blue vial and a red vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stole these from my brothers place as a last resort just in case. Here we have to make our final choice. Either we stop now and accept or fates or we dive into a whole new adventure with unknown futures....\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grew even more nervous as you listened. Not sure what it meant for the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we take the blue vial. Our memories will be erased. We will wake up as we are now always believing we are now the way we have always been. You will forget your old life and simply embrace your life as an incredibly sexy woman. This means giving up on a cure but accepting a normal life. Marriage, kids etc.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we take the red pill we take this curse to its maximum and final stage.....We lose our humanity. We transform one last time into a  true succubus. We will be able to remain human during the day but at night our true demon bodies will come out. This will allow us to travel to the magical underground. A world hidden from mortal eyes were no human is allowed. It's there we can search for clues on Moonfall and hopefully find him and force him to remove the curses from us completely.  If we take this we will be accepting one hell of a fate. We would truly be selling our souls until we find a cure. This could lead us down a very dark road if we are not careful. This is your last chance....once a pill is taken there is no going back....\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca looked nervously as she stood up. \"I've been thinking....honestly I'm okay like this. I have a body I've always dreamed of and my mind is my own again. That is good enough for me. I can handle the sexual desires and learn to just embrace myself if it means a normal life. I...want the blue vial. \" Becca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for me I want the red pill....I refuse to let Moonfall get away with this. Even if it just means vengeance I will make sure he pays for what he did to all of us. I will accept whatever fate as long as it leads me to him. I am taking the red vial.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all up to you now. This was your final chance. Either cut your losses and learn to live life and a sexy woman. Or risk it all and give up your humanity to enter a whole new world of danger and darkness....</span></div></div>",

He was little more than a flash of memory. It had been a very long time since Heidi and Becca had seen Sarah, not since the day when Sarah left to find Moonfall, not that Heidi knew about that. Heidi had a family, a son, and a husband. It may not be how things were supposed to be, but for Heidi, this was a happy ending.<br>\r\n<u><i><b><br>\r\nTHE END</b></i></u></span></div></div>",

A set of clamps crush your lower legs in so that they become slender and thin. Then two more clamps crush your arms in so that they also become slender and thin. Then two mechanical hands message your shoulders until they are more rounded. After that, two metal arms with a suction cup installed on both of them attach themselves to your chest. Then the suction cups begin to pull on your pectoral muscles. When the suction cups are done, they reveal a set of voluptuous E cup breasts. Then a syringe is injected into your neck that makes your neck thinner and smoother, as well as giving you a high-pitched female voice (and smoothing out your Adam\u2019s apple). Finally, a metal mask and metal dome cover your face and head. The mask reshapes your face into that of a beautiful woman. At the same time, the dome lengthens out your hair to your mid-back and also makes your hair silky smooth. Once all of the machines are done and are removed, your conversion into a sexy lady is complete. As if on cue, the employee comes back and is absolutely amazed at the results. \u201cMy oh my.

They etch themselves deeper and deeper into your brain, taking root. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You like to munch on grass sometimes. Grass is tasty. It\u2019s a nice snack. Eating grass is fun. It tastes so much better than icky meat. You\u2019d never eat meat. You\u2019re a herbivore, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could move, you\u2019d try to pry the dome off your head. Instead, your mind is filled with thoughts of lovely greens, with grass at the forefront of your mind. You can practically taste it on your lips-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There is no need to think too hard or worry about human life. It will be taken care of. You can just relax. You are a lovely cow girl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lovely, lovely cow girl with no need to think. Your brain feels lighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You love getting milked. It makes you feel all nice inside.

You\u2019re struggling to think of anything but the words echoing inside your head. What else is there to focus on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are a beautiful bovine lady. Your name is Bess, but you like being called Bessie. You just love the idea of having a blue ribbon in your tail and another one around your neck with a big cowbell attached. You love the sound of the cowbell. It makes you feel safe and happy. You are a happy cow girl named Bessie.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the talking ends, and yet it still feels as if the words are continually echoing in your head. In the distance, you can vaguely hear someone saying, \u201cHm, I think that was a bit more animalistic than it was meant to be...oh well, I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t mind.

There's no way two of the others are guys right?\" You felt you sold the lie pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know seems crazy, but then again, they gave you hair extensions, they made me wear only thong underwear, and Katie (The girl in the Pink outfit, you recalled) absolutely hates the color pink, who's to say they didn't do a bit of extra work to put a guy in a skirt, sounds crazy but not after seeing the lengths they go to appease the Managers. Maybe not that crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe, still seems unlikely to me though, I mean do any of us look like guys?\" you say keeping cool\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the craziest I wouldn't have expected any of them, I mean I know I'm a girl, and would've never even thought about any of the others.\" Amanda got up to get back to work. \"Oh one other thing I heard that the managers check out each others secretaries and often add a few other restrictions, so be on the lookout for an Email from HR about a new dress code or something, though I can't imagine what Mr Lane would add to mine. Well spread the word, later girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems you dodged suspicion from Amanda, you wondered how the girls would take it if they found out you wee one of the guys, would they freak out and shun you or accept you anyways, you'd rather not find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmandas cleavage looked real to you, so you doubted she was a guy, Katie, well you hadn't seen enough of her to make a guess yet, and it was the same for the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day came to an end, you gathered your things and headed to your car, passing Leslie, the only one who had a easy dress code, just a simple skirt suit, maybe she was a guy. You saw both Beth, the one with in a skimpy skirt suit, and Zoe, the one who got the worst of it both showed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you realize that only you Katie and Leslie weren't required to show cleavage maybe the other guy was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got in your car and headed home</span></div></div>",

That was going to be a tough one. Also the 1 inch increase in heel height was going to make walking hard. But one thing in particular stuck out. Must show cleavage? He didn't even have boobs, how was he going to do that? He pushed it aside to worry about later. He finished up his work and went home. He took off his work clothes and relaxed, when someone rang the doorbell. It was Jenna, the girl who helped you start this job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna started. \"In regards to your new dress code, I have a delivery for you. I have some skirt suits and dresses in this box, some new bras, as well as your new heels. Also, I have the solution to your cleavage problem. I have some synthetic breast forms for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou protested, \"I'm not putting those on!

She was a very attractive woman and that had an effect on you. You laid down, while Jenna started applying some type of wet glue to your chest. You fell asleep for a nap, and ended up sleeping through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up the next morning, confused what had just happened. You then remembered Jenna. Sitting up and looking around, she was long gone. Then it hit you, your chest was massively pulling you down. You had boobs! You couldn't even differentiate that they were fake. They felt completely real, but touching them had no feeling as they were made of plastic. Looking in the mirror you admired your body. You could really pass for a girl now. Putting that aside, you got dressed for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the normal routine, except used one of the new bras Jenna bought. It was much tighter, and shoved your boobs into your face. Push up bra, of course. It created ample cleavage. You then slipped into the little black dress. It was extremely tight, showing off your hourglass figure. It was low cut, showing ample boobs. The dress was rather short, going only a few inches below your butt. Lastly, you slipped off the 5 inch heels. It was gonna be a challenge, but you left home to go to work. You noticed guys checking you out in the parking lot. You tried to avoid contact and slipped into your office and sat down. Suddenly Mr. Sharp came in. He.....</span></div></div>",

You would spend most of the summer with your sister, who was 21. You loved making fun of her, and playing practical jokes on her. But little did you know, that was all about to change. She called you to her room, she said that she had an early birthday present for you. Your birthday was only a week or two away, so you gleefully accepted. When you went to her room, she wasn't there. There was just her recliner in the middle of the room. You stepped inside, maybe your gift was on the chair. Suddenly, you felt something hit you from behind. It was your sister! You were on the ground, and she managed to put a blindfold over your face. Confused, she managed to get you tied to the recliner. \"Let me go!\" You scream. She didn't say anything. You felt her take your shirt off. You felt a lot of things done to you, and felt her put some kind of clothes on you. They dug into your back and shoulders. She took the blindfold off, and flash! She snapped picture after picture. You had no idea what she was doing. She went to her computer, then came back. She printed one out and showed you. \"What the hell!\" You screamed. \"What are you doing?\". She had managed to put her clothes on you, a red bra and a shirt that didn't even cover your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally spoke \"That's what you get for all the years of your practical jokes and bothering me!\", she smiled as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now untie me so I can take all this crap off\" You told her.

Perhaps you could have some fun with this. If this was no one's desk, then who could stop you anyway. With a smirk, you began taking the paperwork, seeing that many needed signatures or something. You immediately began writing your own name, though it was far from neat. It contrasted heavily with the print of the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" you sighed as you leaned back, taking it in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to look over the paperwork, which went over stuff from recommendations to appointments to many other things. It was all very business-like. Funny enough though, by the time you had signed well over a dozen papers, it was like even your signature was better. Your cursive had never looked so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, neat.

Quickly, you searched for anything that could give you a hand. Thankfully though, you didn't have to look far. A little bit aways from the phone was a list that conveniently had numbers on it, apparently relating to certain divisions within the company. You hummed for a second before finding the human resources division, seeing the numbers to connect to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll connect you over to the human resources department,\" you said, trying to sound professional at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you,\"</i> the voice happily said before you pressed the correct numbers, making the line go silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly as you put the phone down, you felt pretty good. You actually helped someone out, well you hoped you did at least. Maybe this wasn't so bad if you could get the hang of this, not like you intended to stay any longer than when your mom returned though. In any case though, with nothing else to do, you went back to looking through the papers. However, as you did, something...began to feel a little off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" you hummed as you looked at your hands, before proceeding to feel your face a bit. \"Huh...did my skin always feel this smooth? Must be my shower or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was true that your skin was smoother. Though, you didn't notice how sudden it was and it certainly wasn't because of the shower.

Funny...a lot of them actually had the top buttons on their shirts undone a bit, probably for their big chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow...your mind thought about that for a sec, seeing your fully buttoned up shirt. Maybe...you should try to blend in a bit. Perhaps it would make things less awkward or something. With that in mind, you actually casually unbuttoned a few of your buttons, showing just a bit below the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing this?\" you wondered, feeling like you were having a massive headache.</span></div></div>",

You saw a legal pad and a pen on the table and picked it up. Might as well try to fit in. You started to listen and began to take notes.

Still, you at least felt a little better now than when you arrived, having felt like someone really needed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, thanks for that,\" smiled the woman who needed your help. You could see her name as well, being Belinda Simmons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you smiled a bit, appreciating the sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it seemed like everyone separated, heading back to their own desks. You made a turn and found yourself back at the desk you were at before. It was funny how you already felt like you had a good idea where this desk was despite not knowing this building all that well. Oh well, at least it helped you keep track of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down again, you got settled, thinking about what's been happening. It's been so strange. No one found your presence all that strange, not even questioning why some teenage boy was here. Not only that, you looked back at your hair, seeing that it was the same color as usual, but unusually long. Pulling on a strand, it looked like your hair could cover your ears easily, probably going chin-length at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and your smooth skin. It certainly felt strange. Heck, as you put your hands down after inspecting your hair, you looked back at them. Your fingers even seemed a bit longer, and did the nails seem a bit longer too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...either I've really neglected cutting or something's up,\" you pondered to yourself, even as you got back to doing a few more papers. It appeared as if a few more had arrived since you left.</span></div></div>",

I am so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" you muttered as you attempted to dry your soaking wet pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything to change into?\" Belinda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind drifted to the skirt in the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I am so sorry.

You looked at your pants and made sure no one was watching and you pulled your pants off, folding them and putting them in the drawer and replacing them with the skirt, which came down to a little above your knees. You looked at your legs, which you thought were hairier, but actually looked rather clean and smooth, and sat back down at the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked through the papers and continued working and drummed your fingers on the desk as you worked, noticing that your nails had gotten long enough so that you were tapping them against the desk instead of your fingertips.

It really gave you an empty feeling with your legs, like you were exposed. Granted, the material felt kind of nice, and it did match your blazer.

It always smelled weird to you, so you never went near it. Still, it wouldn't be nice to not drink it by this point. So, you took a sip, immediately feeling the bitterness of it. However, you took another sip....and it actually began to taste better, and it did so with every sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the point where it actually got pretty good, surprising you all the same.

It actually made you kind of nervous. Just what could that man want. Did he need you specifically because you were at this desk? But it wasn't even yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even work here,\" you mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" Belinda asked, not having heard what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" you sighed in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm sure Jeff won't really have anything bad to tell you,\" Belinda smiled. \"Heck, he kind of likes you and your work anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had zero idea what that was supposed to mean, even as you slowly felt a little queasiness in your stomach. However, it wasn't any sickness, but rather your stomach beginning to flatten out a bit, becoming nice and smooth. Your waist was also diving inwards, beginning to form the basis of an hourglass figure, further adjusting your insides. As an addition, your back was even starting to arch a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, all of these aches you just passed off as being nervous as you got up from your seat. You just hoped this Jeff guy wouldn't be too mad at you for sitting at someone else's desk. Belinda's talk about him appreciating you sounded really strange, to the point where you could only believe it if you saw it. With another sigh, and watching Belinda leave as she had to head back to her own desk, you slowly opened Jeff's door.</span></div></div>",

How was that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does all of this make sense somehow?\" you muttered to yourself, looking over every little thing like you knew it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as you were sitting down, your feet seemed to tap something underneath. Curious, you pulled out a bit to look under the desk. Right underneath seemed to be a pair of black high heels, extremely similar to what the other women were wearing all around this place. Honestly you weren't sure why you were looking at them so closely. They...did fit the rest of your clothes to be honest. Your sneakers really stood out against everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I suppose they're worth just a little try,\" you decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you untied your shoes, pulling them off and then sliding your socks off. Just like that, after putting them aside, you pulled the heels closer, slowly putting in one foot and then the other, your arching harshly inside the frames. You actually grunted a bit as you felt your feet adjust inside, arching and even snapping just a bit to create feet that had been in heels for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....guess these aren't so bad...\" you smiled a bit, although still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you got back to fulfilling more of the list Jeff gave you. Honestly, it seemed like you were flying through a lot of it, like it was just coming to you naturally. It was like you were a pro, looking up and recording whatever was needed. It actually gave you a sense of pride to be honest. As you were working, a strand of hair began to fly into your face again. However, you barely paid it any mind as you just casually used one hand to tuck it away. Against your notice, your hair was growing much longer than it was before, flowing in straight strands down your head and past your shoulders. Just like that, you had long and rather beautiful brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....Jeff said he needed copies ASAP,\" you said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you looked up the Henderson account reports as he specifically wanted.

In addition to that though, the new weight on your chest was definitely noticeable. Your new breasts, which were C-cup at minimum, definitely pushed your shirt out, a tiny bit visible beneath some of your buttons. Honestly, you felt like you should be more freaked out about it, yet all you could think was that it was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, that wasn't all. Another part of the desk happened to catch your attention. Opening it slowly, it revealed a black bra and panty set, perfectly normal for any woman. Like the other clothes, you wondered why stuff like that was even here. Still, you guessed you couldn't ignore them, so you took them out, casually putting them in a purse nearby. Yeah, you didn't even notice how the purse seemed to come out of nowhere too, since it transformed from the small wallet you used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well...\" you sighed. Hopefully you could get your mind off things soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Jeff returned, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you ready Alex?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" you smiled as you got up, grabbing the purse like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to walk with Jeff, you slowly began to feel your hip bones cracking a bit, making you wince slightly. Slowly, with each step, your hips began to push themselves out, shown off completely in the black skirt you had. Your walk was altering slightly, becoming more like woman's. By the time you and Jeff even reached the elevator, your hips had become nice and wide, swaying with every step against your notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating out a problem?\" Jeff asked nicely as you got to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no problem at all,\" you smiled. \"Anywhere is nice.\"</span></div></div>",

He got in and started driving. You looked around the interior and your eyes settled on the purse sitting in your hands in your lap. You noticed that your nails, while they hadn't grown any longer, now appeared to be sporting an elegant french manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Alex.\" Jeff started. \"You've really been doing a great job. I want you to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, sir. That means a lot coming from you.\" you blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't imagine that all the work you had done this morning was all that impressive, but hearing Jeff say it, made it sound pretty important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the restaurant and Jeff parked the car, walking you inside. It was a pretty upscale establishment, a place one might take a date or a business client if they were trying to impress them. Jeff walked up to the ma\u00eetre d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Table for two, under Hoffman.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right this way sir.\" the ma\u00eetre d said, leading you and Jeff to a table.

You were honestly quite impressed by it, enjoying the atmosphere of the place. Frankly, the fact that Jeff has asked you...made you blush quite a bit honestly. It made you feel really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a waitress came by, introducing herself and asking you both if you wanted to start with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not the best time for a drink,\" Jeff chuckled a bit. \"Um...I'll just get a Diet Coke please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" you replied back, with the waitress writing them both down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you felt like an appetizer, given that it was only lunch, so you both stopped at that. Jeff chuckled again at the fact that lunch probably wasn't the best time for wine or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this was dinner, I probably would have done that,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....same here,\" you laughed a bit, trying to fit in a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment though, your chest tingled a bit, almost like it was trying to tell you something. Your breasts were full and perky right now, though they felt kind of rough against the shirt you were wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to use the bathroom quickly,\" you said as you got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jeff replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you left to go quickly use the bathroom, though you didn't need a toilet or anything. You didn't even notice that you walked straight into the women's room, as if it didn't matter. It was deserted inside, which made it perfect for this. Looking at yourself in the mirror, you could see yourself. Your face was still the same, but you had long hair pulled in a bun. Were those earrings as well? It looked like there were as you felt them in your ears a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, you pulled the blazer off before unbuttoning the shirt, showing off your perky breasts. Oddly, you didn't panic at them, just casually pulling the bra out of the purse you brought. One after the other, you pressed your breasts to each cup before sliding each strap over your shoulders, feeling them pull your breasts up. Eventually, you were able to tie them in the back, perfectly settling them before putting the shirt and blazer back on. There, your breasts felt perfectly snug, poking out slightly from inside the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I guess this is okay,\" you smiled as you took your leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to the table, just as drinks were coming. You had already settled on something before leaving, getting a chicken salad while Jeff got something rather light as well. All in all, things were moving quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this place is pretty fancy,\" you smiled a bit. \"Not the kind of place for casual time usually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" Jeff said before sighing a bit. \"There is a bit more to say, other than how much your work has been excellent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What was this about?</span></div></div>",

Still, he kept it professional, but his smile couldn't be denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic,\" Jeff smiled. \"I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, both of your meals came, much to your delight. Honestly, it felt like things were getting better. Jeff was happy...and you were feeling happy too. So much that you didn't even feel your butt beginning to expand, slowly cushioning you a bit as you ate. Before too long, your butt was big enough to compliment your large hips, forming a perfect heart shape underneath the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what other details are there?\" you asked as you ate. \"Like...where are we moving and all that?\"</span></div></div>",

They even said that we'd both get raises when we transfer.\" Jeff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your meals and the check arrived.

He's such a gentleman. She returned and you gathered your things and left the restaurant, returning to Jeff's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back you opened up your purse and started inspecting the makeup. You dabbed some blush on your face, absentmindedly applying it expertly. You followed that by doing the same with mascara and lipstick. You checked your face in the compact mirror and smiled. The car ride continued and you and Jeff continued to talk about the transfer. You were so involved didn't notice that your face was reshaping itself, as your nose became smaller and cuter and your lips plumped a little bit.

Jeff was such an interesting man and a true gentleman. You...really couldn't help but like him a lot. You had never felt so attached to someone before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, Jeff had to leave to go take care of something, so you waved good bye for now as you casually walked back to the desk. This felt great. Since coming here, you felt a lot better. Actually moving to a new place sounded daunting, but something in you just loved the idea. It was like being able to start something new or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you returned to your desk, feeling like you knew it like the back of your hand now. Looking at the mirror once again, you actually smiled. The face of a beautiful and mature woman looked back at you, with perfectly applied make up and everything. With the addition of your hips and butt from earlier, you very much looked the part of a woman now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Alex,\" Belinda smiled as she came over to you. \"I just heard everything.

Surprisingly, things had gone very smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were an expert at your job, like you could do it better than anyone else. It had given you a large sense of pride, making you feel passionate towards this work. Once work had ended, it had been quite an adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously you didn't live with your mom anymore. You had an apartment all to yourself, full of naturally woman clothes and everything else that was needed. You had taken to it all pretty well. Even after someone happened to call you \"Alexandra\", it felt pretty natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, it did feel like blanks were getting filled in, as if you had been at this job for years. That stuff was still kind of confusing, but you just rolled with it. You had an answer for everything after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Jeff,\" you smiled as you had entered his office upon your arrival, bringing coffee for the both of you. \"I brought you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah perfect,\" Jeff smiled, accepting the drink. \"I can always count on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly sir,\" you smiled, taking a seat yourself as Jeff let you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like you had especially bonded with Jeff over the month. Granted, you bonded with everyone, like Belinda and Melissa, despite your upcoming transfer. Still, Jeff seemed to really stand out, but you liked that about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't believe this is the last day,\" you said.</span></div></div>",

Days merged into weeks and then a couple of months since the move to LA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you and Jeff had come a good ways in your jobs as well. While your positions hadn't changed, the higher-ups had certainly noticed your dedication and work ethic, as well as Jeff's own. They were quite proud of both of you. It made you wonder if a promotion could be in the future. If so, perhaps the pay increase could result in you both being able to buy a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded so heavenly, not that apartment wasn't nice though. In any case, after yet another day of work, you and Jeff had gone out to a fancy restaurant. You had been waiting a while to wear the dress you were wearing, a nice green one that showed off your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably the most we've spent since coming here,\" you smiled as you had a sip of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Jeff said, though he seemed like his mind was occupied with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had noticed that since the beginning of the night out, making you wonder what was going on.

I mean, you liked the occasional anime and all that, but that was quite a step beyond that. You had never even been to such a place, just sending in one of many online applications.

Still, this was how things were I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it, you think it's strange,\" you sighed as your mom drove you in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not,\" she smiled sincerely. \"Any place is good job experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered if she really believed that, but you shrugged all the same and let it go for now. The place wasn't too far away so it wasn't a long drive. Of course, as one might expect, the entrance seemed kind of inconspicuous. Yeah, you could already see the mix of English and Japanese words on the front of it. You just felt an odd sense of curiosity and dread right now. If anyone else knew about this, you'd get heckled for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to come in with you?\" your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can handle it,\" you said. You were 14 after all. You could handle yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I'll come back at around 4:00 then,\" your mom smiled as she gave you a little kiss before you jumped out of the car, your stuff in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your mom left, leaving you in front of the weird place. Well, Dad always talked about having to lay in your bed as you made it, so you guessed you had no choice. Surely, as a guy, you wouldn't have to do anything too bad. With a deep breath, you slowly opened the door. The inside of the store was....pretty cutesy as one would expect. If they ever liked Japanese anime and all that, chances are they'd feel a little bit at home. For you, it was a mix of that and just finding it a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a bit quiet right now, making you wonder who was even around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you called out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard the clacking of footsteps coming. Right around the corner came who you assumed to be one of the employees, or maids given the atmosphere. Fittingly, she looked Japanese, and had the full uniform on. She didn't look a whole lot older than you though, possibly in high school like your older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello?\" you said, trying to be nice. \"I'm...Chris Hoffman. I submitted an application recently and....I was told to start today....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, you really didn't know what to say to the girl. Bet she didn't expect a boy to come in and say that.</span></div></div>",

Once she was done and had calmed down, you could get a better look. Like many of the others, she had dark hair, though hers was in a ponytail. She hardly looked over than you as well, which kind of fit the place anyway. She was cute though, probably the kind of girl you wouldn't mind dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" she said with a small bow. \"I was a in a bit of a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you smiled, deciding to give a little bow back out of respect. \"I'm Chris by the way. The...uh..new guy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl beamed a bit. \"Oh, I had heard a boy had applied here. It's nice to meet you. I'm Aiko. Aiko Sugihara, at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a little curtsey just for fun, which got a little laugh out of you both. Okay, this girl was pretty nice. Maybe you could be friends. Though, right then, your stomach rumbled. Aiko smiled a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think we can have our lunch break now,\" she said. \"I was just about to have mine anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" you said, agreeing with her as you put the broom in a good spot.</span></div></div>",

My family and I have lived here for a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, neat.\" you smiled, continuing to eat. \"Guess that explains why you talk so well.....Ah, no offense!\" you immediately said as you felt like you messed up a bit there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. I get that sometimes,\" Aiko nodded. \"Though...I think you might be the first boy I've actually seen work at the cafe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's easy to see why,\" you said. \"I mean, I'm not exactly one for dresses.\" you added with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you got a little laugh out of that, easing the mood a bit. Although...oddly enough, as you were eating, your hand glanced over your arm a bit, and something....felt a little bit off. With a hum, you looked at your arm, feeling like it was...kind of smooth? Granted, going through puberty, you certainly weren't the hairiest boy around, but it felt like your hand went over your arm a lot smoother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe it's just the work or something,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Aiko quizzily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nothing,\" you waved it off.

Chris, that table needs their order!\" Ruki shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused you, since you didn't serve. You felt a weight in your arms and you were suddenly holding several trays.

Even your armpits seemed like they had less hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just overthinking it,\" you said, just focusing on washing yourself, though the slightly bushier hair wasn't helping much. It wasn't that long, barely enough to cover your ears, but it was longer than you ever had it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you went back after getting dressed up, having breakfast as you always did. You were pretty much scheduled to work every weekday, and yesterday was Monday. Boy, you hoped you could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking a little tired there, maid,\" smirked Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" you snapped back. Seriously, if only Damon could have an experience like this. That would show him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, things went normally from there. Granted, your siblings were like opposites. While Damon kind of got on your case about it, Erin was kind of happy. She thought it was cute.

Even the kitchen staff was mostly made up of girls of Japanese descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got to work helping arrange the trays with the various food items and drinks that the cafe served and left them for the maids to deliver to the patrons.

It was definitely busier than it was yesterday, so you were kept busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it seemed like a lot more people were becoming impressed with how quickly you were picking things up comparatively speaking. That honestly made you happy, giving you a sense of pride. The place was quickly becoming one you could be comfortable with, though you were still adjusting and all. In any case, during one instance, you were handing one tray off to another girl with twin ponytails, though she nearly tripped. Thankfully, you were there to help her stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigat\u014dgozaimashita!\" she smiled gratefully after breathing a sigh of relief. Judging by her nametag, you could see her name was Sayaka. \"Watashi wa chotto bukiy\u014dda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure what she said, but something in your head told you that she was thanking you and telling that she's a little clumsy. Oh well, there was no problem with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mondainai\" you just replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response just sent Sayaka giggling as she left to take the order out, while you were left confused. All you meant to say was that it was no problem, but it came out in Japanese? Did you pick up on something from being around the girls all that much? You spoke a few words to yourself just to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing..strange here,\" you spoke normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh...well, it wasn't a bad thing at least. Being at a Japanese cafe, you were probably bound to pick up on a word or two. Most of the girls were pretty fluent in both languages, so it wasn't that big a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thanks for helping with Sayaka,\" Aiko smiled as she was apparently next to get a tray from you. \"She actually hasn't been here that long either. She lived in Japan until very recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, so she's kind of new as well? You could sympathize with the thought of being new. Well, she seemed pretty nice at least. Anyway, you nodded at Aiko's words, continuing to do work with the trays. Granted, you didn't get that good a look, but that small feeling from your hands continued on, almost like a very dainty feeling. Heck, your arms as a whole seemed to be feeling a little soft and dainty. Your nails were actually getting a little more longer as well, though you didn't pay attention to that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in any case, time flew by, as it was once again time to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow!\" Aiko giggled as she waved you good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved as well as you left, heading back to your mom's car.

Your mother looked at you concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, are you okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naze watashi wa okiru koto ga dekinai nodesu ka?\" you replied, before covering your mouth. \"Naze watashi wa eigo o hanasemasen ka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew they'd get him into that dress eventually.\" Damon laughed. \"My brother the maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damare!\" you shouted back, almost in tears, but he kept laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finally able to stand up and you ran out of the room, as fast as you could in the heels that you were wearing, but turned when Erin started screaming. You looked back and Damon had transformed into one of the giant monsters from the anime you watched.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't quite as easy getting back to sleep this time, meaning you were groggy as heck when you woke up. It was a minor miracle you could even get up on time for your shift today. Yawning, you just went through the motions, showering before anything else. It only brought back that weird sensation as you were washing your skin. It felt smooth everywhere, with nary a trace of hair. Granted, that wasn't all bad. It was kind of a hassle to begin with. Still strange though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever...\" you groaned as you eventually got out and dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you got ready to go, After you were dressed up, you went down to have breakfast as usual. Everyone was there of course, but you were in no mood to talk to Damon right now. Seriously, just looking at him brought back the sensation of a Japanese monster, just like the anime you had been watching. Seriously, what was that show even called? Guess you didn't look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much talking, as you weren't in the mood. Still, you brightened up as you got into your mom's car and she drove you down as usual. At least you could look forward to seeing Aiko and the others. They had been so good to you so far, accepting you and even praising your work. It honestly made you look forward to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look happy,\" your mom smiled. \"These girls good friends already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't know, but they're certainly nice,\" you smiled. \"I'm glad that they like me being there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful,\" your mom was happy to hear. \"I hope it gets better for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she dropped you off, and you walked inside as usual. It seemed that it was never too busy at the times you arrived, which was nice since it gave you time to get adjusted. As you walked in and grabbed your apron as usual, Aiko walked by, her smile still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa\" you spoke back almost immediately. Aiko's eyes widened a bit, though yours did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was perfect,\" Aiko smiled, clapping her hands a bit. \"Still need to work on the accent a bit, but the enunciation was perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...thank you,\" you smiled. Eh, who cares what happened. You were just glad that you got something down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment though, a strand of hair fell into your face again. This had been becoming more common of late. Groaning, you tucked it away again, laying one hand on your head. It felt...longer now. Getting a nearby reflection, it looked like your hair had grown enough to cover your ears now, nearing chin-length. The strands even seemed straighter, and even darker. Your hair was light brown to begin with, but now it seemed like a darker brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Aiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...my hair's been kind of annoying of late,\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's perfect timing then,\" you both turned to see Ruki approaching, a smile on her face and her hands behind her back. \"You've done a great job so far, so I'm here to hand you something new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she giggled as she pulled out something from behind her back. It was a white headdress, just like the other girls had. Honestly, you were kind of curious as to why, but then again, it was the uniform here. You were a boy, but perhaps you did have to abide by some rules, like with the apron. Aiko was happy to help though, since you had no idea how to work it. Eventually, she got it comfortably on your head, even keeping your hair in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Like it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you weren't sure, but at least it fit. You looked bizarre with it to be honest, but how could you say that to Aiko? She was so helpful with it, and Ruki seemed proud too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect,\" you smiled, getting equal smiles from the girls.</span></div></div>",

They definitely seemed to be the sort of people who enjoyed this kind of thing, judging by the smiles they gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you deal with all this?\" you said with an exasperated smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you get used to it,\" Aiko smiled, grabbing a tray for herself and handing one to you. \"I'd had a bit of practice anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you continued to help with whatever was needed. When things slowed for a bit, you helped with cleaning the lobby, sweeping the floors and rubbing down any tables that needed it. You liked to think that you were getting pretty good at it by now. Whenever things got a little busy, you put that down and helped to bring food out. You pretty much left all the conversing to Aiko and the girls of course. Not like you were ever going to get involved in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, as time went on, you began to wonder something. As a boy going through puberty, you were at 5'6\" or so, just a little above average. However, the more time you spent around Aiko, the more it felt like you two were even or something. Aiko was definitely around 5'2\" or around there, so it was kind of confusing to see her eyes just about even with your own. In fact, there was just a feeling in you that you were a bit smaller. Even your clothes just seemed a bit baggier. Not nearly enough for anyone to notice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, lunch break came around. However, as you were able to go to the take-out place as usual, Aiko stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...I wanted to formally welcome you here,\" she smiled, pulling you back to where the maids actually had a break room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decently-spaced, filled with anime looking stuff as one person might expect from this kind of place. There was even a TV where you could watch stuff, which seemed to have some good channels. Still though, you were kind of confused as to what Aiko was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, nothing bad,\" Aiko raised her hands up to relay that point. \"It's just that...I usually bring a lunch most of the time, and I actually wanted to share some with you. I made enough for two and I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, a girl that could be that thoughtful for you. You couldn't help but blush at her generosity. Besides, it was true that you never had Japanese food before, and it would be worth not spending money on take-out lunch every day. With that, you nodded and agreed to her request, making her giggle with delight. She ran over to a locker where she kept her stuff, soon pulling out some bento boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, this one is yours,\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you smiled back, taking a seat next to her in the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the box had all the typical stuff you would expect of a Japanese lunch, with even chopsticks to go with them. Yeah...this was going to take getting used to. Good news was that you had a great teacher to help you.</span></div></div>",

You just spent it doing whatever you could to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, that's how things went for the next couple of days. Your duties didn't change at all, so you just kept doing the same thing, not that you minded. You hadn't had any major dreams either so things were rather peaceful for a while. Aiko was by far your best support, though you had begun to develop friendships with Ruki, Sayaka, and some of the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, by the time Friday came, they almost felt like a 2nd family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****Friday****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Friday had come, which was also payday according to Aiko. You were quite curious to get a check for the first time in your life. You weren't entirely sure how much the job paid to be honest, but that hadn't been a major concern when you were looking for a first job. In any case, you got to work, as typical as possible. You went and got your apron and headpiece as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa\" you smiled at Aiko, who was just coming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa,\" she smiled back. \"You sound great now. I couldn't do it any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's flattering,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, work started up as usual. The lobby was about as busy as it had gotten when you got the headpiece, so you kind of knew what to expect. A certain sense of routine had been growing with you here. You always greeted the girls as you saw them, and they all giggled when you said hi in Japanese, getting gentle replies in return. Even Ruki liked your progress there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder when she'll have more work for me,\" you smirked as you had lunch with Aiko again. Boy, you weren't sure if she made this or her parents, whoever it was was a great cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably next week,\" Aiko giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that mention, Ruki came right around to the break room, confusing you for a second before she offered envelopes to both you and Aiko. She said a quick congrats before returning to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, payday at last,\" Aiko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course,\" you smiled, opening it to get your check. \"Oh, that's pretty good for a place like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You ever thought about my offer?\" Aiko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit,\" you smiled back. \"It would be fun if we could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugureta!\" she exclaimed. However, right afterwards, she got a little shy. \"Say...if it's alright...would you like to come over to my house after work today? My parents are going out so....I could show you around. We could talk about all sorts of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost spat your drink out at that. A girl offering to take you to her house? Boy, that was quite the advancement. Your friendship must have been even better than you thought it was.</span></div></div>",

She naturally was completely on board with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork ended and you hung around a bit while Aiko finished her work.  While you did, you inspected your nails, which were definitely longer than they had been that morning. Eventually the two of you left for her house, coming to a house that looked fairly normal. Your noticing of that must have been a little bit unsubtler than you thought because Aiko giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think I lived in one of those traditional houses, did you? In the middle of L.A? You've been watching too much anime.\" she laughed and you laughed along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went inside and the house was pretty normal looking, though there was a lot of Japanese decor.

In fact, most of my family still lives there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nice,\" you said. \"You visit them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Aiko smiled again. \"We try to visit at least once a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiko then began to go into some little details about her family, though it wasn't much. They were fairly ordinary for a Japanese family, nothing too strange or anything. Still, just knowing that much meant a lot to you. You had never had a relationship this strong with a girl before. It felt really nice. It was like she truly trusted you. In a way, it was almost like you had known her longer than a week. No idea why though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you? What's your family like?\" Aiko smiled, dangling her legs over her bed. She actually patted the spot next to her, prompting her to sit with her. You hesitated for a sec, but then took her up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing special. My mom and dad work in the same business office. Supposedly, they came from Chicago originally,\" you said. \"I have a big brother named Damon. He's not a bad guy, but he gets on my case a lot. And then there's my little sister Erin. She's pretty nice and likes cute things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might get along with her,\" Aiko giggled before looking back at you. \"Your brother likes to pick on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and definitely since I got this job,\" you snickered. \"In fact, a few nights ago, I had this strange dream where he turned into a big Japanese monster like I saw on an anime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiko just flat out laughed at that, more than you ever heard her before. However, it was such a soothing laugh, like an angel. Sheesh, you being dramatic? Who would have thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can somehow imagine that,\" Aiko got up from her spot and did a monstrous pose. \"Like this? Roar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked so silly, and you just laughed which got her laughing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much!\" you laughed. \"And I was like the struggling damsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds funny!\" Aiko giggled again, swaying on her feet again. However, her tone went down a bit after she looked outside and saw the sunset. \"Say Chris...would you like to stay over tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped at that. Woah! A sleepover? Where did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean tonight?\" you asked. Aiko nodded a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" she nodded, blushing and smiling a bit. \"Sorry if it's sudden...but my parents are actually celebrating their anniversary tonight, so they're spending the night out. I..don't really have anyone else to talk to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...you honestly didn't want to turn her down. You asked for a minute to call your mom, explaining the situation. To your surprise, she seemed to have no problems with the arrangement. She said she'd bring stuff over for you once you told her when Aiko lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm staying for the night!\" you said to Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiko immediately jumped for joy, crying out words in Japanese before giving you a big hug.

A new pair of pajamas. It was a button shirt with pants, both colored a powder blue and made of something that looked to be a softer material than your old ones. You looked at your mom quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to give you those when you got home. I know about the problems you've been having with your old ones.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you...\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mother always knows.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Have fun tonight.\" she said, before hugging you and kissing you on the head. She didn't seem at all concerned about your longer hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother left and you went back to Aiko's room. While you were gone, she had changed out of her clothes and into her pajamas, a nightgown with a floral design. You went into the bathroom and did the same, changing into your new pajamas. They were nice, though they looked almost like they were cut for a girl. You shrugged it off, since they were a gift from your mom, and you went back to Aiko's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Now the sleepover can begin!\" Aiko exclaimed, grabbing your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at your hand and dragged you to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your nails look terrible.\" she said. \"So ragged... I've got just the thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to her vanity and picked up a nail file. She sat back down and started filing your nails. You started to pull your hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Aiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know...\" you motioned towards the nail file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, I'm just buffing out the rough edges. It'll make them look normal, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did trust her and let her continue. In the end, she was right. Your nails, while still longer than usual, looked much better once she had filed and shaped them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh wow...thank you,\" you smiled as you looked at your nails. Boy, they actually looked nice, especially with your smaller hands. \"They actually do look better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Aiko giggled before going back to her vanity. She seemed to pick up an extra file. \"Here, I have an extra. Now you can do it yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bit but accepted the little gift. No reason for you to turn her gift down. You stowed it away in the duffel bag along with most of the other things and looked back at Aiko. You know, Aiko always had her hair in a ponytail at work, so this was your first time seeing her with her hair down. Wow, she had long pretty hair. Made her look even cuter than she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she had a few leftovers that you guys could use for dinner, which actually was some leftover pizza. Again, you must have been as unsubtle as a jackhammer because she immediately dissected your reaction as expecting something Japanese. She called you a silly goose for that, even giving you a light slap to your shoulder, and you put your hands up in mock surrender, getting a laugh out of both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame me. Everything else in there looked traditional enough,\" you laughed as you ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. I pretty much got the same thing when I had a sleepover with a friend a long time ago,\" she smiled. \"Still, in any case, this has been rather fun. I like get-togethers like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" you smiled. \"I'm kind of introverted a little bit, so I've never had too much of this. Still, I like this a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Aiko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you didn't do anything too special. You both got into the family room to watch a little anime. It was fun actually getting to watch anime with someone else who shared your interests for once. Funny enough though, it felt as if you could pick out certain words in the character's dialogue and remember what it meant, almost like it was instinctual. You didn't think much of it though. Being with Aiko and the others had taught you a great deal about Japanese so there was nothing weird there. Still, you did notice that, sitting next to Aiko, you did look to be a similar size to her height-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, it's probably nothing. It's been a long day after all. Anyway, as you both watched, you just had some casual talk over certain things, especially stuff you were watching and all. In fact, it was that same anime that had the maids and monsters from before. You really wished you could get the name of it. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...time to head to bed,\" Aiko stretched a bit as she got off the sofa. \"We can sleep on the floor in my room. It's actually pretty comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted what she said, going back up to her room with her. You brushed your teeth and did everything you typically did, though you were a bit nicer for her sake. After making sure everything was good, you got back into her room to see her arranging a futon. That made sense honestly, as it was something big enough for two at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be fun,\" you smiled as you sat next to her on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" she smiled as she went and turned the lights off before returning. \"Really Chris, thanks a bunch for spending the night. It's been so much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur.\" you agreed, laying down on your pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yawn, Aiko settled in. \"Oyasumi,\" she said as she wished you good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied in kind, settling in next to her. You could see a bit of her face through the leaked in moonlight. Boy, she was pretty. Sure, most Japanese girls were pretty, but Aiko was really pretty. Okay mister, it was probably enough of that for now. You turned a bit and fell asleep, wondering what could be next.</span></div></div>",

You looked around seeing booths and displays from a bunch of anime that you had heard of/seen. You turned to see Aiko, who was dressed in a cosplay that you recognized as being from Madoka Magica. You think she was Homura, though you didn't consider it long as you saw a flash and someone took a picture of you. You looked down at yourself and saw that you were wearing a costume as well. It was that costume that Aiko had pulled out of her closet earlier, a Sailor Moon cosplay, complete with the tied hair hanging from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nantekotta i?\" <sup>(What the hell?)</sup> you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so great, Chris!\" Aiko said as she posed for a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou involuntarily found yourself posing as well.

While you were always a little groggy in the morning, the peaceful sensation you had last night did help a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning....\" you began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you turned to your right, Aiko wasn't there anymore. You raised in eyebrow in confusion. Was she already up? Your question was quickly answered when Aiko suddenly walked back into the room, wearing typical clothing for an average day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohay\u014dgozaimasu,\"<sup>(Good morning)</sup> Aiko smiled as she walked in. \"You looked so comfy that I didn't want to wake you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, well that explained a lot. It was kind of nice of her to let you sleep in a bit. You often had somebody waking you up at home, be it either your siblings or parents. Speaking of which....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you,\" you smiled as you got up. \"Your parents come home yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they'll be back later. There are some things they want to do,\" Aiko said. \"But that's fine with me. I like having some time to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do it,\" you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I got a little breakfast done. Come on,\" she waved you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both went down into the kitchen, where Aiko apparently knew how to make waffles. Boy, they looked delicious. Waffles were always a big favorite for you when it came to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a bunch,\" you smiled. \"You're a pretty good cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Aiko blushed but smiled brightly. \"I often have to make something for myself, especially when my parents are busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both made some small talk before finishing up the meal. Once you were done, you asked if it was alright for you to take a shower here. Aiko didn't mind at all. In fact, she insisted you use her shower, rather than using her parent's one. You weren't sure about using her stuff, but she said she was okay with it. So, with her blessing, you went in to her bathroom and stripped down. It was a pretty cute bathroom all things considered. Her shampoo and soap both smelled really nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got good taste,\" you smiled before going in and showering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was probably the most peaceful shower you ever had. No one was going to bug you, and the scents were super relaxing. Perhaps you could ask your mom to get you something like this, though the others would probably laugh. The soap had a nice flower scent while the shampoo for your hair smelled like strawberries. Really nice combo there. Aiko actually had a few selections around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she likes to try a variety,\" you smiled as you eventually turned the shower off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a towel, you began to dry yourself off before going over to the duffel bag you brought into the bathroom with you. Once you were dry enough, you opened the zipper to look inside. Though...it wasn't entirely what you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you said to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Then again maybe they shrunk in the wash or something. And the shirt, well, that was weird. It was a striped tank top, which you also owned, but the neckline seemed a little low. That could also have happened in the wash, so you shrugged it off.

You weren't aware of any plans your family had today. It was likely just a normal day overall. What did you have to lose anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll come,\" you smiled, getting a bigger one from Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" she smiled and clapped a bit before looking at the clock. \"It's already 11:00. I think now would be a good time. The mall is not too far on foot from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement before you both went to grab what things you needed. The tighter jean shorts certainly stood out as you walked. It felt like they even showed a little more leg than usual. Still, it didn't feel too bad, not even the lower neckline on the tank top. Granted, a tank top wasn't what you normally wore outside of your house, but you didn't see the problem right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after grabbing your wallet and anything else you needed, you met Aiko downstairs. Immediately, you both left the house, beginning the walk towards the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wall there often?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough to know the way,\" Aiko smiled. \"Sometimes I go there to actually buy something, but other times it's just to get away. There's plenty there to do and just hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed...though I've never spent much time there myself,\" you shrugged. \"Usually I'm only there because mom dragged me there for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you have me,\" giggled Aiko, getting a friendly shove from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the mall was rather pleasant. The weather was honestly perfect, not too hot or cold. It was just the time for a walk. It wasn't something you did often, but it was good to get some exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the large mall came into view. You and Aiko walked across the last street to make your way over, before going into the large complex at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so what would you like to do?\" you asked curiously.</span></div></div>",

You could only wonder what she would pick out for you. Not that you've ever experienced a girl wanting to pick something out for you, other than your mom of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, while you had the time to yourself, you felt your newly tied hair a bit. It had gone down to your chin a while ago, but now it seemed even longer, to your shoulders at least. Any curls you might have had seemed to be gone as well, leaving your hair straighter. The shade of color was the same dark drown as before, but you couldn't help but wonder if there were black strands in there somewhere. Well, hair changing color as you got older was something your dad said happened sometimes. Perhaps that was just what you were going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least Aiko actually kind of liked your hair as it was. Maybe you'd keep it if you felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris!\" Aiko suddenly cried out, waving you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her dress neatly, you began to walk over to where Aiko was. She was standing near some accessories. Obviously it wasn't super expansive ones, but they were simple and quite girlish. What she seemed to be holding though was a sort of bracelet that, much like her dress, had a bit of a cherry blossom motif to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it cute?\" she smiled. \"I couldn't believe my eyes as well when I saw it. My dress and your bracelet could match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, it was kind of cute, though you weren't sure if you should get it. Still, you at least allowed her to try the bracelet on you. She slipped it on to your left wrist, letting it glimmer against the light a bit. Wow, it was kind of cute, and it fit you perfectly honestly. The cherry blossom theme really made it stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I like it,\" you smiled. \"Let's get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Arigat\u014dgozaimashita!\" <sup>(Thank you!)</sup> she smiled gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you bought your purchases, with you donning the little bracelet once it was paid for. Honestly, it really did look nice on you, though it was probably because of how thin and delicate your arms looked by now, kind of like Aiko's to be honest. Still, it was a gift from her basically, so you'd always treasure it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Granted, buying shoes was never really your forte. Your mom usually picked your shoes out, so you were kind of doing something you didn't do often. Still, surely you could figure out something as simple as shoe buying. Aiko was casually looking over some shoes herself, but she didn't seem serious about getting anything, given that she already bought a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you just kept on looking, seeing what was good. Honestly, a lot of this seemed a bit girly, but you didn't have much of a choice with how small your feet were now. Still, it could be worse, and maybe you'd find something cute at least. Eventually though, your eyes landed on something. A pair of shoes that looked professional enough, although they did seem kind of different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.shoesforcrews.com/sfc3/images/products/ca_en/3614/zoom_threequarter.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.shoesforcrews.com/sfc3/image...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked rather neutral, though the little heel in the back indicated something a little more feminine. Still, you wanted to give them a try, so you grabbed a pair after finding the right size. To your delight, they were a perfect fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nice,\" Aiko smiled. \"You going to wear those to work now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'd imagine so,\" you nodded, slipping them off and putting them back in the box. \"Though...I probably shouldn't wear these now. They're not that casual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, you remembered how ratty your sneakers at home were. Perhaps you should get something casual as well if the price was right. Getting back up, you started some more searching, even looking at different kinds of shoes. Eventually, you happened to wander into the sandals aisle, eyeing a white pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, those look cute,\" smiled Aiko. \"Why don't you give those a go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it couldn't hurt at least. You grabbed a pair, sitting down to slip them on. It was a weird sensation, as you never wore something like this. Your little toes could be clearly seen, with even somewhat longer nails from what you could see. A stray thought of you needing to file those sometime crept into your head before you shoved it away. You took a few practice steps, actually finding them comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...they feel pretty nice,\" you smiled. \"I think I found some casual shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool choice,\" nodded Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prices for the professional shoes and the sandals were well within your paycheck, so you footed the bill for both of them, giving both you and Aiko some big bags to hold from your trip so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, shopping is hard work,\" you laughed a bit. \"You want to grab some lunch? Probably past noon by now.\"</span></div></div>",

As you stood up again, you realized just how you looked right now, especially with how slim you looked. The tank top and shorts certainly didn't hide much, and the sandals really stood out against your feet and long legs. Seriously, even your legs felt a bit different, a bit slimmer, but still smooth as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you eventually came back to reality. \"Where to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you want to check the arcade out?\" Aiko smiled. \"I figure that's enough shopping for one day.

I love Mario, Zelda, and all the classics and whatnot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that settled that, and you were certainly in the mood for a game or two. Granted, you were never that good at arcade games, but they were still fun none the less. No way would you turn that down, so you both grabbed your stuff and ran over to where the arcade was, which wasn't all that far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got enough?\" Aiko asked as she was getting some coins for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, plenty,\" you nodded, getting a dollar out for some coins.</span></div></div>",

All the rail shooters, skee ball machines, sports games, classic games, even the simulations, and most of them had a few people waiting on each machine. Even the claw machine had a line. Oddly enough, the only one not occupied, was a Dance Dance Revolution machine. You looked to Aiko, who was already rushing towards the DDR machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love DDR!\" she exclaimed. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never really played it. I was never good with hitting the step pad at the right time.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna give it a try while we wait for one of the other games to open up?\" Aiko asked as she stepped onto the Player 1 pad and put some coins in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you sighed and you stepped onto the Player 2 pad, placing your bags next to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game started up and Aiko, being player 1, got to pick the song, picking a Japanese song that you had heard on the speakers at work. The music started and you started to try to follow the movements. At first you were shaky, but you got the hang of it pretty quickly, almost as if your seemingly smaller feet and leaner legs were making it easier for you to perform the moves. Aiko looked over at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you weren't very good?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" you replied as you continued a streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the song ended and you looked at the scores. Not only had you beaten Aiko's score, but you had got a new high score on the board. It wasn't #1, but it was in the top 10, which was still awesome. You entered your name and you hopped off the game to give other people a chance to play, though many were impressed by your skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That was great!\" Aiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I didn't even realize I could do that!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play something else?\" Aiko asked.</span></div></div>",

As proud as you were of your little achievement, it was quite exhausting too. Still, you were amazed none the less. Your legs felt a lot more flexible than they did before. Perhaps all that running around in the cafe was doing you some good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, something that just opened caught your eye. It was Mario Kart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some Mario Kart?\" you smiled. \"I'm pretty good at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" smirked Aiko a bit before she ran over with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you got into the freed-up car seats, getting your coins inside. Aiko went straight for Daisy, while you went with Rosalina, as she was a favorite of yours. For the cup selected, the simple Toad Cup was good for a warm-up race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" smiled Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the race soon began. Granted, controls were kind of wacky compared to the console games, so it took a bit of adjusting. Still, you were having a lot of fun with it, making all the turns and using what items you could. However, Aiko seemed to have a better hang of it, possibly because she was here more often than you were, which made it no surprise when she won the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I win!\" she smiled, celebrating a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, warm-up's over,\" you said. \"This time I'll win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it,\" Aiko smirked back, before you both went in for another race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choose a slightly harder one this time, but you still were doing better than before. Aiko was still more experienced though, and she just knew when to make a move, getting ahead of you again to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're just too good,\" you conceded but smiled all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get better at it. We can come here again sometime.\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look forward to it,\" you laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that 2nd race, you both enjoyed a little Skee Ball as well as some other games. You were having the time of your life here, and you doubted your siblings would have been like this. Damon would probably spend too much time making fun of you and Erin honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy...that was fun,\" you stretched a bit as you grabbed your bags. \"I'm beat from that Laser Tag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing it was on teams though,\" Aiko smiled. \"You and I dominated that game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we did,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you began to leave the arcade, more than a little satisfied with how things went.</span></div></div>",

Come on, there's gotta be something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon just shrugged. He almost seemed indifferent. Honestly, it was more similar to how he acted around either adults or people outside the family. It was usually just his siblings that he messed with on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, just that it's an interesting choice on you,\" he said before looking at your wrist. \"That Japanese girl you talk about get you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....yeah she did,\" you said as you glanced at your wrist. \"She said she liked it on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've always been kind of dainty to begin with,\" he smirked. \"So it fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, there it was.

You went to your drawers and found that there were three pairs of identical pajamas in different colors, a dark red, an off-white, and purple, which was an odd choice. I guess a mother does always know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed into the red pair and got into bed. You decided to take the bracelet off so it wouldn't get caught in the blanket and placed it nicely on your end-table. You closed your eyes and settled in to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Suddenly, you found yourself at the mall, with Erin. She was perusing a display while you stood off to a side. You turned around and came face to face with a pretty Japanese girl, wearing a similar Cherry blossom dress to the one that Aiko bought. You lifted up your hand to say hello and noticed that the girl's hand went up as well, wearing a familiar bracelet around her wrist. <b>It was you!</b> You stepped back and took in the sight. It was you, you could tell now, with there being telling features in the face, which was decidedly Japanese. Your hair was long and black, but styled in a ponytail. You could even swear you were wearing makeup. Your hands were dainty and manicured, but the interesting thing was that both your fingernails and toenails were polished with a light pink color. Your toenails were peeking out from a pair of open-toed heels. But the strange thing, you weren't alarmed by it like usual. You just giggled and turned back to Erin, who had found a dress and held it up to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore wa subarash\u012b ne\" <sup>(It looks great!)</sup> you replied, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?

Perhaps the nice dream you had had something to do with that. It was kind of strange....yet it gave you a warm feeling as well. It reminded you a lot of your shopping trip with Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case though, you slowly got up around the middle of the morning, not too bad for your standards. As you got up and stretched, you wondered a bit about Aiko. She seemed a bit stressed after her dad called her. Frankly, you felt like you had something to do with it, making you feel a bit guilty, the last thing you wanted was to get her in any sort of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, as you showered, you decided not to call her, unless she called you personally or something. It probably wasn't a good idea to suddenly intrude if there was some family business. You'd let her control if she wanted to talk or not. Having settled on that though, you kind of missed her soap and shampoo though. The regular ones you had didn't seem to have the same feeling. Heck, your skin kind of felt weird with them. Perhaps your mom could help with that sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, following your shower, you went and grabbed some clothes. Honestly, having looked at a lot of them, many seemed a bit smaller...and kind of more form-fitting as well. Granted, with puberty happening, you did have a lot of shirts getting too small for you. Perhaps your mom was staying ahead of the game. Honestly, you wondered just how much money she spent on you. Then again, it likely hardly ever dented her paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you put on a casual tank top and shorts, similar to yesterday though different colors. Once you were done, you walked downstairs, grabbing a little breakfast from your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's Damon?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went out to skateboard with some friends,\" your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course. Damon wasn't one to just sit and do nothing during a weekend. He had a circle of friends that he liked to be with. Good for you at least. You had some peace and quiet. After breakfast, you went into the family room, where Erin was just casually playing with some stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can watch whatever,\" Erin smiled. \"Nothing much is on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you up on that,\" you smiled as you sat down and began to find something to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep...pretty ordinary Sunday...so far at least.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, she noticed you watching and you quickly turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.\" you said. \"I was just... admiring your skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Erin said, turning back to her work. \"Do you want to try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, shocked, \"I... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can teach you if you want.\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment. Damon was out, for the whole day probably, and your parents had gone out to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Why not?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let me take a look at your nails.\" Erin took your hand into her's. \"Oh hey, your nails are very nice, do you file them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiko did that, but I did my toes.\" you said, showing your toes to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" she said. \"Anyway, let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started painting her nails to demonstrate it to you. You decided to start with your toes and Erin helped you put cotton balls in between your toes and you started painting them, using a light pink polish. You messed up a bit at first, but quickly got the hang of it, like the chopsticks and the stuff at work. Eventually, you had ten nicely painted toes, with a clear coat at Erin's insistence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very pretty.\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they are.\" you said, marveling at your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to do your fingernails too?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" you said as you waited for your toes to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can keep this, just in case you change your mind.\" she said, handing you the bottle of nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to vegging out while you resumed watching T.V.</span></div></div>",

Honestly, once your toes had dried, you actually kind of liked the look. Heck, it pretty much looked straight out of your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, things did seem a little weird, what with how different you were feeling and all the dreams and such. Still...you couldn't say you felt bad about them. There was a certain warmth to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, a little bit later, you actually did return to Erin, asking about your fingernails. Granted, given what you saw with your toes, you kind of had an idea about them, so she mostly just supervised. It did take a try or two, but by the time it was done, your nails were nicely painted with the same coat as your toes. Erin was really impressed at how good you seemed to have gotten and so quickly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you seemed to be picking up on things faster too. Aiko and Erin had shown you a lot and you seemed to be getting the hang of this stuff. It felt kind of nice to be good at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your new friends are Japanese right? At the cafe?\" Erin asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" you said. \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They teach you any Japanese?\" Erin asked further. \"That would be really neat if you could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, is this really the time?\" you rolled your head, but Erin wasn't having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! Show me!\" she cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, one thing about Erin. If she ever got an exciting thought, she would never let go of it, not until she was satisfied. You groaned at this fact, and just talked back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miru? Watashi wa nihongo ga hanasemasu,\" <sup>(See? I can speak Japanese)</sup> you finally spoke, your eyes widening a bit at what you said. You actually weren't trying to say anything like that. Erin just covered her mouth in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....so...,cool!\" she giggled. \"My big brother can speak Japanese!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess I know a bit,\" you scratched your head a bit, only reminded of your shoulder-length hair at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Erin seemed to be satisfied, leaving you alone after that. Actually, that little moment with your hair made you realize something. Perhaps you could use a ponytail, just like how Aiko stylized it yesterday. You got to keep the hair tie after all. Taking a quick break, you got the tie from your room, somehow being able to put it in a low ponytail just like how Aiko did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh....maybe sometime I can get it to a higher ponytail like she does,\" you smiled as you returned to the TV.</span></div></div>",

You immediately brought the phone to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N\u0113, Chris!\" <sup>(Hey, Chris!)</sup> she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiko, hey!\" you replied. \"D\u014d shita no?\"<sup>(What's going on?)</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment, shocked at your usage of the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's been practicing.

You know, perhaps sometime you should go online and test to see how much Japanese you knew. Might as well see some subtitles episodes to test yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the rest of the day came and went. Damon eventually returned home, though surprisingly he didn't mention your nails. Granted, you didn't mention them to him so perhaps he didn't see them. It was honestly time to remove them for the day anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was fairly natural, though you didn't have much to say for once. Tomorrow would be about returning to work. You kind of looked forward to it, getting to see Aiko and the other girls again. You felt like you accomplished much with them during the past week so you could only wonder what might happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Chris,\" Erin smiled as she began to head to your room. \"Seriously though, really cool what you showed today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you smiled back at her before she left, allowing you to head into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready for bed was rather typical, though, as you looked around your room, you kind of began to wonder if it looked a little plain. Aiko's room looked vibrant compared to what you had. Maybe you could liven it up some time. Actually, as you were looking, you saw your work clothes. You had the new shoes, but you wondered about the rest. Hopefully you could work with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....that's for another day,\" you sighed as you stretched a bit and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...you surprisingly didn't have any weird dreams. However, around midnight, you did happen to wake up, feeling a little parched. You made your way towards the bathroom, turning the light on so you could get a cup of water. However, as you did so, a slight turn of your head blew some hair into your face. It was at that moment that you saw that your hair had grown again. It was well past your shoulders now, doing down your back in straight strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of those strands, they appeared to be pure black now, like the night sky. It was actually kind of pretty, kind of like the girls at the cafe. You weren't sure what to think, but you gave it a little comb over with your hands to feel it out before feeling like sleep was coming back. Perhaps you could worry about that later, once you were actually wide awake.</span></div></div>",

It also seemed a bit smaller, but you were past that. You put on the shirt, and a new pair of pants, which seemed tighter and the legs seemed shorter, stopping a little bit before your ankles. You'd have to talk to mom about getting new pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also brushed out your hair, which was definitely black. But it wasn't alarming, since your father's hair was black, so maybe genetics just took a while to assert themselves. You pulled it into a ponytail, and pulled it a bit higher than usual, like Aiko's. You looked into the mirror and saw something that was alarming, a huge zit on your forehead. How had you not noticed it when you were in the shower? You tried to use your hair to cover it, but no dice, it was noticeable. But you couldn't worry about it, you were going to be late if you stood around trying to get rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on socks, and your new shoes and headed out for work.

You were kind of social, a little bit introverted maybe, but actually waiting on customers like this was quite a step up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you always had some help if things seemed a bit out of control, Ruki, Aiko, Sayaka, and the other girls were more than happy to help out if you looked a little bit overwhelmed. Frankly, you were surprised by how helpful they were. You didn't see this kind of thing at other fast-food places and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...everyone's really helpful,\" you smiled at Aiko as you were getting back from a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of like a family away from home,\" Aiko smiled. \"So yeah, you're part of that family too now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and blushed a bit at that, feeling a sense of pride. That give you some motivation to keep on going. Can't exactly let these girls down now could you? On another note though, you did take note of how your clothes felt as you were working. The slimmer shirt was one thing, but the shorter pants definitely felt kind of off. At least the shoes you paid for were actually doing their part, though you kind of blushed at how they had a little clacking to them, not totally different from the girls high heels. Well, at least it perhaps helped you to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need to get better pants,\" you sighed as you had lunch with Aiko. She was nice enough to bring you one again. You really needed to learn to make this yourself. \"They just feel strange like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, that's why I like the dress,\" Aiko said as she ate. \"It's pretty easy to move in and the skirt is just the right length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...I think that sort of thing is a bit out of my league.\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but who knows,\" Aiko said before giggling. \"By the way, I like your hair. It really goes well with the hairpiece. Just like us.\" she said which made you smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the day was going on, you couldn't help but feel a small feeling in your hips. You had grimaced a bit as the day went on, as if they had slowly pushed out or something. Looking down when you had a second, there definitely seemed to be a small curve to them, which didn't help with your small pants. Maybe you had put on some weight? That didn't sound good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a lot of things to figure out,\" you said as you continued to push through.</span></div></div>",

During the car ride, your mom pulled a bag out from the back of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you some new pants and some other things.\" your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said, deciding to wait until you were in your room to check out what she got you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got home and went into your room, pulling out the few items in the bag. The first was a pair of very thin black pants, almost like tights or something, though it had the design of belt loops a button, a fly and all that. You tried them on. They were definitely much more comfortable than the pants you were wearing and your... curves fit a lot better in them. In fact, they didn't look all that off with your shirt tucked into them. The next item was a bag, a red leather satchel. You wondered at first why your mom would get you a bag, and then realized that those new pants lacked an important feature, pockets. The bag made sense. The last item... well it just confused you. It was a black skirt, that came down to about the same length that the dresses that Aiko and the other girls wore at the cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's for Erin?\" you wondered, but a check of the size showed that it's too big for Erin, but just the right size for you. \"Why would mom get me a skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at it for a moment, before curiosity got the better of you, remembering what Aiko had said at work. You slipped off the pants and pulled on the skirt, posing in it a few times in front of a mirror. With your smooth legs, the skirt actually looked pretty good. You started walking around your room, pretending to wait tables, to see what it's like for Aiko and the others, and you concluded that the sensation of the skirt was pretty weird, but you supposed you could get used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed it in your drawer along with your new pants and you transferred the contents of your pockets to the new bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also took some time to examine your chest, which was irritated, no doubt from your old soap, and the new soap alleviated it, but your skin was still sort of raised in the area. It didn't look that bad, so it wasn't anything to trouble your mom about, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished up and decided to spend the rest of your time before the evening, relaxing.</span></div></div>",

Though, for the most part, you kind of just stayed back and let your parents talk things over with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Erin asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" you said. \"Just a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you couldn't help this little strange feeling. Like....for some reason....being in your work place felt a little bit more comfortable than you did now. You didn't get why, as this was your family and all, but all those Japanese girls oddly felt...comforting to you. Kind of like what Aiko said, it was like a family away from home...which kind of made you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, maybe you were just being paranoid. You spent most of your weekdays there now so a sense of familiarity with them was kind of expected. Still...it did kind of make you want to get to know Aiko and the other girls a little better. You actually kind of missed the constant Japanese babbling that killed the kitchen whenever you were at work. Heck, you almost felt inclined to blurt out something in Japanese right now, but you held it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more weird, Damon hadn't been all that teasing. He smirked a little bit at times, but he never seemed to insult you much anymore. You kind of wondered why. Your mom liked to believe he was finally maturing, though that seemed kind of sudden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, eventually you excused yourself and went upstairs, playing a few games and watching a show or two on your computer before deciding to hit the hay. Though, as you were putting your pajama shirt on, something else did stand out. Your chest was raw for sure, but further down it looked like you had gotten a little bit thinner. Your waist just dipped in a tiny bit, and your stomach felt just a bit flatter. It honestly confused you, feeling bigger in one place and smaller in another. You weren't sure if it was your diet or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I don't feel sick or anything,\" you shook your head as you just put your shirt and pants on, brushing your teeth as usual before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing though, taking care of your long hair was certainly a bit of a chore, though you didn't feel like disliking it. There was something kind of pretty with the shade of black, kind of like the other girls. Heck, Sayaka actually came around and called your hair pretty, while Ruki really liked how it was like most of the other girls. Guess it was a hassle you could live with. Perhaps a haircut could wait.</span></div></div>",

Not caked on, but still more than just concealer, you could distinctly see some mascara and lipstick on your face. You were... pretty. And you felt content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to your room opened and Aiko, and several of the girls from work walked into your room, carrying bags. It's a sleepover, like you had had with Aiko, but with all your new friends.

You weren't sure why but you liked them all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you began to get dressed after showering. As you got dressed, you took a minute to think about the new pants and the skirt. Honestly, given that the skirt was kind of weird for right now, the smaller pants seemed like the better option. So you went with that, grabbing your shoes as well. Breakfast came and went as natural, and you were soon in your mom's car headed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do the clothes feel?\" your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good,\" you smiled. \"Though...I'm not sure about the skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's there if you feel like it helps.

It was kind of strange having the satchal as well, but perhaps you could get used to the lack of pockets. I mean, Aiko and the other girls didn't have pockets to deal with either, so it wasn't like it was something new. In any case, you made it to work safely, grabbing your headpiece and apron as usual before you tied your hair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs pretty much usual, Aiko showed up with a hello not too soon after. However, she didn't seem sure about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" you asked as you flattened your apron a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just.....I actually have something I want to ask you,\" Aiko said, actually sounded really serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, what is it?\" you asked curiously. \"You need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Aiko said, sighing a bit as if this was a hard thing to ask.</span></div></div>",

Granted, you still couldn't help but worry about things.

Oh boy, this was going to be something. Damon actually told a story once of meeting the dad of his first girlfriend. He said it wasn't too pretty, but not as horrible as it could have been. Still, the very memory you had of Aiko's reaction back at the mall kind of scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this,\" you said as you were walking along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay.

You weren't entirely sure. They were...still family right? At least you certainly thought of them as much. If anything, it almost felt like you thought of your family and Aiko's family equally right now. Well..perhaps it was something to think about later. You were enjoying your time here for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Aiko told me that you lived in Japan when she was a kid?\" you asked curiously, hoping that it wasn't deep in personal territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news was that it seemed to be perfectly fine judging by Aiko's mom's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, until she was 7, we lived in Tokyo,\" she said. \"I remember those first few years being quite the adjustment. See, my husband and I already knew a fair amount of English before coming here since our jobs required it, but Aiko never really had that before coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to mention that part?\" Aiko sighed, her face beat red. \"But...yeah, going to school here was quite the adjustment for someone who had to learn the language on the fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to have worked out for the best,\" her dad said, actually having a hint of a smile on his face. \"You caught on quickly enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently \"quickly\" in his definition means a couple years,\" Aiko pouted before turning to you. \"Imagine speaking broken English in the best case scenario in 3rd and 4th Grade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can imagine it I suppose,\" you chuckled a bit, getting a little smack from Aiko in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension at the table had lessened. It had become a bit more casual, which was nice. Aiko talked some things over with her parents, just personal things that didn't need to be mentioned on by you. While she was talking with her mom though, you actually turned to her dad, apologizing if you caused any trouble when you went to the mall with her. Surprisingly, her dad kind of waved it off, saying that it was in the past and no harm was done. He actually kind of admitted that he's a little overprotective, though he didn't regret that side of him. That helped you feel a bit more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the food was just about gone, Aiko had a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mama, could Chris perhaps come with us this weekend?\" she asked with a smile. \"I think it'd be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think that's a marvelous idea,\" she said. \"The company would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked with a raised eyebrow. \"What are you talking about? What's this weekend?\"</span></div></div>",

You had a bit more freedom it seemed to look around, so long as Aiko was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well,\" You smiled. \"They took to me pretty quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a bit surprised myself,\" Aiko smiled back. \"But it's all well and good now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded back, just enjoying the time you had here. Honestly, the more you saw of the house, the more it felt like it was being etched into your memory, like something you would never want to forget. You kind of wondered why, but it didn't matter. Still, the extra room Aiko told you about kind of drew you in a way. It...looked so plain. It was like you wanted to make it look better or something, so it looked nice with the rest of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Aiko cocked her head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" you shook your head, before scratching your chest a bit. \"Although...my chest has been itching a bit lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Can I take a look?\" Aiko asked. \"Perhaps it's something I could help with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of showing your chest to a girl made you blush a bit, but then again, you'd have to be fine with it if you were going to spend a whole day with her this weekend. Slowly, you nodded and allowed her to take her into her room again, closing the door. You took off the nice shirt you had, letting you and Aiko have a little look. Honestly, from what you could tell, even the tiny hairs you had a few days ago were gone, leaving nothing but smooth skin. In any case though, you definitely had two red rashes along your pecs. Your nipples seemed a bit enlarged as well, considerably larger than they were before, and darker as well. The flesh had raised a bit, forming a small bump in both places. Aiko tapped her chin a bit before running inside her cabinet and closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she returned with some cream of some kind and....a bra?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cream helped with the rashes when my breasts began growing. Perhaps it can deal with your rashes as well,\" she said as she began putting it softly on your chest, which got a bit of a cold feeling to it. \"And this should hopefully keep your shirt from irritating it further. It's my training bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure, but she seemed to have an idea so you let her do what she wanted. Once she had the cream on and got the training bra on you, you were surprised that you actually did feel considerably better. Your shirt couldn't rub against it through the training bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Aiko. You're a lifesaver,\" you smiled at her, putting your shirt back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I am,\" Aiko giggled, getting a little laugh out of you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your mom picked you up, and you said your good byes to the Sugihara family for now. Your mom was pretty happy that you had become friends with them all, much to your pleasure as well. After a time, you got home, though it was already pretty late. You did a little relaxing in your room, though you still couldn't help that feeling from before in Aiko's house, like something that this room didn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that's for another time you decided. It was time to hit they hey. You grabbed your pajamas and went to bed, feeling pretty happy about your day.</span></div></div>",

It felt like your desire just grew everyday, so much that nothing could really get you down about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough, whether it was the dreams or not, you had spent more time with Erin of late. Sometimes you played a game or two, and sometimes you did each other's nails. You had gotten quite proficient at that by now, much to Erin's surprise. Honestly, you really felt like taking her shopping some time, kind of like in one of your dreams. Damon was still his usual self, though you didn't talk to him much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, things had stayed the same for the most part. However, yesterday marked something major. As time had gone on, it felt like your hips had just pushed out wider than ever, forming distinctive curves in your legs. It had gotten to the point where even the new pants had begun to feel a bit odd, so you decided to take the leap. You used the black skirt your mom got you, going to work with that. Boy, did it feel strange, but everyone at the cafe loved it. You remembered Sayaka absolutely gushing over how cute it looked on you, and the customers seemed to like it too. Well, you couldn't complain I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, that was why you were wearing a casual skirt right now, along with a tight tank top that was showing off a bit of midriff. You had gotten this recently with how hot it had been of late, and it showed off how slim you were now. Your back had this nice little arch to it, and your stomach was nice and flat. You kind of liked how smooth and trim you looked. You were skinny, but not overly so, like you were perfectly healthy. Guess all that exercise at work helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your bag with the swimsuit,\" your mom said. \"Hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you smiled as you exited the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, you hadn't been calling her mom lately, which was really strange. I mean...you still thought of her as a mom...but at the same time she wasn't. It was confusing, but one thing you knew for sure was that you loved her like a mom. That would always be true. Anyway, you met Aiko right outside, as she was putting her stuff into her family's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa!\" <sup>(Hello!)</sup> you smiled as you approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa!\" <sup>(Hello!)</sup> Aiko smiled as she turned around and hugged you. \"Son'nani tanosh\u012b jikan o sugosu junbi ga dekimashita!\" <sup>(You ready to have so much fun!)</sup><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zettai ni! Sore wa totemo tanosh\u012bkoto ni narudeshou!\" <sup>(Absolutely! It's going to be so much fun!)</sup> you smiled as you laughed a bit. \"What do you think of that? Much improved huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I feel like I could take you to Japan and you'd fit right in,\" Aiko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked the sound of that. At that time, Mr. and Mrs. Sugihara move arrived, welcoming you as well. You barely felt any sort of resistance from her dad now. It felt a lot more natural now. With that, you got into the car with them.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't the first time you had been to any water park, but your first time at this particular one was turning into something truly wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that's enough slides for a while,\" you smiled while putting your hands on your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Aiko agreed before turning around. \"Why not try the wave area for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't tried that in a long time. Let's do it.\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMama and Ot\u014dusan took a little bit of a break after all those rides, wishing you both fun in the wave area. Keeping your tubes with you, you both found the wave area rather easily, finding enough room to get in and sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this feels great,\" Aiko smiled as she relaxed a bit. \"Even better with you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You too,\" you smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, a bigger wave emerged, surprising you as you actually capsized and fell into the water. Of course, there was no danger, just a small amount of time where you were fully underwater. Right as you did though, it was like your face was becoming as soft as the rest of you. You had kind of wondered why, but it didn't matter. Eventually, you finally resurfaced, seeing a giggling Aiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caught you by surprise there?\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed back, before happening to see a decent reflection of you in the water. It...was almost like seeing a blurry image reshape itself. Your face looked smooth, with delicate and soft features. Your jaw was much less pronounced, and your lips just a bit puffier. Your nose felt just a bit smaller too, and your eyebrows were thin. However, the biggest change was your eyes, looking just like Aiko's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust seeing it...made you smile wide. Being cute like Aiko was something you had warmed up to, and now you even kind of looked like her. A true family resemblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get closer!\" you laughed, your voice even just a little bit higher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiko of course obliged as you both enjoyed some more time in the waves.</span></div></div>",

You went towards your bag when suddenly you felt as if you were being dragged to the closet. You opened the door and saw several outfits hanging up. One was a casual outfit consisting of a skirt and a blouse. You put it on and noticed that the outfit fit you perfectly, almost as if it was yours. You admired yourself in the mirror when Aiko walked in. You jumped and started to explain yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aiko... I...\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that looks cute on you. You don't wear that one enough.\" Aiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt at ease. It was your outfit, and you should wear it more, it's super cute! You finished getting dressed and Mama was nice enough to drive you home. Normally you'd have used your key, but you couldn't find it, so you knocked on the door. Erin opened the door and she looked excited when she saw it was you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, let's go to my room, Damon and his friends are in the living room.\" Erin said as she led you upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, passing Damon. He looked at you, but only with the look of recognition, and not of say, sibling rivalry or familiarity, as if you're not close. You saw your room across the hall, but the door was shut and appeared locked. That was strange but... you didn't really notice it, hanging out with Erin. You had fun hanging out in her room, doing what had now become your typical behavior, talking and doing things like best girlfriends.</span></div></div>",

Then something clouded your mind for a moment. \"Wow! It's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it. Go change and get out there.\" Ruki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly found a place in the breakroom and changed quickly, coming out dressed identically to all the other girls. Maid outfit, complete with skirt, the headpiece, the only anomaly was your shoes, but that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAiko walked into the breakroom with a shoebox as you made sure your outfit was ready to go out. She walked up behind you and tapped you on the shoulder. You turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chouko!\" she said. \"I got you a present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you shouldn't have... what is it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it's your first day as a waitress, I wanted to make sure you fit in. I brought an old pair of my heels, the ones I used when I first started here.\" Aiko replied, opening the box to reveal a pair of black heels, around the same height as Aiko's and the other girls'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly took them and traded out your shoes for the heels. Something just felt right about them. You and Aiko started walking towards the door to the main part of the cafe.</span></div></div>",

There were certainly no shortage of expectations of you, especially with your mom and dad being such successful people. Even your sister, Erin, was excelling in school right now. Not to mention how proud your parents even were of that Chouko Sugihara girl that was almost like a second daughter to your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you were never sure how you felt about that. In a way, you felt like you could have ribbed that girl a bit more. It felt kind of strange, but you had this feeling that you had more than your fair share of jabs at Erin's Japanese friend, kind of like as if she was another sibling of yours. Sounded kind of ridiculous but oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, being at college now felt like something completely different, especially being in a dorm. You could only wonder how Erin and your parents would be like. House would feel a bit emptier now. Still, you were excited to see what it would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough...the last thing you expected was seeing a young woman, likely around 19 or so as you were, getting some things out of a box. She had fair skin with nice brunette hair. Honestly, she was kind of pretty in a down to earth sort of way. From her expression, you could tell that she was just as surprised as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....hi..\" you said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" she said, blushing a bit. \"S-Sorry, I didn't expect that my roommate was a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't expect a girl either,\" you chuckled a bit, getting over the initial surprise. \"But in any case, it's nice to meet you. I'm Damon Hoffman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Briana Forest,\" she smiled, accepting the handshake you offered. \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the greetings shared, you got a bit of a look around the dorm. It was fairly nice, with two small bedrooms for you both so you didn't have to worry about bunking in the same room with a girl. The lobby was a decent enough size, as was a spot that could serve as a dining room. Overall, it was small yet cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you would definitely get well acquainted with it.</span></div></div>",

Your teacher was absent, and it seems that no substitute was sent, as it's been a half hour and the teacher's desk is empty. You look around at your classmates, who are all just sitting around talking as they wait. You decide it might be a fun lark to sit down at the teacher's desk, and so you leave your bag at your desk and walk up to the front of the room. You sit down in the teacher's desk and look out over the class. It's an interesting feeling, seeing everyone in front of you like that. Even more bizarre is that the talking died down slowly after you sat there, and everyone looked at you with attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's going on?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, we were just talking before you showed up.\" one of the students, a boy, replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our normal teacher keeps the attendance roster in the top left drawer of her desk.\" another student, a girl, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clicked in your mind. They were playing along with the lark! You were the teacher! You chuckled a bit and walked over to the desk to retrieve the roster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, everyone, I'm the substitute teacher and I'm gonna take attendance!\" you said. The class sat there silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to read off names, getting raised hands and replies of \"Here!\" or \"Present!\" You got to your own name, and no one responded, naturally. You went to mark it absent, before catching yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you finished, class was over and the bell rang. Your classmates gathered up their things and started to leave the class. You went to follow them, but something called you back to the desk. Maybe you'd sit there until the substitute showed up, no reason to leave these classes unattended. You retrieved the second period roster from the desk and sat back down at the desk, brushing a loose strand of hair from your face.</span></div></div>",

It's not like other haven't done it when a substitute was coming. Even weirder though was how you were just sitting here. Wouldn't you possibly end up in trouble from your teachers in your next period?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....I'm helping out right?\" you said to yourself, scratching your head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, you did help the class out. English was a topic you were pretty good in anyway, so going over basics and such with the class today wasn't too bad. Maybe they wouldn't be too hard on you if you were just helping out. That thought gave you a bit of comfort, though you still kind of felt weird from the whole thing. You thought you would be more worried about doing this, but something made you feel oddly a bit better about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw your reflection in the desk just a bit, seeing your normal appearance with blue eyes and blonde hair and all. Granted, little strands of hair that were longer than before were there, definitely making your hair a bit bushier than usual. It was even covering your ears just a bit. Perhaps it had been a while since your last haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as you were thinking, the next batch of students seemed to be filing in, all jabbering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have a substitute today?\" one boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" another replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess they were referring to you. Kind of odd how they kind of seemed to accept you being a substitute. Boy, this was going to require a lot of explaining when the school found out what you were doing.</span></div></div>",

You figured it couldn't hurt and put them on your face. You looked around, noticing that everything seemed even more crisp. You smiled as you passed out the worksheets to the groans of the students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just play hangman?\" one of the students asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't notice was that your eyes were becoming a little feminine, with your eyelashes becoming feminine and your eyebrows thinned out.

As you just rambled on about whatever you could think of, some of the students seemed to be not paying attention, rather getting rather talkative. For a little bit, you ignored it, as you kind of liked to talk behind the teacher's back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...just seeing some beginning to goof off...didn't sit well with you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something to say?\" you asked, trying to sound professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing,\" one of the boys just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't nothing from what I could see.

It seemed like they more or less didn't respect you, wanting their regular teacher over the sub. Honestly, you could understand that feeling. You wondered where in the world the real teacher, Sarah Morrison, was. Well, wondering wasn't helping you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...you ended class the same as you did the others, just doing whatever came to mind. You weren't really giving out homework, which you could tell everyone did like, although something still felt off about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, with 3rd Period done, it was time for lunch. Good thing too because you were starving. It would be nice to go sit and eat with your friends like you usually did.

Nothing more than a prank. Yet, it also felt as if you were really one of the teachers. At least, everyone seemed to treat you that way. It was hard to think of this as some kind of prank that everyone was somehow in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention how off your body and clothes felt. You felt the same for the most part, but the platinum-blonde hair really stood out, especially with how much longer it was. It wasn't long enough to touch your shoulders, but it was definitely longer and different from before. In addition, there was your clothes, as you had noticed the extreme color change of your shirt and jeans, and the fact that your pant leggings were shorter, showing your shoes in full. Speaking of which, there was how you could actually see your shoes in the front, and the small heels in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" You asked yourself. This was just so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one else seemed to think so though, even as they all began to come in for 4th period, which was the last class of the school day. Overall, you just tried to do the same things you had done earlier the day. No one seemed to call you out for being stupid or anything. That actually helped a bit, though you couldn't help but wonder if they were just holding in their laughter at how bizarre you had to be by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you continued to just say whatever came to mind regarding class topics, which pretty much sounded like you made things up as you went. Still, no one seemed to think anything strangely of it. After a while, you basically told the class to read on their own for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a little time to myself,\" you whispered to yourself so no one would hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class read to themselves, including discussing it a bit among themselves, you just sat back and thought about things. Something else felt off since your \"lecture\", especially around your chest. You looked down, being surprised when you saw how much tighter it was. In fact, it looked like it had split in two, being connected by a series of buttons like a blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd....why was the neckline so big? You were showing quite a bit of upper chest right now. Ugh, the constrictive feeling of the whole thing wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you'd be happy to just get home and be able to put all of this behind you.</span></div></div>",

It was coming from under the desk. Strange as that was where you put your backpack last. Looking under the desk you saw a purse sitting there that clearly wasn't yours. It was an expensive Michael Kors purse made of white leather. Inside it you found the found, a brand new pink iPhone. The number calling in just said unknown....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's is this?\" You asked yourself. For some reason you couldn't help but admire the purse and phone as it kept ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a bit annoyed you decided to answer the call. \"Hello?\" You answered so you could tell the person you weren't the one they were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen....don't hang up....you are in danger!\" The voice said. It was a woman's voice with a rather sultry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...okay, listen this isn't my phone so.....\" You said as the voice suddenly cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! Just listen don't talk! This IS your phone now. So is the purse. The process is already begun I had to reach you before the physical changes started. Listen I know this won't make since but you are slowly becoming Miss Morrison! It starts with your clothes then progresses to your body and then your mind so you totally forget and accept it.\" The woman said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit stunned and alarmed at what the voice said. There was no way this was possible but it would make sense with all the strange things you have noticed today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know all this? Who are you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter just listen....You still have some time but you need to listen carefully. You CANNOT let any of the teachers catch on that you are aware of this now...What you need to do is finish your last two classes like normal. Then after school the faculty will invite you to the YMCA for a volleyball game and pool party. Accept their invitation and play along. Just make sure you DO NOT accept any drinks you don't pour yourself. Understand? Just do your best to ignore the changes until I contact you again at the party.....\" The voice suddenly stopped as she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could she be telling the truth? Was this even possible?\" You asked yourself as you got up and went to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing yourself for the first time in awhile it finally began to sink in now....Your hair was now fully platinum blonde and was still growing....it currently touched your shoulders and was still growing...Your fingernails were much longer and well manicured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at yourself in the mirror you started to feel a strange bunching feeling on your chest and crotch. Unbuttoning your pants you noticed you were now wearing a black lacey set of panties.... You also noticed a matching bra had formed under your shirt....To make matters worse as you looked your pants had also fused together and finished reforming into a knee length skirt that matched the photo of Miss Morrison you saw earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head you made your way back to your classroom not even noticing your shoes had finished morphing into three in black open toed heels. You already were walking as if you were an expert in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in the classroom you sat down nervous at the desk. Do you listen to the phone call or speak up? You were torn right now. Looking at the purse you put the phone away as you noticed a gym bag next to it that wasn't there before....Slowly you opened the bag as you saw some clothes in there. A pair of tennis shoes, a pair of flip flops, black athletic shirt shorts, a yellow tank top, and a rather sexy white bikini with pink flowers on it. Looking st the bikini you noticed the cups seemed huge! DD cups by the label. Putting the clothes back you put the bag away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for the next class right rang as you knew students would be in their way....Do you stay and listen to the phone call or bail now? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe something good could happen if you got far away from here. You had no basis for that, but it was worth a try at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacking up the purse and bag for some odd reason, you exited the classroom, as no students had arrived yet. You didn't rush it, trying to look natural, as you made your way through the hallway. It was kind of disturbing in a way that no one found your appearance odd. It didn't help your mental state that's for sure. Did the other teachers think the same? Probably best to not think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a turn after getting through the hallway, seeing the entrance doors straight ahead. No one seemed to approach you, which was fine with you. You exited the doors casually, making sure no one happened to be following you or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good,\" You smiled a bit, turning around and picking up the pace a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you got a distance from the doors though, you suddenly felt a shot go through you, making you groan and almost fall to the ground. You had to stifle a cry at it, feeling like you just got punched in the gut. It was kind of painful, though the feeling slowed into discomfort after a little bit, but you felt completely strange all the same. Looking back and forth to make sure no one was around, you unbuttoned the skit a bit, seeing that your panties seemed perfectly flat. You panic began to rise a bit, looking underneath to see a perfect womanhood underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...oh no!\" you cried out, now a lot more unnerved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you couldn't become a woman!

Running outdoors you struggled to remember where your house even was or better how were you gonna get there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran to the parking lot you heard a jingling in your purse. Reaching in you pulled out a pair of keys you didn't recognize. You saw a key faub for car as you clicked it. A white Toyota in the lot suddenly beeped as you thought for a second this was your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it didn't matter now as you got in and started it up. Taking off quickly. Following your instincts you tried to remember your house but for some reason the details were getting harder and harder to remember. Following your gut you drove for several miles before coming to a rather cute blue house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...this isn't my place...is it....?\" You began to think. You saw a house key on the key ring so maybe it was your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out you walked to the door and of course the key was a perfect fit. Going inside you found a cute house decorated in a very feminine way. You knew this wasn't your place but for some reason it felt very familiar....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the bedroom you had to examine yourself. Taking off your heels you unbuttoned your skirt and slid it off. You saw your panties and the flat mound in front of you. Taking a deep breath you slid down the panties as you saw a hairless slit where your once proud manhood was....Gulping you grew nervous as you reached down to touch it as you felt another pain similar to before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunching over you grasped your sides as you felt a pressure building inside you. Holding it as best you could a sudden popping feeling started to come from your hips as they started to push out. The pressure was building in your backside as your butt was starting to swell...It grew larger and larger until it formed a perfect bubble butt....Your entire lower abdomen was now totally female. It looked so strange with your male legs and stomach. Turning around you began to panic realizing this transformation was no joke, but how do you stop it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then.....</span></div></div>",

You were not in the mood to talk to anyone right now, not when you were somehow experiencing female puberty. Still, it just continued to ring...and ring...to the point where it was just getting annoying. With a groan, you walked over, your new hips and butt proving to be major adjustments as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you asked into the phone, wondering just who it would be. Would it be someone reprimanding you for leaving the class or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" It was Rick this time, sounding pretty calm all things considered. \"I just wanted to ask if you were still coming to the YMCA later today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? He was asking about that? Nothing about leaving during school or anything? He was playing it so coolly and such. Why? Nothing seemed to make sense to you. Although...you wondered if you should just go with it. It was beginning to seem like you had no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....y-yeah, I'll be there,\" you stuttered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Rick seemed to smile through the phone. \"Just to remind you, it's at 5:00. See you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the clock, seeing that it was 3:30. Boy, you really did leave early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you said slowly, eventually hanging up without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, guess he was stuck playing along. Who knows about that other voice that called you earlier. Who exactly could you trust in this situation. It didn't seem like many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right as you hung up, another shot went through you, making your legs tingle. Gasping and worrying, you looked down at your bare legs, immediately seeing your little hairs just flow away in the wind, leaving smooth and hairless legs. Graceful tone set into them, making the thighs and calves stick out perfectly and match with your big hips. Your feet changed shape a bit to a new softer look, with new longer nails that looked perfectly taken care off. Now everything from the waist down looked womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....Now what?!\" you cried out, your hands on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like you were running out of time, and the YMCA wasn't even for a while. This felt hopeless!</span></div></div>",

Sexy legs and feet with wide hips and a nice bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do now I can't go home like this?\" You asked yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of just lying there your phone suddenly rang again. This time the number was unknown....You had a pretty good idea who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT!\" A familiar voice suddenly yelled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to leave! The curse works slower in the school. Now it has accelerated I won't be able to make the cure in time now we have to change course....\" the female voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" You asked siting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a counter measure to this curse. I had a potion made up that was going to reverse everything but it had to drunk before your body wasn't totally female. Now there is no way that's going to happen at this rate you will be female within a couple hours. You will lose all your memories a few hours after that so we have to act fast...\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I panicked! What do we need to do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be able to stop the mental changes from erasing all your memories but it won't be perfect...You are most likely going to inherit some of the female traits they want you to have. After that we are going to have to play their game for a bit. You are going to have to act as Miss Morrison completely on the outside. I might be able to find another way out but it will take more time. Go the YMCA I will find you when the time is right. For now just play along like everything is normal.\" The voice said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" You said to yourself as you got up. You decided to keep your mind off things by exploring the house you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the closet you discovered a huge selection of outfits. Almost all of them were very sexy. You even found a section towards the back that was almost all lingerie and bikinis. It seemed like they were not kidding when they talked about Sarah's background. You found yourself unable to resist as you picked out a sexy thomg and slid it on and you stared at your beautiful round butt in the mirror. Bending over you gave a sexy pose as you suddenly imagined guys staring at you....This thought caused a strange new warm sensation to build up within you that you had never felt before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts out of your head you left the closet as you explored the house. You were really impressed with the decor and art style. Very modern but also feminine. She even had a jacuzzi tub in her bathroom. She also had lotions and creams of all types everywhere along with a ton of scented candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile of exploring you saw it was almost time to leave. You walked back towards your room as another painful wave hit your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...no not yet....\" you said as you looked down to your stomach. It was beginning to flatten and tighten up as you saw small ab muscles forming as your stomach finished forming into a sexy female mid-section. Your arms were also beginning to itch as they lost all their hair and thinned out matching your legs. Your platinum blonde hair down came to your mid back. You only had a few pieces of your old self left now. You knew was was coming next which is what you feared most....glancing down under your shirt your nipples seemed really puffy and swollen and tender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing on your skirt and heels from earlier you got back in your car as you drove off to the YMCA. You just hoped this voice would come through so could go home and see your family again, if even their faces and names were becoming much harder to remember now...</span></div></div>",

However, you eventually did come to see that...when you heard a siren behind you. That got your heart beating even faster to the point where it felt like you might have a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man....\" you worried, on the verge of a bigger freakout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you pulled over, hearing the policeman come up behind you. Oh boy...this was going to be really bad. The officer came right up to your window...but surprisingly he didn't seem to be chewing you out immediately, kind of asking casually how you were and if you were aware of your speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry....\" you said, meaning it. \"I was...distracted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell,\" the man seemed to smile a bit. \"I suppose someone as attractive as you would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, something in you clicked, and you smiled sexily at him. \"Would you care to see just how attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man genuinely laughed, as if this was a nice casual conversation, even getting you to laugh with him. Right as you did though, the feeling in your chest just exploded. Right then, you looked down, seeing two mounds rapidly forming on your chest, pushing out the blouse you had on, and easily beginning to fill out the DD-cup bra you had. The feeling put a lot of pressure on your chest, making you even moan a bit as the feelings rushed into you. However, they also served to break out of that mood you just felt yourself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the officer let you off with a warning, though not without a little wink at the end that made you blush a bit. As he left though, you just laid back, your new huge breasts bouncing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" you worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more, it felt like you were changing. Even the faces of your family were really blurry by now. In fact....were you even a student at school? No....you...were a teacher....right?</span></div></div>",

You knew something was wrong but it was getting harder and harder to remember what. You could barely remember your old life right now. You were even struggling to remember your real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into the YMCA you went to the conference room as several other teachers were waiting for you, including Rick who gave you a small wink which suddenly made your body feel rather strange. Like it was getting hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Sarah!\" The crowd shouted for you as you entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as everyone cheered for you. The principal of the school an older man Mr. Wilson walked up to you and shook your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard Sarah. I just wanna say on behalf of the faculty here I am pleased to have you join our team.\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...thank you...\" you said feeling a bit dizzy. Why we're here again? You just got this job as an English teacher right? Way better than that strip club you had to work at in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait why did you suddenly have memories of working at a strip club? Why did you have memories of college? You were a student right? Feeling a. It strange you walked to the bathroom and leaned over the counter. Your face was starting to feel weird as you looked at your reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips suddenly started to swell as they grew pouty, your face was shrinking and reforming as your Adam's apple shrunk away. You let out a groan as your voice suddenly changed. You jumped as you looked at yourself. You looked almost just like the picture you saw. The only difference was your boobs were a bit smaller and still natural looking. Maybe that Sarah had a boob job done sometime? Or was that you? Your butt also wasn't as prominent as the picture version yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking deep breaths you felt like the last bits of yourself were slipping away. You couldn't remember your family's faces or names anymore. Who were you again? Sarah Morrison right? Hitting your head you tried to keep your thoughts straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled you suddenly heard the bathroom door open and lock. Turning around you were a bit shocked. Standing there was a woman who looked just like you! Well almost....She had the same face but her body seemed even more sexually  extreme than yours. Her platinum blonde hair was even brighter and longer, her skin was a deeper tan, her boobs were giant and clearly looked like implants. Her butt was bigger nails were longer than yours and her entire figure was a tool hourglass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't answer as she took a step towards you and reached to her purse. She suddenly pulled out a small golden ring as she walked over and grabbed your hand and withiutiut asking slid the ring on right ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey why did........\" You said as you suddenly paused. In that moment it was like everything came flooding back. Your memories of yourself and your family. Everything about yourself you had almost forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I remember! Oh my god what's happened to me?\" You said seeing yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saved you that's what....If you weren't so ambitious I could have reversed the curse but now the best I can do is delay it.\" The other woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....You are the voice on the phone? Who are you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you....or at least I was the Sarah Morrison before you. It's too long of a story to tell right now. All I can say is I broke free of their curse but I was forced to pay a price for it....\" she said gesturing to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want you now...This ring will resist the curse's takeover over your mind, but only for so long. It doesn't stop the changes to your body, you will still feel the desires of having that body. We must take more steps to free you from their control. For now you just play along l. Pretend to be Sarah, the sexy blonde teacher they want. If you let on you can remember your past you will suffer the same fate as I did. I will contact you again when the time is right.\" The woman said before she turned around and left before you could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you looked at yourself in the mirror. You realized now you had to play the part of a sexy female teacher. Luckily you could still remember all the things they implanted in your mind. The thought of being stuck like this forever or worse haunted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking outside the teachers still greeted and talked with you like normal. You did your best to try and mingle and find a way to leave normally. However another teacher just walked in and adressed everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Sarah, just like you asked we have volleyball set up. We can do normal volleyball in the gym or water volley ball in the pool, what shall it be?\" The teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the gym bag you had now and why it had both a pair of tight yoga shorts and sports bra and a bikini in it. You couldn't get out of this easily you just had to make a choice.</span></div></div>",

From \"her\" perspective, either option sounded fine, although they sounded equally bad to you. Well, in the end, you had to pick one, regardless of how tough it was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....water,\" you just said randomly, picking whatever name went into your head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" the teacher smiled and clapped her hands a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seemed happy at the choice, though they probably would have been satisfied either way. In any case, you wondered if it was worse choice. After all, water volleyball involved swimming as well, though you were at least competent in that regard. Still, seemed like you were stuck, so you grabbed your bag and began following some other female teachers into a locker room to change.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSome of the other women tried to bring up some casual talk, not like you would know what they were talking about anyway. You were too weirded out by this body to care about what they were saying. As stated earlier, your proportions seemed within the realm of normal so far, nothing that looked over the top or anything. That was a little bit reassuring, even as you began to strip down and get your new bikini out. Just working with the memories you had, it wasn't too hard to get the top on, fixing your breasts inside the cups carefully and pulling the bottom up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, they both feel tight,\" you groaned, fixing the bikini just a bit. Obviously, you still had the ring on your right ring finger. Thinking about it, you wondered if that would stand out at all. Eh, some people did everything with rings on so you doubted it'd stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, couldn't help how weird it felt, even with the new memories in your head. It was strange to have close to 2 sets of memories in your head, and the balance feeling so delicate like it could break at any time and unleash a flood. It was kind of scary to be honest, even as the Sarah side of you wanted to have some fun in the pool, making you smile just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter others were done, you followed the other women to where some of the guys had gotten ready as well. Looks like they had picked a typical men vs. women battle for the game, which felt fine enough. They all seemed pretty casual about it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...just stay calm....\" you said as you got into the water with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started off slowly in the water. You kind of had to get used to it all, though you seemed to do okay as things went on, likely due to Sarah's influence in you. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up, Sarah!\" someone cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the ball happened to splash right in front of you, spending you reeling backwards in the deep water. You flailed for a bit to try and get back up to the surface, before finally wadding back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" someone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I'm....fine?\" you said before realizing something. Why did your hand feel different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the others turned away, you looked at your right hand, your eyes widening at the lack of a ring. Oh no! Did it fall off while you were wadding yourself back to the surface?! Oh no, that can't be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where is-UGH!\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, your head was aching again, everything from before trying to come back. Not only that, but the feelings spread to your body as well, specifically your breasts for some reason. Looking down, you gasped as you saw your breasts rapidly growing again, going beyond natural looks as they became even more enormous, something that somehow your bikini top grew to compensate. The feelings sent waves of pleasure throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...where is the ring?!\" you cried out as you dived underwater again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your chest was growing tighter and tighter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah you okay?\" One of the girls asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....I'm fine....I inhaled some water I will be right back.....\" You said swimming to the edge of the pool as you rushed back to the women's locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to a mirror as hair peeled off your bikini top. Your already large breasts were pulsing as they grew more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no please  no more!\" You cried out in vain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to stop them from growing only to watch them rise off your chest as they began to block the view of your body. Soon you couldn't even see your toes normally by just looking down. As your breasts grew you noticed they were changing shape too. They lost their natural sag and tear drop shapes. They became rounder and more centered as each breast became a perfect shaped sphere. Your nipples were perfectly shaped and centered. They were clearly not naturally looking anymore as they were clearly the work of an expert surgeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your new huge rack your mind began to pulse with new memories again as your felt your mind going blank for a moment as everything went white......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you had passed out as you awoke slowly to find yourself somewhere very different from a ladies locker room. You were in a doctors office it seemed. However you were unable to move or speak. You were simply a witness to something as you saw a pretty young women who looked suspiciously like you sitting on a bench topless with a doctor looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a dream? Or a memory?\" You asked yourself watching the doctor examine the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe definitely looked like you. Except her skin wasn't as tan. Her hair was shorter, and also brunette instead of platinum blonde. Her breasts were a nice size, probably C cups, still healthy and and natural. She was a younger you it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am are you sure about this? Going up to such a large size? Your breasts are fine right now? If you go that big you will never be able to go smaller again. Also consider the cost. \" The doctor asked the young lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's totally fine. My work insurance is paying for them. Plus my boss David says I can make double the tips with bigger ones. I need that money to pay back all my loans.\" The young woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was another flash of white as you found yourself back in the ladies locker room. You were staring at your huge perfect breasts in the mirror as someone suddenly walked behind you. It was Grace another teacher, skinny little thing with almost no tits at all which for some reason made your really sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Sarah? You just walked off?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah....my top started to bother me. I will be out in a second.\" You said lying as best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding your top you put it back on as you noticed it had totally changed shape. It now seemed built to support you new larger breasts and also show them off more in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the pool you saw Rick standing there with something in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think you dropped this.\" He said opening his hand and showing you a gold ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you!\" You said taking it back as you put it back on. Immediately you felt better as your mind seemed clearer. Your breasts were still changed and that strange memory of the doctor seemed clear as day still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the game you were surprised at just how good you were at this game. You made several goals and led your team to victory of the men. You felt really good actually as everyone got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you played one hell of a game.\" Rick said to you afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too.\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I was thinking, would you like to grab dinner tonight?\" Rick asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just realized he was asking you out in a date. Your body felt strange both excited and terrified now. You had no idea if you should go or not.</span></div></div>",

Should be easy enough to find a place by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure,\" you stuttered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, it felt like no matter what, you would just get yourself into hotter water. Another look at your ring really showed how precarious things were. It was off for just a little bit and look what changed. Those memories didn't seem to be going away, and the addition of the new one continued to tip the scales oh so delicately in \"Sarah's\" favor. Ugh, this was so weird and complicated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the party didn't last for much longer with the main event out of the way. It was pretty much time for you to head back to your house, though I guess that meant Sarah's house really. Rick winked in your direction right before you left, getting another warm feeling in your body. Seriously, was that going to happen with all guys in this body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs frustrating as it was, you got back to the car, driving back the familiar way to Sarah's house. The new breasts were something to really adjust to with how big they were. Seriously, they nearly touched the steering wheel even when you sitting normally. The slightest lean forward would almost hit your horn. Conveniently, your top and bra had also shifted to an enormous size to suit your new rack, making you sigh again as you eventually made it back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what am I doing?\" you sighed as you took your shoes off, walking inside the house again and sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had about half an hour or so until 7 could come and Rick would arrive. Who knew how long that strange woman would leave you on your own, so you had to handle it yourself for now. </span></div></div>",

The idea of going on a date seemed really odd to you but for some reason you also felt really excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily your female memories on how to get ready were there as you took a shower and began to dry and do your hair. You gave your platinum blonde locks some light curls to them as you did your makeup. Making sure to add just enough but not too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you had to pick an outfit. You found a sexy matching set of blue bra and silk panties. The bra supported your heavy tits nicely and the silk panties curved your but nicely.  You found a rather sexy blue dress which matched your underwear nicely. It wasn't too low cut but still showed a decent amount of cleavage. Your huge breasts still left little to imagine regardless of what you wore. It came to your mid thigh showing your legs nicely and hugged your body showing your curves and framing your butt. You found a pair of black open toed heels that went really well together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had dressed you were rather impressed. You looked damn hot! Rick was gonna be a lucky guy tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made your body warm as you suddenly paused. Why did you think that? This date wasn't normally remember? You played with the ring on your finger trying not to slip away again. You had to remember who you were. A few minutes later you heard your doorbell ring.</span></div></div>",

Just the thought of that sounded so bizarre. Still, guess you had to do it given your current situation. Taking another breath, you opened the door, seeing Rick there in a rather nice suit. Pretty typical stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful, Sarah,\" Rick smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks,\" you tried to smile a bit, though a part of you genuinely liked the compliment. \"You...look nice too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick thanked you for the compliment, leading you outside to his car that he came in. He let you into the passenger's side, allowing you to get settled in before he came over to the driver's side. After another minute, everything was good and he had the car rolling along to it's destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed the party,\" Rick smiled. \"Everyone put a lot of effort into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that's great,\" you smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were insanely nervous on the inside. Trying to play along was hard, especially with all these strange feelings in your body and head. You kept on playing with the ring, which seemed to be quickly becoming a nervous habit of yours. It probably wasn't a good thing with how easy it came off earlier, but you couldn't really help it. Still, at least there wasn't much talking. It was pretty quiet inside the car as Rick kept driving along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good at least,\" you sighed to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite this, you kept fidgeting, playing around with the ring all the same. However, a few minutes later, Rick had to make a sudden stop because of a dumb driver, sending you reeling a bit and accidentally knocking the ring from the finger in the process since all your fidgeting loosened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, not again!\" you said as you reached for it since you could still see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the deed had already been done as the feelings rushed through you once again, going through your body. You were worried your breasts may grow again, but that didn't seem to be the case, No, this time the pressure seemed to be in your legs, making you grimace as they seemed to grow out from under your dress, becoming even more smooth than they were before. You gasped as how long they looked before you finally got the ring back on, feeling a bit exhausted from the events. Sheesh, this constant back and forth was going to wear you out eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Rick seemed too occupied with the driver in front of him to notice what happened with you, which saved you some explaining, but didn't make you feel better about how you had transformed further once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you said slowly. \"Where...are we going?\"</span></div></div>",

You were trying to relax even as your new longer legs made your dress seem even shorter now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the waiter came and brought you some water you took a big gulp as you tried to seem calm even though you were almost shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay? You seem nervous.\" Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....I'm just nervous.\" You said with a light smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, just enjoy yourself.\" Rick said with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small pause the waiter came back as the two of you ordered. For some reason you found yourself ordering a salad. You hated salad normally but for some reason it sounded really good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you excited to start teaching after the weekend?\" Rick asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Just nervous about....the other teachers.\" You said trying not to let on you knew there was some kind of curse going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey....Don't let them get to you. Most of them are just jealous. I know word travels fast I'm sure you know everyone has heard about your past. Just so you know I don't care. I think you are stunningly beautiful.\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...my...past?\" You said not quite sure what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....Its not a secret you were a stripper during college to pay for your loans. You had several procedures too. I know some of the other teachers look down on that that doesn't change you as a person.\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...thank you.\" You said a bit stunned. You were a bit flattered by his compliment. Your body was starting to react strangely. You suddenly began to stare at Rick in a different way, looking at his muscles and masculine frame....wait...were you attracted to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your glass of water you took a sip as you suddenly spilt a bit of water on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!

Trying to calm yourself, you walked in and headed immediately for the sinks where the paper towels were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid water....\" you groaned, the liquid mostly over the front of your dress, though it hardly seemed too bad to dry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you grabbed some towels and tried to gently mop up most of the water, just the sensation of you touching your breasts seemed to tingle. Pretty much every action felt like it sent waves through you, making you sigh as you tried to control yourself. As you tried though, you couldn't help but think back to a few minutes ago with Rick. Those...muscles....and frame...and eyes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why do I keep thinking about that?!\" you groaned, almost yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to counteract it by thinking of some women you thought were attractive, to at least get your mind off Rick. Yet, each time you did, you felt nothing at them, nothing like before. Why was that happening? Each time you would end up back at Rick, and you'd feel hot all over again. You looked down at the ring, seeing that it was still there, but these desires seemed to be increasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....she did say it wouldn't stop them completely,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you kept on moping the water and dealing with the flowing desires though, a little flash went through your head, startling you a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It felt kind of like the last time, with you observing over a woman that was clearly the younger Sarah. She looked like she had already gone through the massive breast expansion, the same ones you have now. Her hair was longer, and even getting a bit lighter as well. She was conversing with a doctor once again, though it seemed a little more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this?\" the doctor asked. \"There could be side affects from this, especially mentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I can deal with that,\" Sarah said. \"I can get better tips with better skin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory continued on for a bit longer, until you felt yourself back in the present day, feeling a little winded from it. It seemed like you were getting a better idea of who you....Sarah....was now. That memory continued on in your head, not going away much like the last one. It made you wonder just how long before more memories permanently stayed in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you had no choice but to continue, so you went back out once you were satisfied. Rick seemed happy that you were back, and you couldn't help but smile back, still as conflicted as before.</span></div></div>",

You were a bit surprised by how much you liked the salad you were eating considering the old you hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the check came Rick paid for it without even asking. You wanted to offer to cover the tip but he simply took care of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly keep yourself from fiddling with your ring now as you stared at Rick more and more. You began to imagine him throwing you on your bed and ripping your clothes off and then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" You suddenly said quite loudly and with almost a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick stared at you blankly more a moment before you realized what had just happened. You couldn't blush harder if you tried. Feeling so embarrassed you suddenly got up and walked of the restaurant as Rick followed you having just paid the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's going on? You okay?\" He asked following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fine I just feel weird....that's all.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your body isn't it? You're having another reaction aren't you? The same as in the pool earlier?\" Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reaction?\" You suddenly asked. Looking down to your ring you suddenly decided to do something crazy....You needed to know what he meant. Reaching down you suddenly slid your ring off as another memory came rushing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before you were a witness to a doctor's visit. However this time you saw a version of Sarah you didn't expect. Her hair was a bright silver now, almost white even. It was wrapped up in a pony tail that almost touched her ankles. If she let it fall naturally it would be at least a foot longer than her body. Her lips were much fuller and pouty. Her skin was even more smooth and tan, her nails even longer. She had the same huge tits you did, as well as an even bigger and rounder butt. She also had much wider hips giving her a total hourglass shape. She looked like a complete sex doll....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I can't go back?\" She asked yelling at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we can't reverse the changes Miss Morrison. I warned you when you started these changes. If you went too far the damage would be permanent. The surgeries plus the drugs have completely altered your body makeup.\" The doctor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't become a teacher looking like this! No one will take me seriously! I don't even recognize myself anymore. My hair grows faster than I can manage it, Not to mention the urges! Sometimes I just get randomly so horney I can barely control it! I just quit my job and finished my degree and paid off my loans! What am I supposed to do now?\" The Sarah in the memory asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure a woman of your brians and beauty will work it out. Not many women in the world are willing to go as far as you did just for a job.\" The doctor said with an almost evil grin.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory suddenly ended as you suddenly found yourself pushed up against Ricks chest leaning against him. Your huge breasts pressing into his firm chest. The sensations felt amazing as you almost leaned up to kiss him as you pulled away at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry it's just....they are so strong sometimes....I don't want...\" you said as Rick interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want some jerk to take advantage of you. I understand, so many creeps out there only see a sex object. They don't realize you are a real person who is actually dealing with medical side effects. Trust me I would never take advantage of your situation unless you wanted me to.\" Rick said crossing his heart and making a pinky promise with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gesture made you smile as you suddenly felt something familiar....A change coming on as you new you had to lay the price for removing your ring.</span></div></div>",

It continued to become rounder and firmer, becoming more bouncy by the second as it made your dress hike up even more. It was barely even covering it by the time you felt that it ended, leaving your long legs almost fully exposed to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you panic a bit, though you had to expect it given that you kind of had it coming. Still, you made your way with Rick over to his car, though you immediately felt your new butt as you sat down. It was like an extra cushion underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little better?\" Risk asked, seemingly oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" you said slowly. \"Just a bit tired after a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable,\" Rick smiled as he started the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rick began the drive to your house, well your current one at least. You avoided talking for the most part, leaving yourself to your thoughts, which weren't getting much better. Those new memories weren't going away, like they were there to stay. It conflicted heavily with your male memories, making you sigh a bit at it all. You were lost in thought so much that you barely noticed when you got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are,\" Rick smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" You smiled a bit, saving face before turning to Rick. \"Say Rick....would you like to come inside for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure why you asked that, though Rick didn't seem to mind, as it wasn't too late or anything. He accepted your offer, coming inside with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a really nice place,\" Rick smiled as he looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" You smiled a bit, seemingly liking the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...those desires and urges were feeling as strong as ever.

He explained he was the oldest from a large family and got into teaching because of his love for kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only half paying attention to him as your hands were almost shaking.

You were a stunned at what you saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sarah you saw was somehow even more sexually extreme than last time. Her hair was a pure Snow White. However it seemed to have some kind of silver glitter in it that shined in the light. It was braided together in a log ponytail which touched her ankles. Her nails were even longer. What was weird was she was standing in the office wearing a silver bikini but barefooted. Expect she was still standing on the balls of her feet like she was in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at what you did to me! I'm a complete sex doll! The doctor said I can never go back now! How can I be a teacher now! You did this to me you bastard Scott!\" Sarah yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Honey....all I did was pay for the procedures and meds. You agreed to the entire process. Was I wrong? You make more out there in one night than any other girl here makes in a week. You are a legend here. Why give that up?\" Scott the manager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew this would happen didn't you? You never intended to help me become a teacher! I should have known....Those hair growth drugs, the last surgery to help me stand in heels longer....You knew this would happen to me didn't you?\" Sarah screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course of did, I turned you into my perfect little puppet. You have not only been the best money making asset I ever invested in, you have been the best sex partner I've ever had.\" Scott said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a sick bastard! I quit! I hope you rot in Hell!\" Sarah said turning around grabbing her coat and storming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck trying to be a teacher with a body like that! You know your nothing more than a sex doll and eye candy! I'll be waiting when you come crawling back!\" Scott yelled back as the dream ended.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you snapped back to normal Rick was looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you okay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it....\" you suddenly said as you leapt out of your chair and into Ricks lap as you began kissing him furiously.</span></div></div>",

However, part of you expected Rick to perhaps stop you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it seemed like he was serious about being support, as if allowing you to do what you needed to do and accepted your affections easily and returning your kiss. That just seemed to spur you on further, rubbing into him while you kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, things were proceeding as you would expect sex to. You began undressing Rick, feeling even more turned on seeing his bare chest. Rick returned the favor by pulling your dress down, revealing your insanely large breasts and large butt, still clothed in a bra and panties. Before long though, things continued and Rick unstrapped your bra, allowing your perfectly round orbs to bounce, along with your bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you think?\" you smiled, despite much of you wanting to stop this now before it went further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful, as always,\" Rick smiled. \"You shouldn't ever feel ashamed of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just made you blush a bit before you continued to pull Rick's pants down and his underwear, leaving you both naked. You just felt hotter at it, urges practically overflowing right now. The ring didn't seem to be helping much, something you noted but didn't have the power to resist right now.

You could feel a climax coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....oh my god....\" you kept saying, mostly because of how you felt like you couldn't stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, that climax happened, making your body wrack with pleasure, though the commotion caused the ring to slip once again from your fingers. Your eyes widened a bit as you saw that, but the pleasure kept you in place. You continued to kiss Rick while you were together, though the ring's absence made the feelings flow even more so. With each second that went by, you could feel a tingling in your head, the feeling of hair growth like before. Slowly, you could feel it down your back, touching your butt by now. A strand flowing by your face showed how silver it was, not quite the white it was in the memory but close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you tried to think, there was yet another climax, sending more pleasure through you. Right when it did though, the sensations flowed into your feet, and you felt a popping in them, them feeling like they just straightened out. It felt harder to bend them into a normal position, as you got a brief glimpse of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally....after a minute, the feelings finally began to slow down, allowing you enough time to grab the ring against Rick's vision, slipping it on as fast as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please work...\" you groaned as you got it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the feelings began to subside, allowing your head to clear a bit more, making you sigh in relief as you and Rick separated finally. You could see the changes though, like your hair touching your butt in incredibly long strands. You also landed your feet on the ground, but they stayed in an upright position like they were going into high heels. You could move them a bit, but this position felt natural to them somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that wasn't all....the ring looked a bit different. It was really plain before, but now it had a slot in it. One perfect for a diamond or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" you asked yourself.</span></div></div>",

As before a white light washed over you as you saw yourself watching another one of Sarah's memories. This time she appeared to be sitting on a a couch in an apartment. There was another girl there too. Her body was incredibly sexual as well but not nearly as much as yours. She appeared to be another stripper and friend of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was weird was how Sarah looked. Her hair was white with silver strands like you had seen before. It was already longer than her body by at least a foot. However her breasts, butt, and hips hadn't quite gotten to where yours were yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just cut it?\" The other girl asked Sarah as they sat and drank wine together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried! It keeps coming back longer each time and stronger. Scissors barely work anymore on it!\" Sarah said standing up as she stood on the balls of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you standing like that?\" The other girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I...can't help it. Scott had them do a foot alteration with along with the hair drugs. He said it would make standing in heels more comfortable. However now whenever I'm not standing like this it feels uncomfortable.  Also I think Scott is lying to me. He said these new type of implants were natural and would grow my boobs over time then stop. However I seem to keep getting bigger every week!\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you let Scott do all this to you! You were pretty before now it's just getting extreme....\" the other girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...it's just...oh...oh!\" Sarah said suddenly leaning over. She was wearing a blouse with no bra which was suddenly getting tighter as she looked down to see her breasts growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah moaned grabbing her breasts her hair continued to grow longer and longer as if responding to the sexual pleasure....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream suddenly ended as you woke up naked in your bed. It was morning and Rick was laying next to you. Yours eyes suddenly widened as you remembered what happened last night. It suddenly dawned on you that your first real sexual experience was as a woman! What scared you even worse was deep you couldn't deny that you loved it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed you suddenly found yourself almost falling over as your feet refused to bend. You leaned against the wall trying to balance yourself as you realized your feet refused to bend flat. You were forced to stand on the balls of your feet and tip toes like you were in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" You said trying your best to walk and balance yourself. Making your way to the shower you were surprised at how quickly you seemed to adapt to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the shower you began to wash yourself as you played with the ring on your hand. Your mind was racing as you thought of Rick laying on your bed. Had you really just done that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course he is your boyfriend!\" A new thought suddenly popped into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking those thoughts out you tried to remain yourself as you suddenly played with the ring too much as it slipped off your finger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" You said as you could feel a Daniele pleasure coursing through yourself as a tingling began in your scalp as your hair started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a moan of pleasure as you suddenly heard Rick wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, want me to join you?\" He said as your body was heating up again. Part of you wanted him more than anything. The other was desperate to try and get he ring back on. </span></div></div>",

You could hear hear Rick getting closer, about to come to the bathroom. You looked down, seeing the ring as it was too big to drain away. However, picking it up seemed to be troublesome, especially with your feet stuck in this mold. That plus the water was making it harder to grab it, much to your frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" you grunted as you kept on trying to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you tried though, the door opened and Rick appeared, his full nude body in your view again. Not that it was a surprise as you had already seen it, but just the sight of it was making you hot inside again. With a smile, he came inside the shower with you, holding you close which just seemed to ampify the feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Rick smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah I am,\" you somehow smiled through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the feelings just continued to take over, leading to another hot session in the shower. Plenty of loving going around as one could put it, though you weren't oblivious to what was changing. You could feel the itching in your scalp, indicating that your hair was growing again. Looking behind you briefly, you could see it hitting the bottom of the tub now. Looked like your hair was even longer than you were tall right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it did little to slow things down, and you moaned as Rick was inside you all over again. This body couldn't seem to get enough of it frankly. Eventually though, things did come to an end, though Rick seemed more than satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really romantic, eh?\" he chuckled a bit as he got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" you said, just trying to hold off the emotions as best you could after that event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the water off, you were able to get the ring and slide it back on thankfully. However, when you did, there was another change. It had a small diamond in the slot now, looking much fancier, almost like an engagement ring or something. What did this all mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...getting out of hand,\" you sighed, leaning against the shower as you wondered what to do.</span></div></div>",

Part of you hated yourself the other part wanted it to never end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braided your hair into a long ponytail which still almost came down down to your ankles. The hair was longer than your body at this point. You were still surprised at how easily you braided it. The color was almost gone too. Only hints of blonde were left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in your room you found a pair of comfy sweatpants and a nice large t shirt. Pairing it with normal pair of panties and bra you tried to make yourself at least sexy as possible for once. The only problem was your feet. Because of their shape you still had to put on heels. Luckily you found a pair of small closed toe heels that still worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick got dressed as he got ready to head out. Turning to you he suddenly gave you a kiss as you pulled him in closer almost instinctually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I still picking you up later today?\" Rick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...for what?\" You said blinking not remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our date silly! Remember we were going to dinner then you wanted to check out that new dance club downtown?\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeah!\" You said bright eyed. The idea of dancing and looking sexy suddenly made your body warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rick left you shook your head trying to get those thoughts out.  Walking around the house you suddenly noticed something new. You saw several pictures of you and Rick together were around the house now. Pictures of the two of you places you had no memory of. It looked like the two of you had been dating for quite awhile actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was pounding now you didn't know what was real anymore! You could barely even remember your old life! Even your old name was getting harder to remember. Laying down on the couch you tried to concentrate as you suddenly felt a new memory coming in....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a familiar white flash you found yourself watching a younger Sarah in an apartment as she seemed to be in her closet rummaging through clothes. By her appearance you could tell she was somewhere in the middle of her transformation. she was wearing only a sexy set of lingerie as she kept trying on different outfits before ripping them off. She also seemed to be on the phone with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you! I can't wear them anymore! None of my pants or normal clothes work for me! They all feel really itchy or uncomfortable! The only things that work are sexy outfits and workout clothes! It's like my body rejects them now!\" She said as the white flash returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you woke up you shook your head as you suddenly felt a tingling under your sweatpants. A sudden tightness as you felt something crawling up between your butt cheeks. Going to a mirror you saw your panties were morphing into a sexy thong....looking down your sweatpants were looking a bit shorter as they seemed to be shrinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no! Please!\" You called out. You refused to just let this curse take you so easily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You pondered perhaps going out and getting some normal clothes, but would that really help right now? Going with that new memory you got, it seemed Sarah struggled with anything that wasn't sexy. Maybe that was what was keeping you in place right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sweatpants continued to shrink, which was only punctuated with your shirt feeling like it was shrinking as well. You tried to fight it, but the change just kept happening, with the two garments eventually merging into one at the hems. A nice black color spread, eventually covering them completely as they morphed into a silky material, the bottom half practically becoming a mini dress with your full legs getting shown off. However, you felt even more stuff going on up top, where you saw a wide amount of chest beginning to be shown, your breasts not feeling the bra anymore. Looking down, you saw that the bra was gone, seemingly merged into the dress as the black dress barely covered them, with only some straps holding it up beyond there. If anything, it was like this dress made your breasts look bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding,\" you sighed, putting one hand to your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, you just sat on the couch, not exactly sure what to do. As you did though, the changes continued, apparently not content with your little heels. You felt them on your feet, looking down as the heels grew longer, shifting your feet as they did. Even more so, you saw the fronts of the heels fade away, showing off your toes in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....guess that's all for the clothes,\" you sighed, quite worried about how you were looking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like the ring's new look was helping your mental state either. It was like something else was coming, but you didn't want to imagine it. Eventually though, after a little while, you felt something wash over your face, prompting you to take a trip to the bathroom to make sure. Sure enough, it was like you got make-up applied, pretty much professionally done. Your nails even had a clear nail polish on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooked like the curse took care of anything related to your look before your eventual date.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time you saw Sarah in a very similar stage to you now. She was wearing only a silver bikini and heels and seemed to be at the strip club where she currently worked. She was in stage dancing with all sorts of men yelling at her when suddenly one of her heels snapped....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was about to fall off stage and possibly break her ankle when a man leaped up and caught her.

Well, at least the class itself was rather nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took another look at what you were wearing. The briefs and tank top were tighter than anything you usually wore, that that didn't feel bad in itself. The shirt, with it's lavender color, definitely had a soft feel to it, though you did wonder what was up with the buttons. The pants felt okay, though you didn't like how much of your ankles they showed. It just looked strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of strange, so did your cotton socks against the black shoes.

Didn't seem like they got into any trouble. They seemed to be working well, along with some casual conversation. However, they all straightened up once you got back. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....sorry about that..\" you said unsurely, walking back to the desk, picking up the glasses you had been wearing. \"So...let's get back to work..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, this whole thing made you feel unsure about this. Still, the fact that the class was rather cooperative helped quite a bit. It was fun in a way, and seeing the students get stuff right that you were talking about felt nice. Granted, as time went on, you failed to notice a subtle shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants were beginning to cover your ankles, as you were seemingly getting a little shorter in height. You found it a little curious that the ceiling seemed a bit higher, but ignored it as you had more important things.</span></div></div>",

However instead of standing up and leaving as you normally would you found yourself sitting and waiting for the next class to arrive. Normally this would worry you. You were never the kind of person to skip class but something about helping this students just felt....natural. Almost like you were meant to do. You decided you could stay for one more period at least until the real substitute arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a small itching at the back of your neck as you brushed the hair tickiling it aside. Your blonde hair now was past your ears touching the mid part of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes the 3rd period class began to trickle into the classroom. Their reaction to you sitting there was about the same as the last class. Most shrugged it off while a few said that they must have a sub today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the class was in session you stood up as you began to pass out graded homework from the night before. You walked around without even realizing it. How did you know each student and where they sat? Why did you know he answers to this quiz just by looking at it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class lets start by going over the answers together.\u201d You said with confidence. An almost strange kind of confidence you didn\u2019t have before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you read out loud the first question you felt a breeze near your feet. Your ankles were showing again. Were the pants starting to shrink? What was weirder was how the new breeze felt against your smooth skin. Wait...smooth skin? Looking down you saw your pants were now much more like capris stopping right about your knees. Your exposed calves were now visible and what was weirder was all the hair there was gone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething is wrong.....something is very wrong.\u201d You told yourself as you suddenly saw a raised hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Billy what is it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot my book in my locker can I grab it?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t explain it but something told you he was lying. Billy had been caught smoking a month ago and gotten suspended for it. Something told you he was trying to sneak out of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo....just share with Mary.\u201d You said pointing to the nerdy girl Mary who sat right beside him. Billy groaned a bit as he moved his desk closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked a bit seeing his reaction. You weren\u2019t born yesterday, nice try Billy.

On the other hand though, something felt natural about this, with helping other students.

You continued through the 3rd period class like you did the ones before it and the bell eventually rang. 4th period wasn't too different, though you did worry about how casual this was all becoming. No one said anything strange, and just let you fill in the role of a substitute teacher. You weren't sure what to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there was all the odd other things, like your clothes. Not much else had changed, but everything still felt weird. I mean, the sleeves on your top were almost completely gone now, showing off rather smooth arms that also had no hair on them. Plus, you had noticed your nails, which had grown longer and had a shiny tint to them. Had it really been that long since you last cut them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the bell for 4th period eventually rang, which meant it was finally time for lunch. Honestly, you were more than happy for that. You were crazy hungry by this point, and all this acting was rather tiring. You sent the students off like you did before, finding the lunch you brought with you to school. Curiously, you couldn't seem to get rid of the purse, even though it only had really girly items and such. Still....guess it didn't hurt to take it along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, once the students were all gone, you eventually left, that little clacking sound still reverberating throughout the hallway as you did. The slip-on shoes you got had begun to form a small heel, not enough to really make your feet crack, but still enough to make a noise. Still, you didn't really bother since the hallway was rather noisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....where to go....?\" you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, as you began making your way to where the cafeteria was as usual, you began to feel....odd. As if sitting in your usual spots would be kind of weird. You weren't sure why, but there was this sense of maybe being somewhere else would be good for now. Heck, since you were playing the role of teacher, perhaps you should eat with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled a bit at the thought of that...but perhaps it wouldn't be so bad. Besides, you had to thank that one teacher for helping you with the sick student.</span></div></div>",

Heading away from the cafeteria you walked into the lounge as saw a few other teachers there enjoying their lunch. As you entered no one paid really any attention to you as they just continued on their way A small problem began to arise, you were quite hungry but you would normally eat at the cafeteria so what was your option? Perhaps there was something in the fridge no one wanted? Opening up the fridge to your surprise you found a back lunch with your name written on it. Grabbing the bag you opened it up and saw a pre-made salad and a vitamin water.....That sounded great! Wait....you hated salad....why did this sound so delicious all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at a small table you began to eat your new lunch which tasted better than any salad you had ever eaten for some reason. Not looking to complain you began to dig in when you heard a voice above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" It was Mrs. Parker the teacher from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure...\" You looked up and smiled not sure what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Mrs. Parker sat down as she began to eat her sandwich as she didn't seem to notice anything odd about you. You noticed she was one of the younger teachers here. She was very small and skinny with dark brown hair cut just below her ears. She wore dark rimmed glasses wore a denim skirt and sweater. \"Definitely the nerd growing up.\" You suddenly thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are your classes today?\" She asked looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad. Last two periods were a bit rough, lots of talkers and distracted kids.\" You said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. Don't worry once you figure them out it gets easier. My advice, if anyone asks if something is going to be on the test you always say yes. Keeps them on edge.\" She said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed back as a sudden high pitched giggle came from your lips. It was undeniably feminine sounding...Covering your lips embarrassed you went back and finished your lunch in a hurry. Standing up turned to leave as you waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later Mrs. Parker.\" You said instinctively not realizing teachers call each other by their first names...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Parker suddenly laughed at your comment. \"Please...Call me Sherri. Also its just Miss now if any of the kids ask. Paul and I split up last summer.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bit bright red as you tried to bounce back. \"My bad...just been a long day. Later Sherri!\" You said as you turned to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to your classroom you felt happy about what just happened. Were...were you making friends with her? You began to wonder. On the way back you noticed your shoes were making a louder clicking noise. The heel was still rising on your shoes and now the fronts had also vanished revealing your toes which now seemed small and dainty with a nice pedicure on them.</span></div></div>",

You still had no explanation for how this was happening, nor why everyone was so okay with you acting like a teacher. It couldn't be an act. It was a heck of an acting job by the school if that was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, something had to be going on, much like what was happening with your clothes. Seeing the growing heel and exposing toes in your shoes was all the more alarming. Heck, you looked completely different from the knees down now, plus there was how different your arms and hands were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then of course that giggle earlier....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, this is so confusing...\" you groaned, not sure what to make of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...there were some positives at least. The students were mostly good, and Sherri was really friendly. Guess you could make it through today and then have things go back to normal tomorrow. Surely the school would have its substitute problem figured out by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that figured, you got back to your classroom, ready for the 5th period of the day. As with before, students slowly began to file in a few minutes later. It was a wonder how repetitive this all was from this angle, not to mention always going over similar class content. Oh well. At that, you actually did write your name on the board so no one would be confused....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Which in turn made you confused for a second. Your name was Casey Tucker no doubt about it....though names like Cassandra or \"Cassie\" for short also shot through your head. In the end, you just settled for Tucker with nothing else. Enough to not have to think on it any longer than you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough...your whole mental process that hid the fact that your chest was beginning to irritate, with even your nipples beginning to enlarge along with the fat underneath.</span></div></div>",

You were a bit surprised by their reaction. It was almost like they knew you already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed this class was much more prepared than the one  before. Maybe it was because this was a junior class compared to the freshman ones before? Either way this made you happy as they were already getting out their homework to be turned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really happy with this class. It was made even easier since their class was watching an educational movie today which meant you got to relax for once all day. You dimmed the lights and turned the movie on. One thing you failed to notice with this class however was more of the boys were looking over to you with rather lusty stares while several of the girls were giving you jealous looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down and watched the movie your shoes continued to change under the desk. The heels rose a bit higher as the final remnants of the shoes melted away save two straps to hold your feet into place. They were fully high heeled sandals now, and very sexy ones to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat your legs were pinched closer together however it wasn't by choice. Your black capris had gotten even shorter coming up past your knees and they had begun to fuse together creating a new skirt for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You found yourself brushing your hair out of your face more and more as well. Your long blonde hair was now past your shoulders in length and kept getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie was over class was getting out as your students began to leave. \"Just one more class....\" You whispered to yourself ready for the day to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your class left you noticed one girl had stayed behind. It was Yesina. She was a hispanic girl and very sexually mature for her age. Most of the boys were always hitting on her. It also didn't help that she dressed as slutty as possible every day. Today she was wearing a black halter top and short jean shorts for example. Tears were running down her face as something was really wrong that she wanted to talk to you about.</span></div></div>",

The seemed to watch you with a very intense look many of them not wanting to take their eyes off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever you would ask a question several of the boys were the first to raise their hands even if they didn't know the correct answer. It seemed they really just wanted your attention. They were quick to crack jokes in hopes of making you laugh as they seemed to ask more questions about your personal interests, However You were careful to always steer the class back to direction. You had the class reach a chapter from their books quietly as you sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down you felt something. Padding....Like a cushion. While you had been teaching your butt had finished changing as it was now a perfectly large and round tear drop shape that complimented your beautiful long legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of you was screaming to wake up and realize what was happening to you. However that voice was quickly drowned out by a few students raising their hands. You walked over to help the students in need as you bent over to show them where to look as you suddenly felt an odd tightness in your chest. You heard a few whispers and chuckles from the male students as you quickly gave them a glance as they went back to reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the nicer female students. Ashley raised her hand next. She wanted to tell you something in private. You trusted Ashley a lot so you had her come up to your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...Miss Tucker. I remember you saying that lost your shirt earlier because of a sick student right?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats right Ashley, what does that have to do with class?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...its just...um....it's kinda noticeable. Thats why the boys are being....well boys.\" she said as her eyes motioned to your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you saw your breasts and it was obvious what she meant. Your nipples were poking through the shirt quite obviously. Blushing a bit red you thanked Ashley as you instructed the class to finish their reading while you used the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up you walked to the restroom as you adjusted yourself and went to the ladies room. Inside you immediately noticed what she was talking about. You had lost your bra earlier and hoped you could go the day without but your girls had other plans. Just one of the many perks of being a busty girl.....wait what? You weren't busty or a girl....right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a new memory entered your mind. You remembered your breasts grew quickly as a teenager. By the time you were 16 they were already DDs. You remembered being an embarrassed girl always wearing sweaters to hide her chest. It wasn't until a teacher, Miss Willis, a very busty woman herself talked to you. She gave you the confidence to be proud in yourself. Since then you have been nothing but proud of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this memory entered your body your chest seemed to react accordingly.Your small but noticeable breasts were pushing out the material of the blouse. They grew larger, rounder, fuller, swelling until they were at least a full DD cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered that lesson from earlier as you smiled knowing just how to handle those boys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back to class your long blonde hair flowed behind you. It was now waist length and perfectly straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into your class room you opened the door with confidence as you looked the all the boys giving you lustful stares. You smiled right back at them with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny boys. I get the joke....Now...for a little pop quiz.\" You said as they suddenly turned to each other worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For extra credit who can tell me the answers to questions 10-15?\" You asked. Smiling only the girls raised their hands. The boys had been too busy making sex jokes about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh....thats a same. Cause anyone who answers these questions correctly also gets to leave early today.\" You said as the girls cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys  sunk their heads realizing their pervy behavior had gotten them totally busted. Just because you were sexy and proud didn't mean anyone could take advantage of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass soon ended as you glared at the boys making sure they watched themselves in the future. Today had been a good today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew him from staff meetings and you two had fostered a friendship since you both started working at the school around the same time. He wore big glasses, hipstery and dressed like that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, you ready?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carpool... unless you found another way home...\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" you exclaimed. \"Sorry, it's just that, there was a lot of excitement today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sherri told me.

Jason. As you walked to the employee parking lot, you felt some discomfort within your blouse. That tank top was starting to re-form into something more suitable to support your ample chest. Something well needed, because your back was starting to hurt. As you approached Jason's car, he opened up the passenger side door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you said as you both climbed into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was wondering...\" Jason started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you wondering?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... well... the homecoming dance is next week and...\" he started, but you cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need a date to the dance?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Getting up you needed to make sure your next class knew your name so you wrote on the board. Miss Tucker. Wait...Why would you write Miss? You were a guy right? Cassie....no....Casey Tucker. For some reason your mind was getting a bit fuzzy as you left Miss Tucker written on the board it just felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your next class came in you had an itch underneath your shirt. Looking around no one was watching as you reached under your shirt and began to scratch the itching area. The itching was coming from nipple area which you could tell yet was looking a little swollen, with your nipples looking much bigger than normal. Thanks to your longer nails you were able to relieve the itching right before your next class began to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next class came in and sat down you got an immediate feeling that this was going to be the trouble making class. Several students were already talking and gossiping while several girls had their phones out and were taking selfies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....not in my class...\" You said feeling a stir of anger. Standing up you grabbed the heavy text book and slammed it loudly against your desk. The loud crashing noise caused the entire class to be silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Students....I am Miss Tucker and I will be teaching your class today. Open your books to chapter four please...\" You said with a strict and firm tone that made the whole class follow your instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the class was reading the chapter out loud you sat back down feeling strangely good....empowered even. You even caught a few of the girls whispering as you threatened to write them up if they didn't be quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait why did you introduce as Miss Tucker? That wasn't correct was it? The fuzzy feeling in your head returned as you ran your long nails through your hair as you noticed something. Not only were they even longer and well manicured now, they were painted a bright Lavender color as if to match your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwhile later As you sat you began to feel a slight breeze on your toes. Looking down you saw the fronts of your shoes had vanished exposing your toes were were painted the same Lavender as your fingernails. What is heck is happening? You began to wonder right as the bell ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your underwear was dividing itself into two distinct sets of clothes, with both bras and panties taking up the space now.

They were quickly headed to C-cup as you desperately tried to push them back in. However they continued to grow pushing out farther until they reached the same 36 DD size that matched the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear now this dress was changing you into a woman.

This was....like magic, and that wasn't a thing right? Yet....you could actually FEEL these things, every little bit of them. Even a little poke sent a shock of electricity through you. Their weight was real, making you lose your balance for a second, and they were very much showing off thanks to the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe....I should lie down....\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that you clearly weren't in the best state of mind now. You were going crazy. Only way to explain growing boobs and suddenly having a closet full of women's clothes. You stumbled back and sat on your bed, trying to calm down and get your head on straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were though, you suddenly heard your phone ringing. Now who could be calling you at this time of night? Couldn't be any of your friends, as they rarely did stuff like that at this time. You picked up your phone, not immediately recognizing the phone number. Perhaps you should ignore it then. However, involuntarily, your thumb happened to press over the answer button, making you swear to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrud, well no choice now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello....\" you said shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there babe,\" spoke a male voice. \"You really for the date tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this guy talking about? What date? And who the heck was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think you.....\" you tried to say. This whole thing had gotten you all bothered now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in half an hour. See you then,\" the male voice said before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was incredibly cryptic. Not helpful in the slightest. What in the world were you to do now? That's what you thought as your eyes looked over the phone in your hands. However, right as you did, there was a tingling there, making you look closer at them. You nearly dropped your phone in surprise, seeing your fingernails growing before your eyes. Your nails that you just cut the other day...growing past your fingertips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop growing!\" you cried out, flexing your hands a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nails kept growing, until they were longer and perfectly manicured if appearances were to be believed. Even your hands felt softer and....wait, your arms felt softer too, with not much muscle to speak of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this was really getting crazy. You just wanted this stupid dream to be over with!</span></div></div>",

Even your hair looked beautifully maintained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, more changes were to come.

It was a nice day out and there were several people walking around, but no one seemed to notice that you were a boy. Some glanced oddly at the overdressed girl, but other than that, it was okay. You rounded the corner and your heel got caught in a crack, and you tumbled to the ground. You started to brush yourself off when someone reached down to help you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any help, miss?\" the person asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and...</span></div></div>",

Picking girls up from bars generally wasn't your style. Not that you were ugly or awkward at all, it just never really interested you that much. However that night you just couldn't resist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday Jacob!\" Everyone shouted at your table as everyone took their shot of tequila. It was your buddy's birthday and you were out with a group of friends celebrating. Normally you tried to keep yourself restrained at the bar but Jacob was buying more shots for everyone and you starting to get pretty tipsy. That's when she noticed you. A really sexy yet strange looking woman across the room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had almost pale white skin, jet black black silky smooth long hair, long jet black nails that looked pointed. She was was wearing a tight black dress dress and heels. She also had black lipstick and eyeliner on. She looked almost like a vampire from a TV show you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you would never go for some gothic looking chick but she was incredibly sexy. Large breasts, long legs and a great figure. Maybe the alcohol gave you the confidence boost you or maybe it was the seductive way she walked over to you but the first two words she spoke to you were ones you will never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sexy....\" she said to you with a lustful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour you talked with her. You learned her name was Beth but she preferred to be called Raven. She even had a tattoo of a Raven on her back which was pretty sexy. The only weird thing was she loved to joke about being a witch a lot. You figured it was part of the whole goth persona she had going on and you were too drunk to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile the moment you hoped for arrived when Raven leaned in and whispered to you. \"Wanna come to my place?\" She said lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much convincing at this point. Within minutes the two of you were in a cab heading to her apartment. Once you arrived you noticed how deep she was into her whole witch lifestyle. There were pentagrams and strange symbols painted on her walls. Candles everywhere and strange old looking books piled up in places. It looked like a movie set for a haunted mansion. Part of you wanted to laugh but that part quickly died off once Raven removed her dress....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bedroom Raven pushed you down into her bed and quickly jumped you tearing off your clothes in a Hurry. Needless to say the sex was amazing. She was very aggressive and wanted to be on top the whole time which didn't bother you. The only thing you thought was weird was how the whole place was lit by candlelight, and stranger the candles seemed to just light on their own when you walked into a room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some amazing sex the two of you laid together. You wanted to say something but didn't want to risk ruining the moment. However that moment came for you when Raven suddenly sat up with a startled look on her face. You were a bit stunned to see the tatoo of the Raven of back was suddenly glowing and moving around her body like it was a moving picture. The tatoo moved to her chest resting above her breasts as she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! Not now!\" She claimed sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" You said sitting up. You were pretty much sober again and what you saw was no trick of the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a warning.... a spell ties to my boyfriend. When it's on my back he is in his own world. When it's on my chest he is coming back here. Listen you have to leave now! He can't see you!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have a boyfriend! Then what the hell was that just now?\" You said ignoring all the weird stuff she also said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you don't understand....it's a long story. Just you have to leave now! He is a powerful demon and if he finds a mortal here, let alone one I slept with he might turn you to ASH!\" She said as the tatoo on her chest began to love again this time the wings of the Raven beginning to flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! There is no time! Listen.....I'm really sorry about this.....\" Raven said as she turned back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly without warning she lunged at you and sunk her teeth into neck and her long nails dug into your back.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming in pain you pushed her off of you. \"What the hell was that you crazy bitch?\" You said feeling your neck. Your eyes suddenly went wide when you realized here was no blood or bite mark....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" You asked jumping up examining yourself in a mirror but not seeing any wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I had to. I just put a curse on you that's about to transform you into a woman. Once you are done changing follow my lead and just do as I say. You are going to be my new friend. This way when he arrives he will won't be able to smell a mortal male he will just smell another female.....\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" You said as you were about to leave when a sudden tingling feeling began to wash over your body....</span></div></div>",

There was a sudden popping sound as your hips began to get wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel something swelling behind you as your butt began to swell with soft feminine tissue raising you slightly off the bed.

You watched in terror and your new breasts began to grow.....A cup....B cup....C cup.....D....cup....Soon they were blocking the view of your body as they finally stopped growing at a huge DD cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were almost complete as the final and most important ones finished. You could feel your manhood beginning to shrink and slither away as you were unable to save it as a new wet and warm slit took its place....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes were to your face and hair. You could hear your voice changes as black hair starting to get in your way. It changed to a jet black color as it began growing longer and longer. It didn't stop growing until it was past your waste and butt down to around your knees. With one last gasp your face reformed with your voice as a sexy new woman lay on the bed where you had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process maybe took 10 minutes but it felt like an eternity to you. Looking over to make matters worse you saw a black corset and mini skirt and heels where your old male clothes had been. Raven tossed you the clothes as she got dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry and get dressed he will be here any second! From this point on you are Eclipse or Ele for short. We are childhood friends from school.\" Raven said as a sudden loud noise suddenly appeared from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a whirlwind as you struggled to get dressed and peer out.

Why are you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?\" you asked and walked to the mirror, and were taken aback by what you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair was in curlers, and piled on your head. Your face was made up, with shiny, pink, plump lips and long eyelashes. You were wearing a pink night gown, and your body was shaved.

The thought that this was an elaborate prank never crossed your mind, which your sisters were thankful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we have much to do today!\" Sarah said. \"First, we have to get those curlers out!\"</span></div></div>",

She had just turned 18 and had snagged the star captain of the basketball team as her date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile technically  twins, you felt like your sister and you had nothing in common anymore. You were a typical nerdy 18 year old guy. You loved video games, movies, computers, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister had turned into a total varsity cheerleader peppy \u201ccool\u201d girl. You hated it, growing up she was always a shy and nerdy girl you liked the same things as you. The two of you played together all the time as kids and were really close. You loved to pull pranks and jokes on each other all the time, getting more and creative each time. However all that changed as you got older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you two were in middle school Puberty hit your sister like a truck. She developed curves, breasts, her hair turned blonde. Boys started to actually notice her and she soaked up the new attention like a sponge. Once she was in high school she only got sexier focusing more and more on her appearance and reputation. She joined the cheerleading team her freshman year and was now their captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had grown up fairly typical with your close group of friends. Many of them had typical crushes on your sister but she brushed them all aside in favor of typical jocks and athletic guys. She barely even spoke to you now unless she needed something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t even plan to go to Prom. You hated these types of shallow dances you wanted a night in with your buddies. However your sister had grown even extra annoying recently. She was obsessed with making sure she looked perfect for the big night. You suspected she was planning to lose her virginity as you found condoms and lube in her purse and she threatened to kill you if you said anything to your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had finally had enough of this....It was time for some pay back. Your inner child was demanding to remind your sister where she comes from. So you began to plan your prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for Emily to go to the bathroom where she was drying her hair and doing her make up. She was going out with her girlfriends tonight and to pick up her prom dress. You grabbed a huge water balloon you had made earlier and a large rubber band normally used to tie down things in truck beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little skill and effort you latched the rubber band to the door knob and rigged up your trap. As soon as she opened the door she would get a huge water balloon in the face! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind your door you watched as Emily opened the door and.......SPLAT! You watched the water balloon launch right at her face hitting her so hard it sent her flying back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing in to the bathroom you began laughing so hard your sides hurt pointing at her until you saw her face....Apparently your balloon had hit her a little too hard. Blood was rushing down her nose and she had a huge bruise on her face....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan you bastard! Look at what you did!\u201d Emily cried out in tears as she was crying and furious at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit bad you felt like you may have taken this one a bit too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...I\u2019m sorry sis....I just wanted to balloon you. I didn\u2019t think it would hit that hard.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy face! My beautiful face! It\u2019s ruined! What I am going to do now!\u201d Emily said crying out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh...I\u2019m sure Derek won\u2019t mind that much....Just use more makeup.\u201d You said a bit sarcastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was about to leap at you in anger when you suddenly saw your mother standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d What did you do?\u201d Your mom Tiffany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan ruined my face! His stupid prank hit me right in the face!\u201d Emily said crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...:I said sorry! She has been acting super bitchy lately I just wanted to teach her a lesson!\u201d You said trying to defend yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey watch the laungage!\u201d Your Mom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do my friends are gonna be here soon! If they see me like this I\u2019m ruined!\u201d Emily said crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm....well Ethan since this is your fault I guess it\u2019s uo to you fix this.\u201d Your Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you expect be to do?\u201d You asked not sure what your mom meant as she looked to you and said. </span></div></div>",

It'll take time to grow back, but at least it'll be over soon.<br>\r\nYou finished your shower and turned off the water. As you got out, you noticed that while you were in, your mom or Emily had left a towel and a robe, both pink, and both Emily's, hanging in the bathroom, along with a note that said to put them on.

Obviously, you wouldn't dare use one of your hands to hold a phone while driving, but thankfully your car had a little compartment for handling that.

Perhaps we should take it easy one of these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably a good idea. She could use a good break!\" </i>Jason said with a little laugh. <i>\"Anyway, back to the reason I called, I just wanted to say traffic might be a little tight. Probably best to use the other route.

You made your detour, avoiding most of the accident. It added a few minutes to your time, but thankfully you knew to give yourself enough time. It wasn't too long afterwards that the news building began to show up. You had your own parking space, which was convenient enough, so you parked there as you usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....hope nothing too strange today,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven being a cameraman required quite a bit of running around at times, plus holding the camera and such.

You had been doing it long enough that you knew exactly what to do to set it up.

This is Tom Harris here,\" the male anchor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Samantha Farmer,\" the female anchor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the normal anchors that the studio always had. Pretty good ones too. They were fairly popular for the area. You did your job, holding camera 2 in place. As they began talking about the news of the day, you looked over to the meteorologist. That was Jeff Sanders, who was a good meteorologist in his own right, but the new weather-girl had been really good of late. The ratings went up when she came around. Oh well, guess you couldn't work around illness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, we go out to Rita Parker, who's live at a 6 car pile-up over at Glendale Terrace,\" Samantha announced. \"Rita, you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes I am Samantha,\"</i> Rita's voice rang out over the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always enjoyed hearing her voice. She did such a good job. You felt like she could go on for greater things within the company. Heck, maybe one of these days you'll find something beyond the camera. You chuckled to yourself at that. As if that would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right at that time, there were some blips on your camera screen. You hummed a bit but didn't panic. Technical problems weren't all that rare, so you adjusted the camera slightly. From what you could tell however, the glitching seemed to be happening just about everywhere in the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that, you felt like a small shock went through you. It wasn't anything big, like getting hit with static electricity from someone. It surprised you more than anything else. However, right afterwards, things seemed to be returning to normal. The anchors acknowledged that there was a little technical problem, but proceeded onwards once everything seemed okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrugged it off and continued doing your job. It was probably just a tiny glitch that passed through and got taken care of.</span></div></div>",

Maybe discover the true artist behind the work.\u201d  The older woman said as she kept the tour guide moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused and looked more at the painting. You noticed the mirror in it and paused as you saw the ornate designs matched the mirror at your place perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you see this?\u201d You said pointing it out to Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....Do you think...This was painted by the last person who had this mirror. As a way to tell what happened to them?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorse....I think it\u2019s a warning. They tried to tell their story before the mirror took their identity completely.\u201d You said looking deeper into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...dude...\u201d Max said pausing as he pointed to your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you saw your fingernails, which had grown l a bit longer this morning were suddenly growing again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse was they were changing color...They turned the same shade of bright pink you saw earlier in the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought at first the changes were only coming at night while you slept. It seemed they were now picking up speed. Or was this a reaction to your investigation?</span></div></div>",

When you realized where this thought was headed however you quickly pulled your hand back and shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere it is, the mirror of Prince Adam.\u201d Max said showing you a mirror that looked strangely exactly like the one in your room. However when you looked into it you saw yourself just as you were...There seemed to be nothing special about this mirror at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see! I know this mirror looked familiar! We must have see this ourselves back when we were kids and just forgotten.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething is different though. I don\u2019t feel anything strange coming from this mirror, it seems normal.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax saw a book next to the mirror which was labeled. \u201cAncient Medieval Legends\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the book Max found the chapter he was looking for and began to read it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Cursed mirror of Prince Adam. This mirror dates back to medieval Europe and Arthurian Legends. The story behind it states that Prince Adam was the most handsome prince his kingdom had ever seen. He was loved by the people and his best friend was the greatest knight in the land. However Prince Adam was vain and when it came time for him to marry he was Promised to Princess Lilith of a neighboring kingdom. While Princess Lilith was by no means ugly her rather plain appearance was considered beneath the high standards of Prince Adam. He rejected her and humiliated her at what was supposed to be their engagement ceremony. Horrified and filled with rage Princess Lilith went to an old and evil witch and asked her for a way to get revenge on Prince Adam. The witch made a deal with her and gifted her a large mirror and said to give it to Adam. The princess took the mirror and sent it to Adam as a gift. Adam took the mirror without question and used it in his vanity to make sure he always looked his best. However one morning when he awoke he saw not himself in the mirror but the image of a beautiful woman, more beautiful than any he had ever seen. Adam became obsessed with this woman and wanted nothing more than to find her. However no one else, not even his best friend the knight could see her, they simply saw themselves. Soon Adam began to change, his body, his clothes, even his castle began to change. At first Adam resisted and enlisted his best friend to help. However the more he resisted the faster he changed...Piece by Piece Adam saw his life fade away unable to stop it before he too was transformed into the woman he saw in the mirror. Prince Adam was no more and Princess Adaline was born. When Lilith saw what she had done to Adam she was filled with reject. She commissioned a counter curse be created in the form of a ring so she could restore Adam but by the time he was completed it was too late...Princess Adaline has fully given in to her new female desires and had no desire to return, for the ring only worked if the wearer truly wished it too. Princess Adaline then went on to marry her protector and former best friend and the two had many children together. Prince Adam got the happy ending he always wanted just not in the way he expected...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...that was chilling and accurate.\u201d You said looking at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think your mirror is the mirror from the story?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes sense...I just don\u2019t understand why. I\u2019ve never been a vain person nor have I rejected anyone like that.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...look here. It says this mirror is an authentic reproduction. The original went missing after the Second World War. The ring said to be the original counter curse ring is currently being displayed at the London Museum.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the only potential lead we have is a ring in another continent?\u201d You said feeling hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t give up just like that? You remember when I broke my leg mountain biking? They said I may never walk right again. You showed up every day for 6 months and forced me to go walking until I healed properly. I\u2019m not willing to give up on you!\u201d Max said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s words really helped pick up your spirts as you felt a bit better as you nodded.

Enjoy your last day as a male tomorrow, the final changes are by far the most painful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways and Forever- S.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished reading the letter anger began boil over as you crumpled up the note and threw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo someone is doing this to you....but who?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea!

I\u2019m not some rich playboy burning through women like that fairy tail prince!\u201d You said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt said dear traitor...Did you abandon anybody or turn your back on something important?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m ever aware of?

Your new breasts, while small were also quite sensitive and you found it difficult to stop poking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours you and Max had a small list of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo here is a list of people we know with the initials S.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Sarah Paulson, she was in our high school graduation class. Although neither of really even spoke to her. There is Sandy Perkins, the friend of your last ex-girlfriend Madison. You said you only met her like twice. Lastly there is Sandra Penderson, your old college history teacher who you had a crush on. However you said you never really mentioned that to her or did anything about it...\u201d Max finished going over the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens of others but they were ruled out as never having any connection to either of you. These were the only three women in your life you could even somewhat remember with those initials that had any relevance to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly man I\u2019m not sure about any these. You haven\u2019t spoken to any of these women in years and you barely knew them.

Really awkward and nerdy girl, full of acne and big glasses, overweight with thick dark curly hair. Honestly you always remembered her getting teased and picked on. Not that you did any yourself but you never tried to stop it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard she was working as a secretary for a law office nearby so you went to check it out. You get incredibly awkward going out like this but if it was any consolation with your new body nobody would recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the law office you went up to the counter and saw a stunningly beautiful woman. She had massive breasts that were obviously fake, she had long dark hair past her waist and a total hourglass figure.

Both Sandy and Sarah have gone through massive body transformations but their personalities had changed drastically. Sarah used to be bright and inquisitive and now was dull and uncaring. Sandy was full of laughter and acceptance but was now rude and short.\u201d You said looking back to Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think the same is for your former professor Sandra?\u201d Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope not...Sandra was smart, really well versed in world events and already cute.

Then she began to...uh...change. She started changing in ways that the university felt was inappropriate for a professor and when it finally reached a certain level she was let go...If you want to find her head downtown...To the Velvet Room\u201d The secretary whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name sounded familiar for some reason as you and Max thanked her and took off downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does that name sound familiar?\u201d Max asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up downtown both of your eyes went wide as you remembered the Velvet Room....It was a strip club. You came here on your 21st birthday with Max and college buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...\u201d You said going inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer gave you a weird stare as you tried to ignore it In looking for Sandra and to your dismay you found her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went by Cherry now. Her fiery red hair flowing around her body as she twirled on stage wearing nothing but a string bikini. Her body looked almost cartoonishly over the top. Huge fake looking breasts, tanned olive skin, and massive wide hips. She looked almost nothing like your old professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking to her was even worse. She didn\u2019t remember you, the mirror or worse even being a professor. In fact her memory was totally shot outside of the most simple things. Her entire mind seemed solely focused on getting good tips and looking good....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the club it was as you feared. She had suffered the worst fate of all. Sandra was sharp and witty and now dumb and forgetful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to these women?\u201d Max asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...whatever it is they didn\u2019t deserve it....Maybe I did do something? What if I deserve this?\u201d You asked him tears in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t say that! You are a good man, whoever is responsible for this will pay I promise you that!\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a bit before suddenly clutching your chest. It felt like it was burning as your breasts began to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...please...no\u201d You cried out in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts however didn\u2019t listen as they began to rapidly expand and grow right in front of you. They quickly surged one cup size large, than another, than another, they didn\u2019t stop until they looked just like the woman\u2019s You first saw in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...look at these things.\u201d You said cupping your now large and heavy breasts. They had to be at least E cups now.

Your furniture and decor now looked exactly like what you would imagine a girl that looked like you would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a new purse on the counter with a new Passport and ID in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonya Edwards...\u201d All the names said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening....it\u2019s like my old self was just erased from existence...\u201d you said panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized those dreams were a lie...The warmth and comfort you felt was just to distract you from what was actually happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse there was one new HUGE problem....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mirror was Gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone...Vanished...No longer around...It was like it was never here to begin with...</span></div></div>",

This time you didn\u2019t catch or correct yourself however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting seating Max started to notice small little changes in your behavior. The first thing he noticed was how you were crossing your legs and sitting in a much more feminine manner. Before it had been rather awkward since you didn\u2019t really know how to behave socially as a woman with such sexual body type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing Max started to notice was you had started to look at other women, however it was not in any sort of sexual way...It was like you had started comparing yourself to them. You would see the glances they gave you and either smirk or smile back. It was like you could sense their jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waiter arrived to take your order he picked up on your American accents and began to ask you about your visit and time in London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Max was playing it cool trying to say we were just boring visitors leaving ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were asked about yourself you of course didn\u2019t have much of an answer.

I\u2019m a model, mostly swimsuits and lingerie.\u201d You said without much of a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I can certainly see that.\u201d The waiter replied with an almost creepy stare. He then took your orders as you sat there embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Max asked looking back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...it just sorta slipped out...\u201d You said rubbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen we can head back to the room and relax. I can even leave if that will improve your situation.\u201d Max offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

It was getting harder and harder to think of anything but sex. Every time your mind wandered it went to a dirty place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you decided to just sit down and watch some TV to try and focus on anything else. It was obvious Max was trying his best to behave and be a gentleman but you were not making this easy on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the news was boring enough you both decided so you turned it on and tried to zone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was it was too boring. You found yourself cuddling up closer and closer to Max. Your hands slowly drifting to his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! How about a movie!\u201d Max said trying to cool down. Flipped the channel to an exciting action movie filled with car chases and explosions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to be good. You tried to watch it and zone out. You wanted nothing more than to forget these urges but they only continued to get stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you couldn\u2019t take it anymore....Your body felt like it was burning. The desire for release was too strong to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly you turned the TV off and stared into Max\u2019s eyes. He was sweating and trying his best not to stare but it was obvious how much he wanted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf tonight is going to be my last night as a woman. Then I want it to be one to remember.\u201d You said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your barriers and walls trying to keep yourself in check had fallen away. You speaking purely from the heart at this point and you were tired of the games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching behind yourself your hands slowly began to unzip your dress as you slowly began to slide it off your body. It clung to you almost like a second skin so you had to peel it off slowly sliding it down off one leg at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTonya...I mean...Tony...Wait...\u201d Max tried to say even surprised he slipped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh....\u201d You said slowly as you let your dress fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in the lacy lingerie you had on as a smile creeped up your lips. Your hands moved behind you slowly unhooking your bra as you let it fall to the ground exposing your large and beautiful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then slid your thong down slowly letting it fall to your ankles as you kicked it off slowly. Lastly you stepped out of your heels standing bare nude before Max who stared you gaping mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing...You simply gave him a seductive smile and a small wink as you turned around and headed into the bedroom. </span></div></div>",

You were greeted by an old man with white hair and a big bushy mustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, you must be Mr. Pratford! I must admit when I got your call I was truly surprised. To have the son of such a donator visit us is such an honor!\u201d He said shaking Max\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBradford! That wasn\u2019t Max\u2019s last name....what\u2019s going on here?\u201d You wondered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked inside the museum you Max leaned in to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I had to pull out the big guns to make this happen. My actual Birth Name is Maximilian Thomas Pratford. My father is William Bradford, we really don\u2019t talk anymore so I use my middle name as my last name.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamuel Pratford....Wait...Sam Pratford the media giant?\u201d You asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...the same.\u201d Max sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Bradford was a media mogul who owned TV channels and magazines. Everything from travel to fashion. His content is considered high class and privileged and used by the rich as an example of how to live lavishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...but...we met in a public high school?\u201d You asked a bit stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I never told you. I\u2019ve lived with my mom all my life, she wanted me to have a normal life. Honestly I hate my father. Every time we have met all he cares about is securing me as his heir and finding me a perfect trophy wife and taking over his empire. I\u2019ve tried my whole life to avoid him and just to live a normal life.\u201d Max replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all shocking information to you. You had no idea Max was related to someone so rich and powerful. It did explain how he was never short on cash and how he always seems to brush off everyday costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Museum guide brought you both to the display as your mouth almost dropped open. There it was...Not only the ring in a glass case, but the mirror as well! They were just hanging out like normal as if they had always been here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou requested to see the ring correct sir? Normally we never remove it from its casing but with the donation you generously made to our foundation we can allow you some time with it.\u201d He said grabbing the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guide opened up the case and took out the pillow with the ring on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ring is made of pure gold. The etchings on the side are related to the ancient mirror curse as legend says.\u201d The guide said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, can I please have some time alone with my girlfriend please.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bit hearing Max call you his girlfriend but you guessed it was for appearance sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax took the ring off the pillow and handed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you want this right? Remember the legend says it won\u2019t work unless you want it to.\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes....I want to be the real me again.\u201d You said sliding on the ring...</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve looked out for your best interests. Your mother may have stolen you from me as a child but I have always paved a path for your future. The time had come for you to finally settle down and get married and become my heir. Take your rightful place in my company.\u201d Samuel explained as he suddenly coughed into a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I wanted nothing more with your company! It\u2019s all about greed and wealth! There is no soul or care for common people in your company!\u201d Max shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy son you are so much more than common. Our family has always been better than the dregs who work themselves to death 8 hours a day.\u201d Samuel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me...You still haven\u2019t explained what Tony has to do with this?\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to be happy. I want to you marry the perfect woman. It became obvious that the only kind of woman you would love is one just like your best friend here so I made arrangements to make that happen. After you betrayed me and dumped your last girlfriend I had to take measures into my own hands...\u201d Samuel said coughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words suddenly rung deep into your ears....Betrayed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes suddenly shot wide open....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamuel Pratford....You are S.P.!\u201d You called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...Now you understand. That note was never for you...It was for Max. You are simply the object here, a tool.\u201d Samuel said laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor years I\u2019ve been trying to secure Max a wife so that our bloodline may continue and my company future is secured. I made efforts to try and set him up with several woman however all of them turned out to be failures...The curse turned them all into mindless bimbos.\u201d Samuel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther girls...You mean you sent the mirror to those other girls? The ones I knew?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...they were my lab rats. Simple testing subjects for the mirror itself. However it had unintended side effects on each of them. It wasn\u2019t until I delved deep into the history of the mirror did I learn the truth. The mirror needed a different kind of subject to work properly.\u201d Samuel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were boiling with anger at this point but you needed to hear the rest of his story so you stayed silent for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mirror worked perfectly on you just as I had hoped. Your deep emotional connection to him amplified the curse turning you into the exact kind of perfect woman he truly desires. Yet you remained yourself, your deep bond of friendship remained and in time it blossomed into something more.\u201d Samuel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the whole point of the mirror was the get me to fall for Tony and marry him once he was a woman? Then you hoped I would rejoin you?\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy plans for you are still in motion my son. I simply needed you both here to ensure my plan was a success.\u201d Samuel said still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you are too late this whole thing was a failure! We got the ring...it\u2019s over! Tony is male again!\u201d Max shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he though? Perhaps you wouldn\u2019t think that now if you had actually read the full story in the legend. Fortunately for me I made sure to remove this specific page from the book you read ahead of time.\u201d Samuel said as he held up a rolled up piece of parchment and tossed it to his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to feel dread inside. This couldn\u2019t be good...The ring was also refusing to come off you at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax read the parchment as he looked up to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou son of a bitch! How could you? Where is it?\u201d He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other ring...\u201d Samuel said holding up his hand to show was wearing another ring. Similar to the one you had on but this was made of bright silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe story said that the witch made two rings. The golden ring amplified the curse and the silver removed it. The princess in her anger gave the prince the gold ring in hopes he beg for forgiveness and she would use the silver to save him. When the cursed prince put on the gold ring at first he returned back to normal. However when he didn\u2019t beg he returned back to his female form but even sexier and more beautiful than before. The princess later tried to return him back with the silver ring but witch never mentioned that the silver ring only worked at the time of transformation...When she returned later it was too late. The prince was gone forever...\u201d Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...\u201d You said gulping as you looked down to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt an all too familiar pain as your shoes were vanishing as heels were taking their place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe choice is yours Max...Agree to come back to my company and I will save her from becoming one of those mindless bimbos.

It was practically silver now but it shined brightly and even gave off an almost shining glow when it touched the sunlight. It was longer now too, reaching past your hips and touching the back of your knees. It was also flowing and perfectly straight and seemed to have an almost unnatural flow to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts were still very large and pronounced, but now they were even perkier and perfectly rounded. They had no sag anymore whatsoever. Your legs were long and well toned and your hips wide. Your had a perfect hourglass shape and perfectly curved body. Your skin was flawless and perfectly tanned as your female features had been refined into perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes had changed as well. They were similar to before but just a bit different. You were now wearing a bright white mini dress with matching heels.

Neither of them seemed to show any sort of reaction or magic anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll my life was spent securing my future and heirs and I never really lived a life of my own. You can hate you forever son but at least I can die happy knowing you two can actually have a future together...\u201d Samuel said as with one last summon of strength he hurled the rings into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror soon cracked as it began to splinter and break apart as the metal rings rolled onto the ground. Their lights fading away as the magic within them vanished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel the collapsed as Max rushed over to assist his father.

Any attempts to discard or destroy the light will only result in it returning to its owner\u2019s position.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like you were stuck with it for now...At least you could hide it away in your room for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving back home you set on the light on the counter for now. You went to the fridge to get a drink as you heard your brother Triston come downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriston was 16 and always seemed to find a way to annoy you. He was Always trying to borrow your car but never putting gas into it. Always talking about girls even though he was just a skinny guy who never had a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey where did you run off to? Is this all you bought? What a weird looking flashlight. Where they all out of guy colors?\u201d He said waving the flashlight around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost spit out your water as you saw him waving it around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey....Don\u2019t mess with that! Give it Here!\u201d You said reaching it as Triston pulled it away from you teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Something wrong with it? It\u2019s just a light dummy....See?\u201d Triston said turning the light on as he pointed it at....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Life unfortunately has a really cruel sense of irony sometimes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to believe she had been here a year now.

Large B or small C cups. However it was clear that if you wanted to bring home the big bucks large jugs were the easiest way to increase tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Liz was stuck still paying off these giant DDs to repay the loan she got from her own boss to get them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first started Liz thought her natural skills in dance and singing would be enough, but it seemed most men preferred girls with what her boss Tommy called \u201cThe WOW Factor!\u201d Which was code for looking as slutty as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz wanted nothing more than to escape and run away. She felt trapped in her job. Trapped in her body. Just trapped in life.

She didn't think much of it at the time, apart from possible rabies, and the wound healed up, but a month later, during the full moon, she suffered her first transformation, blacking out and waking up in torn clothing the next morning. Rumors of a dog on the loose and Jessica having researched into the occult for an assignment she was working on, led her to piece together what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdrew after that, cutting out all extra-circulars, and mostly keeping to herself.

You two met in high school, and started dating right before college. You went to the same one, and for the past two years had been begging her parents to use the cabin. They didn't trust Carrie and you alone, because they feared underage drinking, or worse, the two of you having sex. Of course the underage drinking thing made no sense anymore, now that you were both 21, so they conceded and you were driving up there with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Noah, remember the turn is coming up, it's tricky to see if you aren't paying attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm a man, remember? I know how to drive.\" you said as you turned and drove to the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in and she gave you the grand tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first floor is just the kitchen, laundry room, living room, den, that stuff. Upstairs is mostly my closet. I used to be a clothes hoarder, so I have clothes from two or three years ago stocked upstairs.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't kidding. Three entire rooms were just closet space. And then there were the two bedrooms, one with a bathroom attached and the other without. Since you were alone, you got the master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's unpack!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started unpacking, as Carrie emptied out a full suitcase of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're only here for a weekend, not a summer. Why so much clothes?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in case.\" she said. \"What did you bring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have my pants.\" you said pointing to the pants you were wearing. \"I have two shirts, three pairs of underwear and a few pairs of socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to pack more than that, what if you ruin those pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to to ruin them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we haven't touched the cabin since last summer, would you mind helping me clean downstairs?

When she was in high school when you were in elementary school, so now that you're in high school, she was living on her own, with her childhood room relegated to storage of her old stuff, and whatever else your parents needed storage for. You and Julie had always been close, even despite the age difference. Whenever you needed a babysitter, she was always there. Sometimes you missed her, because you only saw her for holidays and some birthdays, but not that often. You usually just passed her room with no thought about it, went in there to put coats in there when you cleaned, but other than that, it just sat there, a relic of your sister's childhood. Until now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" your mother shouted. \"Can you move the folding table into Julie's room? We don't need it and I want it where we can get to it next time we need it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Ma!\" you shouted back, grabbing the table and moving it up the stairs into Julie's room. You leaned it against the wall and looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her desk, that used to house her computer, her shelves, still covered with her old stuffed animals, her bed, that still had her red sheets on it. You smiled, remembering waking her up on Christmas morning before waking your parents. The thought of Christmas in this summer heat was welcomed. You left the room and resumed your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you lay in bed, unable to fall asleep. You suddenly hear a crash, coming from Julie's room. You immediately get up and run to her room. You see the table laying flat on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just the table...\" you said, getting drowsier. You walked over to Julie's bed and lay down. You woke up when sun peeked through the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you thought. \"Right...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the clock, 5 a.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, no one saw me in here.\" you thought, walking back to your room and falling asleep in your bed until your alarm went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, you sat in your room, bored, as you went on social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should do something productive...\" you said. \"Oh!

You continued reading, seeing her talk about how her favorite present from that birthday was a bottle of sparkly blue nail polish, a color that you remember her wearing quite often on her nails.

Who's clothes you're currently wearing? You shake your head, but dammit the boyfriend doesn't notice, he's already looking towards a discarded motor magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather a bit of courage. The boyfriend and the entrance are behind you, the doors to the toilets are in front of you on the back wall, machines cover most of the other walls. You take a few steps forward, knock quickly on the toilet door, then sidestep towards the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt works, someone comes out of the door, and their first words are a terse. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense. \"Ummm, what do you mean?\" the voice of the boyfriend speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd speak to you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just in the area and thought I'd have a chance to talk to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here? Why do you think that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly see an emotional situation coming as their voices are raised. Moving back towards them isn't an option, but you quickly decide to step forward into the toilets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe its the confusion, your tension, or because you were fixated on the idea a second ago, but you accidentally walk into the ladies washroom. Lack of urinals give it away, but its really the open purse and makeup bag by the sink that confirms it. The woman was probably in the middle of fixing her makeup when you knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couples voices continue building up and you don't want to risk going outside. Your wet clothes are getting to you so you dab yourself down with some paper towels. Getting more adventurous, you try the hot air hand dryers, moving around so that the hot air hits various parts of your body. It tickles your bra and panties in a weird way, and it's a strange sensation getting  blast of hot air through a miniskirt. Drying your hair is a challenge, but you find a hairbrush in the womans purse, and you brush out various strands under the dryer. It all works surprisingly well and after a few minutes you look yourself in the mirror to find... oh yeah, you're still wearing a pink shouldertop and miniskirt, and your hair is now puffed up with volume and you've somehow accidentally styled it so it still flows over one eye. How did you get something so stylish by accident? It could work though... turn your head the right way and the hair could block views of your face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you're dry though, except of course for your shoes and socks. You can feel the squelsh when you walk and know there's no fast way to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that's not your major concern, because now that the hand dryer is silent you've realised the outside room is too. You wait a few more minutes. It's tempting not to go outside, but you realise someone could walk in and see you here. Finally, you build up the courage and go out the bathroom door.</span></div></div>",

Are you really ready to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou root through the woman's belongings and lay the cosmetics out on the table. Look, just enough so that even if you are recognised as a guy, no one will know who you are, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you take the lipstick, and gently apply it, leaning in towards the bathroom mirror to see the effect. It's deep red and your lips already seem more full. You come across cream foundation, and thankfully remember that you're meant to start with this... Applying the base, you keep going. Eyeshadow, mascara, damn, how do you do eyeliner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get nervous, not sure what part to put next and how, but thankfully you remember bits and pieces of how its meant to go. Your first attempt seems awkward. You apply some makeup remover to a paper towel and wipe it off. You've a second attempt, and a third. Dammit, it somehow just doesn't look right. Frustrated, you rush over doing the part of the makeup, and find it even looks better. Ah, maybe that's it, you were just overdoing it. Onto 4th and 5th attempt, you're getting into it now. Realising, that small changes and delicate touches can make a surprising amount of difference. Sixth and seventh and you're getting into it, your hands are a bit more used to the movements, and you find yourself playing around with the effects. (Part of you appreciates the surreality of the situation, a couple having a tense dramatic moment, while you're in here busily using the woman's makeup to get past them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this stage, you're more attuned to all the little problems you have with the makeup, but taking a step back, it doesn't look bad. At some point, you'd stopped thinking of it as your face, and more a woman's face you just wanted to get right. That was probably a good sign. The right amount of blush, eyeshadow, mascara, and plenty of vibrant red lipstick. It somehow drew the attention to your lips, and with the way your hair accented and framed your face, it somehow made your whole face look alluring, much less chance of being recognised now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked good, now only if you could find some... you root through the purse and find a stylish pair of clip on earrings. Bingo! You put them on and they work well with the outfit, though one is partially obscured by your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the cosmetics that are now far more used up than when you started. Hoping she won't mind too much (you know, like with the earring and clothes), you put them all back where you remember finding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning again to the door, you get ready and...</span></div></div>",

You feel a bit self conscious as you face him, still tasting the lipstick and almost even seeing the mascara on your eyelashes, but the look he gives you is one you haven't received before. Enthusastic, enamoured, hanging on your very next word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance back at the way you came, worried that the one you'd stolen these clothes (and makeup) would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh her?\" he asks, only semi-misinterpreting your glance. \"Oh... well, she and I... we're kinda on a break right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at him with a disbelieving \"that's really your story?\" expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, um, so... can we walk while we talk about this?\" You decide that moving away from the (ex?) girlfriend is in both your interests, and you both start pacing down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, um... look... it's over... she might think... look, you saw us in there, there's no passion, no care. It's a struggle to be with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, relationship drama, just what you didn't need. You don't mask your expression over it, but since you're both walking forward you don't expect him to be paying attention to it. Why was he so caught up about it? Either stay with her or break up, agonising over this middle ground doesn't help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually you know what? We're breaking up. I'm breaking up with her, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn surprise you look over to him. Sure enough he takes out his phone and starts hammering away at the virtual keyboard. He seems to struggle, type, delete, explain, delete, finally he gets something he's satisfied with and shows the phone to you, you stop walking to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail end of the conversation log with \"Marcy\" has some messages, \"I still don't understand.\" - \"That's the problem, you should!\" - \"Well just tell me what it is.\" - \"I'm sick of texting. Talk to me if you want to know, or care.\" Under that is his unsent text \"I'm breaking up with you. It's not working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you wonder what it would be like to receive such a message. Probably would hurt, but probably better than some cheesy justifications or attempts to imply it wasn't a bad thing or the weak \"we can still be friends\". The \"ripping off the bandage\" approach does have some merit you consider as you nod. Still, you weren't sure he'd actually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches his thumb over and taps the send icon \"And... send!\". It shows up on the conversation log, no \"undo\" or \"delete\" seems supported, just a regular text message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at him in surprise, and slight guilt: Had you caused this? This woman who you'd literally only passed by in a washing room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know its bad to break up in text... but you saw what happens when we talk. It always becomes about something else.\" He puts away the phone, \"Look, lets just go somewhere. It doesn't have to be like a date or anything, just try to have some fun. If you bump into some guy, go with him; if you meet up with friends, I'll just slink away. You probably have a boyfriend anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, then realise you might be giving the wrong idea, then shake it harder to imply you're not keen on the whole proposition. You weren't planning to go anywhere tonight. You've got a pink shirt, miniskirt, styled hair and makeup, but weren't planning to show it all to anybody, in fact, you were planning to show it to as few people as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems to sense he's losing grip on this conversation, \"Look, <i>La Shay</i> is just around the corner, why don't we head there and I buy you a drink? No more relationship talk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and just turn and walk on. He seems to follow you, but then increases his pace so he's now beside you. You don't know what his deal is but figure you'll let him do this at least a little distance. Maybe he's still dealing with the breakup.... damn, the breakup. The guilt hits you again. You were walking her clothes and makeup, all stolen, and now seem to have made her boyfriend break up with her! What could she be going through? You look over towards the (ex) boyfriend, and see he's looking at a text he just got, probably her reaction. You hoped he'd reply with something that would make her feel better but probably nothing would. Damn, how did you get into this situation?</span></div></div>",

After a moment of uncertainty and stumbling, you manage to get upright again with his help without falling over. The embrace seems to last a moment longer than needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, I'm not used to sweeping a lady off her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of the sudden fall, and the fact you suddenly felt a stranger's touch around you throws you off for a second. Fortunately, he leads you to a booth seat and you sit down into the soft seat fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits right next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given that you've just almost fallen over, this is probably not a good suggestion but.... do you want a drink?\"</span></div></div>",

You follow him onto the floor, when suddenly he turns towards you and takes your hand. \"Okay, lets go!\" With enthusiasm, he spins you around, a move you barely keep up with in the heels. He pulls you close, then far, then close, than far. Just then the music changes and suddenly the dance floor is a lot more crowded, you feel pushed in.\"I love this song\" he yells. You try to move away, but an overly energetic couple threaten to accidentally hit you, you move back to him, and then the beat drops!</span></div></div>",

Leaning against the support rail, you try to absorb the minutes of intense conversation. One thing seems clear, you need to be near Brad, or specifically Brad's phone, sometime in the next hour or two. What are your options?</span></div></div>",

As this happens you hear the store windows being automatically locked and covered with metal. Then you remember that it will be about a week before anyone helps because of them being on winter break. But as you stumble around a wood table collides with you and you feel a warm sensation on the front of the pants. Then you feel it drizzle down and then a feeling of lumps come in the back of your pants. A loud *CLICK* is heard as the whole store shuts down and locks for the next two weeks. Your jeans feel rather warm and you realize that you had gone to the bathroom in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this realization dawns on you another thought comes to the warmness in the back of your pants. You realize that it was you pooping yourself. Not wanting to get an even more embarrassing outfit you think of a plan to escapes. The jeans start to feel rather snug and so do the panties. Your shirt also feels rather nice and you look down and see that the jeans and shirt have even more bedazzle then thought. They had pink all over and you noticed that some clothes had got in your shirts bra and it made you look rather female. The bulge in the back of your pants from your accident makes you look even more female. One escape plan comes to mind but it is risky. Your idea is to get into the clothes main room and act as one of the clothes but that room houses the most girly teenage girl clothes ever. The clothes machine could mistake you for a mannequin and force some clothes on to you or you could wait to think of a better idea.</span></div></div>",

It was painted in a pastel pink color and read 'Mrs. Jennings Lovely Girls Daycare'. Upon entering through the only open door, the inside was painted in a similar pink hue along with shade of lavender and white. The entrance area was small to allow maximum space for the girls to stay in.

You reached for your phone to try and call help but the robotic arm quickly took it away. \"Miss Brandy, do not worry you are safe in Mrs. Jennings Lovely Girls Daycare\", the machine spat, believing you were just confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I don't want to be here!\" You were clearly in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie found this all pretty amusing and finally said, \"Don't worry 'Brandy', I'm sure it will realize it is a mistake an let you out and if not, at least you can have fun playing with me and my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not amused but, conceited there was not much you could do at the moment.

You were visiting the college you were about to attend with your mom when drunk driver blew the stop light as you were crossing the street. The impact was the car was so severe it knocked you out instantly. You felt nothing and remembered almost nothing before it happened as it was so fast....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie....Charlie....Charlie....can you hear me?\" A strange voice called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes slowly you looked up as a blinding white light burned your eyes. Slowly your eyes adjusted as you awoke to find yourself sitting in a hospital bed. There was a female doctor standing over you and your mother was beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie can you hear me?\" The doctor said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....yeah....where am I?\" You said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in he hospital. You have been here almost a month. You were in a car accident do you remember?\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind ached. You could barely remember it but you could remember crossing the street before something hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely....am I okay?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a nervous look on your Mom's face as she looked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....You are going to make a full recovery. Thanks to modern medicine and a special new drug called XX-E.V.E. However....there are going to be some side effects. I need you not to panic and listen....slowly pulled down your bed sheet.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying doctor?\" Listening you slowly pulled down your bed sheet. You were naked underneath as you pulled down the sheets until you saw it....or well....lack of it....Your penis was gone! Instead in his place was a hairless and very female vagina....The rest of you looked normal expect the thing that made you a male....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell where is it?\" You cried out! As the doctor turned up your IV to calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Charlie, but XX is a new and experimental drug. It helped rebuild all your broken nerves without it you would have been paralyzed. However it is still....well....rebuilding. The drug has a template in it. Taken from a host source. We made sure to use a source with a host your age, but it is still changing you at the DNA level. Turning you....well female....to match the host source.  By our accounts it will take another week, two at the most to fully change you.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe your ears. It was like you were in a nightmare. \"What was the template at least? What kind of girl am I turning into?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor pulled out her tablet as she showed you a picture as you were a bit stunned. It was a tall, busty, really good looking blonde girl.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://m.imgur.com/fTYa68C?r\" target=\"_blank\">http://m.imgur.com/fTYa68C?r</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5'9, D cup breasts, 110lbs. Natural flexibility and athletic nature. You could do a lot worse, hell most girls would kill to look like that.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point! I never asked for this? What am I supposed to do about school and my life now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie all has been taken care of. Tomorrow we are moving you into your new dorm....it's a female dorm. You have been giving a special roommate who is going to help teach you all the things you need to know about being female. Classes don't start for another couple weeks so you have time to adjust before starting school.\" Your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like you were stuck, little choice now but to go along with his for now.</span></div></div>",

It felt like there was an absence. You found yourself checking your appearance in the mirror every few minutes to see if something had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dressing you had to have one final meeting with the doctor with your mom before you left. You just hoped they were going to tell you this was all some big joke....or at least there was a cure available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the office the Doctor had a worried look on her face. After you and your mom sat down she let out a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Charlie, it appears there has been a mistake. It appears a different sample was taken when XX was given to you. We thought we had picked a similar age  caucasian girl to best fit your DNA but apparently there was a different match.\" The doctor said turning her tablet over and showing you this picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20150413/asian_girls_20.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20150413/asi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some hot busty Asian girl?\" You asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japanese to be more accurate. Same age but different body make up. This one is only 5'1, 105lbs, 36 DD cups.\" The Doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to change my race as well? Anything else?\" You said is dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...with a new race you may experience certain things. You may notice a change in taste buds and cravings for different food. Your accent may also change but we won't know for certain until we start seeing more changes.\" The Doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just great. The other girl at least could have passed as your got cousin or sister. Now it was going to be a total change. Long black hair in stead of your shirt honey blonde. Much shorter rather than just a bit shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the changes? Will I feel them or do they happen while I sleep?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately none of the changes happen while you sleep. That's when the nanobots inside you recharg. The changes will happen fairly randomly during parts of the day. It will start off a light tingling sensation than esculate into a rather intense feeling. Make sure you find a private place whenever they happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings just got better and better for you it seemed. You were quiet the whole car ride home. Once home after a small ceremony where your family celebrated your return home you decided to finish packing in your room alone. Part of you wanted to examine your new female parts while the other refused to even acknowledge it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside you let out a deep sigh knowing your life was about to change drastically.

Learning that you survived a car accident was one thing, but learning that the only reason you even survived was due to some experimental nanobot drug thing? And that same thing was going to make you a girl in return? It was too much for one person to handle honestly. The fact that the doctor even had the initial results wrong seemed like insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you were doing so, a tingling feeling began to spread across your scalp, alarming you instantly. This had to be what the doctor was talking about. Putting aside some of the stuff you were packing, you ran over to the bathroom that was connected to your bedroom. Turning the light on, you felt the tingling feeling slowly begin to build, becoming more intense as you were told. It was like something being pushed to the surface, probably because of the nanobots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, as you felt it reach a certain point, you cringed as you felt your hair slowly being pushed out of your scalp, beginning to flow down your hair as certain strands began to straighten out a bit, enough to cover your ears at least. While there wasn't too much of a change in shade, a closer look at the roots did show the beginnings of a much darker color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you walked back out of the bathroom, seeing the sun set outside. Guess this was reality, as cruel as it was. How were you supposed to handle this? And what about your family for that matter? The nature of the person you were becoming had to be quite alarming to them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you were called down for dinner, joining your mother, father, and sister in the dining room. Your sis, being around 13 years old, was rather inquisitive about what was happening, though your parents tried to help by downplaying it. They were staying supportive at least, which made you feel a bit better at least. It didn't stop your sister from being super curious though. She wasn't mean-spirited about it though, like you might have expected her to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, dinner was uneventful from there, other than your mom saying that you'd leave for the dorm first thing tomorrow morning. You nodded in affirmation, having packed most of your stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are you really going to be different?\" your sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess on the outside at least,\" you said, trying to perhaps believe it yourself that that would be all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she nodded a bit. \"Well...don't stay away too long. Won't be the same without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis,\" you smiled as you shared a brief hug with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving felt a little better with your family behind you, you changed into your pajamas and got to bed a bit later. The change in your plumbing down below still wasn't helping with how weird it felt, though your underwear didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh....this is going to be a pain,\" you groaned as you finally went to sleep, closing the book on this day.</span></div></div>",

You could just imagine how they were going to treat you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember dear, your roommate was chosen for you specifically. She is supposed to be a very nice girl who is going to help you adjust to your growing womanhood. The other girls in the dorm were informed of your condition as well so hopefully they all treat you nicely and with respect.\" Your mom said on the car ride over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we will see....why am I leaving all my clothes behind?\" You asked. You were wearing gym shorts and a t shirt with flip flops. Almost all your clothes were left behind at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because silly your body is changing every day...you will need new clothes shortly. Your roommate can help you pick out ones that fit you and look good as you change. So that's why only your gym clothes and PJs are with you now.\" Your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated this, you suddenly imagined yourself wearing a thong and bra as you.....There was a slight pause as that thought caused a strange and weird new sensation to happen between your legs. A strange stirring sensation of heat and tingling feeling....Shaking those thoughts out quickly you thought about anything else as you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finally arrived at the dorm you went up to your room as you walked in seeing this dorm and building was female only. You got several stares from girls as you walked to your room and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your dorm you saw a quite pretty girl setting up things and putting clothes away. She was white with brunette hair, about 5'6 with medium sized breasts and a nice figure. Turning around she smiled at you suddenly rushed over and gave you a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit surprised at her reaction and a bit uncomfortable as you felt her breasts pushing into your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there I'm Mandy! You must be Charlie! listen I'm really excited about helping you through this transformation stage in your life. I'm super excited to help you become a woman!\" She said with a really preppy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....they picked a total preppy girl for me....\" You thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you brought your things inside and started to unpack a few minutes went by as you suddenly felt a family tingling in your scalp as you started to itch your hair as you realized another change was coming....</span></div></div>",

You had a thought of trying to find a place to hide, but then again, if this girl was intended to be your coach for the next couple of weeks, then she'd probably get to see it eventually. It was with that in mind that you didn't try to hide, instead just groaning as the sensations increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy honestly wasn't sure what to expect. Sure, she had been given the inside track on what was going on from your own doctors, but even then, she wasn't sure about the situation. Part of her honestly wondered if it could still be a prank, despite her peppy attitude. However, standing there and watching you, it could only confirm to her that everything was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratched your scalp a bit more, beginning to feel the hair growing against your fingers again. Slowly, you could feel it crawling down your head again, coming closer to your neck before coming to a stop. The strands just continued to straighten out, though some aspects of your old hair were still here. However, the shade of your hair was beginning to darken, becoming closer to a dirty blonde, while the very roots were nearing a shade of night black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it died down though, you just waited for Mandy's response, her giddiness of earlier replaced by awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocked?\" you sighed, resigned to the idea that she probably thought you were a freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds though, Mandy smiled a bit and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit. To be honest, I wasn't sure what to believe when I was told of this. Seeing it in person....I'm quite amazed,\" she said before coming closer. \"But..I don't think you're a weirdo or anything. It's not like you choose it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...that came off as a huge relief to be honest, making you sigh yet smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's reassuring, thanks,\" you said in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, and sorry if I came off as over-enthusiastic,\" Mandy smiled wider. \"I have a tendency to get over excited when I see something new. Don't worry, I'll be as supportive as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mandy seemed to have gotten off on a better foot now, which made you feel more reassured. Who knew how the other girls would react, but at least Mandy was in your corner. To solidify your meeting, you and her had a more proper handshake in greeting, though you did ache a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my body is still kind of achy from the whole procedure,\" you sighed as you stretched your arms a bit. \"Guess that kind of makes sense though. The doctor described it as if I'm being rebuilt from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would have thought modern medicine could do something like that,\" Mandy shrugged. \"But in any case, let's get everything settled in first.\"</span></div></div>",

Rumor has already spread of a boy living here. Remember this is a girls only dorm. That means girls regularly walk around with little to no clothes on because they don't fear the prying eyes of boys on campus. They need to see you and understand your situation. It will put their minds at ease.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair j guess, I just don't things to get to personal.\" You said in acknowledgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay one other thing I need you to wear this....\" Mandy said.pulling out a pair of black yoga pants and a pink tank top, with matching white panties and bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You asked holding the girly outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your are becoming a girl now like it or not you will have to stat dressing like one. Also it will help show the other girls you are what you say you are.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...but just this once...:\" You said stubbornly. You still resisted this idea deep down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to change you were surprised by how well the clothes stretched to fit your body. However you hated the idea of wearing girls underwear right now. You decided to forgo the bra and panties and just go commando for now. Throwing in a pair of pink flip flops you followed Mandy downstairs. Little did you know that without the panties the tightness of the yoga pants with your new vagina showed off a serious camel toe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs the other girls were all sitting around the lobby as they all gave you serious stares and weird looks. Your hair was a sign of your growing feminity but you still looked mostly like a boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi girls thanks for coming. I know you have all heard the rumors so we are here to dispel them. This is Charlie, he was in a terrible accident that almost claimed his life. Doctors managed to save him but there was a cost. He is now turning into a girl against his will. The school has asked us to help guide him through the next couple weeks as he changes.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the girls shouted this as the others shook their heads. It was clear they didn't believe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we know this for sure? What if he is just lying?\" One girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down crossed legged and silent. Mandy was defending you the best she could but you still felt like a  pariah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen science is weird. I was a bit skeptical myself but now I believe it. In a few weeks Charlie will be done and an entirely new person will take his place. It's our job to make sure that person is a normal well adjusted girl.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat down one of the girls wouldn't stop staring at you. She was a very tall black girl with long hair she had straightened. She seemed to be looking between your legs at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! He has a pussy! Look at that camel toe!\" She said pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls suddenly stared at you as you stood up blushing a deep red and covering yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, prove you are actually a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of the girls shouted as you were backed into a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to choose. Show them what was really between your legs and prove you are telling the truth. Or keep private and risk the mistrust of everyone here.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cool air touched your skin as you slowly revealed what was really between your legs to the group of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that real?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took several steps back as you quickly pulled your pants back up. You were blushing so red it was hard to look anyone in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...You happy now?\" Mandy said taking you beside her in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...I didn't think such a thing possible.\" The girl who called you out earlier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen....If you need help....in this...transition or whatever you call it let me know.\" She said as the other girls nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed they had accepted you for now if a bit grudgingly. Mandy was still the only friend you had right now. The other girls were either confused or weirded out by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading upstairs you buried yourself in your pillow and just wanted to forget the world. You had suffered a huge humiliation and you were still changing on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Mandy came upstairs as she seemed to have something in her hands. It was two things of ice cream as she handed you one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...what's this for?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are becoming a girl now, you should know that whenever us girls have a bad experience Ice cream is the quickest way to forget about it.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped the tears from your eyes as you laughed a bit as you stayed up eating Ice cream with Mandy. The two of you talked about yourselves and got to know each other a bit. For the first time you felt like you had a real friend since coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to bed that night happy as you were able to rest easier now. The next morning after you awoke and went to take a shower a familiar tingling began to appear...</span></div></div>",

Not only in the sense that the yoga pants probably weren't the best idea, but also having to show off your new plumbing to them all. That certainly ranked high on the most embarrassing moments in your life list. The fact that the girls seemed conflicted, though somewhat accepting of it all, did little to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, the day had proceeded quickly, with you not really feeling better about it, Thankfully, as night fell, Mandy had the right idea with bringing a little ice cream for you both. It was a nice touching moment and probably the first real sense of friendship you had gotten since you arrived. You went to bed feeling a lot happier about it, though when morning came, you were beginning to regret eating so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....no more bucketful of ice cream before bed for me,\" you groaned as you got up from your bed, rubbing your stomach a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you didn't see Mandy around. Probably tending to her own affairs or something. It looked like she left something for you though, a set of clothes involving the usual underwear set, a shirt and some sweatpants. Actually, she even left a note, apologizing for suggesting yoga pants the other day and figured that these would suit you a lot better. You looked down at the grey sweatpants. Yeah, they would do nicely. They were of decent size, and you weren't the biggest guy to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you went to the bathroom that was connected to your bedroom. Certainly made for more convenience than anything else. You looked over the shower supplies you had, which wasn't much, but they were fairly gender neutral. From what it looked like, there was stuff for your hair and skin and such, but not so overwhelming as to seem girly or anything, which you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it didn't take long to figure out how the shower worked, and you were soon cleaning yourself off. However, that tingling sensation began to come again, making you groan. This was the third time now, so it was beginning to become a lot more familiar to you. You winced as you let it build up again, looking down to figure out what would happen. Slowly, you saw at the little bits of hair around your body begin to fall off. Granted, you weren't really hairy to begin with, but what little you did have on your chest, armpits, and legs and such begin to fall off, leaving a strange sensation in your skin afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\" you sighed as you got to cleaning. At least it made using the soap a bit easier, not that you liked that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you cleaned yourself normally. Your hair wasn't really long enough to really make much of a difference. This time, you did proceed with the panties, though you didn't put on the bra, as it would be of no use for now. Might as well wait until it was needed. Aside from that, the shirt and sweatpants fitted on rather well, both looking very neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too embarrassing at least,\" you nodded a bit as you finally dried up and left the bathroom, heading back into the empty bedroom.</span></div></div>",

After throwing on some flip flops you went out and decided to go for a little walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking seemed a little harder as your sandals felt like they were bigger than the should be.  You decided to ignore it as you walked around campus. You were a little hungry so you went to the cafeteria for some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you would be all over some bacon and waffles with maybe some coffee or Orange juice. However the thought of eating that almost made you sick. You found yourself craving just a small latte and a fruit cup. You were surprised by good it tasted as you never liked this kinds of stuff before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished your meal you saw Mandy waving at you from a few tables down. Smiling you waved back as you walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, how was your night...:did you shave or something?\" Mandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uh...no my body hair fell off this morning.\" You said noticing how smooth and almost shiny your skin seemed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey listen I'm sorry what those girls did. I can't imagine what you are going through.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright now, I'm just not even show how to handle all this.

It's going to be hard to keep you dressed if we don't know.\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...actually I do....\" You said pulling out your phone as you showed Mandy this photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20150413/asian_girls_20.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20150413/asi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was a bit shocked at the photo. \"Damn!

Now we know! We can plan for this! Come on let's go get some real clothes for the future you!\" Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...sure.\" You said as you decided to go along with Mandy for now since she seemed excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood up you suddenly felt a familiar sensation as you hunched over as....</span></div></div>",
