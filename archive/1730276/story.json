            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mr. Fox looked ahead at a two story house from behind a tree his was behind. The reason for this is because the anthro fox had heard that the house was empty, or at the very least was inhabited by a single human. Even so the middle aged red fox couldn't help but become curious as to what was in the house. Which of course led to him to where he was now. And after letting out his trademark whistle and two clicks of his tongue Mr. Fox made his way to the house, and after he had reached the front door he saw that it was opened slightly which of course led him to head inside without any trouble. However, when the purple clothed fox walked around the home he made sure to find various places to hide behind until he reached the room that had the a light still on while he was still on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder what's going on in there?\" The red fox wondered to himself, before he carefully pushed opened the door and looked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this the middle aged red fox saw a single human sitting on a stool in front of a table that he various vials and chemicals on it. This caught Mr Fox's interest as he slowly approached the human who he noticed appeared to be perhaps either 22 or 23 if he went by how humans kept track of their ages. And to his surprise he was able to make it underneath the table without being noticed at all. Once he had accomplished this Mr. Fox heard the young man let out a heavy sigh when he said out loud to himself, \"Come on Robert, you can figure out this. Because once you blend the right chemicals together then I'll be able to help the local farmers crops grow a little faster then normal. That is of course if they'll let me do that.\" Mr. Fox's right ear twitched when he heard the young man let out another sigh before he added, \"Although I guess if they don't want me to mess with their crops then I gues I could just try and grow some in the backyard. Or maybe my Mom and Dad will let me use a plant in their greenhouse back home to keep a journal log on to record how it reacts to the chemicals.\" After he uttered thse words though Mr. Fox's eyes widen in shock when he heard something get knocked over as the human named Robert continued with, \"Oh crud, I can't belive I did that. I really need to be more careful since now I only have two other vials left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the red fox to look up in horror as he let out, \"Oh dear....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was then cut off as the vial fell and then landed in the red fox's open mouth which caused him to fell to the ground. This caused the odd green colored liquid to flow out of vial and into the anthro fox's mouth to which he had no choice, but to swallow all of it down his throat. Once that happened Mr. Fox was able to finally grab a hold of the front part of the vial container and pulled it out of his mouth which caused it to fall onto the wooden floor. Once this happened Mr. Fox took the chance to run out of the room right when the human young man was done writing something down in a blank book. But when Robert looked down at the ground he was quite surprised to see that there wasn't any sign of the liquid on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused him to scratch the top of his head a little while he asked out loud, \"Well that's odd. I thought for sure the vial would have broken and the chemicals would be spilled all over the floor. But there's nothing there....I wonder what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Fox let out a sigh of relief upon getting back to him. He wasn't sure what was in that vial that he ended up drinking, but the middle aged fox didn't seem to be in any pain so he figured there wasn't anything to be worried about. And so the red fox quietly changed his clothes once he had gotten into his and his wife bedroom. Once he did this he crawled into bed and fell asleep for the night. However, when Mr. Fox woke up the next morning he quickly noticed that he had grown.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He couldn't help but frown at the bizarre sensation that something was... off. Whatever it was, it was very subtle, but it definitely wasn't right. As he pushed himself up off the bed and rose to his full height, he paused. The doorframe wasn't that short. It simply wasn't. Had... Had he... Had he grown? He shook his head. It was absolutely absurd! He was a fully grown adult now, he wasn't supposed to be growing anymore. It had to simply be a trick of the mind, it had to be. However, before he could consider that matter further he was distracted by the voice of Felicity. \"Foxy! What... Since when did... How? I mean, your tail!\" She gasped, the fog of sleep clearly having been blown away by the shock of seeing her husbands missing appendage firmly reattached to his body. He immediately whipped around and realised that she was right! His tail had grown back! Could it have been the chemicals from last night? As his mind raced, he forced himself to keep a somewhat straight face. \"Oh! Yes, the tail! Um, gee, I guess it had results like no one had expected...\" He trailed off, realising that there was no way he could keep his mid-night adventure secret with this. His only chance now was to try and minimise the damage, so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity blinked, cocked her head, furrowed her brow and stared at him for a moment. \"Wait, what had results? And, more importantly, why didn't you tell me?\" She snapped. He couldn't really blame her for her irritation. \"Er, well, ah geez. This is going to make me sound so dumb, but, well, I was embarrassed. I was worried it wouldn't work, and I didn't want to humiliate myself, so...\" He trailed off, trying to think of how to continue before Felicity stepped in. \"So... you've been going out at night, haven't you?\" She asked in a manner that made it perfectly clear that she knew it was the truth. He grimaced, knowing that there was no way he could deny it. \"Yes.\" He nodded slowly, looking towards the floor. He heard her sigh deeply, an emotional sigh that he knew meant bad news on the horizon. \"Were you at least planning on telling me at some point?\" She asked, to which he immediately jumped up. \"Of course! Of course I was, I wasn't going to keep this a secret from you forever! It just, well, happened so fast!\" He said. It wasn't even a lie really, in a way. She paused, looking away. \"Foxy...\" She started softly. \"Foxy, we need to talk about this.\" There it was. \"But, not now. Not while Ash and Kris are here, they'll be heading out soon. We can talk about this when they're gone.\" She suggested, to which Foxy couldn't argue with. That was already far more generous than she had to be, not just with him but with the boys. \"Okay, that sounds like a plan.\" He agreed, looking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxy?\" Came Felicity's voice again, this time more confused. \"Are you... are you bigger? I mean, it seems like you're a little taller... and your clothes look a bit tighter.\" She asked, prompting him to look down and realise that maybe he really was bigger. His clothes really did look tighter. Was that... was that muscle definition outlined in his shirt? He was glad he was looking away as he shook his head. \"No, no. Probably just looks like it, now that I've got my tail back!\" He grinned, finishing with his trademark whistle, relieved and impressed at how well he'd hidden his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that casual deflection, he quickly dashed into the bathroom and jumped into the shower. As he turned the water on, he yelped at the freezing cold. He'd been so disoriented, he hadn't even waited for the water to warm up. He shook his head with an irritated sigh and simply stood there, as he tried to puzzle out what was going to happen now. Felicity was furious with him, there was no denying it. He could tell so clearly it was as if she had written it in bold letters in front of him. He hated to admit it, but he was certainly not in control of this. Felicity could go anywhere, from screaming at him all the way to divorce. He couldn't even bring himself to find her at fault, she was right. She was absolutely right, this was all his fault. He closed his eyes and grimaced, he loved Felicity, he loved Ash, he loved Kris. He loved all of them dearly and deeply, but he just wasn't a good family man. He was born to be a cunning, smooth, silver-tongued conman, but that lifestyle simply wasn't sustainable in later life, nor was it cohesive to family life. He ran a paw over his muzzle. At least the water was warm now. He snatched the bar of soap up and got to work. He couldn't stay in here all morning. As he got to cleaning his fur, he paused as he ran over his abdomen. That was muscle. There was no way around it, that was definitely muscle. He had muscle. It wasn't a full-blown eight-pack or even a six-pack, but there was absolutely some trace of muscle there. He'd always been in good shape, he had to be, but he'd never been defined. He briefly worried if there were going to be side effects from this, but he shook the thought away. He had his marriage on the line right now, that was far more important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! C'mon! I need to go!\" Came Ash's cry from behind the door, jolting him from his misery. \"Ah! Uh, sure thing, I'll be out in a minute!\" He yelled back, rinsing his fur out and reaching for a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that the towel was firmly wrapped around him and obscured the view of his abdomen, he quickly stepped out, seeing Ash standing by the door, evidently agitated. \"Ah, hey Ash! I see your mother let you go before her, well, bathroom's free now, it's all yours!\" He smiled, making sure to put a bit more warmth into his greeting. If things went bad, he didn't want Ash's memories of him to be tainted by harsh words or indifferent actions. \"Thanks, dad.\" Ash said quickly, dashing in after him. He paused, staring at the door. He felt like Ash had been looking at him strangely as if he had noticed the difference in height too. He brushed it off. It was morning, Ash needed the bathroom, that was all there was to it. Now he was just projecting his fears. He let out a sigh as he turned and walked back to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slipped through the door, Felicity nodded and gave a quiet greeting, to which he responded in turn. Okay, well, she wasn't screaming in incandescent rage at him, so that was a positive sign. Hopefully. He sat down on the edge of the bed, cringing slightly as he felt the springs compress under his weight. It wasn't even that much, Felicity probably didn't even notice. He just couldn't shake the feeling, however. He was bigger. He simply couldn't deny it anymore, he was bigger. He'd grown at least a couple of inches and had probably put on twenty pounds, not to mention he'd grown his tail back. He'd been lucky his towel had hidden his tail from Ash, now really was not the best of times to try and explain how he had regrown a missing appendage overnight, especially when he didn't even know how it had happened! As far as he'd known such a thing was impossible, even with intensive, aggressive medical therapy. He wanted to ask the man how such a thing could possibly happen, especially given that the chemicals he'd been doused in were apparently supposed to be for plant use, not animals! Biology simply didn't work like that. Did it? He shook his head again. It wasn't as if he'd know, and he could hardly go out and ask him, not least because he was a human and he was a fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached for his clothes, deciding that given the circumstances, something light and looser would be better suited. Pulling out a pastel blue shirt and grey slacks, he slipped the slacks on, grimacing as they became momentarily stuck around his waist, before with a forceful tug, they pulled up. He was briefly worried that he might have torn them in some way, but let out a quiet sigh of relief when he saw that - although tight around the waist and calves - they still fit. He picked up his shirt and pulled it over his head, sliding his arms though the holes, stiffening in concern when he experienced some difficulty. However, he managed to squeeze through, although his nerves faired much poorer than his clothes. As if he didn't have enough to worry about! He shook his head and began buttoning the shirt, grimacing at how the buttons seemed smaller, although it was likely because the buttons were smaller. Well, rather he was bigger and the buttons were smaller compared to his fingers. He could still hardly believe it, he was bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGah, this was all just so bizarre! He was bigger, taller, and also at risk of serious marital problems. All because he'd snuck out in the middle of the night, just because he couldn't control his curiosity and his urge to be out in the night, slipping past security systems and guards. All because he couldn't shake the need for a thrill. Now he was going to pay a price for it, and he still didn't know what that price would be. He grimaced, building up his courage to simply ask Felicity what this would mean, but when he turned, she was gone. He blinked, whipping around to see that he was alone in the room. He strained his hearing and could faintly pick up the sound of the shower. Ah, that was it. He'd simply been so preoccupied with his own musings and thoughts, he hadn't even noticed her walk by. He felt a twinge at that thought, feeling a rush of guilt at the thought that that might be a metaphor for his own selfishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his head down, staring at his knees in misery. Why couldn't he have just had this big moment of self-reflection earlier, before all of this? He'd have happily kept going without his tail in exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and steeled himself. He still had to get through the morning without breaking down under the stress. This was his fault. He owed it to Felicity to at least face it like a responsible, mature adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, he pushed himself up off the bed and walked to the door. Time to face what may come. He could only hope that Ash and Kris didn't get too suspicious.</span></div></div>",

Or if they had they didn't seem to bring up the topic at all, which was completely fine to Foxy since he already had a much bigger problem to deal with. And having the boys asking him questions would just made maters worse. Although that was mostly due to the fact that he made sure to just lay his tail flat while they ate breakfast so that they didn't see it move slightly here and there. And since he knew Felicity was already upset with him he was glad that both of the boys listened when he suggested that they should go play outside once they had finsihed breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is where the middle aged fox was now actually as he sat on the sofa and waited for his wife to be done with cleaning the dishes. Although this didn't take long for her to get done. And once she had sat down onto the sofa next to him Foxy let out a heavy sigh as he let out, \"So......what not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxy, please don't.\" His wife pleaded, while she also let out a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the orange and white furred fox's ears to fall flat up agians this head when he let out, \"Oh, right...... But I am truly sorry Felicity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are, dear. But I'm afraid this isn't the first time you've gone out to get that \"thrill\" again.\" Felicity explained, before the anthro fox saw his wife turn to him. And upon seeing tears start to form in her eyes went on with, \"And I'm sorry Foxy, but.....I just can't deal with this anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused Foxy to become very worried as he asked, \"Felicity, what are you saying exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know exactly what I'm saying Foxy.\" The female anthro fox sadly answered back, while she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Felicity, I'm sure we could figure this problem together just like we did last time.\" Foxy implored, as he took a hold of one her hands with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Foxy shock and dismay he watched as his wife gently remove his hand from his while she told him, \"I'm sorry Foxy, but this time you'll have to figure this out on your own.\" She then took in a breathe of air and released it before she added, \"And....I think you should leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? you can't be serious, dear?\" Foxy begged, with sadness clear in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Foxy. But I just can't deal with worrying about you all of the time. So please don't make any harder then it already is.\" Felicity implored, while she looked away from him. She then sighed once more and continued with, \"I'm afraid it's over between us, Foxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...understand.\" Foxy let out, before he stood and began to walk out the door. But before he closed it behind him he looked at his wife and added, \"But when you tell the boys please tell them that we both agreed to this decision. Even though it was a very difficult decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Foxy. But please try to be careful alright?\" Felicity let out, before she got up and walked out of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too...\" Foxy softly said back, before he closed the door behind and walked away form his home for what he knew would be the last time ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night by the time Foxy had finally reached the young man's home that he had sunk into last night. Along the way and throughout the day though the middle aged fox had experienced some more growth spurts. This left him completely naked since his clothes throughout the day had gotten tighter and tighter on him until he was only in his underwear. Although those didnt' last that long either. And so as Foxy stood behind a tree that was in front of the human's home he had a slight blush on his face knowing that he was completely naked. Not only that, but the anthro fox now seemed to be the saw height of an average human male. However he did notice taht he had more muscle mass on him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Foxy took in a breathe of air before he released it and said out loud ot himself, \"Okay, well here goes nothing I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro fox then proceeded to walk up to the front door to which he then gently knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert lifted and then turned his head in slight confusion upon hearing his front door being knocked on. This prompted him to get up out of his chair at his desk while he asked out loud ot himself, \"Hmm? That's odd, I wasn't expecting any visitors tonight. But it'd be rude to not go see who it is.\" The young man then kept on walking until he reached his front door. He then turned the knob and began to open the door while he added, \"Yes, who is it?......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette haired young man found himself trailing off as soon as he had opened the front door upon seeing a 6 foot tall well muscled anthro fox standing outside of his home. And while stared att he anthro animal wide eyed and in shock he saw fox raise a black furred hand like paw up into the air when he said, \"Hello, young man. I know this might be sudden, but as you can seee I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last thing Robert remembered before he suddenly found himself falling onto the floor from fainting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Foxy gasped, darting forward and grasping the man under his arms. His weight nearly brought him crashing to the ground with him. His muscle mass had certainly increased and while he hadn't had much of a chance to test it, he would be willing to bet quite a significant sum that his strength had improved as a direct consequence. However, his strength could only do so much when he was off-balance. He let out a groan as he struggled to keep the man from smacking straight into the floor, gently easing his unconscious form to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the man was laid out on the hardwood floor, Foxy carefully stepped over his body, reaching over and closing the door. This was already bad enough, the last thing he needed was some random visitor coming up and spotting him. He looked down at the man, grimacing slightly. He should have expected something like this. How else was a human going to react to a human-sized fox strolling up to the house and talking to them? He sighed, shaking his head. Well, better get him somewhere a bit more comfortable than the floor for when he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding his arms under his shoulders, Foxy grunted as he began to haul the man into the living room, stopping in front of the sofa. That should do. Hauling the man into a sitting position so that he was resting against the sofa, he began to haul him up. It was surprisingly easy however, all things considered. It wasn't a cakewalk, but it was certainly no slog either. As he got his upper body onto the sofa, he paused, looking down over his body. He shook his head, letting out one of his trademark whistles. He was in pretty good shape now, if he did say so himself! He was now sporting traces of muscle around his abdomen and his chest was slightly more defined than it had been before. He chuckled to himself as he reached down for the man's legs. Well, the height was obviously an issue, but getting his tail back and putting on some muscle? It wasn't all bad. Well, then again, he was here, instead of home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a breath, running a paw across his forehead. He sat down on the armchair across from the sofa and took a proper look around the room for the first time. It was quite a nice house to be fair, although it was quite different from what he was used to, given that he was used to homes being built into trees, holes, dams, and pretty much everywhere else that could use the nature around it without needing to build actual buildings. It kept them from being spotted and it meant that they were much more protected from things like storms and rain. There could be so much rain sometimes. He smiled softly at the thought as he looked out the window for a moment before turning back to the room. The hardwood floor's lighter tone was a nice contrast with the darker red of the wallpaper and it gave the room a comfortably spacious feeling, although the fact that the beige sofa and armchair ensemble were positioned against the perpendicular walls helped too. The TV was positioned in the corner atop the stand. Not much to say about it, although the bookcase was more interesting. A quick glance over it showed various movies and shows, but a large portion of the shelves were taken up by textbooks on Biology, Chemistry, Horticulture, Agriculture and Biochemistry and even a few on physiology. He let out a murmur of approval. This guy was clearly very intelligent to be knowledgeable in so many topics. Of course, given that he'd made a serum or formula or something that made him grow like this, well, it wasn't that surprising really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at the human, who was still draped over the sofa, unconscious. He frowned, his fingers dancing uneasily. He was certainly no doctor, his knowledge was more rooted in strategic thinking, navigation and avoidance and manipulation of security systems rather than medicine, first aid, and neurology. He'd only fainted though, having caught him before he could hit the floor, so he strongly doubted that he had a brain bleed or a concussion or whatever. So there was that at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted the TV remote on the table sat next to the armchair he had sat down in. He leant over to pick it up, the chair creaking lightly as he did so. He froze, ears perking as he looked down at the chair, holding his breath. However, the chair did not protest any more. He let out the breath he had been holding, shaking his head as he let out a chuckle. He was a bit too anxious about his new size. He was the size of a human - a towering giant compared to any fox, but completely within the usual range for a human, so of course, the furniture would still hold his weight. He grabbed the remote and examined it, musing over whether or not to actually turn it on. On one hand, it would probably help ease the tension quite a bit, but on the other hand, would it not be a bit disrespectful? To simply sit down and start watching TV in the home of someone you had shocked into a faint?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his musings were interrupted by a soft, quiet groan. He jumped, dropping the remote with a clatter that made him wince. However, it seemed it wasn't as loud as he had thought, either that, or the man was still not fully awake and aware yet. He hesitated leaping forth for fear of startling the man back into unconsciousness. Instead, he tentatively stepped forward, stopping when he was just outside of his field of vision.</span></div></div>",

But of ocurse there was no way that such a thing was possible.....right? However, once the young man had opened his eyes and his vision had adjusted Robert couldn't help but let out a gasp when he still saw the anthro fox in his house. Not only that, but he was very close to him. Not only that, but the young man soon realized that he was laying on his couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few seconds of silence had passed the human looked up at the fox's concerned face as he asked, \"Were......Were you the one who moved me over to the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. And it wasn't that easy, but I managed to make sure you didn't get hurt while moving you and then putting you on your sofa.\" The fox replied, with a look of relief clear on his face. Robert then heard him let out a sigh before he added on, \"But I'm just glad you're okay though. And I should of known better then to just knock on your door like that. So sorry for making giving you such a surprise like I did, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no it's okay.\" The young man stuttered out in a attempt to reassure the anthro fox. However, a blush soon formed on the human's face as he saw that the fox was naked to which he went on with, \"But um before we continue talking, would you like me to get some clothes that my Dad gave me? I mean they don't fit me, but I'm certain they'll fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's very kind of you to offer.\" The fox happily replied, as the young man got up and off of the couch. The young man's eyes then followed the fox who he could just tell by how he talked and walked that he was certainly in the same age range as an older human man. However, before he could dwell on this for too long he saw the anthro go over to the stairway when he continued, \"So by all means lead the way, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, right. Of course.\" Robert stuttered out, to whcih he then lead the fox up to his room. And he also made a mental note of asking him for his name after he had gotten dresed. And after he had cut out a hole for the fox's tail in the underwear and pants too.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Foxy let out a breath as he sat down on the bed, picking up the boxers. He paused, smiling lopsidedly at the hole Robert had cut in the back of them for his tail. It had been very kind of him to accommodate his needs like that. He glanced behind him as his tail twitched, staring at it for several long moments silently, the ringing of silence in his ears before it was broken by the muffled sounds of Robert doing something downstairs. He frowned at that thought - so many bad decisions one after the other, and where had it gotten him? Sure, he was a literal giant as far as foxes were concerned, and he was currently more muscular than he had ever been in his whole life, but his marriage was in ruins and he had no idea if he would ever see Felicity and the boys again. He wasn't even entirely sure if they wanted to see him again in the first place. All he could do was hope, but full reconciliation was unlikely if not impossible. He just couldn't change himself. He lacked something, willpower maybe? He grimaced and shook his head sorrowfully. There was nothing he could do now but get dressed. Pushing his morose thoughts to the back of his mind, he reached down and hooked the boxers over his left foot and then his right foot, the massive digits splayed across the floor. He paused, looking around at the room. A human's room. He let out a breath, this time of awe. It was still unbelievable that he was human sized now, things were so similar, yet he couldn't completely adjust. His foot now would have probably covered his entire body at his previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a hand over his muzzle, still attempting to come to terms with this new reality. Remaining silent for a few minutes, he realised that he simply didn't have any idea how react yet. The whole situation was too alien and too complex to really think it all through. There was misery at his loss, elation at having his tail back and his newfound musculature, all mixed in with a combination of joy and fear at his overall growth. He was no scientist, that much he would openly admit, but even he knew that something so drastic in such a short amount of time simply wasn't possible. Yet, here he was, as tall as a human and as muscular as an athlete. If it wasn't possible, then it couldn't be happening. Right? That was how it worked, how reality worked, wasn't it? He shook his head and pulled his boxers up. He wasn't getting anywhere fast with this. Hopefully Robert could fill him in, he surely knew more about science than he did. Rising from the bed as he pulled his boxers up over his backside, he grabbed the pants; they were canvas pants, regular fit at that, so they would hopefully accommodate his powerful legs. He dropped his arms, putting the pants back on the bed when he noticed they covered his legs, and looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were massive - the complete opposite of what they had been before. Where his legs had once been slender with sleek muscles, they were now huge, broad pillars of incredible strength, the muscles bulging impressively. He whistled in awe, unable to suppress his amazement. Bending his left leg at the knee, he stared intently as his quadriceps swelled outwards and his calves followed suit, flexing to the point where he couldn't even get his hand around them. Leaning back up he sat down on the bed again, stunned. As he looked up, he froze, spying a mirror in the corner. He'd been so deep in his thoughts he hadn't even noticed at first. Standing up and walking over, he looked at the full body mirror being almost fully filled with the muscular body of a tall, humanoid fox. Stretching one leg forward, he watched excitedly as his muscles engorged, chuckling softly to himself. He was huge. He'd never had this kind of strength before, not even in his youth. He had to test this out sometime. He hadn't even checked out his torso or his arms. He glanced down at them, but before he got lost in his own awe, he shook his head, moving back to pull his pants on. Thankfully the fabric allowed his impressive legs to slide in neatly, although they were slightly tight around the legs. Thankfully, they weren't so tight as to be restrictive or painful, and after he slipped his tail through the hole, he moved onto the shirt. Rather, he made to move onto the shirt before trailing off as he caught sight of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like his legs, his arms were absolutely enormous. While before they had been slim and slender, now they were huge and muscular; they were as thick as drainage pipes and could probably lift and swing one like a whackbat with ease. Rotating his arm to get a better look, he clenched his hand into a fist and flexed. He only held the pose for the briefest of moments before he dropped the flex out of pure shock. The muscle was easily the size of a basketball. He'd never had... never in his entire life had he ever had any sort of muscle mass even anywhere near half of that. Not even when he was a young fox. He flexed again, letting out a whistle as he watched the bicep swell outwards. Holding the pose, he tentatively reached over with a paw and slowly gripped the muscle, marvelling at how massive it was - so massive in fact, that he couldn't even get his hand around it properly. He dropped the flex again, slower this time, half-wanting to continue checking it out. With his new, substantially larger size, he couldn't help but suspect that that single bicep probably had more muscle mass than he had in his entire body before all of this happened. He couldn't stop himself from grinning. Felicity had broken up with him for a completely justifiable reason - he just couldn't control his reckless impulses. Yet, at least for now, he had a silver lining, something that would distract him from the situation, even if it wouldn't solve it in any way. Shaking his head with a breath of amusement, he reached for the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very basic garment, with no design or pattern. The fabric of the plain light blue shirt was thin, but stretchy, which was immensely beneficial. Sliding in a thick arm, he shivered slightly at the sensation of the slightly cold fabric brushing against his fur. He slid the other arm in and rolled his shoulders, noting that it was a little bit tight around there. He couldn't really complain though - Robert looked quite slender in build, if he did any sort of exercise it was most likely cardio. His smaller frame reminded him of what his body used to be like before... well, before... this. Now he was built less like a professional burglar, but more like an amateur athlete, with his powerful limbs, firm pectorals and rigid abdominals, which his fingers ghosted over as he began to do up the buttons. As he reached closer to the top, the shirt became progressively tighter. It wasn't constrictive or uncomfortable though, if anything it was a very enjoyable feeling, the constant, subtle reminder of his newfound musculature. As he did up buttons over his chest, he took in a breath, involuntarily grinning at the tightness. Despite everything with Felicity and the boys and his life in general, at least he did have this going for him. If he got the chance to shrink back down, he wouldn't mind keeping the muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of his body, he looked down at his torso, murmuring quietly at the sight. His pectorals were immense, jutting out at least an inch. Beneath the clean fabric and soft fur, the thick muscle was firm, powerful, unyielding. Before, when he simply been slender but fit, his chest had felt somewhat squishy, whereas now, there was no give to his chest. At first, he suspected he simply wasn't pushing hard enough, but even after he started to apply some more serious pressure, all he could feel was the steel-like muscle. He paused, his mind reeling in awe. Never in his wildest dreams had he ever even imagined something like this could even be remotely possible. He briefly mused that it was supposed to be impossible, although he supposed that as far as the average human was concerned, him and the other animals in general, should be impossible as they were anyway. Most people thought that they were more like that wolf rather than... well, what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze drifted back to the mirror, catching sight of his stomach. His hand fell back to the bed as his jaw fell open. Of course, he'd noticed that he was now impressively muscular, but until now he hadn't had a chance to sit down and examine himself in any great detail, with breaking up with Felicity and leaving the house and then ending up here, he simply hadn't had the time. While he'd got a quick look over himself when he'd burst out of his clothes, now he could really see his body in perfect detail, which was only made more impressive with the fact that the definition was visible through his clothes. No longer was his stomach smooth and flat, now it was adorned with a breath-taking set of prominent abdominal muscles. He raised a paw, pulled up the shirt and rapped on the firm 8-pack, letting out an astonished chuckle at how tough it was. He'd felt it, but there was no real trace of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh of wonder, he slid his shirt back down, pushing himself up. He was slightly surprised at the lack of vertigo, although he supposed that the furniture being scaled up with him helped take some of it away. As he considered his height, he raised a paw and reached towards the ceiling. Much like with his own home, it was probably a foot or so away. Yet, despite the similarity, it was eerie to consider that if he went back to his old home, he'd probably only be able to squeeze a single paw in. At the height of a human, he obviously wasn't going to dwarf the tree, but the main living area would surely be filled with nothing but fox. It was as disconcerting to consider as it was wonderful. He paused at that, but had little time to consider it before his mind moved back to Felicity and the boys. He shook his head forcefully. Not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could think about that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, he had someone to talk with.</span></div></div>",

He did his best not to blush as he could see the outline of anthro's muscles on his body as he walked over and then sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw him let out a heavy sigh before he asked, \"So you're probably wondering how I ended up here at your house aren't you young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I was actually.

After this happened though Foxy let out another sigh when he added on with, \"But I should explain to you how I ended up here at your front door.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the anthro fox explained how he used to be at a much smaller size.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Foxy started at the sudden movement, blinking reflexively as he leant back, watching the man break into a dash. Frowning quizzically, he pushed himself up off the couch, following in Robert's footsteps. It was easy to follow him, even when he was out of sight. The hastily-thrown open doors and muffled exclamations made his position all too clear. Following him up the stairs, he slipped through the door to find Robert in his office, standing over the two remaining vials of... whatever it was exactly. Braced against the desktop, he was murmuring something to himself under his breath, shaking his head. Unsure of what to say, he tentatively stepped forward. Before he could actually say anything, however, Robert whipped around, as if only recognising his presence just then. He held a vial up to his muzzle, an alarmed look in his eyes. \"You drank this, didn't you?\" He asked anxiously, to which Foxy stammered, trying to answer before giving up and simply nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face dropped, as if he'd been trying to deny it to himself. He mouthed something that Foxy was convinced was a swear, but he couldn't dwell on it further as Robert continued. \"How?\" He asked, almost spitting it out. Foxy parted his jaws, only to find that nothing came out. He coughed, clearing his throat, and tried again. Deciding to be honest, he was upfront and straightforward, resolving to leave no detail out. \"I was out exploring and I found your house. You know how I mentioned that I thrive on the thrill of sneaking into places? Well, I hadn't done any sort of fancy infiltrations lately, so when I saw your house, I jumped at the chance. It wasn't that dramatic though, I mean, you left your front door open.\" He began, to which Robert frowned anxiously, shuffling on his feet. He was guessing that he'd found that after he'd made his escape. \"Still, I went in, and saw a light on at the top of the stairs, so I went in to investigate and I found you sitting at your desk, talking to yourself. I crept up close by, and ended up getting a full dose of whatever was in there straight to the muzzle. So... I drank it all down right there and then. It was either that or most likely choke.\" He explained, raising a paw before letting it drop down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert stared blankly at the vial in his hands before slowly shaking his head, as if in a daze. \"I... so that's where it all went.\" He said softly. Foxy could only nod awkwardly. \"Yeah.\" Robert blinked slowly, like he was waking up from a deep sleep. \"I... I don't understand. This is... it's essentially... it's supposed to be for plants! I don't get it. How did that work? It... it shouldn't work! Should it?\" He wondered aloud. Before Foxy could try and offer any suggestion, he remembered that Robert was the expert between the two of them, so with Robert's bewilderment, it certainly didn't inspire particularly great confidence. However, before he could figure out a way to voice his concerns in a manner that wouldn't come across as insulting, Robert seemed to be struck with a flash of inspiration. \"Of course! That's it! Ugh, obviously! It can't affect plant growth, it affects cell growth! That's the only way it can work, it mustn't be specific to plants, it must be general! Otherwise it wouldn't have done anything, it'd be like drinking chlorophyll in the hopes to photosynthesize!\" He exclaimed excitedly, before pausing abruptly, starting at the vial in his hand with a mix of fear and caution. \"I... I better be careful with these. I don't know if these'll affect humans too, but they might well. Don't want to take that chance.\" Quickly depositing the vial back in its secure place, he turned back, staring Foxy in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy shifted his stance as he digested Robert's words before something came to mind. \"Wait, hang on a minute here. I'm a little bit confused. So, did you just... not know that that's what it did?\" He asked, bewilderedly. Robert gave a slight nod as he gestured towards his set-up with a sardonic expression. \"No, I didn't. I know, I know, sounds stupid, but you have to remember, I'm not exactly swimming in cash right now. I...\" He trailed off, shaking his head morosely. \"Ah, never mind. Look, you gotta realise that I just don't have the funds for a professional set up. I mean, you were listening to me go on about my plans, you should know, right? I was thinking of using plants from my parents' greenhouse!\" He sighed, to which Foxy frowned, nodding. \"True, I do remember something about that very thing actually. I'm just a little surprised that you found something so...\" He trailed off, doing the little wild paw gesture. \"...different, with a set-up like this.\" He admitted, to which Robert shrugged his shoulders. \"I see your reasoning, but at the same time, this isn't unheard of. I mean, Thomas Edison is known as a great inventor - although he was more of a businessman - but he knew nothing about science. He literally achieved all his discoveries by sheer brute force and trial and error. Even before then, Ignaz Semmelweis - a doctor, he discovered germ theory long before it was mainstream. Ah, poor guy, he got driven out the community for it too, even though he could prove a benefit, but couldn't explain it.\" He lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy nodded awkwardly, not knowing any of these names. They'd never taught a lot of human history in school. Dispelling the confusion, he turned his thoughts back to the topic at hand. \"Okay, so... you just... happened to stumble on something that's completely new and no one ever thought was even possible before?\" He asked, still slightly skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert nodded. \"Yeah, pretty much. I know, I know, sounds really weird, but that seems to be the case.\" He mused, scratching his head. Foxy took in a deep breath, closing his eyes as he tried to make sense of the bizarre situation he'd found himself in. Robert couldn't help but glance away bashfully as the buttons of his shirt strained against the thick musculature of his chest. Foxy let out that breath, his broad shoulders dropping as the tension in his frame vanished. \"Alright. Alright. Okay. So... I'm a giant now. I'm a giant... well, I'm a giant and I've got more muscle that I did even when I was in my younger years...\" He sighed, bringing a paw to the bridge of his muzzle. \"Do you have any idea how to reverse this? Or at least stop this?\" He asked, almost pleading in his tone. Robert turned his gaze to the floor, his expression forlorn. \"I'm sorry. I don't. I had no idea it even worked yet, I have no idea how I'm going to reverse it, or even stop it.\" He admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy's face fell as he covered his face with a paw. He grit his teeth in a grimace, a frustrated growl bubbling up in his throat. \"Ah... cuss.\" He snarled. Robert flinched at the irritated exclamation. \"I'm sorry, I really, really am. I can try to look up what might counteract the components and see if they work?\" He suggested, to which Foxy sighed and nodded calmly. \"Yeah, sounds good. Sorry, I'm just frustrated, with what's happened since this.\" He morosely lamented. Robert nodded sympathetically. \"I understand. I'll get on that. Plus, if that doesn't work, I can try things in combination and if that doesn't work, well... we'll think of something if that comes. But, we've got a lot of time before then and we've got a good plan in place I think!\" He said, hoping to reassure the older fox. It seemed to work, as Foxy withdrew his paw and nodded. \"Alright, that's good. Better than where we were, that's for sure.\" He agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert nodded tiredly. \"Yeah, sure is. Man, what a day this has been.\" He sighed, to which Foxy nodded in agreement. \"Ha. Tell me about it.\" He chuckled weakly. \"Still, we've got a plan now!\" He sighed in relief, to which Robert chuckled in turn. \"Yeah, hopefully it'll all work out.\" He mused,  before glancing at the clock on the wall. \"Hmm, time's going in. Do you want something to eat?\" He offered.</span></div></div>",

Let's see what you got, I'll give you a paw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a paw? Is that another way of saying that you'll give me a hand?\" Robert asked, with a very confused look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm yes, I suppose I do mean that. We have slightly different saying compared to you humans\" The older male fox confessed, as the two walked out of the room and then down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Very interesting.\" The human said, before the two entered the kitchen. Upon doing this the older anthro fox then saw the young man look slightly up at him while he added, \"Alright I'll take care of making the pasta and garlic bread. So while I do that how about you get out some plates and glasses from out of those cabinets over there and se them onto the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange and white furred fox watched as Robert pointed at two different spots in the small kitchen. And upon seeing them Foxy nodded his head in understanding and did just that. He then was able to find where the forks where without too much issues considering he watched where the human had gotten out a wooden spoon to stir the pasta with. And once the plates, glasses, and forks had been set the small table Foxy decided to sit down himself and wait for the food since this owuld be his first time in while eating human food. And this it was being made a human no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once the food was set down on the table and Foxy proceeded to take a piece of garlic bread and some pasta onto his plate the older fox thought he saw the young man's look at him with a light lbush on his face. And at first seeing this the anthro was a bit confused though, when he noticed where the young man was staring he just smiled a bit smugly and decided to give his arm a bit of flex for a second before eating the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon taking a few bites of both the bread and pasta Foxy's eyes widen in suprise before he smiled again and told the human, \"This is very good Robert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you. Though I know it's nothing anything special.\" The young man replied, before he also started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so. But dinner nevers needs to a large feast of different foods. Well unless you're feeding more then just a family of four.\" Foxy commented, before he went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis remarked caused the human to smile and let out a light laugh give caused Foxy to smile a bit bigger as the two ate in silence together for the rest of the meal. Though whenever the Robert looked at Foxy and looked away with a light blush the older male of an anthro couldn't help but think that such a sight was well.....cute. Even if he was a male like him. Howver, he knew tackling that matter would come at a later time once his gotten used to his current changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour after dinner had been finished and Foxy had helped Robert with the dishes, (which the human slightly protested about at first) the anthro fox decided to take a shower to finish off his day fully before heading to bed. But while he was in the shower Foxy ended up.......</span></div></div>",

It wasn't fair, he thought to himself. Kristofferson's longer legs gave him a natural advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson, deciding to be nice, slowed down a tad. \"C'mon,\" he said, \"it's right up ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh watched as his slightly younger cousin sped up again, shaking his head. Whatever they were going to see better be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kristofferson skidded to a stop, and Ash caught up with him a moment later. They were standing in a near-deserted part of the sewer, next to a brick wall with a crack in it. \"It's right through here,\" Kristofferson said, slipping through the crack. Ash followed, having no problem making his way through due to his littler body type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw on the other side was pretty cool, though, he thought to himself. They were in a small enclave of the sewer, what seemed to be a dead end. The room was dark save for what was coming from the middle, where a plant glowed a bright green. \"What is it?\" Ash asked. It sprouted from a crack in the ground which was surrounded by a greenish looking sludge  It looked like a small apple tree, standing about as high as Ash was tall, but the fruit growing from it seemed more banana-like in shape, though smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Kristofferson replied. \"Have you ever seen anything like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shook his head. The light was beautifully eerie, and he couldn't help but step towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, no!\" Kristofferson cried out. \"We don't know what will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small explosion of light cut Kristofferson off in mid-sentence, as he shielded his eyes.

The once tiny fox had dramatically risen to twice his size, and was just as amazed as his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened to me..?\" Ash groaned, dazed but regaining awareness, \"Why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not small,\" Kristofferson said, his voice full of worry, \"You grew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the tree was roughly half as tall as it had originally appeared.  He might not have been the brightest student in class, but Ash knew that trees didn't grow underground.  The pair studied it in silence, as if acknowledging the presence of something magical.  Whatever it was, it was a strange thing, and its small, banana-like fruit was quite a sight.  Ash began to reach for one when Kristofferson threw out his arms and yelled, \"What are you doing?  Don't touch that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late.  The enormous fox had plucked the fruit and was turning it over in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Ash said dismissively, \"The damage is already done.  Besides, what if it's the key to making me little again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt like he was grinning inside.  \"Little again.\"  He was no longer 'little'.  He was big.  Huge, even.  Even his father, the \"Fantastic\" Mr. Fox would look up to him.  He felt great!  In fact, when he really focused on it, his whole body was pleasantly tingling.  Is this what it was like to feel powerful?  He'd always been particularly slender, lacking any muscle mass to speak of, but this was different.  Noticing for the first time that his size change had also endowed him with an above-average physique, he scanned the toned definition of his forearm and flexed his bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel cussing fantastic,\" Ash beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...\" Kristofferson gasped, \"You're still growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help but smile. \"Yeah!  I'm finally going to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't good at all, Ash.  We've got to get you out of here and above ground!  Come on!  Through the crack, follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally cool under pressure, Kristofferson was visibly shaken.  He maneuvered gracefully through the crack in the wall and started to run before suddenly realizing he'd left his cousin behind and doubled back.  Ash was doing his best, and failing miserably, to squeeze through.  \"Cuss it!\" Ash growled, and spit, \"I can't make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Kristofferson thought, \"Well, you're really big now.  Try pushing on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as Ash gave it all his might, the bricks gave in and crumbled outward, giving him enough space to break through.  Now roughly three times his usual size and growing, the young fox panted and wiped his brow.  \"Wow.  This is crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The closest way out is over here,\"  Kristofferson said, gesturing into the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hesitated.  What would he do, once he was safely in the open?  His folks would have a meltdown if he went home like this.  He was huge, but not gigantic, not to mention that the tingling he'd felt had weakened.  Maybe his growth spurt would stop, then he and his (considerably smarter) cousin could figure out how to shrink him back before anyone else could see.  Ash glanced at the strange fruit he'd taken and considered his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\"  Kristofferson yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?</span></div></div>",

Sure, he could eat the fruit, and maybe it would cause him to grow even bigger, but then the fruit would be gone, and if Kristofferson told anyone, they might come down to destroy the tree or brick up the wall to the room. No, he thought, the safest thing would be to save the fruit for later and take it home; maybe, there, he could even use it to grow a tree of his own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stuffed the fruit in his pocket and hurried after Kristofferson, who was already halfway up the ladder. With his new height, he could almost reach the top of the sewer cover standing on the ground. He smiled, feeling good about his body for the first time since he could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two foxes pushed the cover open and peered into the daylight, they looked around, making sure there was no humans around. Luckily, this sewer hole was in the middle of a rural street way out in the country, where traffic was very rare to nonexistent. Kristofferson climbed up out of the sewer first, followed by Ash, who found the opening to be a tight but manageable fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Kristofferson said, his breathing returning to normal. \"We're out of the sewers, so we should be a little safer now.\" He stared up at Ash, whose growing had seemed to have stopped now that he was no longer holding the fruit. \"Why did you have to grab the fruit a second time, Ash? Who knows what could've happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked, looking down at his now diminutive cousin. \"Are you kidding?\" he said. \"This is the best thing that has happened to me in -- well, ever!\" He flexed his new muscles, and, though he was wearing his trademark white suit with cape (which had grown along with him), his new biceps and pectoral muscles could easily be made out through the fabric. In fact, even though it had grown, the suit seemed to be fit a little more smug than before, and a little bit of Ash's stomach was now visible where the shirt was too short to cover it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kristofferson said, clearly uneasy at the prospect but trying to keep his head, \"Okay. You can enjoy it for now, but we can't go home until you shrink back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded, seeing the logic there. \"Fine,\" he said, \"where do you propose we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson thought for a moment, then finally proposed...</span></div></div>",

He had a way of coming off as unfeeling, dispassionate even, yet Ash sensed something was up. \"You're lying,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not,\" Kristofferson answered dryly.  Still, there was something unusual about his behavior.  Suddenly, Ash bent over to pick up his practically weightless cousin and peered him in the eye.  \"Put me down!\" Kristofferson yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you tell me why we're going to the Whackbat field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you, ok?  I thought it would be good for your self esteem.  You could show off to everyone and boost your confidence, which, by the way, you severely lack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fought the temptation to spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on.  You even said it yourself:  This is the best thing that's ever happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true.  Ash felt better about himself than ever.  He'd had his successes, sure, but when he was little things were tough.  He was a frequent, though well-intentioned, screw-up, and had always dreamed of being special.  Now that he was, he wanted to exploit it for every ounce he could wring free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" he said, lowering his cousin to the ground, \"I'm tired of being a shadow.  You... you always get what you want!  Now, look at me!\"  Ash lifted his head and puffed out his chest to demonstrate. \"I'm, like... I don't even know how to put it.  It's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Kristofferson thought to himself.  For all his effort and discipline, he could never achieve the kind of figure his cousin had been gifted with.  Whatever the tree they'd discovered was, it was incredible, and for the first time that he could recall, Kristofferson was jealous of Ash.  Unintentionally, he had been superior in every way, from sports to academics; it had been a huge thorn in their relationship, even after everything they'd supposedly reconciled during the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean fiasco.  Ash's jealousy had been intense, but with that suddenly changed, it was Kristofferson who felt small and overshadowed.  Strangely, in a way he couldn't understand, he liked it.  The thought of Ash being the center of attention, impressing everyone, or even growing bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha,\" Ash beamed, \"Let's go. I can't wait to see the looks on everyone's faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ash plucked up Kristofferson (eliciting a \"Hey!\" of protest) and carried him to the Whackbat field not terribly far away.  It was a sunny late spring afternoon, and the sky was dotted with a scattering of puffy clouds.  As the fox's figure appeared, the animals who were playing there dropped what they were doing and stared, several with their mouths agape.  The unexpectedly enormous Ash deposited Kristofferson onto the ground and loomed over his friends with a toothy smile.  \"What happened to you, Ash?\" one of them asked.  A few others murmured quietly amongst themselves, while a handful more kept their distance.  Kristofferson, a touch uncomfortable, sidled up against Ash and accidentally brushed his foot on top of his cousin's.  It was huge!  His toes were almost as long as Kristofferson's entire paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a growth spurt,\" Ash said, matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you did,\" one of the animals replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull-cuss!\" snapped another, \"You've been taking drugs or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Ash growled, stepping forward, \"You're just jealous. Hey, somebody give me the whackbat. I'm gonna destroy the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed to like that idea.  \"Yeah!\" one of the animals yelled, \"Everybody, back in your places!  Somebody give Ash the bat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it,\" Kristofferson said with an encouraging smile.  With the bat in hand, Ash felt like he could accomplish anything.  It was so tiny.  How he could manage to actually swing the thing now that he was more than thrice his usual size, he didn't know, but this was his time to shine -- he WOULD do this.  However, unbeknownst to him or the others on the field, the fruit inside Ash's pocket had started to glow.  The players had taken their place and were ready to start when...</span></div></div>",

Strange, he thought. He stepped up to the basket, and the center tagger lit the pinecone, and gave it a hurl. While the pinecone was flying at him, Ash's entire body suddenly began to tingle. It was the exact same sensation he had down in the sewers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring it for now, Ash took a deep breath, and then threw every bit of force he could into swinging the bat. With a tremendous WHACK sound, it made contact with the pinecone, cracking the bat in two, and sending the cone flying through the air. Ash immediately threw down the bat and made a mad dash for the cedar stick. With his tremendous size advantage, he was easily able to avoid the taggers and grabbers and knock the stick off the cross rock. At first, the twig runners were too stunned to dash back and forth, but they each eventually snapped back to attention and got to work.  It took nearly a full minute for the pinecone to be retrieved and to burn out, and by that time, the twig runners were all nearly doubled over from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotbox!\" the umpire called out. \"Uh... Divide that by nine, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Kristofferson said as Ash made his way over to the sideline. \"That had to be a world record or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ash said, grinning smugly, \"when you just happen to be a natural athlete like me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natural nothing,\" Kristofferson said. \"Look how much bigger you've grown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Ash had opened his eyes and took a look around, he noticed that everyone around him looked a lot smaller. The tips of Kristofferson's ears now only came up to the middle of his shins. He bent down, bringing his massive muzzle level with Kristofferson. \"Hey, you're right!\" he said. \"Wow, how cool is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson chuckled uneasily. It was troubling to see that Ash was still growing even though he didn't have the fruit with him, but at the same time, he was getting some sort of thrill out of it. Almost like it felt good to have his cousin now leer over him. He felt an urge to lean up and grab a hold of Ash's muzzle, doing what he wasn't quite sure. But he was beginning to know that he liked it, and secretly was hoping that the growth wouldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" one of the animals from the field called out. \"You broke the whackbat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" another one yelled, \"that's our only one. How are we supposed to play now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned around, shrugging. \"Sorry, guys I guess I don't know my own strength.\"  He walked over to a tree at the edge of the field and grabbed a limb, snapping it off like it was a pretzel. The limb was much larger than a bat, but around the same flatness. \"Here you go,\" he said, tossing the limb at one of the upset players, who had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. The other animals looked up at Ash with an angry look on their faces, but everyone kept their mouths shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kristofferson, let's get out of here,\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Ash,\" Kristofferson answered meekly. He felt Ash's long, warm fingers wrap around his torso as he was lifted up, then held against his shoulder. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled, as he said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The depth of Ash's voice was particularly striking when he spoke. As he started to walk away from the Whackbat field, he left huge pawprints in the dirt, each at least the size of the tallest creature there! Typically awkward and consistently unsure, Ash came across now as cool and confident, a rather becoming trait, at least to Kristofferson. He had demonstrated impressive patience putting up with his cousin's quirks; even if his sudden change was merely temporary, it was pleasing to know that Ash had it within him to be those things he'd dreamed of. Kristofferson smiled thinly as he placed his hand on top of Ash's shoulder and looked him in the eye. \"Where did you have in mind?\" he asked, not even questioning the motivation of relocating somewhere private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had detected something different about Kristofferson since he'd grown, a kind of admiration toward him he'd never felt. Is this what it was like to be respected? No, there was something more to it than that. Concealing his suspicion for at least the time being, Ash gave his cousin a gentle pat with the tip of his finger and pointed toward somewhere in the distance, \"There's a pond I used to go to when I needed to escape, I've never seen another living thing there. I'd really like to show it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice,\" Kristofferson said, watching the field disappear from view, \"You know... now that everybody's seen you, your dad's going to find out, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought honestly hadn't crossed Ash's mind. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Your parents were going to find out before long anyway. Let's just make the most of this while we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make the most of this?\" Ash wondered, \"What exactly does he have in mind?\" Ash couldn't help but quirk an eye and glance at his cousin as he continued to plod across the countryside. After several minutes filled with largely uneventful chatter, both travelers arrived at a gently-sloped, forested hill over which neither creature could see. The trees, once tall and great in comparison to Ash, were barely as tall as he now. Just how much had he grown? Kristofferson appeared smaller than ever atop his shoulder, and that was perfectly fine with the diminutive fox. \"It's just over this hill,\" Ash said, \"and then we're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was careful not to lose Kristofferson as he maneuvered between the trees. The sun was high in the sky, and the temperature was mild but warm. As he pushed between the last pair of trees near the bottom of the other side of the hill, a small flock of birds scattered and re-settled somewhere else amidst the trees. Having reached his destination, Ash found himself in front of the pond he'd often slipped away to since he was very young. The water looked particularly refreshing after the afternoon's excitement, and Ash let Kristofferson down before getting down on all fours to take a drink. The banana-shaped fruit he'd been carrying slipped out of his pocket and rolled to the ground; to Kristofferson's surprise, it was much, much bigger than he'd first witnessed, and brightly glowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash!\" Kristofferson exclaimed, \"The fruit!\"  Ash collected it into his palm and examined it closely. He had begun to tingle all over, like he had during the brilliant flash of light in the sewers. Ash's clothes, already tight and revealing, began to become even moreso, and he bared his teeth as if in pain. \"Are you alright?\" Kristofferson asked, yelling with the full power of his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...\" Ash whined, \"Unnnghhh..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson's eyes widened as his cousin experienced another potent growth spurt. The fox's gigantic footpaw crept toward him in quick fits, swelling with the rest of his body. Shaking off his immediate shock, Kristofferson scurried away from the path of Ash's toes and watched as they doubled in size, then doubled again, almost in no time at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cuss,\" Kristofferson panted, rarely one to swear. This moment, however, called for an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Ash hurled the fruit into the pond. Splash! The water was deep enough to hide it, though its glow, slowly dying, persisted from within. The tingling sensation within Ash was fierce but subsiding. As he continued to grow, he backed up away from the pond and took a seat, snapping several trees beneath his mighty figure, then clutched his head. The titanic fox was completely naked now, and fully exposed, which Kristofferson duly noted. Had Ash always been so gifted, or did the fruit enhance his sexual attributes as well as his height and physique? The monstrous fox looked fully grown-up, yet still remarkably youthful. Not even realizing that he was unclothed, Ash scanned the ground for Kristofferson, his tail flicking about. Dazed with the intensity of his growth spurt, he hadn't even noticed that his massive erection was jutting out between his legs and leaking a steady stream of precum into the field of grass by the foot of the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson could do little but stare. A sense of jealousy within him was quickly overcome with awe, and he presented himself to his cousin. \"Ash,\" he said, perhaps inaudibly to the enormous fox, \"What's going on..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh reached forward to scoop up Kristofferson and squinted as he studied him close in front of his muzzle. \"I feel really funny,\" he sighed. Kristofferson felt like he needed to meditate just to get his bearings now. What on earth were they going to do? How big was Ash going to get?? Still, despite the emergency, he couldn't deny his urges; Kristofferson stepped to the edge of Ash's palm, trying to catch an eyeful of his cousin's foxhood. The air around him smelled deeply of sex, only adding to Kristofferson's excitement. It was truly massive and red, bigger than anything he had imagined. If Ash were normal-sized, he'd still be at least twice as big as anyone else. Even Kristofferson's own foxhood, impressively large, paled in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, you're so...\" he said nervously, his voice trailing off. Though gigantic, Ash's ears were sensitive enough to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" Ash asked, his voice rumbling through Kristofferson and the hill underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson had an idea...</span></div></div>",

He had never seen anything like it before; somewhere inside, he felt that he just had to touch it. \"I just want to...\" he continued, unsure of what he could say that would express what he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he was picking up Kristofferson's thoughts telepathically, Ash slowly nodded, and lowered his paw down to stomach level, where Kristofferson jumped off. The white fur on Ash's stomach was very soft and smooth, and as Kristofferson walked on it, Ash began to chuckle slightly, Kristofferson's footsteps tickling him. The laughter caused his stomach to move slightly, and Kristofferson lost his balance, lurching forward, falling straight into Ash's foxhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Kristofferson said, his muzzle now inches from Ash's shaft. He looked up at the towering presence above him, stretching at least twice as tall as Kristofferson was. Whistling in wonder, he took in the amazing view. It just felt right. He had never thought of himself as one to be attracted to another guy, least of all his cousin, who had seemed to be antagonistic towards him since he first arrived, but this was different. Ash was now a whole different fox, confident and powerful, and there was a certain sense of power, an aura around him, that was certainly sexy and irresistible to Kristofferson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller fox wrapped his arms around Ash's shaft, not even reaching halfway around it. Ash leaned his head back and began to moan. He had pleasured himself before many times, and sometimes he had pictured in his head the lean, muscled figure of his athletic cousin while he did it, not really sure what that meant. But this was different; this was real, and the way Kristofferson had been acting, so respectful and admiring, it felt all the more special. Looking at his little cousin riding his cock, pressing his body into it, he could even feel Kristofferson's own tiny foxhood through his shorts. The thought drove Ash wild; he just had to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out his paw and tugged on the back of Kristofferson's collar, trying to pull his shirt off.  Kristofferson quickly understood and offered no resistance, sticking his arms off and allowing the shirt to slide off easily. He then unfastened his shorts and Ash's immense fingers lightly grasped them, pulling them off completely, setting the clothes down on the ground some yards away. Both foxes were completely naked now, both sporting hard-as-rock erections that desperately needed to be attended to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kristofferson?\" Ash said, his voice heavy and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ash?\" Kristofferson said back, no less excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just wanted to say something.\" Ash searched for how to put his thoughts into words. \"I know I haven't always been the easiest fox in the world to get along with. I gave you a hard time when you first got here; I was a jerk. But in these past few weeks, since the adventure at Bean's house... Well, I've started to feel really close to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're cousins,\" Kristofferson said, smiling, \"we're supposed to be close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more than that,\" Ash said. \"You're like this perfect fox, smart, and strong, and kind and patient. You put up with me and defended me when I didn't deserve it. I- I love you, Kristofferson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson was speechless; his mouth was left open, stunned.  Ash had never been so eloquent before, but what he said hit home; Kristofferson felt the same way. Finally, he looked up at Ash, tears of joy beginning to form in his eyes. \"I love you too, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cousins looked at each other, both smiling and feeling inside a new sense of closeness. Taking his finger, Ash gently stroked Kristofferson's head, running down his back to his tail. Kristofferson, unable to contain himself any longer, started stroking his own hardness, the sensation of Ash's finger and the sensual aroma surrounding him driving him to the next level. Ash began to rub his own cock as well, but within a few seconds, Kristofferson was back working on it too, moving his body up and down, licking it and grasping it tightly, stimulating the giant fox as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh began to moan, and he could feel his heart pumping faster. The feeling of Kristofferson's silky chest and stomach fur against his sensitive shaft was unlike any other, and he knew that he wasn't going to last much longer. Within a minute, he began to tense up, his cock ready to explode. Kristofferson felt it too, and worked even harder. Finally, Ash began to erupt, sending strings of hot cum flying into the air. Some of it shot far, disappearing into the trees. Some fell straight down, landing on Ash's stomach and coating Kristofferson. Ash shot several large spurts; he had much angst pent-up inside, ready to get out, and the whole idea of being so big and with his cousin just made it even better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he finished, Kristofferson slid down, landing on Ash's sticky groin. He still had his own business to attend to so he began stroking hard, trying to get off while in this amazing situation. Ash noticed his cousin's attempts, and reached out a finger, gently rubbing Kristofferson's chest, sending shivers down his spine and causing the little fox to come within seconds, adding onto the mess already in Ash's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finished, both foxes were breathing heavily. Ash stretched out, knocking down some more trees in the process. Kristofferson sat back against Ash's drooping cock, reveling in what had just happened. They were both content, not needing anyone or anything else in the world right now. It was a perfect moment.</span></div></div>",

You look like you've seen a ghost or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson shook his head. Did he just imagine that bright flash of light? Was he going crazy? In any case, it was over now; no need to worry about it. He started to say something to Ash when he was stunned to see Ash stuffing the fruit into his mouth, chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't eat that!\" Kristofferson cried. \"It can't be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another slow chew, Ash then swallowed the fruit. \"Oh, don't be such a spoil-sport. Here, have some,\" he said as he handed the uneaten fruit to his cousin. \"It's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, Kristofferson took the fruit, examining it in his paw. It still had what seemed like a bright glow to it, but he figured it was just the light of the tree reflecting off the walls. Sniffing it, it seemed safe, so he took a small bite. As he chewed, the fruit had an odd texture, like nothing he had tasted before. It felt stringy, almost meat-like in its consistency, but had a surprisingly ultra-sweet taste to it. Ash was right; it was very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys took another bite and, after a few minutes, they had finished their fruits. Ash licked his lips as he looked at the tree again, his stomach growling. There still seemed to be plenty of fruit left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much of that do you think you could eat?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Kristofferson said. \"I think one was enough.\" He burped, and then felt something gnawing away at his own stomach. \"Then again, it was pretty tasty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys approached the tree and each grabbed another piece of fruit from the low-lying branches. They began eating again, these ones going down quicker than the others. But their hunger only seemed to grow. They grabbed another, and another, slowly eating all the fruit on the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, they didn't notice the changes that were happening to their bodies. It was only when they had each eaten ten pieces of fruit that they looked at one another, and gasped. Something incredibly strange had happened.

It was a mistake coming here. We should leave immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked back at the fruit tree with a hint of longing in his eye, but then nodded and walked back over to Kristofferson. \"You're right,\" he said. \"Let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh made his way through the crack in the brick wall, having to hold his breath as he passed through. Having made it, he stood up. \"Kristofferson?\" he called out. \"Are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a second,\" his cousin answered. Ash wasn't sure what he was doing; he tried to peek through the crack but couldn't make out the silver-furred fox, only the light glow of the tree. Finally, though, Kristofferson put his leg through the crack and began squeezing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Ash asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kristofferson said, quickly looking away. \"C'mon, let's go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash watched the taller fox scamper off to the ladder at the end of the pipe, he noticed that his pockets appeared to be bulging slightly. He scrunched his muzzle up and tried to see if he could detect any unusual smells coming from Kristofferson's direction, but nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. The two foxes climbed up the ladder and headed back to the tree, just in time for dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Ash climbed into his lofted bed, while Kristofferson rolled out his bedroll in the space underneath, since Ash had cleared out all his junk from there after becoming friends with Kristofferson. When Ash flicked off the light switch, he could swear he saw something glowing coming from underneath his bed where Kristofferson was sleeping. He looked over the edge, seeing Kristofferson curled up tight in his bedroll, the glowing light having vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay up there?\" Kristofferson asked with a slight smile on his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh\u2026.\" Ash paused, then replied, \"yeah, everything's fine. Good night, Kristofferson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Ash,\" Kristofferson said, closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh leaned back on his bed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kristofferson stared up at the bottom of Ash's bed, his mind racing as the night went on. Every so often, he would reach his paw down into his pocket, feeling the fruit, sometimes pulling it out slightly to check and see if it still glowed as before. If anything, Kristofferson realized, the glow seemed to be getting more pronounced as the night went on, but that just might be his eyes adjusting to the darkness and getting more sensitive to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what this fruit could do,\" he thought to himself. The ideas were endless. Perhaps it would increase his brainpower, making him even smarter than he already was. Maybe it would affect his muscles or fur, causing him to look more svelte and athletic. The thought that the fruit could have a detrimental effect also crossed his mind, but he shook it off, hoping for the best. \"I don't read comic books,\" he thought, \"but in Ash's, something like this would always give whoever had it superpowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson started to frown slightly. Ash would be the one who would really get a kick out of something like this, he realized. Sure, Ash had been a bit of a cuss when Kristofferson had first arrived, but over time his cousin had begrudgingly began to accept him, even sharing things like the comic books with him. In the past month or so, Ash had cleared out all of his old junk from the room, making space for Kristofferson's things and trying to make sure the room they shared became \"their\" room and not \"Ash's\" room. It was a heartfelt gesture, and one that Kristofferson appreciated and didn't take lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson had also gradually become aware in the past few days of some other feelings Ash seemed to be holding, even though the more intense, shorter fox obviously was trying to hide those feelings away. It was little things Kristofferson picked up on: Ash staring at him across the dinner table, then immediately averting his gaze as soon as Kristofferson made eye contact; Ash helping Kristofferson out even when he didn't ask for help; and, most noticeably of all, Ash scooting over and inviting Kristofferson to ditch the bedroll and sleep in the real bed with him, which Kristofferson politely declined, disappointing Ash slightly. The feelings were something that Kristofferson had been accustomed to from some of the girls (and a few guys) in his old school and in the one he attended now, but coming from his cousin, he wasn't sure what to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of Ash's behavior or leanings, though, Kristofferson quickly knew that he couldn't keep it from his cousin any longer. \"He's my friend now,\" he said softly, \"he deserves to know.\" He slowly stood up, climbing the ladder to Ash's bed, and gently poked the sleeping fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--?\" Ash gradually awoke, his green eyes shining in the moonlight. \"Kristofferson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhh. Keep your voice down.\" Kristofferson smiled gently. \"I have something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ash sat up eagerly, his sleepiness from a moment ago having vanished completely. He scooted over and allowed Kristofferson to sit next to him. As the silver fox stretched out his legs on the bed, he reached into his pocket, and Ash's eyes lit up at the sight of the glowing fruit. \"The fruit from the tree!\" he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I\u2026\" Kristofferson started, hesitant to explain exactly his thoughts, \"\u2026 I guess I couldn't just leave it there. It was too intriguing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw glowing earlier when we went to bed,\" Ash said, grinning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning his paw through his headfur, Kristofferson blushed. \"Yeah\u2026 I'm sorry for hiding it from you earlier. I guess I wanted it all to myself, but I just now realized that you've been too good a friend to me in these past few weeks for me to be selfish like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stared at Kristofferson for as second. Kristofferson could've sworn he saw his cousin's eyes beginning to mist up. Finally, Ash leaned forward, putting his muzzle directly in front of Kristofferson's, nose to nose, and said...</span></div></div>",

For some reason he wasn't entirely sure of, this seemed to excite the silver fox as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ofen yur mouff,\" Kristofferson instructed, his voice muffled from the fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh did has he was told, and Kristofferson leaned forward, placing the opposite tip of the fruit inside Ash's lips. The glow shining from it illuminated the inside of Ash's mouth, causing a little light to leak from his nose. Kristofferson couldn't help but chuckle from the sight of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bife down on free,\" he instructed, holding up three fingers for added emphasis. \"One, Two, FREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth foxes bit down, causing the insides of the fruit to burst through the skin. Neither of them expected the fruit to be as moist as it was, and as the juices dribbled down their muzzles, they both wiped them up with their paws, slightly embarrassed. Pulling back from each other, they started chewing, each pleasantly surprised at the substantial flavor, much like a cherry but with a little more tangy taste. The fruit itself was small enough that after splitting it in half, only a few chews were needed before the glow in their mouths started to die down. Ash swallowed his first, gulping it down quickly, while Kristofferson let his rest in his mouth a little longer, savoring the flavor, before finally swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's it,\" Kristofferson said nervously as he wiped his muzzle one last time to make sure it was clean. \"What's gonna happen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think <i>I</i> know?\" Ash's ears twitched as he looked straight into his cousin's eyes. \"Probably nothing, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young foxes waited for a few minutes, trying to see if they noticed any changes. After nothing happened, Kristofferson turned his head to Ash, yawning just a little. \"Maybe we just have to sleep on it or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't answer, his face full of disappointment. He crossed his arms on top of his knees and burrowed his muzzle in it, sighing softly. Kristofferson placed his paw on Ash's shoulder, trying to comfort the unhappy fox. \"Don't feel so bad, Ash. At least the fruit tasted pretty good, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Ash didn't seem to be looking any less upset. Kristofferson knew from experience that it was best to let Ash mope about these kind of things until the next day, when he'd usually forget about them (or bury them away inside, Kristofferson wasn't sure which). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the silver fox finally said after waiting long as he could, \"I'm getting pretty sleepy. I'll see you in the morning, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up off the bunk and started climbing down the ladder, until he felt his pajama shirt being tugged back. Looking up, he saw Ash's eyes, as big and as brilliant green as ever despite the darkness, looking at him pleadingly. \"W-would you mind... sleeping next to me tonight?\" the smaller fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson tilted his head to the side, slightly befuddled. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned away, his ears drooping. \"I... I dunno. Forget I asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly was a rather strange request, but Kristofferson couldn't bring himself to say no. \"Sure I will, Ash,\" he smiled, causing his cousin's demeanor to brighten again. He climbed back up and lay down, Ash scooting closer to the wall. The twin bed certainly was a tight fit, but the two boys were able to make it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Ash,\" Kristofferson said as he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Ash's paw brushed against his in the bed, and he heard a soft, barely audible moan escape Ash's lips. \"Good Night, Kris.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys slept soundly through the night, not having any clue of what they would be in store for when they woke up the next morning.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opening his eyes, Kristofferson could immediately tell that something was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, his feet were hanging off the edge of the bed, and his nose was substantially closer to the ceiling than before. For another, he felt an uncomfortable tightness around his chest and waist. Looking down at himself, he saw that his pajama shirt and pants had been stretched out considerably, a substantial gap between them revealing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a stomach it was! Kristofferson had always been an athletic fox, making sure to stay in shape with his dad using karate and yoga, but he had yet to develop any substantial musculature -- well, that is, until now. His abs now seemed to have a well-defined six pack, rippling and bulging in places they had never done so before. It had to be too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he gradually became more awake, he noticed a paw resting against those strong, pronounced ab muscles. Looking over, he saw his cousin was still asleep, his arms wrapped around Kristofferson in a way that seemed more than platonic, though Kristofferson couldn't say it was entirely unwelcome. As his eyes moved up and down Ash's body, Kristofferson was stunned to notice that the shorter fox seemed to have changed overnight as well, and in much the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Kristofferson, Ash slept shirtless, so the effects the fruit had on his body were much more visible at a glance. Not only was he now sporting a healthy six-pack of his own, but his chest seemed to have buffed up as well, his pectoral muscles firm and large, below a broad set of shoulders and next to large, powerful arms. Ash's boxers, loose the night before, now were almost skin-tight, and Kristofferson could clearly make out a pronounced bulge in between the red fox's legs. Looking down at himself, he quickly realized that he had that same bulge as well. Kristofferson felt his fur begin to tingle as his heart beat faster, getting excited, though he wasn't 100% sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back into Ash's face, Kristofferson finally saw Ash's eyes flutter open, still groggy and sleepy. He thought he saw a smile form on the corner of Ash's lips when they made eye contact, but he couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Ash moaned slightly, \"good morning Kristofferson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Ash,\" Kristofferson replied matter-of-factly, trying to hide his nervous excitement as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey fox chuckled, unsure of quite how to answer that. \"Uhhh...\" he stuttered. \"About as great as you, I guess.\" He motioned down to Ash's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" Ash hadn't noticed the changes yet, still in the process of waking up, but when he followed Kristofferson's gestures and saw the new muscles and bulges on his body, his eyes lit up. He instantly jolted upwards in bed, which caused him to whack his head on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWW!\" he cried out in pain. \"What the cuss?\" Rubbing his head, he looked upwards, stunned to see the substantial dent his head had left in the ceiling, which was much closer than he remembered it being just a few hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pained seemed to disappear within a few seconds, however, and Ash's face quickly returned to one of excitement. Swinging his legs off the edge of the bed, he quickly jumped to the ground and stood to his full height. Even standing, his ears were brushing the ceiling, and looking down caused him to get a little dizzy due to how far away the ground looked. \"Kris!\" he exclaimed. \"This is amazing! We're huge!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson made his way off of the bed in a gentler manner than his cousin, standing to his full height, noticing that his head was pressing against the ceiling, still a few inches taller than Ash. Regardless, both young foxes were indeed much, much bigger than before -- a true sight to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walked over to the mirror on his wall, whistling when he got a good look at how his body now looked. \"Wow,\" he grinned, \"I'm even bigger and stronger than dad now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" Kristofferson said. \"Either of us could probably lift him clear off the ground with a single paw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh continued to admire his body in the mirror, taking his arms and flexing as he posed. As he did so, a loud RIIIIPPP came from his underwear. Ash froze, realizing what had happened. Looking down, he sighed in relief when he saw that they were still staying on, if only barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door. \"Ash? Kristofferson?\" The two boys recognized the voice of Mrs. Fox. \"Are you boys up? It's breakfast time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob began to jiggle, and the two boys stared in horror at it. \"We can't let her see us like this,\" Ash said as he began to panic. \"She'll freak out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kristofferson whispered back, trying to maintain a calm composure, \"what do you suggest we do?\"</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way she couldn\u2019t see us. Maybe\u2026 Maybe a mother is just really supposed to love unconditionally? Even to the point of .. No that\u2019s absurd\u201d Kristofferson shakes his head and chuckles. \u201cBut let\u2019s pretend like nothing happened. If it works it works, right?\u201d The two foxes chuckled at each other and started getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling their shirts on was more a challenge than ever. Not only was it necessary for the two huge foxes to kneel down in their small room, almost making their undies pop off, to allow enough overhead room for their arms. But their once loose shirts were now skintight, and ripped and tore almost completely off again as soon as they had pulled them on. \u201cThis..\u201d Ash breathed shallowly, trying to remain in his shirt \u201cis not going to work, is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shared a laugh at the situation, and could not help but admire each other\u2019s and their own towering bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on their shorts was near impossible, the threads popped all along the legs of them, as a single flex of their young muscled thighs pulled the strands of fabric apart. \u201cWhat the cuss?!.. At least they\u2019re so tight now we won\u2019t have to worry about them falling down, right Kris?\u201d Ash grinned as the two barely clothed boys duck their way out of their bedroom <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of foxes tramples down the narrow stairs to the living room, creaks from the stairs and rips from their clothing following their steps  till they reached the table where Mr. Fox was sitting with his newspaper, skimming ever so quickly through the headlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris threw Ash a worried look, knowing he was the newest in the family he was even more concerned with the reaction Mr. Fox might have of him now that his ears brushed against the ceiling of the small house. But all Mr. Fox did was to look up from his paper and smiling contently at the two boys, before greeting them \u201cHello boys! I say, you seem bigger and bigger every day, soon we will have to expand the rooms for you two!\u201d He chuckled, winked, and whistled at Mrs. Fox in that classic charming way of his \u201cWe must have done SOMETHING right raising them, hon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat carefully on the floor beside the table, almost looking like the table fit him in this position, and hungrily grabbed a bowl and the new chicken-flavoured cereal. \u201cAsh.. you might want to hold back a bit if we are to.. you know, get some fruit later\u201d Kris said as casually as he could. \u201cHmm?\u201d Ash looked up from his second bowl in what seemed like seconds \u201cOh right! I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to get some of that down\u2026 All this growing must have made me hungry!\u201d Kris just laughed and bonked Ash teasingly in the side \u201cThat\u2019s not true, you\u2019ve always been hungry, Ash!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving from the table, Mr. and Mrs. Fox quickly rushed off to do their weekly survey of the tunnels \u2013 which meant that the two foxes would be left for themselves till the next day. A deal that had often made the two unlikely friends uncomfortable and bored, but not these days, and certainly not now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young foxes crouched down in the window, waiting for their parents to be out of hearing-range before cheering loudly and jumping slightly within the small living room, making both of the young foxes bump their heads forcefully against the ceiling \u201cOWW!! Haha, this is going to take some getting used to! But it\u2019s SO worth it!\u201d Ash chortled before the two foxes made their way back into the tunnels themselves, in the hopes of finding more of their secret fruit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Making their way through the sewers wasn't as easy as it had been the day before. Ash had to crouch down quite a ways just to be able to fit, and behind him Kristofferson could only make it by crawling on his hands and knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we in the right part of the sewers?\" Ash asked with a worried look on his face. \"This looks all different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course it looks different, Ash,\" Kristofferson replied. \"We\u2019re both nearly double our previous heights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Ash nodded, \"but still, I think we're lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We\u2019re not lost, Ash,\" Kristofferson said in as hopeful a manner as possible. \"Trust me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned around, grinning slightly. \"Okay, Kris, I trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued on, Kristofferson couldn't help but start to think that he was getting the much better experience of the two, as he was able to watch Ash and his newly-muscular ass as it tried to free itself from the remains of his boxers. He was one hunky fox now, and he stirred up feelings that Kristofferson didn't even know he had. He started to imagine him and Ash standing nak--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urk!\" Kristofferson exclaimed as the tip of Ash's tail brushed across his face, filling his mouth with fur. He yanked it out, noticing his cousin had stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Sorry!\" Ash giggled slightly as he grabbed his tail with his paw. \"But, uh, I think we may have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pointed in front of him, where the path was blocked by a large tangled mess of roots, the tips of which were glowing a bright, eerie green hue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that--\" Kristofferson couldn't finish his question, too stunned to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else could it be?\" Ash replied. \"And I think we're in the same general area we were in yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-- But-- that doesn't make any sense!\" Kristofferson's eyes had gone wide and he was sputtering, very uncharacteristic for the usually calm fox. \"I mean, it  was barely a bush yesterday. It couldn't have grown that much!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ash shrugged, grinning slightly, \"we grew a whole bunch, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYeah, but--\u201d Kristofferson stopped, thinking this over. It sort of made sense that, if they grew because they ate the fruit, then the tree could grow bigger too. But this seemed sorta ridiculous. The roots in front of them filled up a large amount of space, and they seemed to be pulsating, almost as if they were slowly growing larger, right in front of their eyes. And who knew what the actual top half of the tree looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHey!\u201d Kristofferson yelled out as he realized something. \u201dIf the roots are spread out down here, where's the actual tree? How are we going to get to the fruit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Ash looked around to try and find any clues. As they examined the walls, they noticed that the growing tree seemed to have put a lot of strain on them, causing some of the bricks to start crumbling and topple over. Closer into the center of the entangled roots, the ceiling seemed to have been pushed out of the way. The rest of the plant extended upwards, and they could make out a few rays of sunlight poking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI think that's our answer,\u201d Ash said as he pointed. \u201dI wonder if there's a way up there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dAsh! Wait!\u201d Kristofferson cried out as Ash started to scamper up the roots towards the opening. Shaking his head, he followed after as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got closer to where the ceiling where the sunlight was seeping through, Kristofferson thought he heard the sound of a stream or river flowing close by, and he could definitely hear a couple of bird calls. \u201dWhere exactly are we?\u201d he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOnly one way to find out,\u201d Ash said. Pressing his paws against the ceiling, he pushed upwards with all his might, causing the ceiling to start crumbling again, forming an opening that was large enough for the two foxes to climb through. Dust and debris rained down on them, but nothing big enough to be more than an irritant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGeez, Ash,\u201d Kristofferson smiled as he shook his head, \u201dtry and be a little careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring him, Ash climbed up through the opening he had formed, with Kristofferson following behind. The two foxes were amazed to see they were in a grotto of sorts, a place they had never seen before in all their exploration of the forest. As Kristofferson had guessed, a brook ran in between the trees, forming a small waterfall a little further down. In the middle, the formerly small tree from the sewer now towered overhead, significantly taller than any of the other trees in the area. What's more, it's branches seemed to be full of dozens, if not hundreds, of glowing fruits, many of which had fallen to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh my god,\u201d Ash said as he gawked up at the tree, and Kristofferson could only whistle in amazement. \u201dKris,\u201d Ash said, turning his head slightly but still keeping his eyes on the tree, \u201dare you thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dUh, what's that, Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWe should eat every last fruit on that tree!\u201d As if on queue, Ash's stomach let out an audible growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dUm, maybe we should pace ourselves a bit, Ash,\u201d Kristofferson said, nudging his cousin in the side with his elbow and chuckling. \u201dBut still, I think we're both pretty hungry, aren't we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Ash nodded eagerly and the two boys started picking up fruit off the ground, eating it as quickly as they could. There were about fifteen or so fruits that had fallen, and they split them more or less evenly. After finishing them off, Ash patted his belly and stuck out his tongue. \u201dMmmm, delicious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat, you're already full?\u201d Kristofferson made a \u2019tsk\u2019 sound. \u201dI told you not to eat so much at breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNaw, I'm just \u2019pacing myself,\u2019 like you said, Kris!\u201d Ash sat down, leaning against the tree, and spread his legs out. He patted on the ground beside him, motioning for Kristofferson to join him, which he did. \u201dWe can take a bit of a break, maybe nap a little, and then go for the taller fruit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh, I see,\u201d Kristofferson winked as he sat down next to Ash. He felt his heart skip a beat as Ash leaned his head against his shoulder, and he heard a slight moan escape his throat. This adventure with Ash had made him significantly more horny than usual, and he felt an impulse to start making out with Ash right then and there. But he couldn't give into his instincts like that, could he? No, it would probably be better to just nap like Ash said, and then have some more fun later.</span></div></div>",

However as they moved over they failed to notice the earth shaking beneath them or the massive paw prints six feet deep in the ground. As they leaned on the building, inside the pipes burst, the walls cracked, the lights shook, the catwalks buckled and the machines toppled over. The smokestacks tumbled to the ground. But they slept on. All though when they awoke they both gasped in shock. \"Oh my god!\" yelled Ash. \"W... We.. We're Gigantic!\" gasped Kristofferson. Standing up they noticed two things one their boxers were on the verge of shredding off entirely, mostly round by their mega muscley butts, and second of all, they were almost as big as the factory! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" gasped  Ash \"We'd need to crawl just to fit in the sewer, never mind the house!\" \"We'd crush the house!\" gulped Kristofferson. \"Com' on! Let's head in! \"WHAT!?\" \"Oh come on we can get rid of this thing easy\". \"Look\". Kristofferson gawked at the younger but still massive fox grabbing the factory door and bending down and flexing, stretching his underwear to the limit, and pulling the door off it's hinges with ease. Kristofferson crawled inside and called out \"We should make a camp in here\". Ash agreed and soon they were grabbing huge machines and tossing them out the door with ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater they decided to head back home and let Mom and Dad know that they were spending the night at a 'friend's house'. Lucky they said it was ok and the two sat down in the now empty factory complex. Kristofferson sighed as his tail tore down another catwalk. He was so big he nearly broke through the roof and often crushed something or other with his massive hulking frame. He was glad this place wasn't populated or he would be like Godzilla with his size and Enormous muscles that could lift a plane and crush it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Ash said goodnight and snuggled down and drifted off to sleep......</span></div></div>",

But when he felt his tail hit the nearby wall of the factory he knew that it was all real. \"Well, at least it doesn't seem like Ash or I grow any bigger.\" The white furred fox whispered, while he sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to slowly and very carefully stretch his body to completely wake himself up. As he did this though a scent caught his attention causing his eyes to widen in surprise. He slowly moved his head from left to right before he thought, \"I wonder where it's hiding? Because I know it's here somewhere.\" The light grey furred anthro fox could not ponder on the matter for that long though because when he heard his cousin let out a rather loud yawn he sharply turned to look at him and told him, \"Hey, keep your voice down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good morning to you too.\" His younger cousin shot back with, while he glared back him. He then crossed his arms over his chest and looked away as he went on with, \"Geez, what's your problem this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older of the two cousins sighed before he replied, \"Look sorry about that.

It's the scent of a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Jefferson, but when she used to go to school she would be called by the nickname Becky still couldn't believe what she had gotten herself into. One minute she was walking by an empty factory like she normally would on her days off. Today however, when was very different when she not only saw that the front door had ripped off of it hitches. But she was also not expecting to see two giant (and very muscled) anthro foxes laying on the ground. The blonde haired blue eyed young woman couldn't help but explore the two sleeping giants after she had walked inside the factory. \"Wow, they're both huge.\" She exclaimed, with amazement in voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also took notice of the differences between the two foxes. The first being that the orange and white furred fox seemed smaller and younger looking then the one next him. She assumed that, that one must be a little be younger then herself. But when the blonde haired young woman looked over at the light grey furred fox though she saw that he was much taller and bigger then the one on the left. And by the looks of him she assumed that he was either her age or a little bit older. \"Hmm, I wonder what happened to these guys. How in the world did they end up here without anyone noticing?\" However, the blue eyed girl could not pardon on the matter for long as the larger of the two anthros began to stir before he sat up causing Rebecca to see nothing but his huge muscular back. She looked from the left to the right quickly as she added in a whisper, \"I had to find a place to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde quickly ran towards a corner of the factory hoping to not be seen by the two giant anthros. As she did this though she could not help, but wonder how her life would have been if she had been able to continue to going to school inside having to leave. The reason behind that decision was because she practically on her own now since one morning she woke up and found a note a from mother saying that she had left to find a job in different town. The letter also said that once she had found a good job that she would come back for her, but she knew better then to believe that since it had been a year since then. The young woman was brought out of her thoughts when she heard one of the giant's voices as it said, \"It's the scent of a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, they know I'm here.\" Rebecca let out, while she closed her eyes and then covered her face with both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, you're right. And I think it's coming from over there.\" One of the giants replied, before the ground lightly shook from behind the girls feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly stopped though when she heard, \"Dude, what do you think you're doing?! Do you want to stare the human even more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guress you're right. But what should we do?\" One of the giants asked, as she slowly moved her hands away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had done this she heard the other giant's voice as it responded with, \"Well, we'll just have to let the human know that we don't plan on hurting him or her.\" She then felt warm breathe go over body as that same gaint added, \"Don't worry human, we're not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca opened her eyes after hearing the last comment. And when she did she saw a giant furry hand slowly come towards it. She also found out that it's color was.....</span></div></div>",

Once this had been done the blonde haired young woman realized that she must be about the size of a doll to these two giant sized foxes. She also noticed the two anthro foxes were barely clothed with their underwear which seemed to be close to snapping off if they weren't careful. However, she was brought out of her thoughts when she saw that she was looking up at the foxes faces as the one holding her asked, \"Hello, wm what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Rebecca, what's yours?\" The blue eyed young woman asked, as she kept on looking at the grey fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Kristofferson, the fox behind me is my cousin. His name is Ash.\" The fox named Kristofferson explained, before she saw him give her a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's very nice to meet you both. But could please tell me how the two of you got so big?\" Rebecca questioned, while she tilted her head to side a little. She then added, \"Maybe I can help you guys figure why it's happening. Although I'm not sure how much help the daughter of a decease farmer will be. But I'm willing to do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had said this she saw the older of the two foxes eyes light up with what she assumed was hope as he let out, \"You'd be willing to do that for us? Well, then I guess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute there cousin. Could I speak with you for a minute.....in private.\" Ash interjected with, giving him a sour look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure I guess so.\" The light grey anthro fox replied, before the young woman felt herself being lowered towards the ground. And once he had set her onto her feet towards the opened entrance he went on with, \"Rebecca, could you please wait outside for a little while I talk with Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure no problem.\" Rebecca reassured him, as she walked out of the factory. When she had gotten outside though the young woman ran a hand through her long blonde hair and mentally continued with, \"Gee, it's too bad Kris isn't at the normal human height for guys my age.\" She quickly blushed and placed both hands on her face while she ended with, \"Wait a minute I shouldn't be thinking like that.....but for some reason I can't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris looked over at Ash, who still had an unpleased look on his face as he let out, \"What's wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with me? How about we find out what's wrong with you first?\" The orange furred fox snapped back, now showing his fangs a little in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't see why you're getting so upset. She might be a human, but if she can help us we might as well tell her about the fruit and where we found it.\" The older of two foxes countered, while he turned away from his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard his cousin let out a snort of what he assumed was bitterness when he replied with, \"Yeah you could be right. But the real reason why you want her help is because I think you like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light blush formed on the grey furred anthro fox's face while he said, \"You can believe whatever you want to, but my minds still made up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stood up against a nearby tree still waiting for the two foxes to come out of the factory so that they could tell her their story. \"I hope their conversation is going ok. I hate to be cause of an argument between them.\" The young woman thought, before she was covered by a large shadow. When she looked up she saw the light furred anthro fox standing at his height. And while she looked up at him she added, \"Oh there you are Kris. Hey, where's your cousin Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue eyed young woman saw the fox's ears fold back a bit as he answered her with, \"Well, you see Ash....</span></div></div>",

Is he okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson sighed and Becky noticed that his ears were still pinned flat against his head. She deduced that this was probably an uncomfortable subject and she felt a twinge of guilt at possibly being the center of some sort of conflict or disagreement. \"He's just a little bit freaked out at the fact that we're enlisting the assistance of a human. Especially a human we don't even know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's eyes widened as she exclaimed, \"Wait, human?! Are you two really giant walking, talking foxes? Not two guys who turned into giant foxes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris nodded. \"Uh, yeah the both of us are part of an entire community of animals. I'm Ash's cousin. We live in a hollowed out tree with Ash's parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, an entire community you say? And you live with your cousin's parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wish the same could be said for me.' She thought. She was suddenly struck by another question. \"Hang on, how do you live with Ash's parents? You guys are enormous! I highly doubt that either of you could even fit in a hollowed out tree. Even a big one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kris chuckled at that and leaned down so that his huge, muscled torso loomed over Becky as he admitted. \"Well, now we can't. As you saw, Ash and I had to sleep in that factory because estimating based on the height of the factory, we're both around the 40-foot range. So we would flat out crush the house if we even tried to get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the back of her mind, Becky acknowledged with some degree of surprise, that she wasn't the least bit intimidated by the fact that a 40-foot tall human-like fox was towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whistled and remarked, \"40 feet, huh? Wow. How did you guys even fit in there? And how come your parents are ok with all this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris took in a deep breath and gestured towards the factory. \"First, we ripped out and threw out all the machinery. It's just on the other side of the factory, along with the ruins of the smokestack I presume.\" He paused to laugh to himself. \"I thought I heard something the night before last. Anyway, it was surprisingly easy to just lift all that equipment of what I can only deduce to be a car factory.\" He looked down at Becky who was staring up at him in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two just threw it all out?!\" She gasped. Becky could hardly believe it. That level of strength would have seemed impossible if it were not for the fact that she was talking to a 40-foot tall talking fox on two legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris just smiled endearingly and nodded. \"Amazingly, yeah. As for why Ash's mom and dad are ok with this, well... We need to explain how we got here. Both how we got so big and how we got to this factory that is. Ah, speaking of Ash, here he comes now.\"</span></div></div>",

I don't blame him for acting like this.\" Becky reassured the light gray furred fox. She then pointed down the dirt road they were currently on she added, \"Anyway if you want to get to my family's farm just head down this road a ways. And then turn right when you see a long dirt road leading to a two story house with a large red barn a good ten feet behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange and white furred fox watched as his older cousin nodded in understanding before both of them started to make their way to the human's home. But while they did this Ash couldn't help but notice how his cousin and the young woman were acting while they talked together. Which mostly consisted of Kris telling Becky of how they found the large tree and the fruit that grew from it. Although he didn't like it when the other anthro fox explained how the fruit seemed to have grown along with them when they found the tree the next morning. And Ash wasn't impressed when he heard the blonde haired human tell Kris how she might be able to figure out what had caused their growth after taking a look at the fruit. He wasn't even fazed when she told them about how her father had died at a young age, and her mother leaving her all along on the farm a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ash did feel himself getting a bit angry when he saw Kris gently rub one of his fingers of on the top part of Becky's head in an attempt to comfort her as he softly told her, \"I'm sorry to hear that you've had such a difficult year to go through all by yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and it doesn't really help since I had to sell all of the animals a few months ago.\" The blue eyed young woman confessed, before Ash saw a smile cross her. When this happened she quickly continued with, \"But I guess that's okay since I now I won't be alone since I have you and your cousin as company. ANd both of you are more then welcome to use the barn as a living space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's great and all. But will your barn even be able to fit both of us?\" Ash spat out, before he crossed his arms in front of his chest. And once he did this he mentally added, \"<i>Besides even if she could figure out what's happening to me and Kris. There's no way I'm going to her where I hid that fruit before we left the factory.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the orange and white furred giant fox looked up at his cousin he saw the other muscled fox was glaring at him from over his shoulder as he remarked back with, \"We'll worry about that when we get to her farm, Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the rest of the trip was full of silence until the three arrived at Rebecca's farm.

If he spat, he'd probably send a huge ball of saliva hurtling through the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, he just flicked his tail to do something to expend all his pent-up energy, loud thumps reaching his ears as his huge tail smacked against the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his towering, muscled form, grinning slightly at the sight of his boxers clinging to his body, his orange fur peeking out from huge tears in the fabric, their elasticity the only thing keeping them somewhat together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure that another growth spurt would leave them in tatters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of such tightness around his groin was as uncomfortable as it was wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wonderful sensation was his sheer size, he'd always been a small fox, which had been even more pronounced when Kristofferson showed up. That had been something of a sore spot at first, it seemed to further emphasize how better his cousin was at everything, but then the whole incident had come about and he'd been reassured that just because he was 'different', it wasn't as if he wasn't valued. Those memories of his mother comforting him, his father assuring him with that it wasn't his fault and Kristofferson accepting his apology were still, and always would be, crystal clear in his mind, as would the knowledge that his parents loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, I'm so glad he was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the happy tears forming in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, now, he was still different, but in a completely different way, he thought, looking down over his huge body again. He towered into the sky, easily taller than every single building in the human village except for a mere handful if even that. He had a physique so strong, powerful and well-defined that it would easily put all the other animals to shame, cuss, it would put most humans to shame. All he needed was an outfit, and he could be a superhero like Whitecape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and let out a breath through his nose. It was amazing to experience, it felt so good, but it was going to leave him without any chance of living any sort of proper life. Forget living in a tree, he'd have to live in a cave, it'd be the only place big enough for him. Then there was employment, getting things like food, and all those other things that he was starting to realize would be problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what happens when you become an adult?\" He murmured to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minus turning into a giant, that is.\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he could sense the wind change and his olfactory senses were blasted with the scents of Kristofferson and Becky and the mood quickly turned sour again, his left ear flicked as it usually did when he was irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent forward and pushed the doors open slightly, poking his head out to see the two of them sitting and talking. Becky was sitting with a flashlight and a blanket, looking up at the towering, muscled frame of Kristofferson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh bit his lip, growling softly. Cuss it all, why did she have to show up and make everything so complicated? Why were she and Kristofferson so interested in each other? He'd only made up with him recently, now he could lose that closeness again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat there, mulling over his thoughts, he noticed that Becky was...</span></div></div>",

And once the young woman was a few feet away from his head he coldly snapped, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to talk. Besides it wouldn't be fair to only talk to Kris and ignore you.\" Becky explained, while a soft smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however did not sway the orange and white furred anthro fox in any way as he shot back with, \"Yeah right. You may have tricked my cousin, but you won't trick me, human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this Ash rolled his eyes upon seeing the blue eyed human shake her head from side to side as she protested, \"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Ash. I'm not trying to trick anyone. And to be honest I'm actually excited about you and Kris staying here on the farm with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, yeah, whatever.\" Ash remarked, before he used a few of his fingers and shut the barn door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky found herself letting out a heavy sigh once Ash and shut the barn door as she was really hoping to have an actual conversation with him. But that idea seemed to fly out of the window so to speak as the young woman walked back over to Kristofferson to which she sat down where she had been earlier followed by letting out a heavy sigh. Not to her surprise though the light of moon was blocked out by the white furred fox's shadow when he asked, \"So I take it Ash wasn't any mode to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it didn't seem like it.\" The young woman let out, as she pushed some of her long hair behind her right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had done this she looked up at the giant muscled fox and saw him give her a warm smile before he reassured her, \"Don't worry Rebecca, I'll go talk to Ash in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kristofferson.\" Becky replied, before she felt a cold wind go over her. This prompted her to wrap the blanket over her a bit more while she continued, \"Brr, I didn't think it would be this cold out tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had said this though the young woman heard the white furred fox let out a light chuckle before he told her, \"Here. I think I know of a way to keep you warm. Besides I don't need you catching a cold on me.\" Upon saying this Becky felt one of the giant fox's large hands wrap around her before she was gently lifted her into the air while her blanket fell to the ground below. Once this happened she then saw the well muscled fox move a good distance away from the house before he laid down. Becky then found herself blushing a little when Kris gently placed her on top of his right pectoral. She then felt him lay a hand on top of her before he smiled down at her and went on with, \"There. Is this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, it is. Thank you.\" Becky softly replied, while the warmth of the fox's fur and muscles caused her to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this caused Kris to grin a little while he whispered, \"You know Becky, I know what it fels like to be all alone. But like I told you earlier today, you won't have to worry about alone ver again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon saying this the well muscled fox then also closed his eyes and fell asleep for the night. But in the morning when Becky woke up she quickly realized that Kris was taller then the night before. In fact when she looked down she found herself blushing again when she saw that his underwear was completely destroyed. Along with this she saw that he was also closer to the house then last night as well. In fact if she had to guess how much he had grown the young woman figured that Kris (and Ash) had added on an extra......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Author's Note: Okay so I made a big mistake in the last few chapters. That being that I accidentally described Kris as the older of the two cousins. However, since I know/remember that Ash is the older of the two let's just say that Kris is the same age as Becky, who I think I made either 16 or 17, while Ash will be either 18 or 19 years of age. Also let's just pretend that I didn't make that mistake to being with too. Anyway back to the story)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky slowly began to open her eyes the following morning only to see that she was completely covered by Kris's hand. This did not last though as the giant white furred fox moved it away from her in his sleep which gave her a better veiw of the giant anthro fox. And when this happened the young woman let out a loud gasp as she saw Kris had grown during the night. In fact it looked like he had gain an actually twenty feet thus putting him at sixty feet tall. Along with this the human also found herself blushing when she saw the fox's now even larger muscled body which looked like he was a pro bodybuilder. And upon lower her gaze her blush grew an even darker shade of red when she that the white furred fox's briefs had been completely destroyed thus revealing his currently soft white color and pink tipped cock and large white furred balls. Seeing this only cuased the blonde haired young woman to picture Kris standing either at her bedroom window or in front of her while doing different muscle poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were quickly pushed away however when she heard Kris yawn lowdly which cuased her to turn to face him as she greeted him, \"Good morning, Kristofferson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the now heavily muscled fox had finished yawning she saw him look down her while he replied, \"Good morning, Rebecca..... Wait, do you look smaller now compared to last night.\" After saying this the blue eyed young woman saw the giant's own blue eyes widen in realization on what happened as he added, \"Oh no, don't tell me. Ash and I grew overnight didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem like it.\" Becky let out, before she let out another gasp. Once she did this she continued, \"Oh no, the barn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Kris nod his head before she gently picked up by the white furred fox and then placed into his right hand. And once that happened Becky found herself in awe at the fact that everything seemed so far away compared to what it was the first time she sat in the heavily muscled fox's furry hand. And within a few steps Kris made it back to her house to which she let out a sigh of relief upon seeing it still standing without any damage. When she looked over at the barn however, the blonde haired human found herself covering her mouth with both of her hands as it was completely destroyed with pieces of wood that was laying all on the ground. And in the center of it all was Ash, who Becky noticed was also completely naked like Kris. But while the other heavily muscled fox did various muscle poses the young woman was a bit surprised when Kris moved his fingers to where they were blocking her view of the orange and white furred fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris made sure that Becky couldn't see his older cousin flaunt his heavily body. The white furred fox quickly put a stop to this though when he cleared his throat and asked, \"Ash, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Kris. Sorry I just figured I do various poses. I mean can you blame me, just look at us. We taller then any human building and we're more built then any human bodybuilder could dream of.\" His older cousin remarked with a large grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and what's your point? Just because we're sixty fee tall now doesn't mean we need to not still be careful. Because the last thing I'd want to do is hurt anyone by accident.\" Kris pointed out, to which prompted his cousin's grin to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this happened the white furred fox saw the other fox's eyebrows narrow in anger when he asked, \"Okay, I get that. But then why are you still hanging around with Becky? And on that note why did have her sleep on your right pec last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this cussed a light blush to spread on Kris's face as he stuttered, \"B-Becky and I were talking last night because I was telling her about the shape of the fruit and I also told her I'd take her there so that she could get a sample of it to study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Of course you would.\" Ash remarked, followed by crossing his muscled arms in front of his huge chest. Once he did this he then went on, \"And besides how do we know she can even figure out a way to get us back to a more reasonable size anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted Kris to let out a slight growl of anger as he shot back, \"You know Ash, I wish you'd give Becky a chance. She's a really nice person who just wants some company and wants to help. Although I guess I shoudln't be surprised that you'd act this since you've never acted your age. Even though you're suppose to be the older cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARe you serious, Kris!\" Ash almost shouted, now with fangs showing. After this though Kris heard him let out a heavy sigh before he turned his back to him and added, \"Well if that's how you're going to be then I guess this is goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this cousin begin to walk away prompted the white furred fox to lower his fingers thus allowing Becky to see him leave. And when this happened the heavily muscled fox's right ear twitched when she begged, \"Wait, Ash! You don't have to leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Kris saw hi older vousin stop walking for a moment and look back at the two before he muttered, \"Sorry, but I'm out of here. But I guess I'm sorry for what happened to your barn....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this both Kris and Becky watched as Ash walked away until he was out of view and seemed to be heading towards the mountains. However, in the back of his mind Kristofferson wondered what would happen now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash let out a growl of frustration as he shoved his way through a thick branch in front of him, his broad, muscular chest smashing straight through the wood as if it was a toothpick rather than a fully grown tree. His ear flicked as he turned his head, spitting in barely constrained anger. The glob of saliva smashed into a sickly looking tree of some kind that Ash couldn't recall or be particularly bothered to remember at the current time. The tree didn't even offer the slightest of token resistance, it simply shattered into shards of blackened wood. He paused at the sight, his heavy stomps coming to an abrupt halt as he suddenly realised what he'd done. He looked around and realised that he was almost breaching the canopy of the tallest trees. This area of the forest had taller trees than the rest, and he was nearly tall enough to look over them. His spit had destroyed a tree and he had smashed another to pieces without trying or even consciously thinking about it. He let out a deep, long sigh of misery as he put a paw to his face. He needed to get a hold of himself, keep his anger in check. He was already too big for barns and powerful for nature. The damage he could cause was tremendous, the factory had more than proven that. He was just so angry, Kristofferson was smart, cuss, he was practically a genius compared to Ash, but damn if he could be na\u00efve at times. How could he trust Becky so easily? Well, rather, how could he trust a human so easily? Ah, why did he have to be maturing and becoming more aware now? Why couldn't he enjoy this without a care in the world? He was huge! Hell, he was bigger than human buildings, stronger than many machines and more muscular than even the most athletic of Wackbat experts or professional athletes he'd ever seen! He was as powerful as a superhero - as powerful as the White Cape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his paw down his muzzle, a small smile coming to his lips. Ah, White Cape. The brilliant martial arts trained freelance detective who had trained himself to the point where lifting cars wasn't unreasonable. Now there was a wonderful thought! Of course, he wasn't a trained detective, and he didn't know of any private labs who did crime scene stuff, but lifting cars was child's play at this point! Although, he didn't actually know any martial arts come to think of it. Well, there was that one move that Kristofferson had thought him, he knew Karate. He shook his head. Ah, why was Kristofferson being so open, it was going to turn out bad, he knew it! Someone was going to come by, maybe the local government for something boring like taxes and then they'd find Kris... He growled and shook his head again. Argh, this was just all so stressful! Even the White Cape had to deal with a lot of stress and problems - science took hours and hours, even from science class he'd picked that up around the same time as the comics told him, detective work was hard, keeping in such great shape took so much effort. He grimaced at the feeling of everything beginning to overwhelm him. He brought a paw up and rubbed his shoulder, slowing down and then pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer amount of muscle under his grip... It was amazing! He took a moment to look over himself, taking in his broad shoulders, his muscular chest and abdomen, his powerful legs, all the way down to his huge paws. Well, if Kristofferson somehow managed to not get found out and he came up with a solution to not getting spotted soon, then he could head back sometime. Then he could teach him Karate, and he could put in lots of effort in school... Man, he could end up the real-life White Cape! Although, not that there was any superhero outfit that could fit him at this size! He let out a snort of amusement as he raised an arm, grinning widely as he flexed a bicep and proudly watched it swell outwards to an impressive degree. Even in his wildest dreams, something like this had seemed impossible before, but now, now he was a giant, he was stacked, and... he could hear something. Was that... yelling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused his confidence - and ego - raising flexing, dropping the pose to strain his hearing as hard as he could to see if he could pick up the voice again. His left ear twitched as the faint but absolutely unmistakable sound of someone screaming for help. He froze up, feeling the fur on the back of his neck stand up straight as he realised that whoever it was, it was undoubtedly a human. Their tone made it abundantly clear that whatever was happening, someone was in serious danger of actually dying. Oh man, oh man, oh man. Oh man, oh man, man, man! Oh man! What was he supposed to do? The White Cape wouldn't have this sort of problem, he'd know what to do! He'd leap into action, lunging into the fray dramatically, crashing through a window, even as the glass scratched his paws, or tackling someone holding a weapon. The White Cape wouldn't just stand there like a useless idiot while someone screamed and begged for help, he'd... he'd... He would help. The White Cape would help, and he was an ordinary fox. Sure, he was pretty much a genius and he was probably a bit of a freak of nature thinking about it pretty hard, but he was still just a normal fox. Ash, on the other hand, was something far, far beyond a normal fox. He could help. He could do something! He could be a hero like the White Cape, and he'd really be helping someone in desperate need! The scream came again. He focused, trying to work out the direction, shifting his huge body to the left, crouching down and bracing himself like a sprinter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, hang on whoever you are! I'm coming!\" He grinned, before pushing himself forward. The earth beneath his paws was displaced as if it had been moved with a digger. He shot forward with incredible speed that surprised even himself. He'd never have expected to be able to run so fast, with all this new bulk. He'd heard in Biology that bears could run like this, although there weren't any around as far as he knew. Bah, now wasn't the time for that, someone was in trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore through the forest, his massive paws slamming heavily into the dirt beneath him as his powerful legs propelled him forward with every step, his cavernous chest heaving with every breath, although he didn't feel exhausted in any way. Leaves and branches smacked him in the face but they were no obstacle to him - he barely even noticed them as he barrelled through them, there wasn't any pain or anything like that. The scream sounded out again, louder. He was getting close now, he could feel it! He couldn't let whoever was in trouble down, they could be badly injured for all he knew. He hoped not, if they were trapped under a tree or something, he could pick it up no problem, but if they really needed medical attention, then he was stuck. Not only was his knowledge of first aid limited, but at his great size, there was nothing he could do anyway. As his shoulder smashed an oak tree to the side, leaving it leaning dramatically in the wake of his passage, he promised himself that he was going to learn first aid as soon as he could. He wouldn't make a very good superhero if he couldn't help anyone! The scream came again, he had to be almost there! They needed to know he was coming, that someone was on their way to rescue them! As his jaws parted, he only just realised that whoever he was about to save was almost definitely a human. The irony wasn't lost on him. However, before he could think about it further, another scream rang out, but this was no cry for help. It was a scream of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get to them now! \"Hold on, I'm coming!\" He bellowed at the top of his substantially larger lungs, hoping to reassure them that help was about to arrive and to maybe scare off any bad guys that might be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he burst through the row of trees in front of him, he skidded to a stop, his thick paws gouging huge trenches out of the soft, wet mud as he slid to a stop where his paws came to rest half-in the cold water of the stream. He froze up, stopping and staring as he caught sight of a man - a human man - lying face down in the dirt. He felt a thrill of panic rush through him at the thought that he might actually be dead, but before he could carry on with that thought, his gaze drifted over to the sizeable pack of equally sizeable wolves who were all crouched, snarling aggressively at the new interloper who had burst through the trees. However, despite their fearsome snarls and angry expressions, even Ash could see it was all largely posturing. They were absolutely terrified of him, and frankly, it sent a rush of smug satisfaction through him as he realised that these fearsome predators, these powerful canines, who were so much bigger than your typical fox, were all utterly terrified of him. For good reason, standing at sixty feet tall, with a weight that he couldn't even begin to guess that left his paws sinking into the mud, and musculature so impressive he actually entertained the thought that it might be able to cut granite. He put on his own snarl, to which the wolves quickly backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a thunderous step forward and the wolves stepped back again. He started stalking slowly towards them, his shadow completely dwarfing them all before they finally scrambled back, scampering into the woods back to their Den. With the threats gone, he turned his attention back to the main situation. The human. He looked exhausted, disheveled and a bit banged up, but apart from what looked like scratches, he was fine. On the outside anyway. He knew enough that you shouldn't move anyone with a head, neck or back injury, but given the situation, he had to. He might stop breathing with all that mud around his face. Rules have exceptions. He gently rolled him over with as tender a touch he could manage, so that his face was facing up at him. His face was obscured by mud, but before he could ask him anything or explain himself, he heard a murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, didn't realise God was a giant, super jacked fox man.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He wrapped a paw around the top of the 40-foot tree, the leaves tickling his paw slightly as he gripped the bit at the top where all the branches split off. He had no idea if it had a particular name, and at the moment, he had no real interest either way. He brought a paw up to his forehead, scratching vigorously, his sharp claws scraping across the skin relaxingly. He loosened his tense grip on the sturdy tree as he returned to pacing anxiously around the small clearing. Well, it was small to him. To the tiny human laid out on the ground, it was certainly very spacious indeed. He shook his head as he tried to calm his racing heart, stomping back over to the other side of the clearing, looking down at the tree that he had kicked out of panicked frustration. It looked as though it had had a boat thrown into it or something really heavy like that. He hadn't meant to kick it so hard, but he must have been stronger than he looked, and given that he looked like he could bicep curl trains without breaking a sweat, he couldn't even begin to imagine just how strong he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised and flexed a leg experimentally, watching how his calf bulged smoothly outwards until it completely dwarfed a fully grown member of its namesake. He blinked as he braced himself against a smaller tree for some form of support, watching as it easily swelled out to what had to be at least double the size of a bull, probably even tripling it if he was generous. All of it was pure, solid muscle, just like the rest of him. He couldn't suppress a grin that crept over his muzzle as he thought back to the White Cape. In the rare shots of him where he was out of his costume, he looked as though he could at least go toe-to-toe with a fully grown wolf and come out on top with barely a few scratches. He could close his eyes and remember the late nights in bed, reading the new edition, lapping up the tales of his epic adventures with glee, marveling at how tough he was, how capable he was and how downright powerful he was. He was everything Ash wasn't then, athletic, intelligent, he could fight his own battles. But now? Now he was even more powerful then the White Cape could ever dream of being! He grinned widely as he turned back around, his grin dropping as he caught sight of the human again. He was still unconscious, to the point where Ash was getting worried. What if he was dead? What if he'd cracked his skull or had a really bad brain bleed and he was slipping into a coma? It wasn't like he could take him to the clinic, the human was simply too big to get in there, never mind trying to even get one of Ash's paws through the doors!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a rumbling sigh, his breath ruffling the smaller man's hair. He was a lot more attractive than those farmers were that was for sure. He couldn't make out his eye colour, given that his eyelids were closed, but his jawline was fairly smooth and his hair, while a complete mess, was quite a pleasing shade, a tone richer than chocolate but lighter than the earth he lay on. His body was certainly nowhere nearly as powerful as his body was, although given how he'd eaten a fair few fruits that had made him what could easily be one of the most physically powerful animals on the planet, he supposed it wasn't exactly fair to compare the two of them. Besides, it was hardly as if he was overweight, sure he looked like he had a bit of a stomach but he sure wasn't fat. With a bit of working out, he was petty sure he could end up a pretty good looking guy, maybe in more ways than one. He paused, shaking his head quickly to dispel his thoughts. What was he doing? He wasn't seriously thinking he was good looking, was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his bewildered thoughts were interrupted by a soft moan that escaped the man's lips. He froze, his eyes going wide as he realised that he had no idea about what to do. The man's eyelids blearily cracked open, as he grunted in pain at the sudden change in light intensity. Ash instinctively moved to cover the sun and give him some shade before he could stop and consider if that was actually a good idea or not. The man slowly opened his eyes further, as he gently pushed himself up on his elbows. Moving his head back and forth to dispel the bleariness he looked up. From the confused expression on his face, Ash was quite sure that all he could see was probably the dark silhouette of some massive thing looming overhead. He let him stare for a few more seconds before slowly drawing back. He could see his face shift from bewilderment to shock as it struck him that he was staring at the impressively muscular stomach of a sixty-foot tall, walking, talking fox. \"Uh, hey there little guy. You, uh, you okay? I mean, considering.\" He mumbled out awkwardly, trying not to alarm him too much.</span></div></div>",

He felt a rush of embarrassment as he realised that he was completely naked, and he could clearly see the man's gaze linger on his lower waist, before continuing down his legs and then back up to meet his gaze. His mouth opened and closed a few times before finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... You! You're... you're real! You're real! Holy... you're really real, I can't believe it! You saved me! You scared those wolves away and, look at you! You're huge! You're absolutely massive!\" He cried, staring in absolute awe at the titanic fox towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt his face flush anew as he chuckled weakly. He couldn't blame the guy for being so freaked out, after all, he'd completely freaked out when he first saw his newfound size after waking up - there was probably still a large dent in his bedroom ceiling that could attest to that. The human lay there, staring up at him, stammering in complete and total shock, obviously struggling to accept the reality before him yet unable to decisively rule it out. \"Yeah, yeah, I guess I am a pretty big guy, huh?\" He grinned proudly, as he felt his chest swell with pride, gleefully reminding himself that he'd never be called little ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded dumbly, still staring in mute shock. He felt a twinge of awkwardness,  he couldn't just stay crouched over him, and he couldn't just leave him all of a sudden. That would be far too awkward, at least when the White Cape left in the middle of a conversation, he could at least do it dramatically, or in a way that didn't make him seem like some high-schooler ducking away after fumbling up talking to their crush. \"So, uh, my name's Ash. What's yours?\" He asked, almost adding a 'little guy' at the end but stopping himself at the last minute. Given how he'd gone through dealing with that his whole life up until this point, it wouldn't exactly be cool to start doing it to others. Even if they didn't even come up to his knees now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence that hung in the air. Ash felt his ear twitch as he stared at the human, and the human stared back at him. He was about to say something, anything to break the tension in the air - he didn't even know what he was going to say, but then the man spoke up. It was a soft, strangled whisper, hoarse and scratchy, but he heard him. \"I'm... I'm Mark.\" He managed to croak out, to which he nodded in response. Best to acknowledge that he'd spoken. If he could convince Mark that he wasn't a threat, then that would make everything so much easier, although he wasn't really sure what to do next. He couldn't take him anywhere, maybe they could just chat? It sounded pretty cheesy as soon as he thought of it, but he didn't really have any other ideas. Besides, he still had to get to that stage first. The natural response to something bigger or more powerful than you is fear, and a  sixty-foot tall, walking, talking fox with a musculature so well built that it looked as though he could crush ships against his chest was considerably bigger than any human would ever be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to meet you, Mark. I'm glad you seem okay. You're not in any pain, are you?\" He asked, hoping against hope that Mark hadn't suffered any broken bones, or even worse, internal bleeding that would only kill him after several hours went by after they'd let their guards down. He'd just have to hope that Mark knew his body, and knew it well enough to tell if anything was obviously out of the ordinary. Different. He bit his lip, a sharp fang pressing gently into the flesh as he pondered the meaning of the word as he'd know it before. Being different certainly wasn't quite so bad now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blinked, looking up at him with the most bewildered expression, slowly digesting the fact that the hulking giant of a fox man looming over him could talk, and not only that, but he seemed genuinely concerned about his physical well-being. He raised a hand and gently pressed at different points and areas around his body, raising different limbs and flexing his fingers and joints. After a few moments of gingerly experimenting and checking for anything obviously injured or painful, he shook his head slowly. \"No, I, I think I'm fine. Apart from this scratch on my arm, but as long as if doesn't get infected, I think I'll be fine.\" He explained, before pausing and diverting his gaze for a moment. \"Uh, how... what... what are you? There is no way you're an ordinary fox, being a giant and looking like you're a pro athlete aside.\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled at that, it wasn't a loud howl of laughter, but the much greater size of his lungs and vocal cords transformed it from a quiet chuckle into a booming peal of laughter that rumbled through his muscular chest. He almost wanted to say that the ground shook, but he wasn't sure if it actually happened or if it was just his imagination getting over-excited. He noted how Mark's eyes went wide though, so whether it shook the ground or not, it sure was louder than he was expecting. \"Well, uh, it's kind of a long story, so I'll keep it kinda short. Oh, uh, you'll want to know about me, like, where I come from and all that, won't you?\" He asked, to which Mark nodded in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded as he let out a rumbling sigh. He turned to look around and gently eased himself down into a sitting position, his firm rear smacking into the ground beneath him, the crunch and rustle of leaves and sticks sounding out and pressing into his rear, although with surprisingly little force. In fact, it wasn't even painful to feel the sticks jag into his flesh, just mildly irritating. He couldn't help but wonder if his greater size had also made his body a lot tougher in general. He would have dismissed the possibility beforehand, thinking the idea was simply something you'd find in one of his other comic books, but now that he was a real, living, breathing giant, the idea didn't seem so ridiculous anymore. He turned back to face Mark. \"Okay, so, settle in, this is going to be a shock.\" He warned, to which Mark snorted. \"Yeah, well, I've been saved from a pack of wolves by a giant, hulking fox, I think I'll manage.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grinned. \"What happened anyway?\" He asked, to which Mark replied. \"Well, we can talk about that after you've explained what's going on, where we can actually introduce each other for real.\" He suggested. Ash couldn't argue with that.</span></div></div>",

Sure, the two of them may be sixty foot tall foxes with muscle mass that would put anyone to shame. But there in lined the problem. Because what if the orange and white furred fox was still venting about his and Kris's argument. What if he was so mad that he went on a rampage in a town? Or stomped on a humans either by accident or on purpose? Of course either outcome was verry bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the blue eyed fox was broken out of his thoughts when he heard Becky's voice when she asked, \"Kris, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah, I guess so. But I can't help but worry about Ash.\" The anthro giant confesed, followed by letting out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the giant anthro's surprise he felt one of hte young woman's hands as it ran across a small part of his open palm when she reassured him, \"Don't worry Kris, I'm sure Ash will be fine. Maybe having some time apart willl be good for both of you.\" Haring this prompted the white fox to look down at the blonde haired human. And upon doing so he saw her look up at him once she had relaized what she had said to which she quickly added, \"But now I hope you know I don't mean to sound rude. But honest families argue with each other every once in a while. So I'm positive Ash will come back at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, right.\" Krist replied, as he nodded his head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant anthro fox then decided that now was the best time to go and get a piece of the fruit so Becky could try and figure out what was inside of it that caused him and Ash ot grow to begin with. But once he had started to walk away from the farmhouse while holding the hand Becky was in right in front of his huge chest, the white furred fox saw a set of paw prints that he knew belonged to Ash. And by the looks of it they appeared to be heading into the forest. And upon a closer look Kris found him mentally sighing with annoyance when he saw many broken trees that were laying on the ground to which he knew his cousin was the cause it. However, he knew that this shouldn't be something he should be worried about, well at least not right now anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he turned to the left and made his way until he had brought the human to the tree where he and Ash had gotten the fruit. Upon reaching there Bris yet again let out a mental sigh, this of relief upon seeing that nothing had really changed since he and Ash had been there. And with that in mind the white furred fox reached up and picked one of the fruits from one of the tree's branches. And once he had done this the two headed back tot he farm house. However, as they did this Kris couldn't help, but smile a little as he felt hope begin to form inside of him since he was certain BEcky could find out what was wrong with the fruit to cause he and Ash to grow. And if she couldn't he at least hoped she'd figure something out. But of course he knew that he'd have to think of somet sort of plan as well since he had know when or if Ash would ever come back to farmhouse.</span></div></div>",

And upon looking at the small spot of juice from the fruit that she had put on the small glass panel the young woman was surprised when she saw that cells of the fruit looked far from a normal fruits cells would. If she fact if she didn't know better she'd honestly saw that the fruit looked mutated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caused her to move away from the microscope and push a bit of her hair behind one of her ears when she said out loud to herself, \"Well I guess I found why both kris and Ash grew after eating some of the fruit. But now the question becomes why? Or maybe yet, how? Since I don't think that's any normal kind of mutation that we're dealing with here.\" She then got up out of her chair and pulled open her to open as she added, \"I'd best let Kris know what I found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right when the human was about to call out to the giant anthro fox she found herself instantly stopping while a blush formed on her face. The reason for this was because about ten feet or so away from the farmhouse Becky saw Kris standing up at his full height of sixty feet. Not only that, but he appeared to be practicing karate. Or at least that's what she remembers the boys at her school calling it that. And she found out that she was right as the white furred fox punched the air a few times before he did a few kicks which not caused his huge muscles to tense and flex. But it also gave the young woman a clear view of the anthro's very firm and muscled backside, before he turned around and did some other punches and kicks to which themn Becky saw the fox's large balls and currently soft member that was in between his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once Becky had looked up past the fox's huge pecs until she saw his face she quickly looked away while she told herself, \"H-He looks busy. Maybe I'll let him know about what I found out later.\" However, once the young woman looked over at the fruit came to her as she picked it up and decided to...</span></div></div>",

She looked began to walk downstairs as she thought out loud to herself, \"Hmm, I wonder if making a pie out of this piece of fruit and baking it in the oven would get rid of the mutation. I mean increased heat does affect other things. So I don't see why it couldn't help make this fruit normal again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to various things out of the fridge and cabinets before she got to work to see if her idea would actually work or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris sat with his legs crossed and his eyes closed as he meditated to think about what has happened so far. As it was still unreal to him at times that he was a sixty fool tall fox with muscles that would put any pro athlete or body builder to shame. However, unlike Ash, who he knew was must likely loving this big and strong. Kris on the other hand was on the fence about it. Sure he could easily defend himself or others now. But now he oculd easily destroy something or hurt someoene by complete and utter accident. And that was the last thing he ever wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was especially true when it came to Rebecca, whom the giant fox felt close to. Although that of been because she was the only who lived on the farm and so the two had a lot of chances to talk with each other. And he knew that if she got hurt because of him or something else, well Kris wasn't for sure what he'd do or how he'd respond to such a thing. Althoug speaking of the human girl the fox caught the smell of something coming from the house, which must of meant the young woman was making something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a few minutes had passed Kris saw the human walk out of the house. And by the looks of it, it seemed that she had baked a pie. Seeing this caused the fox's bushy tail to sway from side to side as she approached. However, upon realizing that his tail was doing that he quickly stopped it while also doing his best not to blush as she got closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once she was in front of him the anthro fox lowered a hand down for her to get onto. After she had done this Kris carefully lifted the hand she was on up to his face while he asked, \"Hey Rebecca, what's the pie for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well, I decided to make a pie from that piece of fruit we got from the tree.\" The young woman explained, to which Kris's eyes widen in shock. Once that happened though he saw the young woman shake her head when she continued with, \"But now I only did this to see if maybe the heat from the oven could get rid of the odd mutation that I saw in the fruit cells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had said this the fox did notice that a piece of the pie was gone as he commented, \"Oh, you had slice of it? How did taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'd rather not say....\" The human confessed with an embarrassed expression on her face. She then looked off to the side and went on with, \"I'm afraid that even if it's baked into a pie it would seem the fruit gave me a slight upset stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see. Well I guess it wouldn't hurt to try it and see what happens.\" Kris admitted, to which he then opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this he saw the young woman tip the plate froward so that the pie would fall into his open mouth. And when he knew that it was there Kris closed his mouth and chewed the food, before he swallowed it easily down his throat and into his stomach. And after a few seconds had passed Kris felt.....</span></div></div>",

He was silent for a few moments more before he finally relaxed his frown and spoke. \"Honestly? I really don't feel any different.\" He admitted. Becky let out a murmur of acknowledgement, as she too fell silent, her brow furrowed in thought. After a brief moment of consideration, she put her thoughts forward. \"So, something about making the fruit into a pie stops it from having any sort of effects.\" She noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristofferson nodded in agreement, his mind already racing at this new discovery. \"Yes, something stops whatever it is that makes us bigger from having any effect. What could that be?\" He mused, before Rebecca piped up.\" It would be so much easier if we knew what this fruit was, but I've never seen anything like it, and I know a fair bit about fruit. I mean, I need to, the wrong conditions or a bad spell of weather could wipe out a crop and a full harvest could just go like that.\" She lamented. Kristofferson grimaced sympathetically. \"I'm sorry to hear that\" He say softly, before he shook his head, focusing his thoughts. \"Anyway, yes, it would help if we knew, but I guess we have to work with what we've got. I mean, it's just us and your microscope, we don't exactly have a high-tech lab with spectroscopy equipment and everything.\" He sighed. \"So, maybe an ingredient? Maybe something physical done to the fruit? Maybe just the heat, it might be that simple.\" He suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, we've got a few possibilities.\" She agreed. \"Well, at least it didn't make you any bigger. That would be a problem.\" She offered. \"I guess.\" She murmured quietly at the end, glancing down at Kristofferson's mighty abdomen, fighting to hide her embarrassed grin. Fortunately, it seemed that Kris had lost himself in thought at the mention of growing. His ears were flattened against his skull and he looked a lot more forlorn that he had a moment ago. \"Kris?\" She asked, to which he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry, I'm just wondering how Ash is getting on.\" He explained, looking over at the treeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, okay, hang on. Just, give me a minute.\" Mark said, running a hand over his face, to which Ash nodded wholeheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill struggling to fully come to terms with everything that had just been revealed to him, he glanced up at the enormous titan sitting across from him. \"Alright, so, let me check that I understand all of this. You're part of a small town of animals that are sort of like people, except they're, well, animals? You've got homes, businesses, a school, a doctor's office, your own sports and everything? And you've all existed pretty much secretly for all this time?\" He asked, rubbing at his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled lightly, keeping his voice down so as not to blast Mark with a full on sonic assault this time. \"Well, pretty much. I mean, we've been kind of known about, with the whole farming incidents, but in the sense that we're not real according to the government? Yeah, that's pretty much how it is.\" He nodded, pausing before continuing with a lopsided grin. \"I guess I can kind of see why it sounds so weird, but considering I'm easily twice the size of some smaller human buildings, it all seems kinda... kinda, you know. What's a good word for it, low-key? No, that's not it. Ach, you get the point.\" He said, gesturing to his massive, muscular frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah, I think I get the point. It's all so weird now, I mean, you and the others like you just existing is kind of weird, I don't even know how that works, but you being a flat out giant and looking like you're an professional bodybuilder, well, that's just even weirder. I can't even imagine what it's like to go from being so small to so huge!\" Mark exclaimed, to which Ash grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge. He was huge. Even that was underselling it. He was a literal giant now, he towered over human buildings and utterly dwarfed his own buildings. It was fantastic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's pretty awesome!\" He smirked, pushing himself up and hauling his great bulk into a standing position, looming over the human at his feet with an almost cocky grin. He raised a thick arm and flexed, the bicep swelling outwards to the relative size of a rugby ball easily. Mark could only stare up at the immense titan in mute awe for a few seconds before he managed to gasp out a response. \"Holy... Oh my god, Ash, look at you! You're massive! You're... you're ripped! I mean, you're obviously ripped, uh, not that I, well I was, uh...\" He stammered, before quickly starting up again. \"You've got the body of a freaking superhero!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stopped at that. A superhero. A superhero. Someone else had told him, in complete seriousness, that he had the body of a superhero. That alone was incredible. He, formerly the short, skinny, out of shape weakling, was now a towering hulk of powerful muscle. He could feel a rush of heat in his chest as he grinned widely. His tail began to wag furiously behind him, shattering an errant branch or two as his eyes seemed to almost light up in joy. \"A superhero, huh?\" He asked quietly, although his tone was still virtually dripping with delight. He brought a hand up and ran it across his abdominals, pressing in against them and delighting in how firm they were. He looked back over at Mark and smirked. \"A superhero, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grinned slightly as he noted how fast Ash's tail was wagging. \"Yeah! You're totally jacked, as they say, I couldn't even guess how strong you are!\" He marvelled, his gaze drifting down to his abs. \"You've got a build that could easily put Captain America to shame!\" He grinned lopsidedly, his eyes moving back up past his mighty chest to meet his eyes again. Ash tilted his head slightly, his left ear twitching as it brushed against a branch, which promptly shattered it into splinters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain America? Who's that?\" He asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Captain America's a comic book superhero, started up in the 40s in the US. It's about a guy by the name of Steve Rogers. He's this really small, sickly guy with a lot of health issues who wants to join the Army, but his physical problems cause him a lot of trouble. Then he's chosen for a project with a super-soldier serum, and when he takes it, he grows into a tall, well-built man who can run really fast for ages, he's a lot stronger, all sorts of things like that. From there, well, he ends up doing all sorts of things for the US Army, and it's since expanded into this great big series with all sorts of other forms like movies and TV and all that.\" He explained, to which Ash nodded slowly, his eyes slightly wide. \"Heh, whadya know? Kinda like me.\" He said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Mark questioned disbelievingly. \"I know you said you were small before, but you were, uh, well, you know, a fox... I guess? I mean, you're a fox, obviously, but there are foxes that aren't like you, ah, you know what I mean. You said you were small before, but I find it hard to believe that you were ever 'small'. I mean, look at you! You're, what, a good fifty, sixty feet tall, something like that? Not to mention you've got a body that most people would, uh, be incredibly jealous over.\" He exclaimed, trailing off slightly at the end. \"You've got a full six-pack, your pecs look like they could tank a missile and you wouldn't even flinch, and your biceps could probably crush a car! The idea that you were ever 'small', even by fox standards...\" He trailed off, as if he were struggling for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know! I used to be so small, so, so weak. I was never really much good at anything athletic, but now? Now I'm a beast!\" He exclaimed excitedly, almost hopping from one leg to the other, nearly giddy with glee. \"I feel like a superhero! I saved you!\" He gasped out suddenly, jerking into standing straight upright. \"Wow. I actually saved someone!\" He whispered softly, his eyes lighting up with awed joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded enthusiastically. \"Yeah, you really did! I can't tell you how grateful I am, by the way. Thank you so much Ash.\" He smiled, to which the huge fox grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem!\" He smiled, curling a paw into a fist and thumping it meatily against his thick chest. \"Say, speaking of Superheroes and that Captain America, I'm guessing you like comic books?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yeah! I really like comic books. They give me a bit of an escape from reality while sometimes also keeping with it just enough to be believable. Sometimes they're really cheesy and funny, just mindless fun and over the top action. Other times, they're hard-hitting and moving and they're gripping, tightly-written stories with compelling characters and thrilling plots. I love how they can do things that just can't happen in reality, while making it feel like they're still in reality, almost like it's the world, just with different laws of physics.\" He explained enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I totally know what you mean! There's this comic book called the White Cape, he's this really tough, athletic and smart guy who investigates and solves crimes, hunts down criminals and helps people in need! He's so awesome! He's got this white suit and cape, you know, White Cape. He's so cool, he knows all sorts of martial arts and he's just the coolest!\" He exclaimed enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, sounds kind of like Batman.\" Mark mused, to which Ash cocked his head. \"I don't know who that is.\" He admitted, to which Mark shook his head. \"Well, I could explain it if you want? Heh, we can just chat about comics if you want?\" He suggested.</span></div></div>",

And so the young woman attemtped to calm down his nerves as she walked up to one of his massive thighs and gently storked it while she told him, \"Don't worry Kris, I'm sure Ash is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so....\" Kris let out, before a sigh escaped his lips. The human then saw the giant fox look down at her when he added, \"Although if these changes that he and I went through had happened a few years ago then I now for a fact that I'd need to be worried about him. But hopefully his staying out of trouble.\" A chuckle then let left him as he went on with, \"But I know it must seem odd for the younger cousin to worry about the older one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't worry Kris. And besides that just proves what a great guy you are.\" Becky reassured the heavily muscled arctic fox, while she attempted not to blush from her own comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this attempt failed when she saw the giant fox look down at her with his own light blush on his face before he softly replied, \"T-Thanks Rebecca...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Although I guess should get back to seeing what else I could make that fruit into if the heat from the oven really did get rid of whatever caused both you and Ash to change into what you both are now.\" The blonde haired young woman explained, as she turned aorund and began to walk back towards her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could get too far away the young woman let out a gasp of surprise when she felt one of the white furred fox's hands wrap around her. She then found herself being gently pressed up against the fox's massive pec as he then laid down and said, \"Before you went and did that Becky. I hope you don't mind me holding you like this for a little while.... And I'm sorry for picking you up without telling you first.. Although I really wish I could help you with trying to figure this all out....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Kris, I'm sure we'll figure this out soon... And sure, that sounds nice. Not only that, but this feels nice honestly.\" the young woman admitted, as the massive fox's right pec rose and fell with his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as it did this she then found herself gently stroking the short fur that was on the massive muscle. And while she did this she thought she not only heard the huge fox murr in delight, but also heard his huge tail sway from side to side in happiness which caused a smile to speard across the young woman's face.</span></div></div>",

She could recall that Ash and Kristofferson had both mentioned hastily that they would be spending the night at a friend's place, but specifics were non-existent. On that note, she could recall very little about what happened at home that night or the whole day in general. She remembered a lot of her and Foxy's investigation of the sewers and the results - some promising locations that could be cleaned up and were there for utilities and things. She couldn't recall much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't remember.\" She answered. Frowning, she returned to her thoughts. She couldn't remember anything else, other than a very vague inkling that something was slightly off, but she couldn't imagine what. It might have been about the boys, but what could it have possibly been? There was nothing unusual about the morning of that day, they had gotten up, had breakfast, they had been chatting casually... Nothing out of the ordinary in that, so why did she feel so uneasy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer musings were interrupted as Foxy's voice once again rang out from the kitchen. \"Do you remember how many nights they said they'd be staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned anxiously as her mind turned to that detail, a rising sense of alarm creeping up her spine as she realised that she could at least recall the answer to that - and it wasn't one she had been hoping for. \"I-I'm sure they only said they'd be spending one night there.\" She called through, trying to ignore the discomfort in her stomach, hoping that Foxy would contradict her claim and that she was simply misremembering the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart sank at his reply, his tone quiet and sombre. \"That's what I thought.\" It had been three days now. That would have been excusable, if they had received any notice that they would be staying longer - while they weren't adults, they were both young men now, both perfectly capable of making decisions for themselves - but they hadn't received any sort of message, not in person from the boys, a friend or a friend's parents, not by letter, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxy...\" She said softly, trying to keep her voice steady. \"You... you don't think...\" She could barely bring herself to even consider the possibility. \"Do you think something might have happened to them?\" She asked, her voice quavering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patter of paws on the floor sounded out as Foxy quickly came out from the kitchen, placing his mug down atop the counter. \"Now Darling, I'm sure the boys are fine. I mean, if they'd been taken, surely we'd have gotten some kind of note, right? I mean, we-\" He started, before he was promptly hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxy, please! Don't joke about that.\" She pleaded, her crestfallen face giving him pause. She let out a sigh, dropping her gaze to the floor. \"Sorry, I know you're worried too, it's just...\" She trailed off, to which he placed a paw comfortingly on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay. Like I said, I'm sure they're fine. There's no indication that they've been taken, so I'm sure they're just out there having fun. They probably just didn't even think that we'd be so worried since they're probably having such a fun time, right?\" He suggested, to which she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Foxy. What if it's because they're hurt? They could be out there... lost and alone and cold and-\" She said, growing progressively more anxious until Foxy raised a paw. Hey, hey, it's okay. Look, how about we go out and take a look for them?\" He suggested. His tone was full of confidence, but she could tell that he was as afraid as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a shaky breath, nodding slowly. \"Okay. Okay, that sounds... that sounds like a good idea. I can't bear the thought of just sitting around while the boys might be in trouble!\" She exclaimed, to which Foxy took a hold of her paws in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. It's okay. It's going to be okay. I'm sure the boys are just fine. But, let's go look for them.\" He assured her, to which she narrowed her eyes, a determined look of focus crossing her face. \"Okay. Let's think about this. Where would the boys have gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy was quiet for a moment, his brow creased in thought before he responded. \"Well, let's see, the logical thing to do would be to go around where their friends live, and ask everyone if they're there or not, and if we happen to come across any clues, then, well, we can go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity gave him a small, soft smile as she nodded. \"Okay. Well, sounds like a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy smiled warmly, letting out one of his trademark charming whistles, clicking his tongue as he snapped his fingers. \"Alright! See, we're making progress already! Right, so, I'll just grab my jacket and I think we'll be good to get out there and start searching!\" He smiled confidently, turning and quickly walking off to fetch said jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity swallowed, as if she were trying to swallow down her rising fears for the boys. Following her husband, she resolved herself to remain calm. As Foxy said, they might have been perfectly fine. Then again... no, she had to stay composed, for their sakes. It would be humiliating for them if she charged in on them with friends in hysterics, and they'd never hear the end of it. If they were, indeed, in danger, then her being calm was essential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their jackets over their shoulders, their plan in place, and their boys potentially in need of their help, they stepped through the door into the invigorating air of the outdoors. \"Alright. Let's see, where should we start first?\" Came Felicity's question.</span></div></div>",

Though the older anthro fox took note of how the footprints seemed to get bigger and bigger after so many steps. Though he could tell that this was bothering his wife as she walked up to him and asked, \"Foxy, are you sure everything is alright with the boys? Because these footprints are the boys that much I'm sure. But they seem to be getting bigger after so many steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear, I'm sure there's a reason for these footprints. We'll just have to find it is all.\" Foxy reassured her, before he saw that they were heading towards a factory. However, upon getting closer to the factory the older fox saw that the door to it was ripped clean off it's hinges and was laying down right up against the building itself. This prompted him to let out his trade mark whistle while he added, \"Well it seems we got our answer dear. The boys were definitely here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What really? Do you think they're still in the factory then?\" His wife asked, hope clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe,m but I'll go check just to be sure.\" Foxy said, as he carefully walked up and pasted the factory door. After doing this the older male anthro poked his head inside and found himself looking on in complete shock when he saw various items and beams from the factory laying on the floor of the factory either in pieces or off of where they were originally completely. He then looked down and saw a third set of footprints, though these seemed like that of a human's as he went on with, \"Hmm, interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then heard his wife walk up next to him before a gasp expected her lips when she let out, \"Oh no, those are a human's footprints. Do you think the boys got hurt? Or worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I doubt that.\" Foxy replied, while he followed the footprints of the human's and then saw how they stopped at the factory and then only the two much larger footprints conitued down a dirt road. He then began to walk down the road, but not before he took his wife's hand to ahve her follow behind hm as he continued with, \"Besides by the looks of it whatever human came by the factory didn't run out of it after seeing the boys. So we'd best follow thse prints the rest of the way and see where they go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's smart Foxy? What if the human who's there has a gun or something?\" Felicity asked, now with worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry dear, if something like that did happen you know that I'd make sure you'd be safe.\" Fox assured his wife, as he turned to give his wife a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I know you would and will dear. But I just hope the boys will be okay.\" The female fox commented, while they continued to walk down the dirt road wondering what could of happened to the boys and if they were still safe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As far as Felicity was concerned, she had performed an admirable job in maintaining her composure throughout this ordeal. However, it was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain said composure on account of both the increasing length of time it had been since she'd last seen them and, more pressingly, the extraordinarily large pawprints they were walking alongside. While the prints had been cast out of sheer force in the mud before - that type of soil had been so wet it was less soil and more muddy water, so those six foot deep prints were likely very misleading, or so she hoped - these prints had been cast from mud. However, the constant movement of travelling had clearly allowed for some of that mud to be transferred, so while the prints had been perfectly clear at the beginning, they had become less and less visible, up until right now, where it was difficult to see even a trace of the prints, even when looking closely. Unable to keep quiet anymore, she spoke up and voiced her concerns to her husband. \"Foxy... are you sure the boys are alright? I mean... I don't understand why these prints could possibly be so huge... and why were they exploring the ruins of that old factory?\" She asked uneasily, to which Foxy promptly replied in a reassuring tone. \"Don't worry dear, I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason! Like I said, we'll just have to find it. It's no good guessing, but the boys must surely have their reasons. Like the factory, I'm sure they just wanted to have a look around and explore, they were probably just curious!\" He smiled, although this only eased her fears for the factory, leaving her baffled concerns regarding the prints still unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet sigh and a small shake of her head, Felicity ultimately decided to take her husband's advice and did her best to put her fears to one side. He was right, guessing wasn't going to get them anywhere fast. On the contrary, if anything, it was only going to slow them down. Plus, it was only going to get her more and more anxious about everything, and that most definitely wasn't going to help anyone. No, it was best to try and stay calm and just follow the trail. Well, the road, in this case, given that most of the prints were only barely visible now. Thankfully, the road only went in one direction - there had been no turn offs, no crossroads or T-junctions, no side roads, nothing of the sort. So figuring out where exactly the boys could have gone was not exactly difficult. Especially given that there was no indication that the boys had gone off the beaten track. There were no disturbances in the vegetation or anything like that. Even better, while she couldn't be exactly sure until she got closer, it looked like the road turned off ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... was a good sign. Or at least, she certainly hoped so. It would be cruel to have her hopes raised only for them to be so promptly shattered. Sparing a glance in her husband's direction, she noted that although he had remained silent, he was clearly as hopeful as she was. She could see it. The signs were subtle, but they were there. The twitch of his whiskers. The look in his eyes. The twitching of his fingertips as they approached ever closer. She could only hope she was right. Hopefully the boys were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would finally get some answers too, like what was up with these bizarre prints all over the place? Why on earth had the boys felt in necessary to make such extraordinarily large prints? For that matter, how did they make those prints in the first place? Why had they been exploring that factory when it was in such poor shape? Why hadn't they come home yet? No, no, don't think about that too much. Panicking would only make things worse for everyone. Now would be a terrible time to get all worked up into hysterics. Besides, they were about to find out. Hopefully. But they had to be here. Their scents led down this path. They were faint, certainly, masked by the smell of farmlands, but it was there. They must have been nearby. Surely?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her concerns to the wayside for now, she pressed on alongside Foxy, her paws moving along the rough dirt path with a determined speed. As she rounded the bend, however, her gait slowed to a stop, her eyes widening as a thrill of panic struck her. As Foxy stopped in tandem, she couldn't help but voice her alarm. \"Foxy! It's a farm!\" She cried, grasping his arm as she pointed to the sign with her other paw. He took her paw in his gently, speaking with a reassuring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, it's okay honey. It looks bad, but we can't assume the worst. The boys could be entirely fine. We have to have hope.\" He said gently but firmly, to which she nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay... but we have to be careful. Who knows what the humans living here are like?\" She replied, to which he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, honey. We're not going to rush in, we'll take it nice and slowly.\" Foxy said confidently, before they quickly rushed ahead, rising over the small incline of the road before they stopped in their tracks as they beheld an incredible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment, neither fox moved an inch, standing there, stock still as their brains sluggishly attempted to process what their eyes were seeing, trying to reject it, or rationalise it for how completely impossible it seemed, but unable to do either with how undeniably real it was. There, across from the shattered ruins of what looked like some sort of barn or other such structure, sitting some distance away from them, with what was unmistakably a human in his paw, was Kristofferson. He was almost unrecognisable. Towering far above their heads like some sort of titan, Kristofferson was easily several times the height of the farmhouse, and that was only made even more impressive considering he was sitting cross-legged on the ground. His height most definitely was not the only way in which he had grown, however. His formerly slender, if toned, frame had filled out with enough muscle to easily bump him up into the range that was probably pushing the upper limits of heavyweight and approaching the lower limits for super-heavyweight. His eight-pack abdominals were set in a solid cobblestone grid just below a pair of pectorals that barrelled out several inches. Nothing but pure, solid muscle. His limbs had not been spared any growth, however, with his biceps easily rivalling the size of his pectorals, his calves easily several times the size of fully-grown members of their namesake. He was an absolutely hulking beast of a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxy?\" Felicity spoke, in a voice that was barely a whisper. She was so stunned she could barely even recognise the voice as her own. She felt... like everything around her was slightly transparent, as if it wasn't all quite real. Like some sort of... facsimile. A fake version of reality, almost as if she was dreaming. \"Is that...\" She began to ask before trailing off, unwilling to ask the question out loud, as if it might break some sort of illusion. As if the sight before her might become true. She'd wanted to know if Kristofferson was safe, and he so very clearly was, but... he was enormous! He'd turned into some kind of giant! Was he okay? Had this hurt him? Would it hurt him? How was he feeling? What had caused this? There were so many questions... still, at least she now had answers to some of the earlier questions. That was why they had made such huge prints... and no wonder they felt comfortable going into the ruined factory, with how huge he was. But where was Ash?! Was he okay? Had the same thing happened to him as well, or was he still as he always had been? There were still so many questions! \"Kristofferson...\" Foxy breathed, jolting her back to reality. There was no denying it. It was Kristofferson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing a quick glance in Foxy's direction, she took a few tentative steps forward, her pulse picking up as her paws padded over the rough terrain of the path. She thought she heard Foxy say something, but if he did, he stopped himself partway through. He quickly rushed to join her as the two of them began to walk up towards their nephew who now towered over not only them, but their very home, and even the homes of humans! \"Kristofferson!\" She called out to him. His ears perked up instantly, his tail lifting up in surprise at the sudden voice. Both he and the human held aloft in his paw whipped around to see the pair of them walking up the path, his expression slipping into what could only be described as a mixture of dumbfounded shock, alarm, embarrassment, and... a little bit of confidence and relief too as the human said something that she couldn't quite hear, to which Kristofferson replied with a response in the affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Uh... hey! Uh... you, uh... I see... I see you can, well, see me...\" He murmured quietly, diverting his gaze, to which Foxy gave a weak chuckle before letting out a whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, it's kind of hard not to Kristofferson...\" He trailed off, gesturing to his enormous, muscular body with a sweeping gesture. The silver fox shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'll explain that later. For now, I guess you've got a lot of questions, huh?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes, we must certainly do, young man. Felicity let out, with both a bit anger and relief in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Kris couldn't help but cringe a bit despite his truly gigantic size knowing that his aunt might be cross with him. Though when he looked down he found himself letting out a mental sigh of relief when he saw his Uncle place a hand onto the female fox's shoulder before he chined in with, \"What your Aunt is trying to say is that we'd like for you to start at the beginning. Like how and when did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard this the sliver furred fox nodded his head in understanding as he explained, \"Well um both Ash and I went exploring down in the sewers one day and we well, we kind of ran into this really odd tree that had some oddly shaped fruit on it. And even though I told Ash that we should leave alone he brought back home with us any way and we both ate some of it.\" The giant anthro then used his free hand to mentoin to his body as he went on with, \"And well that's how it started since we woke and saw that we had gained some muscle night and were a little bit taller too. Then after breakfast we went back to the tree and ate some more of the fruit. That's when we took a nap and when we woke up we saw that we had grown again and we knew we couldn't fit in the sewers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so that's why you both asked if you stay a t friends place is that it?\" Foxy questioned, now with a hand underneath his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right....\" Kris let out, as he did his best not to blush out of embarrassment for what he was going to say next. Though after swallowing a lump in his throat he added, \"That's was actually after we found that factory and took everything out of it and slept in there for the night.... Though by the morning we ended up growing again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I take it that's when you ran into that young lady who is your massive paw right now?\" The older male fox asked, to which Kris blushed a bit darker now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, though to be fair we didn't run into her. It was well more like she found us after passing by the factory. And after that happened she was nice enough to let both Ash and I stay on her famr here with her since she's lived alone here for quite a few years now.\" The blue eyed fox said, before he carefully set the human down the ground. And upon doing so he kept on going with, \"Uncle Foxy, Aunt Felicity, this is Rebecca. Rebecca, this Ash's parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fox watched with baited breathe as the young woman pushed some of her hair behind one of her ears before she let out, \"It's um very nice to meet you both. Though I'm sorry that both of you had to find your nephew in this state. I've been trying to find a way to turn him back to normal. ...Though I haven't found any sort of major lead as of yet that can reverse it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you Rebecca. Thank you for looking after our nephew.\" Foxy responded back, with a soft smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you dear. But where's Ash?\" Felicity asked, while she looked from left to right to find her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um well I'm sorry to say that he decided to leave a while ago....\" The blonde haired young woman replied, saddness clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? He left? By why would he do that?....\" Ash's mother asked, fear and worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I um well I'm afraid it's my fault since I wasn't expecting them to have another growth spurt when they got here..... And he well....he outgrow my family's barn.\" Becky confessed, while she turned away not wanting to see the hurt looks on the other two foxes faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise however, after saying this she felt one of Kris's giant fingers gentle rub her back when he told her, \"No Rebecca, it wasn't your fault at all.\" The sliver fox then looked down at his Aunt and Uncle again when he added, \"Ash pretty much was acting like a total jerk and didn't even apologize for what he did. So he and I had an argument. And.....he deiced to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? He went into the forest! But if he....he.....\" Felicity began, before she started to break down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did cause Kris to look away not wanting to see his Aunt like this. Though thankfully his Uncle was on top of situation as he told her, \"Now dear, there's no need to worry. If Ash is nearby as big as Kris is then he should be fine out there on his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Foxy we have to go after him!\" The female fox pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we will dear.\" The older fox replied, as he held his wife in his arms. Kris then saw him look up at him when he continued, \"So Kris, which way did Ash walk off to after you two had your argument?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this the giant fox pointed away from the farmhouse and said, \"He went that way, Uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this the older male fox nodded his head and started to guide his wife away from the young human woman and the giant sized Kris. Though the sliver furred fox couldn't help but worry about his Aunt since he had no idea how'd handle seeing her son being so massive fi she had a hard time handling what happened to him and he was only his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once the two foxes were completely gone from sigh t Kris let out a very heavy sigh and wonder what would happen next. As it so happens...........</span></div></div>",

Grow and shrink the characters, or put them in contact with others who might be of different sizes. Make them more muscular. Progress or regress their ages. Or change them in some other way. No rules to start with, but try and stay literate, please, and try to make your chapters at least a few paragraphs long.
