Despite its massive size and its vast quantity of amenities, which include a spa, movie theater, performing arts stage,  pool, shopping center, fully stocked bar and others, it is surprisingly accommodating for all budgets. Characters from anime, video games, animation and other animated genres frequent this exotic locale for some time away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle do any of them know that upon entering the building, they unwittingly become test subjects for the pair who own the hotel: Professor Roto and Doctor Scope. The married couple love swapping around their guests to experiment with various interactions and scenarios. Roto (the wife) deals with mental manipulation while Scope (the husband) alters bodies and clothes to his and his wife's specifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey purchased the land and built the hotel all within a manner of a couple years. Of course, they saw to the construction of their laboratory themselves, as that was where they would be spending most of their time. They couldn't wait to try out all the procedures they had spent years perfecting in other regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, their first priority was to perform a procedure on them all to make sure they accepted whatever happened in the hotel as reality. With all the preparations in place, the couple happily kissed as they saw the first guests walk into the Anima Hotel.</span></div></div>",

From the comfort of their shared surveillance room, Professor Roto and Doctor Scope contemplated the new arrivals, Scope stroking his chin while Roto clasped her fingers together in interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Marco! It's not every day a weird, huge hotel filled with supposedly everything in the known universe shows up out of nowhere!\" The first character, bouncing around like a little girl on a sugar rush, was certainly an interesting being. With pure blonde hair long enough to reach her knees (being rather reminiscent of one of those fairy tale princesses, Roto noted), pale blue eyes that always seemed to be wide open and - perhaps oddest of all - heart-shaped markings on her cheeks, she definitely wasn't human. Add to that her princess getup consisting of a lime-green dress, purple striped stockings, a red devil-horned headband and dark-purple monster-themed boots, and you have a strange individual in every aspect. Both Scope and Roto looked paricularly giddy at the idea of transferring some of her traits, be they physical or mental, onto some other sap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Star, something about this just feels... weird...\" Being dragged by the arm was a much plainer individual; a skinny, latino teenage boy wearing a red hoodie, brown pants, and beige shoes. He had tanned skin, brown eyes that matched his equally-brown hair, and a beauty mark on the side of his face. Compared to his female comrade, he wasn't particularly visually striking, but he still looked perfectly attractive for a teenage boy. <i>Besides,</i> Scope noted, <i>I like a blank canvas for my work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of the two mad scientists studying their every move, Star and Marco walked up to the reception desk, where one of the hotel's workers currently had their back turned to them. Undaunted, Star slammed down on the bell, prompting the person to turn around. \"Hello, worker lady, me and my boyfriend Marco here were-OH...\" What had initially appeared to be a female worker with long dirty blonde hair and a slender figure had now turned around to reveal a teenage boy's face, but with a large handlebar mustache and gigantic bushy eyebrows. \"Hewwo? Wouwd you wike to book a woom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh...\" Both were struck speechless for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" And with that, the extremely strange being with a little girl's voice handed Marco a pair of keys and went to go check on some of the other guests. \"It's on the thiwd fwoor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, ma'am.\" The latino boy said, and the two promptly headed to their hotel room. \"I still think there's something weird about this...\" He muttered under his breath, but dismissed the thought because of the inhibition-suppressing procedures. \"Good thing I live and breathe weird, huh, Marco?\" Star pointed out, before she dragged her hoodie-wearing boyfriend into one of the hotel elevators. She, too, no longer had any idea of anything being anything more than slightly odd.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kinda boring...\" Indeed, what they didn't know was that the two scientists had actually slowed down the elevator from their control room, as they were currently in the process of deciding what to do with the duo. Should they take both or only one right then and there? Should they let them get to their hotel rooms and decide from there? Or should they go for another set of characters elsewhere in the hotel?

First; the guests are all from animated media. Anime, video games, machinima, Western animation; if it's animated, it counts. Second: the ones doing the swapping are a husband and wife duo who love swapping anything between guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll allow sex, but no killing off characters. I'll retain the right to add more rules as time goes on. Other than that. have fun!!</td>",
