Tails, who was flying in the air like a helicopter by his rotating twin tails, floated down to his exhausted friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sonic!\" he encouraged, \"Your almost there! Just little bit further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked up the hill, dismayed about how far he still had to go. \"Not sure I'll make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make it to the top,\" said Tails slyly, \"I'll make you a chilly-dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the mere mention of his favorite snack, the blue hedgehog grew more enthusiastic. To be honest, anything involving junk food and not having to move all day was enough to grab Sonic's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife on the planet of Mobius have been slow. It has been a while since the evil Dr.Eggmam plotted anything and, growing bored from running the same paths day after day without any excitement, Sonic had grown lax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd obese. The blue hedgehog's body was resembling more the Michelin man these days than his typical bulbous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's belly jetted out before him by one foot, a doughy thing that spilled over his waist and almost reached his knees, decorated by lovehandles on his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this sack of fat was his well defined moobs, and above them rested his two chins. His arms resembled that of sausages and his thighs as thick as tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough their diameter regressed as it approached his feet, his legs were still thick enough to put some strain on his socks, causing it to tear in some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic had gotten severely out of shape, and his friends was determined to get him fit again, no matter how brutal it would be. They feared the day he would end up unable to defend Mobius against their nemesis...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" said Sonic enthusiastically, and began to semi-waddle as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the hill, holding a stopwatch and eating a taco, was Knuckles, watching as the duo came up the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly half an hour,\" he said when the finally reached the finish line, \"That's five minutes more than your last time. You're getting slow, bud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, who looked ready to pass out from exhaustion, sat down, his body asking like jello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Knuckles a sharp glare and said, \"Cut me some slack, man. It's not like you're in the best shape either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles only chuckled and said, \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deep down he knew what Sonic meant. Life on Mobius has been slow and boring for him as well. He was gaining weight too, but unlike the corpulent blue hedgehog he hid it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snacked in private and sucked in his developing belly most of the time. Knuckles really didn't want to go through the torture Sonic was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's my chilly-dog?\" Sonic asked Tails after he rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fox only shook his head. \"Sorry, Sonic, but you can't have one,\" he said, \"You need to avoid them to stay in shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you lied to me?\" Sonic said accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to,\" said Tails, smiling apologetically, \"You couldn't give up on me at that last stretch. I had to use some kind of encouragement. Can't blame me for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed. \"I guess you're right,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean you can get a diet soda,\" said Tails, handing him a can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic smiled and accepted the soda happily, saying, \"I guess I should be grateful for that at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went home, knowing little that someone was plotting something against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it and what was the plan?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Speaking of chins, Tails now had four, each one bigger than the last, leading up to a face so full of fat that Tails had to squint to see.

His stomach began to rumble, and he rubbed his bulging gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked at the clock and saw, to his mild surprise, that it was almost midnight. \"Well, I guess I can take a break,\" he said to himself and jumped off the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was dark and silent, except for the light streaming out of the fridge. As tails looked for anything to eat, his larger than usual rump and twin tails the only thing sticking out of the fridge, he was unaware of a hulking figure approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it looks like I'm not the only one looking for a midnight snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails jumped, bumping his head, dropping the armful of food he was gathering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Knuckles apologized, grinning sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" said Tails, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox then began to gather the food again, and Knuckles noted the large quantity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to make a sandwich or lay out a buffy?\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this? No, no, it's just...well, to get me through the night. You know me. I like spend my time inventing stuff, so I need to keep my energy up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weak excuse, Knuckles knew. Of late, the fox had been gorging more and more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it shows,\" he commented both to himself and Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat fox blushed. He hated it when Knuckles teased him about his increasing weight, yet it was true. He was getting pretty fat of late with nothing to do but sit all day, eat and invent things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shame as well, seeing that everyone was adopting a more athletic lifestyle of late. The girls were getting into gymnastics, Sonic added an extra 20 kilometers to his 30 kilometers run, and even Knuckles worked out more often, looking even beefier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here he was, getting wider every passing day...but not for long, he knew. Tails was working at the moment on something that would help him lose weight much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to run or diet. Science would fix his problem! Excusing himself, he left to finish his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he left, Knuckles watched him, sometching blooming inside him he couldn't quite explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't dislike it that Tails was gaining weight, and that bothered him. Being the extremely athletic type, he knew he was supposed to be repulsed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't. In fact, he was fascinated by how Tails was growing. For some reason, he wanted him even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles shook his head, shook the thought away. No, he can't think that. What was wrong with him? He decided that it will go away eventually if he ignored this bizarre urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that things will be far different in the coming future.</span></div></div>",

Now he was forced to hide out in the normal Mobius hoping that nobody reconized him or worse Sonic would find him. Scourge's stomach grumbled which reminded him that the last meal he ate was that so called \"prison food\" he had been given. He was starving and would do just about anything for a meal, he got a good look around his surroundings and concluded he was in some kind of jungle. Scourge cursed out loud because Mobius and the anti- Mobius had differnt geography so his sense of direction was off. Managing to find a clearing Scourge noticed a house facing a cliff and figured if it wa sabandoned he could loot the place, or if it was occupide he couldpretend to be a starving travler. Although he could play it safe and go looking for fodd in the jungle there had to be fruit on trees someplace.</span></div></div>",

She sighed. While not exactly a social butterfly, Blaze was perfectly friendly, but when she had set out to go shopping, the last person she wanted to run into was Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" Blaze sighed. She had no real reason to hate the bat, she hardly knew her to be perfectly honest, but while being a princess had granted Blaze many things in her life, there was one thing Rouge had that Blaze was never able to attain. Two things, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy seeing you here!\" Rouge smiled, crossing her arms in such a way that her already impressive chest pushed out even more, \"How are you, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" Blaze muttered, trying and failing to take her eyes off of Rouge's figure. She swore the bat got curvier every time she saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find something you like, or just browsing?\" Rouge winked, catching onto Blaze's prying eyes and grabbing her breasts to show them off even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze felt a blush spread across her face, she'd been caught red handed. \"I...Ah...\" She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen with embarrassment, she could only watch as a playful grin spread across Rouge's face, and the woman took hold of Blaze's free hand. Before Blaze could protest, her hand was yanked into Rouge's chest, and vanished into the cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you doing???\" Blaze cried, completely taken aback by the public display<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, The other day I found something special...\" Rouge started, \"I'm not usually one to part with my gems, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out Blaze's hand, and the cat realized that she'd taken hold of a necklace hidden within her bosoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably need this more than I do...\" Rouge finished. Before Blaze could ask about her behavior, the bat girl spread her wings and took off, shouting a final \"Let me know how it goes!\" before disappearing into the distance, leaving behind a very confused princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace was quite pretty, a gold chain adorned with many sparkling gems, but it wasn't really Blaze's style. Still... The way the bat had looked at her... What was this necklace supposed to do, exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Blaze fastened the chain around her neck and went back to her errands. It was just a piece of jewelry, after all. What's the worst that could happen?</span></div></div>",
