She didn't want to admit she was stuck with a musical version of a <i>Writer's Block</i>, as there wasn't much spark or anything worthwhile inspiration for another song piece by her. Since then, she'd found herself bored and eating... quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis honestly has been a bit of a drag...\u201d the blonde grumbled between her shoving mouthfuls of ice cream into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping up what was dangling from her lips, before letting out a small burp, Taylor heaved herself over from her comfortable laid spot, where she lifted her shirt and tried cleaning some ice cream droplets on her stained top. She'd gained some weight since her inactivity, sporting a bit of a pudgy belly that was poking out under her white shirt; since she had been out of work.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three months was a long time for the singer to be so inactive and listless. She knew it, but as the weeks wore on Taylor found it harder to get up and get moving. She just had no motivation. But more and more she realized that if she let herself just sit around like this waiting for inspiration to hit, it never would. As much as she enjoyed the first few days of lounging around and eating, after that she it just depressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out,\" she told herself. She said to herself standing in front of the TV. She brushed some crumbs off her shirt, unable to get the iced cream stain out. She walked to the bathroom to dab some water on it. Her tummy, always perfectly flat, now bounced just a little as she walked. Taylor had spent most of the last three months in sweats, yoga pants, and t-shirts, and had honestly not noticed that her famously long, slim figure was looking softer. Not that it looked much softer, but even five pounds on her fatless body did show up, if subtly. Mostly, she looked a little bloated, and her belly button had a slight depth to it that wasn't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor felt that something was off, but much of that was how little activity she had been up to lately. Her limber body was stiff and a little sore. She stretched as she walked back to her living room, her white t-shirt only a little less stained, but at least presentable, she thought. She was blissfully unaware of her softer tummy, or even her slightly fuller breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the TV, then turned it off. She went to put the ice cream away and found that the pint she had been eating was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" she said with an embarrassed giggle to herself as she patted her stomach. That had been a brand new pint when she opened it hours ago. She tossed it in the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, just go somewhere,</i> the thought burst on her, and Taylor heeded. She did run a brush through her hair and did some light make up, but otherwise left the house as is, in a stained t-shirt that rode up on her midriff and casual but flattering yoga pants. She drove for fifteen minutes, not knowing where to go, only that she had to go somewhere, and the first place she saw was her favorite coffee shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect!</i> She could get a drink and a snack. It was past lunchtime after all. As she approached the counter and ordered, she wondered if they would comment on her absence recently. She knew people had noticed she hadn't been around. Her friends had updated her sporadically on people asking \"Whatever happened to Taylor Swift?\" on social media, which she had avoided while she she sat around with her writer's block. The barista, did recognize her, and greeted her pleasantly, but didn't ask where she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And give me two of those sausage croissants,\" Taylor said, her mouth almost watering looking at them. For a brief moment she almost took the order back, as she did feel full from all the ice cream she had spent the morning eating, but then didn't. She was hungry after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" the barista asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Taylor pause.\"What do you mean?\" Something about the question irritated her, and it must have showed, because the barista looked embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor enjoyed sitting outside, something she hadn't done in three months even though her home was also perfect for that. She watched people go by, enjoying it when somebody obviously recognized her, or pointed her out to a friend. She virtually inhaled both of her sausage croissants, smothered in cheese and loaded with carbs and fat, and felt full and satisfied. She leaned back in her chair, took in the lovely summer breeze, and tried to relax in a way she hadn't really been able to do while moping about at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp,\" she blushed as a little belch escaped her, and she rubbed her full stomach, tugging her shirt down to cover the bit of her middle it revealed. She was feeling better already just having left her house.</span></div></div>",

However, the fact that she didn't instantly shoot the idea down gave Karlie Kloss, and Gigi Hadid, hope that they had another conspirator on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't hurt her, not <i>really</i>,\" Karlie said. \"If anything it might do her some good. Give her some humility.\" Gigi nodded in agreement. Selena knew that was bullshit. Karlie might not have quite the level of ego and vanity as Taylor Swift had, but she was quite arrogant herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the celebrity elite magic has long been something that many know about, and many even use to their advantage. In most cases it's for mundane but career-oriented purposes, generally involved with looking young, staying thin, but that doesn't mean there isn't a darker side. Karlie found access to that darker side. She had discovered some some fellow models in Paris had hired a local magical consultant to keep them all looking thin and pretty-by stealing the youth and vigor of their agents. Karlie was intrigued. She had no doubt that she could maintain her tall, lean figure indefinitely, and was certain that with her careful diet and exercise her figure was safe. She was more intrigued by using something similar against somebody. Partly to teach them a lesson, partly because Karlie loved to a fellow gorgeous celebrity fall from grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the obvious target was Taylor Swift. Once the best of friends, Karlie and Taylor had grown apart. Recently Taylor had been practically ignoring her in social settings, something Karlie thought Taylor was doing to purposely embarrass her. She was right, to a point, but it was more a casual disinterest in Taylor's part than actively disliking her former friend. But what really bothered Karlie was that even when they were friends Taylor would belittle her profession. She'd make snide comments about how she could be as good a model as her, make fun of her when Karlie claimed she had a rough day, and on several occasion posed passive aggressive responses on social media to photos implying that relaxing and working for a model were the same thing. Karlie acknowledged that Taylor was beautiful, and could probably model as well as her if she were a bit more graceful, but thought Taylor had a narrow, insulting opinion of models in general. Her motive, then, was revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi was never bothered by Taylor's comments, probably because Taylor was nice if condescending towards her. She was onboard when Karlie came to her with the plan simply because, unlike Karlie, Gigi was not as confident in her ability to maintain her figure. She liked to eat, hated to work out, and only did so so she could maintain her perfect body. If Karlie had an easy solution, maybe magic might be the way, whether or not Taylor was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarlie wasn't sure Selena would be on board at all. Her and Taylor went way back. But something lately told Karlie that Selena wasn't quite as enchanted by Taylor as she once was. That happens to friends over the years. A few off hand comments told Karlie that Selena thought Taylor had been taking their friendship for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhp,\" Selena thought, mulling the idea over in her head. \"You know, she didn't even help me move last year. Went some island a few days before even though I told her when the big day was.\" Karlie looked sympathetic. Not helping her move was not going to be the motivation to fatten her. \"And the other day, you know what she said? We were having some hamburgers and she actually poked my stomach and offered to eat mine for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Gigi said in disbelief. Selena was as thin as ever now, her stomach only a little soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch,\" Karlie added, \"She does think she's better than everyone, even her best friend, doesn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt her, but I wouldn't mind embarrassing her a little,\" Selena said a smile grew across her face. \"You know who else would want in? Camila, she's really upset with Taylor right now. Well, by upset, I mean jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi had her phone and was texting her. \"Oooh, good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, want to hear what I have in mind?\" Karlie asked, passing a celebratory daiquiri to Selena and Gigi.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Camila headed right over Selena's when Gigi texted her. Once there, the three eagerly waited for Karlie to explain. While hesitant, Selena was now getting excited about the prospect of putting a few pounds on her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, ladies, here's a little spell I picked up in Paris. It's so brilliant, you're going to love it. All we have to do is cast this spell,\" Karlie held a parchment in her hand that looked right out of a fantasy movie, \"and every sugary, fattening, carb-filled calorie any of us take in will go straight to Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really possible?\" Selena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it's not I'm willing to try,\" Camila said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi clapped her hands with glee, Karlie just smiled knowingly. She had pulled the perfect group together for this. Every one of them had some reason to want to take part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Karlie, it was a combination of growing annoyance with Taylor's attitude, combined with her ignoring her, and also simple jealousy. Karlie always wanted to be the prettiest girl in the room, and while she thought most of her fellow models were a little below her level, she always thought of Taylor was being at least as pretty as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Gigi, it was concern for her own weight. Even though she kept it in check, she always worried that her junk food habit would ruin her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Selena, it was being disenchanted with her best friend, who had been distant and standofish lately. And more than that, Taylor had taken to making comments about her weight, even though Selena was on the light end of her yo-yo weight pattern right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Camila, it was a combination. When she had left Fifth Harmony she had thought of her self as the hot, thin, petite member going off on her own. She almost instantly started putting on weight. At first she was upset, then she learned to appreciate her rounder breasts and even her fuller behind. But then the weight kept coming, her breasts stopped growing, and it became obvious that weight was going all to the bottom of her short figure. She still thought of herself as cute and sexy, but was worried that she couldn't stop gaining. Even now, her stomach had gone from perfectly flat, to soft, and was now always sticking out and jiggling when she walked. The corset she wore on stage often to hide it were getting less effective. Even her face had gotten soft. Another few pounds and she'd have a potbelly and a double chin. Even though she wasn't quite fat, or even really chubby, she felt like a whale in the company of tall goddesses like Karlie and Gigi, and even Selena made her feel self-conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarlie could see all that on Camila's face. She looked her short friend up and down with disapproval. <i>She really has gotten plump,</i> she thought, but said nothing. Unlike Taylor, Karlie didn't enjoy mocking her friends for their weight gain to their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can we do it? And how long does it last?\" Camila asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the right attitude, Camila,\" Karlie said with a laugh. \"We can do it tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Gigi said, almost as eager as Camila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said that it lasts a week or so normally. You can renew it and make it last longer but apparently it gets harder and turns into a whole big thing so it might not be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can drop ten of the twenty pounds I gained in that time I'll be happy,\" Camila said, \"Especially if it all goes to Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's more like thirty, dear,</i> Karlie thought, but didn't say. Camila would clearly benefit the most from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to need some candles, and some spices, and some special incense...\" Karlie laid out the parchment and began explaining the complicated ritual involved. They all felt the tingle of excitement, and also fear of joining a pact like this as none of them had experience with magic before. Selena was the only one who felt a little guilt, but the excitement, and the thought that Taylor needed a lesson, overruled that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all going to want to have a seat, this could take a while. But by tomorrow night, Taylor's going to be feeling a lot fuller than she ever felt before...\" and Karlie began the long ritualistic process.</span></div></div>",
