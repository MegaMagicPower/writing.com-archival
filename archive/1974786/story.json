Dark cliffs and black sand littered the world endlessly, and the gentle blanket of grey clouds overshadowed the landscape. No sun ever shown, the wind was brief and world silent. However, it was far from unlively. If one were to pay attention closely in this world, they'd see it's inhabitants are very much about, skittering the edges of it's voiden chasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrive in a flash and leave the dusk of their world just as quickly, like wisp of light coursing through the air. These creatures need not stay in their world for long, although they assuredly will make travel through it. The very moment they enter, another entryway provides their exit and they're warping through portals and passageways to unlimited universes. Once they come across a world, they do what they're naturally inclined to do, mess around with their inhabitants and manipulate them freely. With their powerful abilities, it's not hard, and nobody is off limits or could ever stop them from their play. Save for their queen, Malaise, should she choose victims of her own, are hers to toy with. The rest of the species have no restrictions, nor do they on their own appearances or victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne briefly zapped through it's banal planet for an instant, and than in less than a second was gone again toward's it's next world. It would find new souls to tempt and play with, all for it's own amusement. Perhaps even a game of Musical Swap was in order. Either way, it'd have an interesting time. The Imp worked out it's options while it arrived at it's next destination.</span></div></div>",

Academy graduates were exiting their schools to leave off, hoping to be shinobi, just as Chuunin and Jonin, elite ninja set out to make their way into the world.

It saw them to be short and tall, male and female, but nudged and fickled with what sort of host should be the victor of it's selection, the one to play it's games and have the honor of presenting it a fine show. Looking into their minds was another criteria, but often it wouldn't wield very interesting results. Most people in this Village had known peace for too long, had very disciplined and single track minds, and very little result varying from predictability should it choose to intervene. The nameless imp was starting to think maybe this world wasn't fit for meddling afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until it came across her. A rookie kunoichi, with bright pink hair, Aqua green-blue eyes, a dressy red sleeveless vest attached to her split skirt and spandex pants. Reading through the morsels of her thought and this world's fabric, it now knew her name was \"Sakura Haruno.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp smiled. It's form would come to light soon, only for her however. But there was no way it would let such a fine specimen go. It whizzed behind her, with only a slight tingling on her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did anybody feel that?\" The pink haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see anything. \" Shikimaru replied, rubbing his head boredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're standing over here behind you, so don't blame us.\" Choji added, munching on a candybar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shrugged and dismissed it. They continued walking, having to shop for more weapons. Sakura tried to forget the brief feeling she felt, as if something passed through her. She noticed not when her body underwent a weird tingling, like it was vibrating or harmonizing from within. The Imp only cooed, taking delight in the process. In it's own bizarre language, it rang a tune to the sound that reverberates through a sound soul. And one that would effect this girl down to her core completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stopped for a moment. \"Are, are you guys sure? I could have sworn I just heard something just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ninjas accompanying her looked at each other. Choji fessed up, \"Okay fine, I had a little too much rice dumpling last night. Makes me queer and noxious, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"No, no not that it's almost as if.. as if I can hear, singing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sakura's eyes went glassy and her head went slightly blank.

Her friends Shikamaru and Choji were occupying her, but while they were chasing her, suddenly a strange dullness in their minds kicked in, and it was as if they suddenly were unable to care or even realize what was taking place. They simply carried on casually without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl however, has made her way all the way through the shopping and living districts, and arrived back in her apartment, after crossing several dozen streets and several flights of stairs. She stood in her room, strangely transfixed. The imp that had cursed this upon her before zipped in, and slowly manifested. Looking like a shiny red women with a rubbery body, bu with duck feet , a black goat's head and talon-like fingernails, it scratched the surface of the room and with a single spark, had drastically changed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura proceeded to walk into her closet and look through her wardrobe. She took off her signature red dress, sandals, and everything else. Once she had stripped nude, she peered into her closet. Everything had changed, altered as if magically and she hadn't a word to say about it. Sakura reached into the newly formed wardrobe and picked out...</span></div></div>",

He'd escaped the grasp of Orochimaru, successfully killed his brother, went through a whole hoobaloo from Naruto about defeating Akatsuki and Madara and all that jazz. But now he stood in his shack, bored. His three accomplices, Suigetsu, J\u016bgo, and Karen lounged about with him. They had started up a minor business since the events of their world had calmed down a year ago, but now they simply expired their time bored and lazy in their shack waiting for customers to catch wind of their services and offer up opportunities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door swung open, and the four of them eye's opened wide up like a parachute, only f or their hopes to falter back down and crash when no one arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks. There has to be a better way to make money than this, I'm never going to recollect all the 7 swords at this rate.\" Suigetsu moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, we have to have diligence and patience.\" Jugo said sternly, meditating and keeping his irate in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke 'Tsh'ked and laid back. Even after everything that has happened to him, he'd never imagine the world would be as dull as it was now. Suddenly, that plain lifeless waiting was about to end. Like death reaching out to him, he saw an instant vision of a terrible reaper in front of him. It was only for a mere second, but it was mere than enough to send him flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke!\" Karen yelled, running to help him up. Sasuke rubbed his eyes and breathed heavily, just what was that? A skull monster, a Shinigami, some jutsu or genjutsu, something else? For a second that, thing had flashed to him swiping it's scythe at his neck, leading him to flinch and get blown back on impact. He was still alive and not decapitated obviously, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his neck, groping it for a gash or wound, nothing was present. In fact, he realized he couldn't quite feel, well just about anything. His neck and hands were numb, and his whole body soon followed. \"What is..\" His voice trailed out as the rest of him seemed to phase over, like taken possession. As his eyes turned glassy, he got up pushed his companions aide, and simply walked out the door without a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp smiled at it's deeds nearby.

Spying through the crowd, it saw two such specimens perfect for it's specifications, a tall blond girl and her companion, a darker haired one trailing behind. They were holding shopping bags and skittering around the crowd, which made them easy to sight. The one in the front blabbered about while the one behind nodded and listened diligently.

She hadn't much left to do here, but her hunger and fatigue grew, so she felt the need to stop somewhere. The problem being where exactly, she wasn't too familiar with the shops or people around that district. She started to scout through buildings and vendors, unknowingly trailed by a shadowy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her vision giving her the capability to see in 360 degrees, it couldn't see people's intentions or through the disguises of otherworldly creatures.

This girl wasn't worthy to be an Imp like itself. Imps were naturally vain and narcissistic creatures, and it didn't have the know or heart to be an Imp, and changing that would be just like cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Imp snickered, it had a brilliant idea. Reaching it's arm through the nexus of infinite reality and fiction, it received a vintage image of some sort of puppet, a pink swine creature.

She was dressed in a clean white cloaked suit, not unlike a Doctor of Scientist, minus the hood, and stood at 6 feet shaking the young girl down. White gloves decorated her wrist, as tight and rubbery as the boots and stockings coating her thighs down. A pencil miniskirt covered her bottom held together by a belt at her waist, and her wardrobe as a whole was white as snow, contrasting with her sharp red eyes underneath her misty shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, nice to meet you. I'm sorry if I was startled.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's very much alright, that's my fault mainly. I should have been more courteous than to merely creeped up behind, anyway. I'd like to talk about a proposition for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, A proposition?

I didn't ask you to change anything!\"<br>\r\nShe looked at Bella angrily, but suddenly her rage subsided as if instantly, recognizing new emotions and values she didn't before.

The strange fears that had frightened her so, were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, are you exactly?\" Hinata begged the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella Beatrix smile, and put a single finger on Hinata's lips, turning them a muted blue color, shined like her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Imp.

They're more like pixies or fairies of ancient lore, but they are very mischievous. With their vast amounts of magic and desire to change things, they tend to mess with people in unique ways. Being powerful creatures, they're able to visit and perceive any universe they choose, and mess around how they please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA favorite game they like to play is called \"Musical Swap\", whereas after singing a tune to certain characters, makes them change completely. This can be life changes imitating another character, becoming much like them in their own way, or simple fun changes like personality, job, mind or role switches. It commonly follows a formula where two characters switch depositions, but can vary as far out as the \t<script language=\"JavaScript\"><!--\n\t\tvar notex, thisx, mmove;\n\tfunction showPopNote2(notex, event, thisx, mmove) {  var thisxPosY = $(thisx).position();  var ccTop = 15;  if ($('#Content_Column_Wrapper').length) {  var ccPos = $('#Content_Column_Wrapper').position();  ccTop = ccPos.top;  }  var thisxBot = thisxPosY.top + $(thisx).height(); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).appendTo('#Content_Column_Wrapper'); $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'top':event.pageY-ccTop + 15, 'position':'absolute'});  if ($('#bigPopNote' + notex).width() < $('#bigPopNote' + notex).parent().width() - 50) { $('#bigPopNote' + notex).css({'left':event.pageX-50});  }  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'block';   if (mmove == 1) {  thisx.style.borderBottomStyle = 'solid'; }  thisx.clicked = 0;  }\n\tfunction clickPopNote2(thisx) {  thisx.clicked = 1;  }\n\tfunction hidePopNote2(notex, event, thisx) {  document.getElementById('popnote' + notex).style.borderBottomStyle = 'dotted';  if (thisx.clicked != 1) {  document.getElementById('bigPopNote' + notex).style.display = 'none';  }  }\n\t\t\t\t//--></script><span id=\"popnote16035472391\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('16035472391', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('16035472391',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">Imp</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote16035472391\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\">Reader and writer's</td></tr></table></div></div> wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImp's often have unique types and personalities of their own. Although they're usually small, with wings or horns, they can shapeshift at will, and take on as many forms even naturally as one could imagine. They can be angelic, like looking fairies or nymphs, or perhaps more devil-like. They can be puddles or insects, or trolls or Oni, inanimate objects, other characters, hippos flowers or doorknobs, or whatever. But they do tend to be really slinky and shiny, often sensual. Even after they've sung their initial song, they tend to want to mess around and interfere, often interacting with their victim as much as possible to maximize the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the most special of the Imp's is the Queen Imp, Malaise. While she is vain and pretty, almighty and yet obscenely bawdy, she's a very charismatic and devilish creature.  Unlike other Imps which are carefree, as Queen of the Imp's she's devious, always scheming, clever and very powerful. When she makes a change it will always serve a sort of intended purpose, which she may or may not reveal depending on <span id=\"popnote16035472392\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('16035472392', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('16035472392',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">her mood</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote16035472392\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\">The Writers decision</td></tr></table></div></div>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven this, it's this Interactive's topic to log the exploits and tales of these strange creatures. How they swap up characters, how they change and manipulate people's lives, and what sort of mischief they induce. Sometimes it's random, other's they may want more than fun and are aiming for a different result. They might try to convert other's into slinky, perverted imps like themselves, or they'll give them certain traits just because they find it amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">How will the characters react to these Imps? That's a question that's answered perpetually in flux in this story, so come on in!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome Guidelines:<br>\r\n1.Basically the Imps can perform magic, leading to TF, TG, MC, AP, AR, and any sort of change, physical or mental, personal or of reality, on a fictional character<br>\r\n2.One of the things they like to do most is Swap characters, but in different restricted and special ways as you'll see<br>\r\n3.So long as it's entertaining and follow's the Imp premise I'm fine with it. No Vore/Gore or obscene death though, they're not sadist or downright evil<br>\r\n4.Respect other people's choices, don't flame and try to contribute positively<br>\r\n5.Content rating is 18+, and there may be some adult themes but try to use proper judgement. Sex/Violence is at the writer's digression, and the <span id=\"popnote16035472393\" onmouseover=\"showPopNote2('16035472393', event,this,1);\" onmouseout=\"hidePopNote2('16035472393',event,this);\" onclick=\"clickPopNote2(this);\" style=\"border-bottom:2px dotted ;\" title=\"\">Imp's are creative enough that they don't care for forced Sex 24/7</span> <div id=\"bigPopNote16035472393\" style=\"position:absolute;display:none;z-index:200;\" onmouseover=\"$(this).show(); event.preventDefault(); return false;\" onmouseout=\"$(this).hide();\"><div align=\"center\">\n\t<table border=\"0\" class=\"shadowBox\" style=\"margin-top:5px;padding:15px;border-color:#000000;\"><tr><td align=\"left\">Reader's will get annoyed if you jump to a random pornographic sex scene every single chapter or random option</td></tr></table></div></div><br>\r\n6.Use acceptable spelling and grammar please<br>\r\n7.The Imps, with unlimited power can take any form they, well you choose and enter anywhere. Any Fiction is allowed or fetishy topic, just be creative. Go wild with it!<br>\r\n8.And lastly, just be mindful of content. This is an experimental Interactive, it's not supposed to be a coherent work but just fun place to test ideas. I don't mind what series you use or suggest, but do try to contribute.
