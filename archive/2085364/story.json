I've noticed a distinct lack of Sailor Moon, so I figured this would be a good one to start up. Not going to put up any serious rules for this one other than that the main transformation can't be ones natural to the series. Meaning Usagi turning into Sailor Moon wouldn't work since she does it throughout the series anyway. Not saying those transformations can't happen. They just can't be the focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would also like to ask not to use the names of the Dic/Cloverway dub. This is to make things a little less confusing and because the Super S season was never dubbed. Stick with the Japanese names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, anything goes here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan't wait to see the transformation stories that you guys write with me.</td>",
