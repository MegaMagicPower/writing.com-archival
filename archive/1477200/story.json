Tails was busy at work with a brand new project that he hoped would revolutionize the world and bring an end to one of the world\u2019s greatest problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a welding mask as he took a soldering iron to the circuits of his newest invention, the flame carefully bringing together the necessary connections to make the device function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment to stop and wipe the sweat from his brow, he\u2019d been working all morning on this project since Sonic hadn\u2019t been around lately to keep him company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually only took on these projects when Sonic was absent for an extended period of time, and his imagination tended to drive him to do these sorts of things when he wasn\u2019t around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY TAILS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always that chance he could arrive out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic!\u201d The fox boy shouted in annoyance. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of knocking?! You almost made me burn my fur off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic rubbed underneath his nose and chuckled a bit. \u201cSorry little buddy, didn\u2019t mean to scare ya.\u201d He walked over to the fox boy and leaned over him to see. \u201cWhatcha workin\u2019 on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails smiled in response to that. He always did enjoy talking about his inventions. \u201cIt\u2019s my newest project. If it works I could potentially solve world hunger once and for all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey that\u2019s great!\u201d Sonic exclaimed before blinking blankly. \u201cSo, what\u2019s it supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was about to reply when he heard a knock on the door. \u201cHuh? Who could that be?\u201d Wiping his hands with a somewhat dirty rag, Tails walked over to the door and looked through the peephole. \u201cHuh, didn\u2019t expect them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018them\u2019?\u201d Sonic raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails opened the door and smirked as he watched Sonic\u2019s eyes grow comically wide in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAMY?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there Sonic, fancy meeting you here.\u201d Amy sauntered over to the blue hedgehog who was backing up as she came forward. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, yeah. Nice to see you Ames.\u201d Sonic gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you here Amy?\u201d Tails nodded in acknowledgement of his other guest, Cream, and smiled down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just happened to be in the neighborhood, and I was thinking we could all take a group trip to Twinkle Park.\u201d She batted her eyelashes at the flustered blue hedgehog. \u201cYou know, their cute couples get in free promotion is still active.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gulped again and continued to back away. \u201cSorry Ames, but I was just leaving. Later gang!\u201d Sonic took off like a shot, with Amy trailing behind him crying out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Sonic! It\u2019ll be fun! SONIC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shook his head and chuckled a bit. \u201cAhh Sonic, you\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\u201d He then turned to his other guest and smiled down at her. \u201cSo what can I do for you Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rabbit was standing there with her pet chao, Cheese, hovering closeby. \u201cWell, I came with Amy to see if you and Mr. Sonic wanted to come to Twinkle Park with us, but apparently he doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, looks that way.\u201d Tails sighed, \u201cSorry you came all this way for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream tilted her head to the side. \u201cIt\u2019s not for nothing. You\u2019re my friend too! I like being with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Tails felt his cheeks grow warm at that. \u201cHeh, thanks.\u201d He put his mask back on to hide his blush and went over to continue working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream walked over to the fox boy and rocked back and forth on her heels as she watched him prepare to work. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d She asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails turned around and took his mask off, grinning widely. \u201cWell I was gonna tell Sonic before he ran off, but I can tell you.\u201d He got up and gestured dramatically towards his device. \u201cCream, may I present to you\u2026the Growinator!\u201c</span></div></div>",

Recording.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I stand back?\u201d Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nodded. \u201cThat would probably be a good idea.\u201d He turned a knob on the side of the gun and aimed at the apple. \u201cGrowinator fire!\u201d The moment the fox boy pulled the trigger, green waves of energy began bombarding the apple until it began to somehow fluctuate. \u201cI think it\u2019s working!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Cream clasped her hands in excitement for her friend\u2019s success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Tails nodded excitedly. He kept squeezing the trigger, and suddenly the apple seemed to shift somehow, and again, and again. \u201cIt\u2019s growing! It works!\u201d Tails let go of the trigger and the waves stopped, but not before the apple made one more shift and finally stopped. \u201cI did it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing Tails! The apple looks so much bigger now!\u201d Cream exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails went over and carefully examined the apple, it had indeed increased in size substantially, so much so that Cheese, who had been curiously watching from a safe distance, was now the same size as the apple that he had previously been twice its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doubled in size! This is better than I could\u2019ve hoped for!\u201d Tails cheered. \u201cCream, do you know what this means?!\u201d Cream didn\u2019t get a chance to reply, as Tails continued to rave about his success. \u201cWith my growth ray fully functional, I could end world hunger once and for all by increasing the density and mass of all sorts of foods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails ran over and grabbed Cream\u2019s hands, spinning around with her in joy. \u201cChildren in third-world countries will never have to go hungry again! I\u2019ll make their food so big that they\u2019ll have problems finding a place to put their leftovers!\u201d Tails grinned madly. \u201cI smell a Nobel prize in my future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Nobel prize?\u201d Cream tilted her head curiously, smiling as she took note of Cheese taking a bite out of the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Tails chuckled as he realized he\u2019d gone off on a tangent and rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s an award given to people who discover something amazing for science. That\u2019s the most general description.\u201d Tails snapped his fingers in realization. \u201cOh! I gotta write down the results in my journal! Be right back!\u201d Tails ran over to his computer and sat down in his chair as he began typing at lightning speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cream had gone over to Cheese, who was still happily munching on the apple. \u201cDoes it taste good Cheese?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheese stuck his head out from the giant apple and smiled. \"Chao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit giggled. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for Tails, his invention will make so many people happy! No one will ever be hungry again!\u201d At the mention of hunger, the rabbit girl\u2019s stomach rumbled a bit. \u201cOops.\u201d She blushed. \u201cGuess I\u2019m a little hungry myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao!\u201d Cheese pushed the apple towards her, and the young girl smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Cheese, it looks delicious!\u201d Cream needed two hands to hold the apple, but once she got a hold of it, she took a big bite out of it and started chewing. \u201cMmm, it is delicious!\u201d She swallowed and giggled. \u201cNice to know making it grow didn\u2019t make it taste different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026done.\u201d Tails closed his online journal and turned around in his chair. \u201cOk Cream, next we have to\u2026\u201d Tails eyes widened in horror as he watched Cream and Cheese blissfully eat away at the apple. \u201cCream, Cheese, no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two jumped at the sudden urgency in Tails voice, and they put the giant apple back on the stand and frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Tails?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t finished testing it!\u201c He exclaimed with his head between his palms in fear. \"I have no idea what might happen if someone actually EATS a food that\u2019s been enlarged!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream and Cheese looked at each nervously before folding their hands in front of them in regret. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gulped. \u201cOh boy\u2026\u201d He said to himself. \u201cThis could be a problem\u2026a really BIG problem.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was excited because the ray completed its purpose, but I wasn\u2019t finished with my tests. I needed to know what the possible ramifications were should someone try to eat that apple. I planned on testing it on insects by having them eat pieces of the apple and observing them overnight. If there was any increase in size, that would indicate that the apple wasn\u2019t fit for Mobian consumption.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream tilted her head again. \u201cTails, you use a lot of big words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shook his head in worried frustration. \u201cSorry\u2026when I\u2019m nervous my vocabulary goes nuts.\u201d Tails took a deep breath. \u201cIf the bugs I made eat the apple got bigger, then the apple wouldn\u2019t be safe to eat.

I honestly don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything we should do Tails?\u201d Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pacing back and forth for a few moments, Tails walked over to Cream and grabbed her hands, looking her dead in the eyes. \u201cListen to me very carefully Cream, this is extremely important. Everything I tell you to do, you need to make sure you do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded, Cheese nodding too. \u201cOk Tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to go home, and I want you to act like nothing happened. Then later, before you go to bed, I want you to ask your mom to measure both you and Cheese to see if you\u2019ve grown at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded. \u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, I want you to go to sleep, and in the morning, ask your mom to measure you and Cheese again. She may not do it right away because she measured already, but find a way to convince her. We need to make sure that if you apparently grew the first time, it\u2019s not just a result of your normal growth because you\u2019re young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I might be getting bigger by myself?\u201d Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox boy nodded. \u201cRight. You\u2019re growing already because you\u2019re young, I\u2019m growing too. But we\u2019re supposed to grow slowly. So if you grow the first time and not the second time, everything should be ok\u2026but if you grow both times\u2026I may have to look into reversing polarity on the Growinator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd make it a Shrinkinator?\u201d Cream giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails rolled his eyes and laughed despite the situation. \u201cNote to self, change the name.\u201d Tails then got serious again. \u201cSo you understand what you have to do right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do.\u201d Cream nodded vigorously, her ears bouncing behind her head. \u201cI\u2019ll go right now, Mommy wanted me to go back home if we didn\u2019t go to Twinkle Park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026I\u2019ll see what I can do here. See you tomorrow Cream.\u201d Tails watched the two go, and sighed to himself as his anxiety grew. \u201cLet\u2019s my hope my anxiety is the only thing that grows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after Vanilla served dimmer and Cream got washed up for bed, the rabbit girl walked up to her mother with a shy expression. \u201cHere we go Cheese.\u201d She whispered before speaking louder. \u201cMommy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla looked up from the book she was reading. \u201cWhat is it Cream dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you\u2026measure me and Cheese please? I want to see if we\u2019ve gotten any bigger since since last time.\u201d She asked as innocently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla looked at her pleading daughter curiously for a moment. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been a month since the last time.\u201d She got up from her chair, \u201cBut after this you go right to bed ok? It\u2019s past your bedtime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mommy!\u201d Both Cream and Cheese hurried over to the kitchen where the doorframe had several marks on it. Vanilla had been measuring Cream ever since the girl was 2 years old, and Cream looked in awe for a moment at how low the bottom mark was. \u201cI used to be so small\u2026I\u2019ve gotten a lot bigger since Mommy started measuring me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao.\u201d Cheese looked at his own measurements that were on the other side of the doorframe, but his measurements weren\u2019t as noticeable as Cream\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla came with a pencil and had them both stand up tall against the doorframe. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026this time it\u2019s Cheese\u2019s turn to be measured first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao!\u201d Cheese stopped fluttering and landed on the ground, and Vanilla made the mark, paying careful mind of the little ball that that signified the Chao\u2019s emotions. \u201cChao chao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Cheese, I\u2019m afraid you haven\u2019t grown any bigger since last time.\u201d Vanilla said sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao.\u201d He wiped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla was a bit confused by Cheese\u2019s strange relief, but shook it off as nothing and went over to her daughter. \u201cStand up tall please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream put her shoulders back and straightened her spine. \"Like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla smiled. \u201cJust like that.\u201d She was about to make the measurement when she noticed the mischievous grin on Cream\u2019s face. \u201cNo tiptoes dear.\u201d She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww.\u201d Cream giggled and obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla carefully made the mark and gave a motherly smile when she was finished. \u201cYou can turn around now Cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream slowly turned around, and her eyes widened a bit when she saw where the mark was. It was ever so slightly higher than the last one. \u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla chuckled and embraced her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re growing so fast Cream. I remember when you were tiny and you fit in just one of my arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be a big girl, huh Mommy?\u201d Cream pulled back and asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it will certainly help if you hurry off to bed. Growing girls need their sleep so they can grow more after all!\u201d Vanilla gently gave the little girl a nudge to get her moving, and she watched as Cream and Cheese raced up the stairs to their room. \u201cHow time flies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream closed the door as soon as she got into her room and let out a breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cWell Cheese, it looks like I got bigger\u2026now tomorrow we have to make Mommy measure us again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao, chao chao chao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t grow, maybe that means the apple didn\u2019t do anything to us and it\u2019s like Tails said, I grew naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess we\u2019ll just have to see.\u201d Cream crawled into bed and pulled the covers up over herself, yawning as she settled into bed, with Cheese doing the same in his own tiny bed nearby. \u201cGoodnight Cheese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We gotta check if we got any bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woke the Chao up quickly, and he flew out of bed and followed Cream downstairs, where Vanilla was just finishing putting breakfast on the table. \u201cChao chao chao chao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll get her to measure us Cheese\u2026but we gotta try something.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Cream walked into the kitchen while her mother\u2019s back was turned to the sink. \u201cGood morning Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla turned around and smiled. \u201cOh, good morning Cream, good morning Cheese.

And we were walking around Station Square helping people who were smaller than us! But then we got even bigger! And I started to get scared!

Let\u2019s go tell Tails so we can tell him his Growinator worked perfectly and he can get his Nobel prize!\u201d The two raced through the air and in no time they were landing in front of the fox\u2019s lab, and as soon as they did, the door opened and revealed a very agitated looking Tails. \u201cUm\u2026hi Tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened? Is everything ok?\u201d he asked hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I think so.\u201d Cream replied. \u201cMay we come in please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Tails blinked a couple moments before shaking his head. \u201cSure, sure. Sorry about that. Come in.\u201d He gestured for the two to enter, and the rabbit and Chao did just that.

Then his eyes landed on his invention, then on the dejected rabbit, and back onto the invention again. \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d he said somewhat hesitantly. \u201cThere ARE other applications for the Growinator besides enlarging food\u2026I also theorize it could be used on PEOPLE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream looked up with her eyes wide in shock. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blushed a bit and nodded. \u201cYeah.

You\u2019re all bigger and stronger than me, you always have to protect me when Dr. Eggman attacks!\u201d Cream looked into Tails\u2019 eyes with her own shimmering with unshed tears. \u201cI want to be able to help you and the others!

And even when I DID help, if Cheese hadn\u2019t been there I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do ANYTHING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had no real response to that.

I want to grow and help people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sighed heavily and rubbed the back of his neck before locking eyes with her again. \u201cOk Cream\u2026it\u2019s against my better judgment\u2026but I\u2019ll try and make you a LITTLE BIT bigger. Not too much. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all she needed to hear. \u201cTHANK YOU TAILS!\u201d She squealed and lunged forward, wrapping the fox boy into a hug that made him turn beet red. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me so happy Tails. Thank you thank you thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh, ok.\u201d Tails got her to let go and smiled down at her. \u201cGet over to where the apple used to be, and I\u2019ll make you grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an excited squeak, Cream rushed over and stood in front of the device, jumping up and down for joy as the anticipation overcame her. \u201cHurry Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna regret this.\u201d Tails grumbled to himself as he pressed a button on the console. \u201cProject: \u2018Growth Spurt\u2019, test one initiating.\u201d He then walked over to a nearby wall and rolled over a portable measuring wall. \u201cThis measures things in feet and inches, so now I\u2019m gonna measure you and see how big you are so we have a point of reference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d Cream stood against the wall and tried to make herself as tall as possible for her measurement, minus the tiptoes that she used last night. \u201cShould I take off my shoes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Cream obliged and placed her shoes neatly over by the front door before smiling at him and returning to her position. \u201cHeh.\u201d Tails chuckled in amusement. \u201cEven when she\u2019s super excited she stays polite.\u201d He said to himself. He measured her and made a note in a nearby notebook which he took over with him to the Growinator pistol. \u201cYour current height is 2 feet, 4 inches tall\u2026I\u2019m going to activate the Growinator at its lowest setting\u2026I don\u2019t want you blowing the roof off my lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say Tails\u2026I\u2019m ready to be big!\u201d She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sighed and powered up the gun. \u201cOk\u2026activating Growinator\u2026now!\u201d He pulled the trigger, and weak, green waves of energy hovered over to the little rabbit, who closed her eyes when the waves hit her. \u201cAre you ok?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Cream nodded, \u201cIt feels warm. Like Mommy\u2019s hugs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that.\u201d Tails mumbled to himself. After a few more moments, nothing had happened yet. \u201cI wonder if it\u2019s not working.\u201d He said quietly enough so Cream wouldn\u2019t hear him. He was just about to give up when he heard Cream give a surprised squeak. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt something\u2026it felt like I stretched or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails went over to his console while still holding the trigger, and despite the previous success of the ray, he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. \u201cYou did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?! Oh!\u201d Cream felt the sensation again, and then again, and then again. Finally after about five more times, Cream looked around and a huge grin spread across her face. \u201cIt\u2019s working!

The rabbit giggled and squealed as the waves continued to bombard her, relishing in their warmth as she slowly grew bigger. \u201cI\u2019m getting bigger, I\u2019m going to be big!\u201d But before she knew it, Tails had let go of the trigger, and the rabbit girl frowned as the sensation left her. \u201cAww, why did you stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails tried to give her as stern a look as he could without looking angry. \u201cI said I\u2019d make you a little bit bigger, remember this is meant for science, it\u2019s not a game. The test was successful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream frowned but eventually nodded in understanding. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry Tails, but it was just so amazing!\u201d Cream\u2019s eyes then widened. \u201cOh yeah! So how big am I now?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Tails walked over to Cream who suddenly closed her eyes when he approached. \u201cWhy\u2019re you closing your eyes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I want it to be a surprise!\u201d She exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Tails rolled his eyes and measured the girl, and to his shock, he found that Cream had grown substantially. \u201cYou\u2019re now 2 feet 7 inches\u2026you\u2019re\u2026as big as I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Cream opened her eyes and saw that she could now easily look Tails right in the eyes, no longer needing to look up at him. \u201cI really DID grow! I grew 3 whole inches!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes you did.\u201d Tails turned around and walked away with a thoughtful expression. \u201cOf course, this brings up some rather troublesome implications\u2026such as how your mother will react when she sees that not only have YOU grown, but your clothing has too. She\u2019s gonna KNOW something isn\u2019t right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Cream frowned and scuffed the floor with her shoe. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d She sighed and looked at Tails with a sad face. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m going to have to shrink back down? I was just starting to enjoy being bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna take me some time before I can reverse polarity on the ray. So until I do that, you\u2019re gonna be stuck at that size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well\u2026you know Tails, there WAS another reason I wanted to be bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d Tails didn\u2019t even look at her as he got his tools together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there are some rides at Twinkle Park that I REALLY wanted to ride, but they wouldn\u2019t let me because I was too small. But now that I\u2019m big, I can ride them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails raised an eyebrow at her and pulled off his goggles. \u201cLemme guess, it\u2019s that really huge and fast roller coaster that Twinkle Park is famous for, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Can we go Tails? Please? I promise I\u2019ll shrink to normal after!\u201d She pleaded with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sighed. \u201cHate to tell you this Cream, but just because you\u2019re MY size doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re big enough to ride that roller coaster. I\u2019M not big enough either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit noticeably deflated at that. \u201cI\u2019m still too small?\u201d Then she looked up with a hopeful expression. \u201cWell, could you make me bigger then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t we just discuss this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream hopped over to the fox boy and looked into his eyes with a pleading expression. \u201cOh please Tails! Please please PLEASE! It\u2019s just for one day! No one ever has to know! Just for today, make me grow!\u201d She suddenly smiled. \u201cHey that rhymes!\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019 resolve was weakening as he stared into the big brown eyes of the not as little girl pleading with him, and with a heavy sigh, he agreed. \u201cOk Cream, since it\u2019s just for today, I\u2019ll make you big\u2026BUT, we will never speak of this again afterwards, this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m at all comfortable about doing, especially since we\u2019re sneaking around behind your mom\u2019s back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream squealed with glee and jumped up and down before hurrying back over to the measuring wall. \u201cI\u2019m sure mommy wouldn\u2019t mind, she\u2019s always telling me how proud she is of me for being such a big girl! So the bigger I am, the prouder she\u2019ll be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she meant it quite like that.\u201d Tails prepared the ray to fire again, then he looked up to address Cream. \u201cSo this time I\u2019ll ask\u2026how big do you WANT to be?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Can you make me this big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s eyes widened a bit at where Cream was now. \u201cThat\u2019s really big alright, are you sure that\u2019s what you want Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded excitedly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even mind being BIGGER than that! I want to be so big that I can hug all my friends at once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Tails blush a little. \u201cWe\u2019d probably have to make you TOO big for that. Stand where you were before and we\u2019ll get started.\u201d Tails wanted to hurry before Cream decided she wanted to grow even more. \u201cOk, here we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the green waves began to bombard the rabbit again. \u201cOh! They tickle now!\u201d Cream then squeaked again as she felt herself stretch more intensely than before. \u201cI\u2019m already bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I increased the intensity of the ray, now you\u2019ll grow much faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stretching continued, and Cream looked around the room in awe even as everything around her seemed to become smaller and smaller. \u201cYou\u2019re getting small Tails!\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re getting huge! You must be almost twice my height now! We better stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait! Just a little longer, please!\u201d Cream closed her eyes and really felt herself stretching taller, her young mind imagining all the great things she could do now that she was a big girl. \u201cJust a little bigger, then we can stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails waited for about one second more, and the rabbit made one final growth spurt just before he stopped firing. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, you\u2019re already more than twice my height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream slowly opened her eyes, and she looked around the room in awe of how small everything looked now. \u201cWow! I\u2019m so big now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails went over to the wall and flew up to get the measurement, and his eyes widened a bit at the number. \u201c5 feet, 5 inches\u2026you\u2019re almost as big as Vector now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d Cream squealed in excitement. \u201cThat means I\u2019m SURELY big enough to ride the Rollercoaster now! Oh thank you, thank you Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d Tails blushed as the giant rabbit wrapped him up into a huge hug, picking him up off the ground in her excitement. \u201cCan you put me down now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Sorry!\u201d Cream obliged, and she turned her head as Cheese came over and flew around her. \u201cIsn\u2019t this amazing Cheese? Look how big I am! I can help so many people and do so many things I couldn\u2019t before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, if we\u2019re gonna go we better just go, the sooner this is over the better, the last thing I want is for your mom to find out what I did. Hopefully we don\u2019t run into any of our friends while we\u2019re there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Tails! I\u2019m sure everything will be fine! Let\u2019s hurry!\u201d With that, Cream ran out the door of the lab, and Tails started to fly in order to keep up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s right\u2026somehow I have a bad feeling about this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It DOES seem a little weird for a rabbit to grow as big as you have, so maybe they\u2019re worried something\u2019s going to happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream\u2019s face adopted a determined expression. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to be extra polite from now on so people know that all I want to do is help!\u201d Once it was their turn in line, Cream smiled at the girl in the ticket booth. \u201cExcuse me Miss, could we PLEASE have two tickets to go inside the park?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox girl looked up from her station and flinched when she saw the giant rabbit smiling at her. \u201cUh\u2026two tickets? Yeah-yeah sure, no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream\u2019s smile grew. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d She looked down at Tails, \u201cYou see Tails? I told you everything would be ok! Being big is so cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red fox handed two tickets to the large rabbit and smiled nervously. \u201cHere ya go\u2026heh, so\u2026is that your little brother or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream shook her head. \u201cNo Miss, he\u2019s just one of my best friends in the whole wide world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox raised an eyebrow. \u201cUm\u2026just wondering here\u2026how old are you exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails flinched in discomfort. \u201cPlease don\u2019t answer that Cream.\u201d He mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Cream was all too happy to answer. \u201cI\u2019m 6 years old! But I\u2019ll be 7 in a few months!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the fox girl\u2019s eyes widened at that. \u201cDid you say 6? Not 16\u20266? 6 years old?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026but\u2026but you\u2019re huge! I mean no offense but\u2026you\u2019re the biggest rabbit I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream smiled at that. \u201cReally? Thank you so much! I\u2019m really enjoying being big, but after today I\u2019ll have to be small again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026.wha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream!\u201d Tails suddenly shouted. \u201cWe should really get inside, there are a lot of people waiting in line behind us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream turned around and saw all the angry faces, and she frowned at the sight. \u201cI\u2019m sorry everyone! We\u2019ll be going now!\u201d Cream turned back around and have a cute wave to the ticket girl. \u201cI hope you have a nice day, thank you for the tickets!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the giant bunny walk off with the small fox boy behind her, she shook her head and tried to snap out of it. \u201cI really need to stop eating pepperoni pizza before bed.\u201d She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were inside the theme park, Tails tugged on the hem of Cream\u2019s dress and got her attention. \u201cCream, you can\u2019t just say stuff like that, you\u2019re gonna make people more suspicious than they already probably are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry Tails, I\u2019ll try to remember that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Tails nodded and looked around the area, families and friends were all walking around, minding their own business and having a good time. \u201cWell, we\u2019re here\u2026\u201d Tails relinquished a small smile. \u201cWhat does the new, bigger Cream want to do first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream\u2019s eyes lit up as she looked around the park, now that she was big, there was nothing she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to do. She\u2019d spent years measuring herself at all the different fun rides her bigger friends got to go on, and she was always told that maybe next year she\u2019d be big enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was big enough for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! Why don\u2019t we go to the big slide?! I wanna know what it feels like to go down by myself instead of with Amy sitting behind me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs apprehensive as he was, Tails couldn\u2019t help but smile at how excited she was. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, then lead the way, just make sure you\u2019re careful and don\u2019t hurt anyone on the way there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course!\u201d She nodded vigorously, \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk there like nice people, just because I\u2019m big doesn\u2019t mean I get to be rude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, let\u2019s go then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young children walked over to the giant slide in the middle of the park and got in line, with Cream blissfully unaware of all the odd looks she was getting as she passed people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, even Tails was beginning to stop noticing, as Cream\u2019s excitement started to rub off on him. \u201cIt\u2019s almost our turn Tails! Ooh I\u2019m so excited!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too Cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they climbed to the top after retrieving their mats, Cream\u2019s eyes lit up and she looked down at Tails. \u201cOh! I have an idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we race to the bottom like Mr. Sonic always does? Amy never let us because I was always with her, but now I can have fun like everyone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails took on a thoughtful expression before smiling up at her. \u201cOk, you\u2019re on! At least racing YOU I\u2019ll have a chance, racing SONIC is like trying to race the wind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! He\u2019s so fast!\u201d Cream set down her mat at the same time as Tails and took a seat, \u201cOk Cheese, make sure you hold on tight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao!\u201d Cheese gripped onto Cream\u2019s huge dress and wrapped himself up with some extra fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Cream, I\u2019m gonna count to three, and we go on three, ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u20261\u20262\u20263!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two raced down the slide as fast as they could, using their arms to propel themselves forward, but once they reached the bottom, there was only one winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! We won!\u201d Cream jumped up and down for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Tails got there, he was panting from the exertion. \u201cYep, but I was close!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was so much more fun than when Amy rides behind me, right Cheese?\u201d Cream looked down to where her chao was, and she gasped when she saw the little creature with swirls in his eyes and the little ball over his head morphed into a swirl as well. \u201cCheese! Oh no, are you ok?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChaaaaaooooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess Cheese wasn\u2019t ready to go that fast.\u201d Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that it? Oh Cheese, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d She hugged her little chao softly to comfort him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to ride anymore rides unless you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so much for that.\u201d Tails rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, \u201cSo\u2026what\u2019s next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, I know! How about that really fast ride that Amy keeps trying to get Sonic to ride with her?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the Himalaya?\u201d Tails blushed, \u201cBut\u2026that\u2019s the one where the G-forces end up getting the riders squashed together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I was never big enough before! But now I\u2019m SO big that we\u2019ll be able to ride together and neither of us will get hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re probably right, but still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please Tails!\u201d The giant bunny got on her knees so she was closer to his eye level and folded her hands, \u201cLet\u2019s go together! It\u2019ll be so much fun, I know it will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the fox boy found himself staring into the (even bigger) brown eyes of Cream the Rabbit, and his heart melted at her pleading expression. \u201cWell, I guess it could be fun to ride together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Tails found himself wrapped up into a hug courtesy of the growing rabbit, and he felt his cheeks heat up further as her arms enveloped him and he was pressed into her chest. \u201cThis feels\u2026nice\u2026\u201d He thought to himself. He found himself closing his eyes as a smile spread across his face from the warm feeling of Cream\u2019s hug. \u201cI wonder how\u2026it would feel if\u2026she were bigger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hug eventually ended, and Tails was internally shocked to find how he wished it would\u2019ve lasted longer. \u201cCome on Tails! Let\u2019s hurry before the line gets too long!\u201d She ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails watched as the big little girl ran towards their destination, and he shook his head to try and get himself back to normal. \u201cDon\u2019t think like that, she has to shrink back, Vanilla will kill me if I leave her like this!\u201d But then he smiled tenderly, unbeknownst to even himself, \u201cBut I guess I can still enjoy today\u2026maybe I can get her to hug me again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his heart beating faster than it ever had before, Tails ran to catch up with Cream, and the two did eventually get on the ride, with Cream riding on the inside and Tails on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride went faster and faster in circles, Tails eventually lost his grip on the safety bar of their ride car and slid into Cream, who was having the time of her life as her ears flapped in the air and the wind blew in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he slid into her, she looked down and beamed at him, using one arm to hold him close and the other raised in the air in excitement as she cheered for the ride to go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went on ride after ride, Cream\u2019s smile seemed to brighten more and more as the officials in charge of the rides simply chose to let her pass instead of making her stop to see if she was tall enough, and on the rides both she and Tails could ride, she\u2019d eventually taken to holding his hand for no apparent reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could tell she wasn\u2019t scared, in fact he was shocked at how much of a thrill seeker she actually was. So the only other logical explanation was that she just wanted to hold his hand. That thought made Tails blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the moment Cream had been waiting for arrived. She\u2019d saved the best part for last, and she looked up at the gigantic attraction that for a brief moment made her feel tiny again in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Twinkle Park Rollercoaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it Tails! The moment I\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d She looked down at him anxiously, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails smiled up at her and took hold of her hand, which got her to smile back, \u201cYou ARE ready Cream, you\u2019re a big girl now, and you can handle anything that roller coaster can throw at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made Cream blush, and she suddenly leaned down and kissed the fox\u2019s cheek, \u201cThank you Tails! I\u2019m so glad we came together!\u201d She ran off and waved behind her, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here!\u201d Tails waved and then rubbed the spot where Cream had kissed his cheek, his eyes half-lidded as he watched the giant 6 year old run to the ride. \u201cThat was the biggest kiss I\u2019ve ever gotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blushed at the sly face Cheese was making at him, \u201cWhat? So I think Cream is cute, EVERYONE thinks she\u2019s cute, it\u2019s not uncommon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao.\u201d The Chao flew off to get a snack nearby, leaving Tails standing there by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that ok?!\u201d Tails shouted and crossed his arms with a pout. Of course, the real problem wasn\u2019t that Cheese was teasing him, it was that Cheese was right\u2026he had developed a crush on Cream the Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell well well, what do we have here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019 tails bristled at that voice, and he slowly turned around and his pupils shrank to the size of pinholes at the sight, \u201cB-Brice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello MILEY, long time no see.\u201d A tall fox stomped up to the young fox with his two friends, who were even larger than him, \u201cSo I hear you\u2019re rolling with the legendary Sonic the Hedgehog nowadays huh? Pretty impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh we\u2019re\u2026best friends actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Brice sneered, \u201cWell maybe you should get your best friend to come and meet us, seeing as we\u2019re your old friends and all, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails scowled and shouted up at the three foxes, \u201cI remember that you three bullied me for being younger than everyone else, and for being different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I remember now, you were different. So MILEY, have you grown a 3rd tail yet?\u201d Brice grabbed Tails\u2019 tails and tugged on them, laughing when Tails screamed in pain, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter freak? Didn\u2019t your best friend teach you how to defend yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLEAVE HIM ALONE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three bullies looked up and saw a giant rabbit running towards them, and she didn\u2019t look happy to see them. \u201cUh Bri-dog, that\u2019s a BIG BUNNY!\u201d One of the friends said with a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, big deal.\u201d Brice added injury to insult as he stomped on Tails\u2019 tail before letting go, leaving the fox writhing on the ground. \u201cWho\u2019s that freak? An equally freakish girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a friend!\u201d Tails growled through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m his friend! And I\u2019m not going to let you hurt him anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you have a choice. Ace, Champ, knock that girl down a couple of pegs!\u201d The two bigger bullies both attacked, and Cream was held down from helping as the two slightly smaller creatures were able to overpower her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, no can do.\u201d Brice sneered, \u201cYou were a bad little girl, so now we have to punish you and your stupid boyfriend. We\u2019re gonna take him to our secret hideout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, you\u2019ll never find our secret hideout in the warehouse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChamp, you\u2019re a chump!\u201d Brice snarled and smacked the bigger fox upside the head before growling down at Cream. \u201cI\u2019ll make it clear for you girly. You try to rescue your little boyfriend, and we won\u2019t be happy, and then he won\u2019t be happy either. You got that?\u201d He stood back up and nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s go boys, we\u2019ve got some catching up to do with our old friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream watched in horror as the three foxes took Tails away, just as Cheese came over with a huge frown on his face. \u201cWhat are we going to do Cheese? We have to help Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but I\u2026I\u2019m not big enough to beat those 3 meanies by myself! Together they\u2019re stronger than I am!\u201d Cream thought for a moment, but then her eyes widened as an idea came to her, \u201cIf I\u2019m not big enough to help Tails, then I need to get even bigger!\u201c</span></div></div>",

Tails needs help! The reason I wanted to be big in the first place was because I wanted to help people, and right now, Tails needs my help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked the gun over and saw a knob that seemed to control its strength. \u201cThis is what Tails used to make me grow faster! And we need to go really fast if we\u2019re going to save him from those bullies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream turned the knob as far as it would go, and then she handed the gun to Cheese who landed on the ground with it and aimed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe missed the faint sparks that came out of the gun when she turned it all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Cheese, make me bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese struggled to pull the trigger, but eventually waves of green energy enveloped the young girl and she immediately began shooting up in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m growing REALLY fast now!\u201d She marveled as the world around her rapidly dwindled in size compared to her, no longer in short spurts but rather a continuous growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger Cheese!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Cream was almost as tall as the workshop itself, then she was eye level with it, then she outgrew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk stop!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m huge!\u201d She looked down at the workshop which now only reached her chin and almost couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI\u2019m so big that even Tails\u2019 workshop is smaller than me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now we need to go and save Tails! Those bullies said their hideout was in a warehouse, so we need to go back to Station Square!\u201d Cream waited until Cheese was safely nestled into her fur before she took off, making large gusts of wind as her ears flapped behind her until she was high enough off the ground that it no longer mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her latest growth spurt making her bigger than some buildings, Cream reached the warehouses within a matter of minutes, and her landing caused the area to rumble a little as her feet hit the ground. \u201cNow we just have to figure out which one of these warehouses Tails is in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese flew down and started looking through warehouse windows, and soon he found an abandoned looking one that just so happened to have a light shining through the window. \u201cChao chao chao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it Cheese?\u201d The chao pointed his arm at the window, signaling that he had found Tails and his bullies. \u201cHe\u2019s in that one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then!\u201d She stomped over to the large warehouse doors, which were now only a foot or two taller than she was, and glared at them as if they were purposely barring her way. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tails, I\u2019m coming for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Tails was being tormented by his childhood bullies. \u201cPlease, let me go! Why are you doing this to me AGAIN?!\u201d He sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you little brat? Because you made us look stupid. You were always so much smarter, everyone loved you, the boy wonder who could do no wrong\u2026well now it\u2019s payback time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brice took a step forward, the ground shook. When he took another step forward, the ground shook again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey boss, are you doing that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d Brice snarled behind him. \u201cIt must be some kind of earthquake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the doors to the warehouse burst open, and the sun shined in and revealed a very big and very angry 6 year old. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tails?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-B-B-Boss! The big bunny got even BIGGER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that you idiots, hurry up and get her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two larger foxes stared at each other and ran forward, but instead of attacking Cream, they ran underneath and kept on running until they were long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCowards!\u201d Brice shouted. But then Brice gulped when Cream stomped over to him and leaned way down so that her huge face - that was now bigger than he was - was right in front of him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m afraid of you? You\u2019re STILL just a little kid!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may only be 6 years old, but I\u2019m bigger than YOU\u2019LL ever be!\u201d She raised her hand and the bully fox braced for impact, but no attack came as Cream merely put her hand between him and Tails. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m here to get Tails back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous rabbit easily broke the frail ropes that had been used to tie Tails to the pole, and she gently scooped him up and held him in her palm, his shocked form fitting perfectly in her hand. \u201cCream\u2026did you..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, we\u2019ll talk after!\u201d She whispered to him before glaring back at Brice. \u201cMr. Brice, I don\u2019t like fighting, I never have, and no matter how big I get, I never will. But if you try to hurt my friends again, I will be very unhappy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You can\u2019t do this to me! I want my revenge! Your stupid boyfriend made a mockery of us when we were kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you THINK Tails did! He\u2019s the sweetest, kindest person I know, and as long as I\u2019m around, he\u2019ll be safe from bullies like you!\u201d Cream took a deep breath and blew as hard as she could, and Brice was blown into the back of the warehouse from the wind and groaned. \u201cLet\u2019s go Tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cream turned to leave the warehouse, Tails found himself looking up in awe at just how big she had become. \u201cCream, did you use the Growinator to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t big enough to save you by myself, so I hurried to your workshop and grew even more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thanks Cream.\u201d He said, smiling. \u201cYou sure came in the nick of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re welcome Tails.\u201d She gently pressed him against her torso, and she blushed slightly when she felt Tails snuggling into her gigantic body. \u201cThat feels good.\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels good to me too.\u201d Finally they were clear of the warehouse, and Cream made sure to cup Tails safely in her palm before lifting off, unaware that she\u2019d blown Brice back again as he\u2019d run out screaming. \u201cHey Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Tails?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen Brice called me your boyfriend\u2026you didn\u2019t deny it. Was that a mistake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream shook her head, \u201cNo Tails, I think of you as my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blushed. \u201cBut\u2026how can that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI learned a lot from Mommy and Amy. They told me that if I ever found someone I really liked, I should tell him right away, and that\u2019s you Tails. I love you very much, I\u2019d do anything to make you happy, and you make me happy whenever I\u2019m with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Cream\u2026that\u2019s the nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me\u2026\u201d He smiled and snuggled into her giant torso. \u201cI guess that means I have the biggest, cutest girlfriend in the world.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m growing again, I\u2019m getting even bigger Tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails jumped back and got a full view of his apparently growing girlfriend. Sure enough, there were slow and slight stretches happening to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was happening really slowly, but Cream was getting even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails paced back and forth as his young mind tried to figure out what was happening\u2026besides the obvious that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is really bad\u2026Cream you shouldn\u2019t be growing on your own, you\u2019re already over 20 feet tall, and now you\u2019re getting even bigger? How do we know you won\u2019t grow out of control?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Tails, I LIKE being big, why is this so bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails turned and looked way up as Cream had decided to sit up and was now towering over the fox boy. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t know how big you could get\u2026how do we know you won\u2019t eventually outgrow the whole PLANET?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026I didn\u2019t think about that\u2026I guess that WOULD be too big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t let that happen to you Cream, I\u2019ve got to find a way to shrink you back down before you get too big, and it needs to happen as soon as possible. I didn\u2019t foresee this happening at all, and so I can\u2019t make any scientific theories as to why you\u2019re growing\u2026which means the best way to keep something terrible from happening is to make you small again ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how are we going to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails rubbed his head in thought, \u201cWell first of all, I need the Growinator so I can start reversing the polarity. Where is it Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cUm\u2026I think I left it in the workshop,\u201d thunder was heard above. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea to go out there right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have it with you?\u201d Tails paled a little, \u201cThat means there\u2019s no way for me to shrink you down until at least tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just going to keep growing and growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s brow furrowed, \u201cYou don\u2019t sound nearly as concerned as you should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream blushed and looked away, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Tails\u2026\u201d by now Cream had already gained an extra 5 feet in height, and Cheese was on top of her head, bouncing up and down on her head as she grew. \u201cI\u2019ve just really enjoyed being big, and the bigger I get, the more I can help people! If I hadn\u2019t made myself bigger, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to save you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not denying that Cream, and I\u2019m grateful for you saving me\u2026but this ISN\u2019T a good thing, you HAVE to shrink down. You can\u2019t live life growing forever and ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to grow FOREVER! Then I wouldn\u2019t be able to be with you and Cheese and Mommy and all my other friends!\u201d Cream took Tails into her hand and lifted him up to her face. Now just her eye was bigger than Tails\u2019s whole body. \u201cI just want to keep growing for a little longer, I want to see just how big I can get!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down in her slowly increasing hand, Tails raised an eyebrow, \u201cAnd when do you think you\u2019ll be big enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream raised her other hand to her chin in thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She smiled, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know when I\u2019m finally big enough once I AM big enough!\u201d She started to stand up, and Cream looked up at the ceiling once she was at her full height. \u201cI want to grow and grow and grow until my head reaches the ceiling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cCream\u2026the ceiling in this place is over 60 feet high, do you have any idea how BIG that is? You\u2019ll more than DOUBLE your current height!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat much?\u201d Cream looked back down at the fox boy in her hand, \u201cPlease understand Tails, I know that eventually I have to be small again, that\u2019s why I want to see how big I can grow before I shrink back down. I\u2019ll never get to see the world like this again without flying.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just grow Cream, grow as big as you can, you deserve to be happy, and if growing makes you happy, then go for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case, I think we should go to sleep now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blinked, \u201cHuh? Go to sleep? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy told me that sleeping makes you grow faster, so if I go to sleep now, I\u2019ll be MUCH bigger when I wake up in the morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat seems logical,\u201d Tails shrugged, \u201cWell, if that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll dim the lights for you so you can go to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Cream blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I was hoping that\u2026maybe we could sleep together?

I don\u2019t have any pillows or blankets big enough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded, \u201cJust having you near me will keep me warm tonight\u2026but there is one more thing I need before I can go to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream gently scooped Tails out of his bed and pressed him against her growing body, \u201cEvery night before bed, Mommy gives me a big hug to get me to relax, now I need YOU to hug me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can do that.\u201d He spread his arms out and pressed as hard as he could into her chest, \u201cI can feel the fabric moving as you grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, Cream put Tails back on his bed and closed her eyes, but not before she pulled the closer to her face so she could be as near as him as possible. \u201cI\u2019m still so small, I could be so much bigger\u2026I\u2019m going to grow big just for you Tails, you deserve to have the biggest and best girlfriend in the universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already do Cream.\u201d Tails placed his hands on her face and snuggled close, \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young people went to sleep, and Cream couldn\u2019t wait to see how big she would be when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly how big is that?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m so big my head reaches the ceiling sitting down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed.\u201d Tails smirked, \u201cWhich means I have to hurry and open the hatch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean you can\u2019t tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell what?\u201d Cream\u2019s eyes suddenly widened, and she felt her body give a sudden stretch, and she felt her ears touch the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m STILL growing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it looks like you were right, going to sleep made you start to grow faster, so I gotta open the hatch and get you out before you\u2019re too big to fit through.\u201d Tails went over and pressed the switch to open the hatch, and he did it just in time, as another growth spurt made Cream\u2019s head go right through where the roof would\u2019ve been. \u201cJust in time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Cream stood up, and up, and up, until she was finally standing tall at her full enormous height, then she climbed out of the hole with the help of another growth spurt and got back on solid but wet ground, causing her shoes to make huge marks in the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Tails and Cheese came flying out of the shelter as well, and flew up to meet the still growing 6 year old. \u201cChao chao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Cheese, this is really amazing!\u201d She stretched and grew again, \u201cI\u2019m really really REALLY big!\u201d She grew again, \u201cAnd I\u2019m STILL growing! I wonder how much bigger I\u2019ll get!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you wanna keep growing Cream, we better go somewhere more private than this, if someone sees you at this size they might panic.\u201d Tails said as he flew right up to her enormous eyeball, just before it grew again. By now his lab only reached her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Tails! Let\u2019s go deep into the Mystic Ruins so no one will see me and get scared!\u201d Cream scooped Tails into her palm and placed him on her shoulder, \u201cThere, now just hang on tight, I\u2019m so big that it\u2019ll only take a few minutes for us to get there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flapped her ears for takeoff, causing a huge gust of wind as she did so, and in just minutes they reached the deepest part of the Mystic Ruins, where no life existed except for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a cat who loved to fish. \u201cHey Froggy?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With only 5 minutes left on the clock, Tails was working feverishly to try and reset the settings on the Growinator\u2026at this rate it was the only idea he had left\u2026and man it was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m almost finished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan Tails?\u201d Cream asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails looked up from his work to regard the small again rabbit with an anxious glance. \u201cThe plan is simple\u2026I just don\u2019t know if I should do it or not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna grow Cream, you\u2019re gonna grow A LOT. The plan is to make you so big that the Death Egg won\u2019t be able to hurt you\u2026but I\u2019m worried it won\u2019t work, and you won\u2019t survive if you take a direct hit from the Death Egg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we know it works!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ray works, but do you have any idea how big you have to get? Remember what I said about you outgrowing the planet? That\u2019s pretty much what needs to happen! We only have like 5 minutes left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we need to just hurry and not argue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gulped and nodded at her, \u201cOk, I\u2019m finished.\u201d He pulled something out from behind his back and handed it to her, \u201cPut that in your ear, you\u2019re gonna need it to hear me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream looked at the small device and placed it in her ear, and she soon heard static as the speaker activated. \u201cI hear static.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then pulled a headset out of nowhere and placed it on his head, and then he activated the microphone. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded, \u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we\u2019re as ready as we\u2019ll ever be\u2026\u201d He looked at her in worry, \u201cAre you sure you wanna go through with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded again. \u201cI wanted to be big so I could help people, now I need to be big enough to help EVERYONE! Make me grow Tails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d He pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger, and Cream immediately began increasing in size, bigger and bigger until her head again cleared the trees, and then the rest of her began to follow as her growth sped up. Then Tails flew up and landed in her dress pocket, which continuously became more roomy as she grew. \u201cWe only have 3 minutes left! Start flying Cream!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream flapped her ears and lifted off, causing a huge gale of wind below where the now tiny trees blew in the wind she made. She could feel herself growing as she ascended, and the bigger she got, the faster she moved she noticed. Already her head had reached the clouds, and they looked like tiny pieces of cotton to her. \u201cWow\u2026the clouds look so small\u2026and I\u2019m still growing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Tails, he settled himself in her ever-increasing pocket and was trying to make sure he didn\u2019t get lost in the valley of fabric. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still way too small, you\u2019re nothing but a speck of dust on this newest Death Egg\u2019s radar even at this size, I\u2019m gonna be pushing this trigger for as long as I can, we\u2019re down to 2 minutes so keep flying up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to herself, Cream resumed her journey upwards, her thoughts whirling as she pondered how she could be so big and yet still so small. She figured that by now Tails was about as small as a tiny ant compared to her and yet the Death Egg would think the same thing about her. \u201cI have to keep growing, I need to be big! Everyone is counting on me!\u201d She thought to herself determinedly, \u201cCome on Cream, grow!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She got closer and squinted to see it, and then her eyes widened in shock as she realized what it was. \u201cNo way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Death Egg, the gigantic weapon of mass destruction that threatened to destroy everyone and everything she loved, was nothing more than a dust mote in front of her nose\u2026she was now so big that she could barely even see it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that thought made her feel humongous in the best possible way\u2026and for a brief moment she grew slightly bigger by accident as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Cream, you\u2019re big alright, you\u2019re ENORMOUS.\u201d Tails chuckled as he looked down at his scanner device. \u201cLook behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream did, and she gaped in awe at the sight, \u201cIs that\u2026the Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a big girl now Cream, you grew so much that Earth is barely a speck compared to you. So imagine what I must be like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the Earth so small that she was barely able to see it shocked her, and as she tried to do what Tails said, she found she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can think that small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Tails gave a hearty laugh. \u201cWell, if the timer were still going, I\u2019d say the Death Egg was about to fire,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Cream turned back around and put her hands on her hips, \u201cI bet Dr. Eggman\u2019s mean old Death Egg can\u2019t hurt me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be right, and Eggman knows it\u2026\u201d He grinned, \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s decided to surrender instead of trying to fight back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cREALLY?!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!

Tails was doing experiments and I ate the apple he had made grow, so he wanted me to make sure that it wouldn\u2019t make me start growing too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it did anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Cream shook her head. \u201cNo Mommy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla raised an eyebrow at this. \u201cThen how did my little girl become the biggest little girl ever if it wasn\u2019t that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I asked Tails to make me bigger with his Growinator! You see, I\u2019m too small to help a lot of people, and also the Rollercoaster at Twinkle Park, so I asked Tails to make me grow so we could go have fun together! I grew almost as big as Mr. Vector and we went to have fun, then some bullies Tails knew took him away and tried to beat him up, and I wasn\u2019t big enough to stop them, so I went back to his lab and made the Growinator make me even bigger so I could save him! Then after that the storm came and Tails gave me shelter and called you, by then I was growing bigger on my own, I was so happy! Then when I woke up this morning, I was so big I almost didn\u2019t fit in the shelter! He let me out before I outgrew it, and I kept growing for a little while longer before I decided I was big enough, Tails told me he\u2019d love me at any size and that you\u2019d be proud of me even if I wasn\u2019t big, and that\u2019s the story!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream hadn\u2019t stopped talking once during her story, and Vanilla just blinked in shock at what she\u2019d been told. \u201cWell\u2026that certainly sounds\u2026interesting.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was!\u201d She beamed at her mother. \u201cAnd then when Dr. Eggman said that he was gonna hurt everyone with his Death Egg, I knew that I had to try and save everyone! Mommy, I got so big that Earth looked like THIS to me!\u201d She put her fingers together and showed just how small Earth had looked to the once titanic bunny. \u201cAnd did you know that even when I was that big, I was still really small compared to the rest of the universe? There was so much room for me to grow bigger and bigger!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla was stunned to say the least. She exhaled sharply and pasted on a smile as she wrapped her daughter in a hug. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re safe, and that you\u2019re back to normal. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do THIS if you were giant!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream laughed as her mother smothered her in little kisses all over. \u201cMommy!\u201d She squealed in delight. Once Vanilla stopped, she looked up and grinned at her. \u201cI enjoyed being big, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m normal now too, I missed your hugs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I missed your hugs too Cheese!\u201d She giggled as the chao snuggled up to her face. \u201cSo now what should we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, even though you just saved the world, there are still chores that you need to take care of, when was the last time you cleaned your room little lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream looked away nervously. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla smiled with a quick nod. \u201cI thought so. Head upstairs and get started dear, I\u2019ll clean up the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d The small rabbit sighed and hopped up the stairs to her room. It was indeed a mess. \u201cI need to find a way to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started.\u201d Cream started by picking up her clothes from the floor and folding it, which took her about 15 minutes since it was all scattered everywhere. \u201cMommy was right, I needed to clean my room, it looks like Mr. Sonic lives here instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went and put all her dresses on hangers and went over to hang them up. She looked up at the closet and sighed as she started to flap her ears so she could put them on the clothes rack. \u201cToo small again, now I wish I was bigger again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She saw where she\u2019d last been measured and tried to focus on that mark. \u201cSmaller!\u201d She felt herself start to shrink, and she kept shrinking until she met that mark and then she stopped. \u201cI\u2019m back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Vanilla walked into the room, and she looked over the room before smiling down at her daughter. \u201cI wanted to see how you were doing in here, looks like you\u2019re making progress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older rabbit nodded, \u201cWell then, I\u2019ll let you get back to cleaning. Remember, I want it cleaned, not everything stuffed into the closet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d Cream waited until her mother closed the door and walked away, and then she grinned and looked to the top of the poster. It was at least 3 feet away and she wanted to test something. \u201cI want to be bigger!\u201d She started stretching upwards again, and she watched as the mark she\u2019d just shrunk down to was left behind by her growth. \u201cBigger!\u201d She grew faster, now 3 feet and 6 inches and still growing. \u201cBigger, BIGGER!\u201d Her growth increased even more, and soon she was at the top of the poster and then some. She grinned as her ears touched the ceiling and giggled as they started to get a little smushed. \u201cI\u2019m getting bigger!\u201d She sang as she sat down and enjoyed her growth. Now that she was sitting she had a little more room to grow, but it was quickly getting taken up by her ever-bigger form. \u201cOk stop!\u201d She stopped again. Her ears were pressed against the ceiling again, she must\u2019ve been at least 20 feet tall she guessed, but she didn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cI have control over the growth!\u201d She closed her eyes and focused on shrinking, and within minutes she was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Cheese!\u201d She grinned, \u201cI think tomorrow I\u2019m going to surprise Tails!

Only this time we should test how big I can get without the Growinator helping me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I outgrow the planet again, then I can just shrink down to normal after, maybe Tails won\u2019t even want to test this, he might get worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream thought for a moment before she looked at her chao friend. \u201cWe need to find a way to make sure Tails won\u2019t be scared about this, but how do we do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could just be honest about it, but would he try to take the power away somehow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao, chao chao chao chao chao chao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. It would only be because he cares.\u201d She adopted a determined expression, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to show Tails that this is a good thing somehow!\u201d Then her eyes widened, \u201cHey! Maybe Amy could come up with some ideas!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream finished cleaning her room, then she ran downstairs to tell her mom she was leaving. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see Amy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you finish cleaning your room?\u201d Vanilla called from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will!\u201d Cream grinned and ran out the door, taking a moment to close it behind her. Then she flew a little bit away from the house before landing far enough away that she wouldn\u2019t get spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot answering Cheese\u2019s question, Cream focused on growing and grew until she was about Amy\u2019s size, grinning to herself as she imagined her best friend\u2019s reaction. \u201cThis is going to be so much fun!\u201d She flapped her ears and began to fly towards Amy\u2019s apartment, and after a little while of flying, she finally landed in front of the apartment building that Amy currently called home. \u201cI wonder if she\u2019s home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, only one way to find out!\u201d Cream hopped up the stairs and finally made it to Amy\u2019s apartment, and she knocked on the door and waited with a big smile for her friend to answer it. \u201cAmy will be so surprised to see me big again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute or so, a voice was heard from behind the door. \u201cWho is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream giggled in excitement, \u201cIt\u2019s me Amy!\u201d Moments later the door opened, and at first Amy had a smile on her face, but then as she raised her head to look up it disappeared and was replaced by a shocked expression. \u201cHi!\u201d Cream waved innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second Amy couldn\u2019t breathe, she\u2019d expected to see normal little Cream there to visit, but when she opened the door she found herself looking at Cream\u2019s middle instead, and when she looked up she saw that Cream had suddenly grown to her size, a whole 7 inches taller. \u201cC-Cream? How, what, I thought you were back to normal?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was Amy!\u201d Cream giggled, \u201cCan Cheese and I come in please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026sure\u2026\u201d Amy couldn\u2019t help herself from using her hand to try and get a rough measurement comparison as Cream walked by, and sure enough her hand was at the same level. \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream giggled again as she glanced at Cheese and put her finger to her mouth to shush Cheese, then she closed her eyes for just a moment and grew a few more inches while Amy\u2019s back was turned. \u201cI think I\u2019m bigger than Mr. Sonic now!\u201d She whispered. Then she turned around to face Amy who had just closed the door and was walking towards her in silent shock. \u201cSo Amy, I was wondering if I could ask you for some advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdvice?\u201d Amy blinked and then shook her head and smiled. \u201cSure Cream, sure. Advice on whaaaaaaaaa\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy suddenly found herself looking UP at Cream, the 6 year old girl had grown AGAIN while she was closing the door! \u201cCream, you grew again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou noticed?\u201d Cream began to giggle again, she hadn\u2019t pulled many pranks in her life but this one was so much fun, Amy made the funniest faces when she was confused. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to tell you about!\u201d She closed her eyes again and again she began to grow, earning a shocked gasp from the pink hedgehog that she now only figuratively looked up to. By the time Cream decided to stop growing, she had passed 6 feet tall and was over twice Amy\u2019s size. \u201cI can grow whenever I want now! Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhhh\u2026I uh\u2026\u201d Amy shook her head and tried to get her mind in order. \u201cYeah I guess\u2026can\u2026can you SHRINK too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded. \u201cSmaller!\u201d She slowly began to shrink down, and she stopped once she was back to Amy\u2019s height. \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that as small as you can get or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just like being big! And this way I don\u2019t have to hurt my neck to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha\u2026\u201d Amy turned her head and found a chair, and she took a seat before trying to talk again. \u201cWell, I assume this has something to do with everything that happened earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! You saw me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy breathed out a chuckle. \u201cCream the whole WORLD saw you! Do you have any idea how BIG you were?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded excitedly. \u201cI sure do!\u201d She used her hand to show Amy how small Earth was just like she did for her mother. \u201cEarth was only this big compared to me! And do you know what Tails told me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh no\u2026what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat even as big as I was, I was still really small compared to the rest of the universe, that means there\u2019s a lot of room for me to just keep growing bigger and bigger and bigger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I suppose he\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Amy shrugged helplessly. \u201cBut you DO know you can\u2019t grow that big and still be on Earth right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded vigorously, \u201cOh yes! I would always be very careful to make sure no one gets hurt because of my size! I only grew that big earlier to save Earth from Dr. Eggman\u2019s mean old Death Egg! I still want to be able to be with my family and friends, like you Amy! You\u2019re my BEST friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as bewildered as she was, Amy couldn\u2019t help but smile at that, \u201cWell you\u2019re my best friend too Cream, you\u2019re just a lot bigger than I\u2019m used to now. Are you going to grow again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream thought for a moment. \u201cNo, not yet. Growing and being big is fun, but I still want to be able to do everything I could before I grew too, so I\u2019ll eventually go back to normal size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s normal for you\u2026\u201d Amy mumbled to herself, \u201cAnd here I was hoping I could use that ray myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to grow bigger too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s eyes widened and she blushed. She forget how good Cream\u2019s hearing was. \u201cUm yeah, but\u2026but not ALL of me\u2026just\u2026um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream tilted her head to the side, and then she saw what Amy was looking at. \u201cOh! You wanted to make your chest bigger?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Thank you so much Amy, I can\u2019t wait to see Tails now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome Cream.\u201d Amy stood up and walked over to Cream, who was totally eye to eye with her instead of shorter like in her normal size. \u201cYou can grow as big as you want, whenever you want, that must be awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Cream beamed at her \u201cbig\u201d sister. \u201cWould you like to know what it feels like to be hugged by someone so big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded and smiled softly, wrapping her arms around Amy in a big hug\u2026and then the hug started to get bigger as she started growing. \u201cHere we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy watched in awe as Cream started rising higher and higher, and soon she found herself being lifted off the ground as Cream picked her up and held her in her arms like a little child. \u201cI\u2026haven\u2019t been held like this since I was a baby\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I haven\u2019t seen my mom in a long time, I\u2019m not even sure where she is.\u201d She snuggled into Cream\u2019s growing torso. \u201cBut I remember when she used to hold me like this, I always felt so safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, when Mommy holds me I feel safe too.\u201d When Cream felt her ears touch the ceiling, she finally stopped growing and held Amy closer to her body. The pink hedgehog was now about the size of a newborn baby to her, and she held her as such, with tender loving care. \u201cDo you like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded into Cream\u2019s torso. \u201cIt brings back a lot of memories\u2026\u201d after a few more moments, she pushed back and looked up into Cream\u2019s huge face. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s enough now, put me down and shrink back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream smiled and nodded, and after allowing her \u201cbig\u201d sister to hop down from her arms, she concentrated on shrinking and soon found herself back to her normal 2 foot 4 inch size. \u201cI\u2019m glad I could make you happy Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let me give YOU a hug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cream could react, she was suddenly smothered by Amy who was now bigger than her again and had picked her up and wrapped her into a bear hug. \u201cHey!\u201d She giggled as Amy squeezed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to return the favor,\u201d Amy put her down and grinned at her, \u201cAfter all, no matter how big you get, you\u2019ll always be my little sister! And you know how much I love my little sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream laughed as Amy briefly tickled her belly, then she called for Cheese who had made himself at home in Amy\u2019s kitchen. \u201cThank you so much for everything Amy, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Cream, and thank you too!\u201d Amy waved as Cream ran out the door with Cheese in tow, and she sighed in contentment and wrapped her arms around herself as the warm feeling of Cream\u2019s hug brought her back into her memories. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky guy Tails, there really isn\u2019t anything Cream wouldn\u2019t do to make her friends happy\u2026I know she made MY day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Cream, she had started flying off towards Tails\u2019 workshop, much to Cheese\u2019s surprise. \u201cChao chao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we have to be home for dinner, but it\u2019s only 2 o clock, and hugging Amy gave me a really nice idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I think we\u2019ll all like it, but if we\u2019re going to have time for it, we need to get to his workshop faster\u2026BIGGER!\u201d Cream suddenly grew twice her size in a matter of seconds, her determined shout increasing the speed of her growth. A few seconds later, Cream had grown to over 30 feet tall, over 10 times Amy\u2019s height. \u201cNow that I\u2019m this big, we should get to Tails workshop in no time! I can\u2019t wait!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was just blushing, he couldn\u2019t even talk. \u201cUh\u2026\u201d He almost bit his tongue when Cream started growing again briefly, now up to 10 feet tall with her feet almost hanging over the edge. \u201cAre you going to get any bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream slowly shook her head, already falling to her fatigue as she hugged Tails close. \u201cThis is big enough for what I wanted to do, I wanted to have you close to me, and make you feel how much I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails couldn\u2019t help but smile even as he blushed. \u201cI love you too Cream.\u201d He snuggled into her, finally accepting her size and even allowing himself to enjoy it as her huge size was perfect for cuddling. \u201cThis feels so nice,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cI wish I could have Cream with me when I go to bed tonight, I\u2019d sleep like a baby.\u201d He briefly turned to look at the clock, \u201c2:30\u2026I think we can spare a couple of hours to just sleep.\u201d As he snuggled his face into her arm and used his legs to wrap around her arm like a full body pillow, Tails sighed in contentment and slowly drifted off to sleep himself. \u201cGoodnight Cream, sweet dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I went to Twinkle Park, got a boyfriend, saved the world, got the power to grow, and took a nap with my new boyfriend.\u201d She smiled down at Tails again, who had a happy smile on his face as he quietly snored. \u201cNo wonder Amy wants Mr. Sonic to love her so much, having someone who loves you like this is the best feeling in the whole world!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream placed her lips on Tails head, and she smiled when she heard him sigh after the contact and he snuggled even closer. \u201cI hope one day we\u2019ll be able to be together forever Tails, but that\u2019s a long time from now\u2026I can wait though, Amy told me that if you fell in love you would need to have patience, this must be what she meant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tails eyes fluttered open, and he yawned as he fought the sleep away.

But as time went on, Tails requests got more and more complicated, and the poor girl was having a hard time figuring out what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sighed and rolled out from underneath the plane, grabbing the tool he needed and showing it to her. \u201cThis is a wire stripper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails frowned when he saw her wilt a little in disappointment, \u201cHey don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d he took her hand in his, \u201cYou\u2019re being a big help, so relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream blushed just a little and looked up at him through her eyelashes. \u201cThank you Tails.\u201d She said quietly. Then her eyes widened and a smile spread across her face. \u201cI think I can REALLY be a big help to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026what\u2019d you have in mind?\u201d He got his answer when Cream started growing, up and up until she was so big that the Tornado was about the size of her fist, of course she had to kneel down to fit in the hangar. She stopped growing there and gently took hold of the plane, using her hands to hold it sideways. \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go!\u201d Cream beamed down at Tails, \u201cNow YOU can get whatever tools you need right away, AND you don\u2019t have to work on your back anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah\u2026but won\u2019t you get tired from holding the plane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, at this size the plane isn\u2019t that heavy, I just need to focus on holding it steady for you. And if it DOES start getting heavy, I\u2019ll just grow a little more and make it lighter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ok then,\u201d Tails smirked, \u201cBut don\u2019t get TOO MUCH bigger, you\u2019re already on your knees and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more room in here for you to grow. Taking a break isn\u2019t a bad thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bunny nodded, \u201cOk Tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cream holding the plane sideways, work went much faster as Tails was able to get whatever tools he needed much quicker and didn\u2019t have to struggle with confined space. Within 15 minutes, the plane was fixed, and Tails closed it up with a satisfied sigh. \u201cDone and done, ok Cream, put it down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile and a nod, Cream gently rotated the plane and placed it back on the ground, the she shrunk back to normal and cheered, hopping up and down in glee. \u201cWe did it! I just KNEW my being big would be a good thing! I can help ANYONE now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just smiled and shook his head in amusement, Cream got so excited about helping people that it was just too cute and endearing. \u201cWell Cream, if you\u2019re willing, there is one more thing I\u2019d like your help with, and you can be normal sized to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Cream stopped jumping and looked at Tails. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret, I had no idea what I was going to do with it until I was almost finished, I originally started building it just for the sake of the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then you thought you could make people happy by making their food bigger? Oh Tails, that\u2019s just so nice of you, can I go with you when you go on your mission? I\u2019d really like to see the smiles on everyone\u2019s faces!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely! I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way!\u201d Tails finally pulled up the movie of choice, and he dimmed the lights and hopped onto the couch, patting the spot next to him as the beginning credits started to play on the screen. \u201cWell come on, half of the fun is going to come from us cuddling together, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream blushed and she smiled widely, nodding as she crawled up onto the couch and snuggled up to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she closed her eyes and once again started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh ah ah!\u201d At Tails voice, Cream\u2019s eyes shot open and she stopped growing after only gaining about a foot in height. \u201cNot this time, shrink back down and just relax, this time I wanna make YOU happy, just trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ok.\u201d Cream obliged and shrunk back down to normal.

Hey, weren\u2019t you a lot bigger earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes she was, now if you\u2019ll excuse us.\u201d Tails was about to get going again, but then he stopped again and looked at Big. \u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to see a fox carrying Cheese away did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he went that way.\u201d Big pointed into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails growled, \u201cI was right.\u201d He nodded at the large purple cat. \u201cThanks Big, come on Cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019d you get so big Cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream whimpered anxiously for a moment. \u201cMr. Big, I\u2019ll gladly tell you everything as soon as we save Cheese! But for now, may we please go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Sorry. Good luck!\u201d Big waved and went on his merry way, leaving the young couple to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe means well but\u2026sheesh.\u201d Tails sighed and looked to Cream, \u201cOk Cream, take this again.\u201d He handed the girl the radio she\u2019d used before and watched her put it in her ear. \u201cWe\u2019re about to find Brice, so we have a plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the plan?</span></div></div>",

Then it\u2019ll all be over before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, poor Cheese must be so scared!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nodded in satisfaction, happy that Cream was apparently now focused on saving Cheese rather than how weird it felt to be small. Then he screwed on a determined expression and drove the tank through the branches, and moments later he found Brice, apparently startled by his sudden appearance. \u201cBrice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! Miley? What are YOU doing here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop calling me Miley!\u201d Tails made the Cyclone take another step forward as a threat, \u201cDid you really think I wouldn\u2019t remember this little hidden torture chamber of yours? I know ALL your hiding spots!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger fox growled and grabbed Cheese, \u201cHere to save your little girlfriend\u2019s pet huh? Well guess what? You can\u2019t have it! I don\u2019t care what kind of crazy tank you have, you gonna shoot me or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid Brice, give us Cheese before you do something you\u2019ll regret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrice missed the slight nod that Tails made, and he shook his head defiantly. \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me MILEY, you don\u2019t have the guts to actually shoot at me, and your girlfriend isn\u2019t here to help you this time. And even if she was, I saw her, she\u2019s really just a shrimpy little thing anyway, whatever happened earlier was just a weird fluke!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrice turned around suddenly and saw Cream standing there, at her normal height and looking very upset. \u201cOh, so you ARE here. Well whatever, what are YOU gonna do pipsqueak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Brice, he got his answer when Cream suddenly started growing, within seconds she was his size and seconds later she was twice his size.<br>\r\nAnd she was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You can\u2019t\u2026but that\u2019s not\u2026you\u2019re supposed to be small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream didn\u2019t stop growing until the trees only reached her waist, and then she picked up the panicking bully and glared at him. \u201cI told you Mr. Brice, my friends would be safe from bullies like you as long as I\u2019m around! Now give Cheese back before I get REALLY angry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve it jerk.\u201d Tails hovered up in his flying tank with a laser cannon sticking out the front. \u201cIf Cream isn\u2019t convincing you herself, maybe THIS will. Believe it or not I have a stun setting on my laser cannon, but it\u2019ll hurt A LOT. Wanna know how it feels getting beat on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back and forth between the two, Brice growled and let Cheese go, and the chao immediately fluttered up to his now giant owner and hovered there. \u201cThere, you got your blue puff ball back, now put me down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of doing that, Cream brought Brice right up to her enormous face, glaring at him with an anger she\u2019d never felt before. \u201cMr. Brice, that\u2019s twice now you\u2019ve tried to hurt my friends, doing it a third time would be a very bad idea. You think I\u2019m big now? I can get MUCH bigger, and I don\u2019t think you want that, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully fox gulped and shook his head, \u201cNo way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen promise right now that you\u2019ll leave us alone! Forever and ever, and you\u2019ll keep your friends away from us too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk ok I promise! Please put me down!\u201d Brice was almost immediately placed back on the ground, and he ran off in utter fear. \u201cI give up! I\u2019m going to learn how to make macaroni sculptures!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brice was gone, Cream shrank back to normal and cheered. \u201cWe did it!\u201d She hugged her little blue friend tightly. \u201cOh Cheese are you ok? Did he hurt you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao.\u201d Cheese smiled and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank goodness.\u201d Cream then turned to Tails who was happily watching the scene take place from the Cyclone. \u201cThank you so much Tails, we make a great team!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said it.\u201d He then looked at the dashboard and pointed into the distance, \u201cThe sun\u2019s setting Cream, you better hurry up and get home, your dinner is probably cold by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re right, we need to go! See you tomorrow Tails!\u201d Growing to 30 feet tall, she took off as fast as she could, her extra size making her go much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only way to travel.\u201d Tails chuckled and shook his head in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream and Cheese enjoyed a wonderful dinner courtesy of Vanilla, and they soon went to bed and fell asleep, exhausted from the day\u2019s ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that night, little did they know that a new threat would emerge, one that they never could\u2019ve seen coming. \u201cPrepare yourself Sonic the Hedgehog, you won\u2019t survive this time!\u201d Chortled the evil Dr. Eggman.</span></div></div>",

A huge laser blast from one of the robots made him flinch and look back a second. \u201cOn second thought, maybe it\u2019d be a good thing if they were here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cATTENTION EVERYONE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEggman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the giant robots began bellowing out Eggman\u2019s voice, obviously a large speaker. \u201cThis is Dr. Eggman speaking, seeing as I\u2019ve firmly proven myself as the superior power on this planet, I hereby claim this city as the center of Robotnikland! My dream has finally become reality, and there\u2019s nothing that miserable blue hero of yours can do about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Hope you\u2019re ready to eat those words!\u201d Sonic revved up a spin dash and attacked. But he merely bounced off the giant robot and bounced back to his friends with a groan. \u201cNot even a scratch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots then fired at them, and they were able to dodge the blast by sheer luck. \u201cWe can\u2019t hold out much longer Tails!\u201d Amy exclaimed worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna do this, but it looks like I have no choice.\u201d He activated his communicator, \u201cCream, come in Cream!\u201d He never got a chance to hear an answer, as another blast came his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTails? Tails!\u201d Cream screamed at the computer Tails had contacted her on, but all she got was static. \u201cOh no, they\u2019re in trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChao chao chao!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Cheese, I have to go help them, I have the power to grow as big as I want, so I\u2019m going to use that power to save my friends!\u201d She ran outside and focused on growing, and within seconds, she was as big as the workshop and still growing. \u201cHang on everyone, I\u2019m coming to save you!\u201d</span></div></div>",

If she gets too big, she may become more dangerous than the robots themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrific.\u201d Amy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, out of nowhere, two figures appeared in front of the group, minus Tails who was still circling in the sky in his plane. \u201cShadow, Rouge?\u201d Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve run into a big problem eh boys?\u201d Rouge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m here too!\u201d Amy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ignored her outburst and Tails chimed in via Sonic\u2019s communicator. \u201cPlease, I\u2019ve had enough of size puns in the past few days to last a lifetime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuly noted.\u201d Rouge smirked, although it disappeared when one of the robots fired down on the city again, causing even more destruction. \u201cEither way, we need to do something about this and fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell unless you have a plan, either start helping us fight or get lost.\u201d Knuckles growled at the thief who just rolled her eyes in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe plan is simple.\u201d Shadow finally spoke up. \u201cG.U.N. has provided us with the Chaos Emeralds which Sonic and I will use to defeat the robots. But unfortunately, it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Amy scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she was ignored. Shadow turned to look at the lumbering machines, each one big enough to wipe out a city block in one step. \u201cThese machines the good doctor has made are sensitive to large amounts of chaos energy, when we try to transform, the robots will sense the increase in power and shoot at us before we\u2019re finished. I don\u2019t need to tell you what happens to us if they do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shot gave them all the answer. \u201cSo what we need is a distraction!\u201d Tails exclaimed, \u201cAnd while I don\u2019t wanna make a pun, I think it\u2019s necessary\u2026we need a BIG distraction!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Where did she go?!\u201d Eggman looked around the area using his robots, and moments later he spotted Cream again at that same enormous size, \u201cHold still you impudent child!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrunk again just as the robots were about to fire, and she reappeared elsewhere giggling with amusement. \u201cI may be only 6 years old, but I\u2019m bigger than YOU\u2019LL ever be!\u201d She practically sang as she again repeated the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s starting to love that line.\u201d Tails chuckled. \u201cOkay Sonic, Shadow, now would probably be a good time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it Tails!\u201d Sonic nodded at Shadow, who nodded back just as the Chaos Emeralds floated down and surrounded the two hedgehogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too used to that, I want those beauties back after you\u2019re done!\u201d Rouge exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike they were ever yours.\u201d Knuckles scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sonic and Shadow started their transformation, Cream was busy tormenting Eggman. \u201cShe\u2019s really starting to test my patience!\u201d Eggman then took full control of one of the robots and prepared to fire once more as Cream appeared right in front of them, perhaps even a little bit bigger than she\u2019d been before. \u201cI\u2019m through being made for a fool!\u201d Eggman fired for real this time, and his jaw dropped in shock when he saw that all he\u2019d hit was one of his own robots. \u201cWHAAAAAAAAAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it worked!\u201d Knuckles pumped a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave to admit, the kid\u2019s doing a good job.\u201d Rouge smiled and glanced over at Sonic and Shadow, who had their eyes closed and the Emeralds swirling around them at high speed. \u201cWon\u2019t be long now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately, something was going wrong. \u201cDoctor, a spike in chaos energy!\u201d Orbot exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and it looks like it\u2019s coming from down there!\u201d Cubot shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Eggman didn\u2019t bother to investigate, he had a feeling about what was coming. \u201cAll systems, full power!\u201d He prepared to fire down to the ground. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any super forms while I\u2019M around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Desperate to help her friends, Cream shrank down just a little so she would have room to run. \u201cLeave them alone!\u201d She ran at full speed and tried to tackle the robot, and while it didn\u2019t knock it over, the tackle did throw the beam off course\u2026and it hit the other remaining robot. \u201cDr. Eggman, I won\u2019t let you do this!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Eggman was livid. \u201cThat does it, I have to take her out!\u201d He lowered the robot\u2019s arms and lowered the forcefield and hoped Cream wouldn\u2019t notice, but if he was gonna wrestle with her, he needed the robot\u2019s arms. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m always ready to help people!\u201d Cream replied determinedly, \u201cLike my friends always tell me, great power brings great responsibility!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman froze and turned the robot around, and he came face to face with Sonic and Shadow, both of them in their super forms. \u201cOh no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream, hold him steady.\u201d Sonic smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit smiled and grew even more so that she was twice the size of the robot, and she picked it up and hugged it close with a breathless huff, \u201cIt\u2019s still really heavy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d Sonic grinned and glanced at Shadow. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two hedgehogs burst through the robot\u2019s armor and destroyed it from the inside, right after Cream dropped it to the ground. \u201cWe did it!\u201d Cream cheered at the top of her lungs, \u201cNow there\u2019s only one thing left to do, we\u2019ll have to help everyone fix Station Square!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Little children littered the streets while adults did their best to try and carry on their daily routine as best as they could. Not knowing when or if their next meal would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the famines they suffered, hunger ran rampant across the country, and they lived in suffering every day. It wasn\u2019t a good existence, but they fought on anyway, determined to face whatever life brought their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they never could\u2019ve expected what would happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just another day, a lone mother worked hard on cleaning what little laundry they had there, when suddenly the water in her bucket rippled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought nothing of it at first, but then it rippled again, and again, and each time it rippled it got more violent. She looked around and her eyes caught something in the distance, she dropped the laundry she was holding and her eyes widened in utter shock when she realized what she was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous bunny was walking into the village with a huge white sack slung over her shoulder. \u201cHello!\u201d She waved with a smile and continued on her way, and the stunned woman just watched, frozen as the rabbit made its way to the middle of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the rabbit had attracted a crowd, and once it stopped, what appeared to be a fox appeared from the top of the rabbit\u2019s head, and it flew down to the ground with a device in his hands. \u201cGreetings people of Othiepa!\u201d He said into his device which then translated into their language. \u201cMy name is Miles Prower, and the giant rabbit here holding the sack is my girlfriend Cream!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi everyone!\u201d She waved with her free hand with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails nodded and again addressed the crowd. \u201cBefore anyone freaks out, please know that we aren\u2019t here to cause trouble, in fact, we came to help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp us with what? You are both outsiders!\u201d The device translated an angry villager\u2019s words for Tails. \u201cWhy is that rabbit so large, what witchcraft is this?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is unusual, but rest assured we ARE here to help you.\u201d Tails nodded at Cream, and the enormous bunny gently placed the sack onto the ground and opened it up, revealing tons of fresh fruits and vegetables for the starving villagers. She scooped a very small handful out of the bag and placed the produce onto the ground. \u201cAll of this is for you!\u201d Tails exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the food, the villagers ran as fast as they could to start eating, not caring who got hurt since food was so rare that they took an every person for themselves thought process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, a giant hand hit the ground and blocked the villagers from getting to the food. \u201cPlease wait everyone,\u201d Cream said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to fight, in a moment EVERYONE will have MORE than enough to eat!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right ya know!\u201d Tails smiled and pulled out the device that was finally being used for what it was supposed to be used for. \u201cThis is the Growinator, it\u2019s what made Cream here so big in the first place, and now it\u2019s going to solve your food shortage!\u201d Tails smiled and fired the beam at the food, and within moments all the fruits and vegetables began to enlarge substantially, he finally stopped when one of the apples was about as large as one of the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo emphasize the point that the food was safe, Cream took one of the enlarged carrots for herself and chewed it, smiling at everyone below the whole time. \u201cMmm, delicious!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s all for you folks!\u201d Tails shouted with enthusiasm. \u201cSo come one, come all, it\u2019s an all you can eat buffet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the villagers came up to one of the giant apples and hesitantly took a bite, but as soon she tasted it, she cheered and began eating more, and before anyone knew it, everyone was eating like they\u2019d never eaten before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you fox! Thank you big bunny!\u201d One of the young boys exclaimed as he chewed on a large chunk of apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re welcome, we\u2019re glad you like it!\u201d Cream smiled and watched from her high vantage point as all the hungry villagers got their fill of food, and there still even leftovers to boot. \u201cLook at them all Tails, they\u2019re so happy! This is the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He rubbed the back of his neck and blushed bashfully as he looked up at his giant girlfriend. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be able to do this more, there are a lot of countries out there who could use food, and thanks to you, we can get anywhere to drop off enough so no one will ever go hungry again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad I can help.\u201d Cream smiled with a gentle pink gracing her cheeks. \u201cBeing big is fun, but being able to help people makes it all worthwhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ve still got a lot of ground to cover. Let\u2019s get going.\u201d Tails hopped back onto Cream\u2019s head, and they spent most of the rest of the day visiting different areas and countries, giving them enough food so that everyone who was hungry would be able to eat, and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all of it Tails.\u201d Cream eventually said as she tried to empty the giant sack. \u201cSo when are we going to do this again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019ll have to start a food drive so we have food to give everyone. But that shouldn\u2019t be hard. Then once we get some, you\u2019ll grow again and we\u2019ll go drop it off. I\u2019ll make a schedule and everything.\u201d Tails watched as Cream shrank down to normal and followed him into his workshop just as the sun was setting. \u201cBut for now, we can just have some fun. Any ideas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026there is one thing\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Surely, this would be the invention that would allow him to achieve world domination. \"After all this time, I have finally come up with a foolproof plan to conquer the world!\" the mad scientist cackled to himself as he raised the ray gun into the air in pride. \"All I have to do is pick the perfect target to enlarge, and not only will Sonic and his miserable friends be powerless to stop me, but they won't even be willing out of concern of injuring their precious comrade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the genius stopped for a moment to stroke his mustache. \"But who is that target?\" He began to consider all the possibilities, listing them off in his head and eliminating them one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic himself would be too difficult to control, and he had too many people who would be willing to challenge him even at an enlarged size...the like of Shadow and Knuckles came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of whom, Shadow and Knuckles, also out of the question. Shadow would not stay under control either, and would probably not stop until there was nothing left to destroy...after all, it would be a lot more work to build Eggman Land from scratch instead of having something to work with...as for Knuckles, he wasn't smart enough. The ray would make him huge but useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails would keep Sonic at bay, but knowing how the fox boy worked, he would probably find a way to realize he'd been manipulated and would fight the control long enough to fix himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy...perhaps she would be a good candidate! She was fiery, already had violent tendencies, a bad temper...if she were made monstrous, surely she would...then again...Amy loved Sonic too much, she wouldn't use her size to destroy, at least not unless what she was destroying was getting in the way of her and Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats, perhaps this won't be easy as I first thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone that Eggman thought of had some reason why they wouldn't work...but then a lightbulb turned on inside his mind. \"Of course! Why didn't I think of it sooner?!\" And so, Eggman hopped into his Egg-Mobile, and headed over to the happy home of Cream the Rabbit, where his plan would soon come to fruition.</span></div></div>",

Of course the possibility was there of an attack, but regardless Sora felt safe, currently he,Riku and Kairi were all resting on the beaches of Destiny Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle with Xemnas the three heroes decided to take a break from all of the battles, just relaxing and playing around like kids. Their old friends all saw them too, Wakka,Tidus and Selphie; at first the three didn't even recognize the two, especially Riku but upon realizing they were their old friends they opened up whole heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was nothing special, simply a few days into their vacation. Donald,Goofy and Micky all left days ago so they weren't around but all of the others were, Tidus,Wakka,Selphie and Kairi were all on the sides whereas Riku and Sora were battling one another with their keyblades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they showing off? Yes, yes they were but the fight was mainly about an argument the two got into about who was stronger. Ironically it went with Riku saying Sora was the better and Sora saying Riku was. So this fight was basically a losing contest humorously enough, but through their pride the two didn't hold back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah man, that really Riku and Sora?\" Wakka asked, jaw open in amazement at the acrobatic movements of the two warriors. Currently the fight had been ongoing for roughly an hour, almost a perfect tie between the two thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding once Kairi looked on at the fight, \"Yeah, they've only been gone a year but they've changed completely, this is still goofy Sora and tough boy Riku.\" Finishing her sentence Kairi chuckled once at her friends sounds of amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile both Sora and Riku, after clashing their blades once more leapt back to opposite ends of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's end this!\" Riku yelled confidently, his hand glowing with the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darkness? Isn't that going a bit overboard?\" Sora smirked, pointing his keyblade at Riku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your weapon shoots light, you'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next second Riku shot a pure beam of energy, appearing completely different from anything he's done before. Normally his attacks would be a mere projectile but this was a continous beam emenating from his hand, something about it seemed.....darker than the normal darkness the hero used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Riku blasted Sora's keyblade glowed with light and blasted a small beam of energy too. Immediately the two beams collided, getting caught in one another and trying to force its way to the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Riku's attack was unusual both heroes kept going, unwilling to surrender. Moments later something odd happened, the two attacks which seemed totally even began shaping together, almost like merging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instant a blinding light blinded everyone, all that could be heard were the surprised shrieks of Sora and Riku. Once the light dimmed everyone gasped, Riku and Sora were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Sora!\" Selphie yelped, covering her mouth with her hands like she was horrified. Kairi, unlike her horrified friends leapt up and ran to the beach, looking for signs of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his head Sora looked around, that light somehow hit him and did something, he felt his body undergo some sort of a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around all seemed normal, well a tad off anyway. It was the tremendous booming of Kairi repeatedly screaming, \"Sora! Riku!\" That kinda tipped off the hero to what had happened, he had somehow shrunk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the voice and size of his settings weren't enough to figure out what was wrong for Sora the next thing was, a sudden shockwave tossed him into the air, landing back several feet. Looking forward Sora saw the cause of the shockwave, brown shoes, Kairi's specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kairi! Down here!\" Sora leapt up and down waving his arms</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, he grabbed onto her shoe and held tightly to her shoelaces so that nothing would step on him. Kairi bent down to the sand and looked around, but didn't find Sora at all. The others ran up to Kairi and checked the sand too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelphie asked, \"What do you think could've happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi shook her head, \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakka tried to comfort the two, \"I don't think that they died. If the clashing of their keyblades killed them, we probably would've died too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus nodded, understanding what Wakka was trying to do. \"So they could've disappeared to other places or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kairi started tearing up. \"Why are those two always leaving me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephie patted her on the shoulder, \"I'm sure they would like nothing more than staying with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWakka continued, \"Yea, they care about you too much to leave your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus changed the subject. \"Mhm, now let's go home and get some sleep. We'll discuss what to do tomorrow. It's getting too dark out to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them consented and started walking home, eventually splitting up so they could go to their respective houses. Wakka, Tidus, and Selphie made sure that Kairi wasn't going to do anything stupid before she split from them, and they were assured that she wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora heard the entire conversation and felt bad about constantly leaving Kairi. Sure, it was so he could protect Kairi, but he didn't imagine how tough it was for her. She always seemed strong to him. He knew she was sad, but he didn't know the depth of her sorrows. She would always just fake a smile as she waved her hands. He was snapped out of his thoughts when she reached her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi walked up to her room and took off her shoes. Sora leapt off her shoe and jumped on her sock covered foot. When she got to her room, she took off her sock and discarded it to the side. She walked away, and Sora didn't have the opportunity to jump to her since he was overwhelmed with the smell of her sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped off her sock, he gulped as he saw Kairi pulling unbuttoning and pulling down her short, short skinny jeans. She then unbuttoned her shirt and pulled it off. She now stood in her pink bra and panties and</span></div></div>",

Sango tried to figure out what the enchantment was, but all she could infer was that its effect was not anything bad. Shrugging, Sango put on the necklace and awaited what would happen.

Getting more creative with her \"fun\", Sango unzipped her demon slayer's outfit, revealing her bountiful chest, clad in a crimson bra, to all. With her breasts exposed, Sango extended her palm and dug out a chunk of the ground beneath multiple citizens. With the ground and people secured in her hand, Sango lifted her arm to her chest quickly; much of the ground crumbled off of her hand like dirt, and by the time her hand made it to her chest, it contained nothing but people. Flashing a wicked smile, Sango placed the citizens on her breasts and palmed them inbetween her large mounds of flesh. Suddenly, she shoved her breasts together, forming a man-made canyon from her cleavage; the round mountains began sliding people to the middle of them where they were squished by Sango's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango was having fun but it wasnt enough so she decided...</span></div></div>",

Sango's whole body began growing as a whole very rapidly; her feet, which previously stood on a couple of buildings, now engulfed the whole town she was now occupying.

With the city completely annihilated, Sango began walking to one of the many other cities she saw stretched out in front of her. In no time at all, she arrived at the next town, and the onslaught continued. Sango obliterated multiple cities and villages in a short period of time, yet after a while, crushing people underneath her massive feet soon became boring and repetitive for the giant girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

After a few moments, Sango felt strange and began quickly turning to and fro looking for the source of the sensation. Even as she looked at the tiny fields filled with villages and people below her, she still had the strangest sensation she was missing something. It was then that she finally noticed the world was getting smaller beneath her; she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly pinpointing what could have caused this sudden increase, Sango looked at her necklace and gasped, her voice heard throughout much of the world. The cause of her gasp was not the glow the necklace gave off, but what was happening to the necklace; it was merging into her skin. Desperate to stop the fusion, Sango quickly tried to pry the necklace off with her hands, but to no avail; it had already merged with her body. The merger did not end there, however, as the necklace continued going deeper and deeper into her body to the point where it and its ability were permanently integrated into Sango's very essence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Sango began reaching all over her torso and breasts looking for some sign of the necklace; the site was highly arousing to the citizens who could see her, which at this point was about half of the world. Finally, after a couple minutes, Sango regained her confidence, stood proudly, and maintained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her little \"manic\" phase, Sango had continued to grow. Using landmarks to gauge her size, she estimated herself to be about 5 miles in height. Her breasts were now the size of Mt.Fuji, which was ironically crushed to dust beneath the sole of Sango's foot, and the villages that once were about a third of Sango's foot were now barely big enough to cover her pinky toe. Sango found she had some slight trouble breathing at her new size; she seemed to have penetrated one of the atmospheric layers of the planet and ended up with less oxygen. She quickly wished it was a little easier to breathe and, as if by magic, Sango felt the same sensation she felt when growing, only this time instead of growing, she could breathe easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer powers did not seem limited to growth anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind, Sango...</span></div></div>",

Quickly, Sango reached for her throat and began groping around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the necklace is gone,\" she muttered as the memory came back to her.  Putting her arm back at her side, Sango had but a single thought in her mind as she closed her eyes and made a wish: \"I wish to be bigger than Earth itself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling Sango had grown well accostumed with overcame her once more. It felt something like an orgasm only more...controlled. Quickly as always Sangos body began expanding greatly. Quickly Sangos head began bursting through more and more layers of atmosphere until finally her head had reached space itself. When this happened Sango braced her legs in and leapt upward resulting in her floating in spaces endless void. Here she quickly felt her body grow completely in one big burst bringing her to a massive undescribable height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in space. it was like being underwater to Sango only she could breathe. Using a basic swimming style Sango moved towards the Earth which was now half of her size. Sango positioned her body upward and began to prepare the destruction of Earth but was quickly stopped by a loud ripping sound. Sango heard the noise coming from her legs and saw what had happened, Earths gravity had ripped her demon armour leggings off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sango was barefoot and in a crimson red bra and panties with her long black hair flowing weightlessly around her. Sangos face flushed quickly then she shook her head to get rid of the feeling. To her the glaxy deserved to see her perfect body for the moments they live before she kills them. She pushed that thought out of her head for now and prepared to continue what she intended to do. One problem however she wasnt big enough to do this the way she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango chuckled slightly grinning \"heh no problem\" Once again the goddess closed her eyes and willed herself to grow, when she opened them again the Earth was the size of her hand. Smiling an evil destrucive smile Sango extended her right hand and held the Earth like a small ball. She couldve crushed it in her palm but Sango had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing slightly Sango brought the Earth to her voluptous chest and placed in perfectly in her cleavage. She then placed one hand on each of her breasts and slammed them together applieing heavy pressure to the planet. The Earth wouldnt seem to give until finally a loud cracking noise was made and Sango saw what happened. The Earth had been broken apart into fragments which were nothing more than meteors with grass and water on them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango smiled at her victory over the Earth, however it was short lived as she saw a bright red dot in the distance. \"Another Planet?\" Sango muttered aloud, then she remember Kagome mentioning multiple planets while studying for one of her tests.

The problem was Sango was in the infinite void of space with nothing to eat. Suddenly Sango noticed the moon in the corner of her eye. Seeing it reminded her of the childish notion she once had that the moon was made of cheese. The memory gave Sango an evil plan and smiling Sango plucked the moon out of its spot with her index finger and thumb. Almost carelessly she then tossed the moon in her mouth and ate it. It tasted like a cracker only much saltier, it still tasted good however so Sango held no qualms about finishing her little snack. Then she returned to what she was doing before her appetite kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes in a familiar manner Sango willed her newest urge to grow and as always it happened. Rapidly Sango began growing in a manner that requires no description at this point. Quickly Sango went from big enough to hold a planet in her palm to holding the entire solar system in it! Finally at her new height Sango stopped and opened her eyes. The beautiful array of stars and planets that made up the solar system she once lived in looked extravagantly beautiful but also extremely miniscule. The hundreds of stars around Sango\u2019s bodies gave her a kind of glow that made her seem truly godlike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently Sango began plucking the little planets out of their aligned positions and dumped them into her left hand similar to how one would pick berries. When all the planets were in her hand Sango in a typical manner smiled her evil little smile. Then she brought the planets up to her lips and carelessly tossed the planets into her mouth. She licked each planet all over enjoying the unique flavor. Her saliva was covering the planets completely. If there was even the slightest trace of alien life on those planets it sure as hell wasn\u2019t there now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking on the planets like jaw breakers Sango decided to finish the job. Using her tongue Sango began rolling the planets onto her teeth aligning them above them. When all the planets were set on her molars Sango chomped down grinding all the planets to crumbs which she swallowed. Sango felt she was quite big now but she felt there was something even bigger out there. Then\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sango rapidly grew until she reached an undescribable height. The galaxy itself was now the size of her foot if even that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thousands of stars surrounding Sango were nothing more than little white shiny specks that seemed to only add on to her beauty as she floated there amazed at the numerous galaxies surrounding her feet. In every one of these galaxies the denizens saw the Godly Sango and saw her as a true goddess. To them there was a massive female in a crimson red bra and panties with flawless features. Little did they know this goddess was in fact a goddess of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango lowered her right hand enough to hold her home galaxy if only it were solid. With her hand surrounding the tiny galaxy Sango smiled her devious little smile and she quickly clenched her fist and crushed the entire  contents of the galaxy as if it was nothing. Relishing in the moment Sango continued with this for several more galaxies crushing them in a variety of ways, from crushing them with her feet,breasts, and butt to even eating them. It was quite fun for the young goddess but it soon became dull and repetitive, so she decided to destroy all the galaxies in one fell swoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes Sango once again felt the feeling she was about to grow overcome her.

All that was not her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon this realization, Sango critically looked over her body.

Then, she every so lightly dragged a finger across her exposed slit, and then brought it to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmm...

And so she began to make a concubine for herself. Using her seemingly boundless powers, Sango created an exact replica of her body. The being lay in space, motionless, but very much alive.

As if that wasnt enough a quick surprising growth spurt spread through Sangos whole body and she grew to the stunning height of 1000 miles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf people were once ants now they were specks of living dirt and the villages were ants. Sango took a single step forward and ended up destroying half of Asia, the very edge of where her toe grazed the remains of Asia had now taked the shape of Sangos toes from where they made contact. Seeing this gave Sango a devilish idea. Quickly she turned to and fro looking for and finding the next biggest country which was North america undiscovered still. Looking seductively at the landform Sango turned around and gently began lowering her beautiful butt onto the ground. Careful not to put enough weight to crush anything Sango sat there for a few moments before getting up again. Turning around once more Sango was looking at an entirely different shape from what was there mere moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire land had taken on the shape of Sangos massive butt imprint. It was a beautiful horrifing sight. Then...</span></div></div>",

Renji, another of his friends was in town too, but currently at the Urahara shop being forced to do demeaning chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the others they were all in their third class, all doing their various things. Ichigo was asleep, Uryu seemed not to care, Orihime paid the utmost attention, Chad was just...there, and Rukia was staring out the window bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would've been how things remained for hours if not for the sudden beeping of Ichigo's Shinigami badge, repeatedly the small device screamed, \"Hollow! Hollow!\" To the point it infuriated the Shinigami. All hearing it, everyone leapt up and quickly ran out the door, Rukia being the last out said it was to the bathroom. Keigo Asano, a friend of Ichigo's tried to follow but was unfairly stopped by the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the building everyone got ready for battle, Ichigo and Rukia switching to their Shinigami forms, Uryu making his bow appear,Chad transforming his arm, and Orihime's little allies circling her. Together the group soon reached a random area of town where a rather large hollow was wrecking the buildings around rather pointlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that thing's as big as a menos!\" Ichigo screamed, pulling out his blade Zangetsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping beside Ichigo with his bow ready Uryu readied and arrow, \"Good Ichigo, you've proven you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking the orange haired Shinigami nodded, \"Don't make me turn the blade on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate Shinigami remember?\" Uryu smirked too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the two attacked, Uryu providing rear support and Ichigo running towards him for close combat. Close behind him were Rukia and Chad, Orihime stayed back to provide rear support like Uryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly reaching the hollow Ichigo pulled his sword over his head, \"Getsuga Tenshou!\" Swinging the weapon down a large beam of energy escaped from the blade, creating a good sized explosion on contact. Soon the smoke cleared revealing the hollow, apparently unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ichigo blurted in shock before the hollow struck him, sending him flying back about twenty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot\" Rukia muttered, using a Shunpo to get behind the hollow. With Chad about to attack up front and Rukia behind she released her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sode No Shira Yuki!\" Instantly the silver blade turned into a pure white blade of beauty. Using her blade Rukia leapt and stroke the hollow through the torso, actually slicing it in half on contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, almost hundred foot tall hollow roared in pain, actually getting smaller as he did so. Soon the hollow was no more than a foot tall where it finally died and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichigo had trouble beating that?\" Rukia asked aloud in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eerie voice played itself, \"The one who slays me gains my power, that is the rule of the Gigantes.\" Gasping Rukia recognized the voice belonging to the hollow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Rukia was Ichigo, who apparently just made it back \"Something wrong Rukia?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.....didn't hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.\"</span></div></div>",

All of a sudden, a fun thought occured to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toshiro,\" she giggled, \"I wanna see you at my new size!\" Rangiku began to imagine a impossibly tiny Toshiro exploring her as if she was a country, walking between the canyon-like lines of her fingerprints, trekking through her hair as if it were a deep jungle, and exploring many more places on her lengthy body.

In an effort to attempt to gain Rangiku's attention, Toshiro decided to jump up and down while waving his hands in the air; still, the goddess did not notice him. Now frustrated at his fruitless attempts to talk to Rangiku, Toshiro decided it was time to take things to the next level. \"All right, that's it!\" he mumbled, as he began to pull out his blade. As the sword was removed from its sheath, the thin katana produced a wisp of cold air followed by a massive ice dragon shooting out of the tip of the blade; however, to Rangiku, she could easily crush the icy dragon with just the slightest movement of her pinky finger. Toshiro's strategy apparently seemed to work as finally, Rangiku's gigantic iris fell upon the tower on which Toshiro stood. Having gained the attention of his lieutenant, Toshiro placed his sword back in its holster, and the ice dragon suddenly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toshiro, is that you?\" her voice thundered as she squinted her eyes to get a better look of the area below her; they lit up once she saw Toshiro. \"Oh, Toshiro!\" she cooed, her fingers moving in a blur and suddenly wrapping around his tiny body. Suddenly, the Ice Soul Reaper stared into Rangiku's immeasurable eye; to the newfound goddess, Toshiro was now a barely visible mite compared to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yoruichi changed out of her ninja gear into an outfit that was supposed to be used with the artifact. The outfit was a rather tight two-piece bikini; its color was jet black, yet it accented Yoruichi's body nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was fully changed and ready to begin her mission, she stepped outside and ignored all the men gawking at her; she gave them a sly smile as she passed by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ring, do your stuff,\" she said, looking at the ring on her right index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...please?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Yoruichi tapped the ring twice and was surprised to see the world around her instantly shrink. In less than 1 second, she became 5 miles high; the people below were now ant-sized compared to her, and the Stealth Force HQ only came up to her shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of disappointing...I need to get bigger!\" Yoruichi commanded, tapping the ring again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ancient artifact complied to her order as Yoruichi watched the world around her dwindle in size once more. As Yoruichi continued her growth spurt, she suddenly felt much heavier in her chest area. Yoruichi looked down at her bust and noticed that her small breasts had been transformed into massive round EE cups; the fabric of her bikini top stretched to fit her new busty chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds of relentless expansion, the dark-skinned titaness soon stopped growing at a whopping 275 miles tall; the Soul Society below could now fit on the tip of her finger.</span></div></div>",

Using this distraction to her advantage, Rangiku broke free of Yoruichi's grip, backed up slightly, and then tackled Yoruichi head on. Both women slammed into the ground, each trying to get the better of each other; however, they seemed equally matched. Yet, poor Toshiro; as the two beauties clashed, he found himself being flung into the air and then caught between several massive objects. The mysterious objects were soft yet so powerful; he was trapped between the two struggling titanesses' chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rising spiritual energy of the two giants was unbelievably powerful. The sheer strength of the gathered energy in their struggle began to bend and balloon reality, causing a rift in time and space to appear before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku stood back on her feet and saw her chance to escape. Without any hesitation, Rangiku rushed towards the rift and went through it; Yoruichi quickly followed behind her target.

Actually, it would be more appropriate to say that she crashed into Africa rather than fell on it; her massive rear smashed all who lived in that specific area into dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Sorry!\" she said, wiping the dust off her backside. Yoruichi glared at the ring and began to think it was not very reliable, quite unstable actually.

She began to walk backwards but she fumbled and tripped, her gargantuan frame slowly falling towards the ground. Toshiro felt a sudden jerking motion and he was thrusted backwards, slamming into Rangiku's mountainous nipple. He blushed crazily as he held on for dear life. Rangiku's chest smashed into Japan, crushing millions upon millions into oblivion; the only surviving cities left standing from the impact were Tokyo and Karakura Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku soon stood back up on her feet; her beyond huge boobs had left two giant craters in the country.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rangiku gently picked up the city and placed it on her pinky toe, which could now easily hold hundreds of cities upon it.

As soon as the the sensation could be felt throughout her entire body, Robin began to grow at a speed that was much faster than all of her previous growth rates combined; by now, Robin had adjusted to these sudden growth spurts and was ready to face life at whatever size she was about to become. Robin's body quickly doubled in size, and then tripled. She tried her best to keep her expanding feet from crashing into any continents as her growth persisted. At 47,000 miles tall, Robin decided it would be best for the planet if she continued her growth in outer space. Robin pushed her feet against the planet and floated off into space, watching in awe as the Earth became smaller and smaller right before her very eyes. Robin's growth continued for another few minutes until it eventually came to a halt. She was about 450,000 miles tall after this latest increase; Earth was now only a tiny blue speck compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she breathed, poking the planet gently. Robin then caught it between her right index finger and thumb in order to admire it more carefully. Amazingly, the Earth did not end up crushed between her huge fingers.

Instantly, it gave way into dust. It seemed Robin could will things however she wanted to; she had unconsciously willed that the Earth couldn't be destroyed by her no matter how big she became or how hard she tried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" Robin said to herself. \"Now I don't have to worry about accidentally destroying the planet while it's under my protection.

Why didn't I think of there in the first place?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her attention back to Earth, she caught it again between her fingers and placed it safely between her astronomically-proportioned breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.

Lastly, Robin placed her fourth and final galaxy inbetween her toes on her right foot. Robin flexed her colossal toes to get the galaxy into a comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, it's done,\" she said, smiling proudly at her 'work'. \"Now I'm the goddess of 5 galaxies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If only I was stronger, maybe then they'd send me out on missions more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a scroll dropped from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sakura said. \"Is that a ninjutsu scroll?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura ran over to the scroll. It had the words \"Power Jutsu\" wriiten on it. Sakura opened up the scroll and quickly memorized the hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is exactly what I needed.

Her breasts grew in size and caused her ninja's outfit top to split down the middle and a massive amount of cleavage was starting to show,at the rate sakura was growing,she was afraid her whole shirt was going to explode!! Then  without warning,sakura felt a sharp pain ontop her head. She bent down a little and saw it was a thick tree branch. \"Wo...Wow. What kinda of scroll is this!? I thought i get stronger,not super sized!!\" shouted Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away from the tree branch and looked at what was left of her clothes. She could see a big rip right down the middel which was now showing off a nice set of D's and her sandles were totally torn apart. Her clothes were pretty banged up,but they were still good enough. Sakura didn't know what to do. I mean ya she was stonger in a sence,but now she was a bigger target. Sakura let out a huge sigh and sat under the tree to think about reversing this jutsu.

She was quickly figuring out that the scroll was a horrable,horrable idea. \"Man I got to find away to change me back to my normal height.\" sakura said to herself. She stood up and walked into her bedroom,but not before bashing her head on that doorframe first. Sakura just growled angerly and rubed the second brues on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe open up the scroll across her bed sheets and searched it top to bottom and found no reverse jutsu or how to change back.

So she ripped them off from around the window and tied them around her body.  Sakura then moved as stealthy as a mini giantess could to find Tsunade in her office without attracting attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting over the initial shock of seeing a much taller Sakura in her midst wearing her now-torn clothing with window curtains draped over, Tsunade immediately proceeded to start asking questions as any good doctor would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you took a random scroll you found out of nowhere and instantly decided to use it?  How could you be so impulsive!?\" Tsunade asked with disdain.  \"I ...don't know...I ...did it without much thinking I guess?  It's as if the scroll was calling me.\" Sakura nervously answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Oh...whatever, I suppose.  What's done is done.  Anyway, I have looked over what has happened to you, and this is certainly no ordinary jutsu.  It's not like the bloodline limit the Akimichis have.  They can alter their body <i>sizes</i>.  This jutsu didn't change your size...it instead altered your pituitary gland to make you grow far faster and beyond what a normal human would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how do I reverse it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse it?  I don't think you understand.  Can you reverse your own natural growth?  I'm sorry to say Sakura, this is something you're now going to have to live with.  Luckily, you came to me when you did before this got out of control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?  I...can't reverse this?  But I can't go around like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might take some getting used to, both from you and your peers, but you still are quite capable of functioning as a normal person, so long as you don't get much bigger.  Plus have you checked the mirror lately?  You are without a doubt probably the sexiest looking amongst your peers now thanks to this jutsu of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\"  Sakura proceeded to walk over to a nearby full length mirror, and had to hunch over a bit to see herself.  \"Wow,\" Sakura thought to herself, \"I do look much sexier I do say so myself\".  Her breasts were now a much more respectable in size, almost Tsunade-sized.  Her legs were longer and fuller.  In fact, as she looked over herself, suddenly a dark impulse flowed through her.  She felt like going <i>further</i>.  Getting even bigger, even.  Stretching her body out and expanding her growing ass th..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura shook her head and stopped herself.  What was that feeling just now?  She instantly set out to blot those thoughts from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Tsunade continued, \"there is a chance I can permanently stop this so you don't grow any further at the very least.  You need to give me time.  In the meantime, it's time you used some of that great chakra and self-control you have to make sure this doesn't go down a direction where neither I nor anyone else can help you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Self control?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  From what I can tell about this jutsu, it has made your pituitary gland extremely sensitive to your chakra flows and emotional state.  If you lose control and/or focus...well.  I imagine you can guess what will happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" Sakura sighed loudly, \"This is a FINE mess I've gotten myself into!  I'm going to go home and take a nap so I can calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Don't overdo anything.  I'll figure something out, I'm a sennin after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then proceeded back to her house and bedroom.  The key now was to stay calm, and focused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next to Sakura?  </span></div></div>",

Her messy hair lying on a faded blue pillow as she began to let her mind wander. Random thoughts began popping up in Temaris head, typical things for her like questioning the value of life, god and all that. Shikamaru the lazy Chunin appeared in her daydreams multiple times even now. Whenever this happened Temari used to shake her head and try to force it out of her mind but as of late the Sand Kunoichi began accepting the fact that she had a crush on the lazy genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a most random thought crossed Temaris mind, it was an image of her standing at the gates of the leaf village, only she had to be at least 100 feet in height! The kunoichi rolled her head to the side looking out at a window showing the village in its entirety. She smirked slightly at the site 'Heh being that big wouldnt be so bad...\" Temari focused on this specific topic in her head for a few more minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself being kind,gentle defending the world from threats and getting praised for it. In perfect contrast to this Temari also saw herself as a malevolent, cruel goddess demanding worship or death. Strangely both ideas appealed to Temari, she was a nice girl but the idea of playing the bad guy seemed amusing enough. Still staring at the window Temari sighed \"Sadly that will never happen...\" Immediately after that an azure gleam appeared outside on the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari raised an eyebrow at it, beginning to get up \" A shooting star in broad daylight? Impossible\" Temari now sat upward and stood up, stretching her legs. Slowly she began taking steps forward almost as if in a trance. Fixated on the gleam she saw she focused on it and began examining harder when she got to the window and leaned on the edge. The azure gleam now showed brighter than ever \"Is it...getting closer.\" Just then it grew rapidly and Temari saw it was going to collide with Konoha or in more specific terms herself. The azure glow now more clear and vivid could be seen perfectly as a ray of light, azure of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand kunoichi attempted to run from this ray but couldnt and got blasted by it. She felt it hit her skin and closed her eyes wincing in fear. Moments passed and nothing happened, carefully Temari opened one eye examing her surroundings everything remained the same. Unknown to Temari this ray had given her the ability to grow at an unprediactable rate.</span></div></div>",

Most of the ninja in the village were on dangerous missions so the village's economy would survive. Well, most ninja...except for Naruto.

Naruto wanted to be out on an exciting mission with his friends, but orders were orders, and like them or not, he had to follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, man. Protecting the village blows! I need something cool to do! Huh?

But what if someone I know sees me? Hmmm...\" Naruto thought. \"I got it! I'll just use my Sexy Jutsu and nobody will know its me.

He summoned up his chakra once again and performed the necessary hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERMANENT SIZE EXPANSION JUTSU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shouted out the jutsu, the fine print on the scroll began to become legible.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The city was in ruins, the entire population of Earth was decimated and even her friends weren't spared from the onslaught. It was all because of him, Trigun, the demon that took away everything she held dear, and she had just the artifact needed to put an end to his cursed existence once and for all. The last remaining survivor of the onslaught, the Teen Titan Raven, held in her hands the artifact that her friends sacrificed their lives for and she would make sure that their heroism will not be in vain. Opening the box that held the artifact, which was no bigger than one meant to hold an engagement ring, she sees an oval jewel of sapphire colour and on topof the box there was a small note that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whosoever consumes the Heart of Eternal Enhancement<br>\r\n  A force of eternal and endless power shall become.<br>\r\n  Its owner will lose the former heart along with any weaknesses it had<br>\r\n  Being replaced with the new one forevermore<br>\r\n  Be warned, however, that the Heart seeks continuous improvement<br>\r\n  Eventually blinding its owner with desires of such nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I'm gonna let a poem that can't even rhyme right deter me from giving Trigun what's coming to him\" was Raven's only heed she gave to the warning. The note also had at the bottom 3 words: \"Eternia Xesium Nevar\". Swallowing it, as stated by the poem, she could feel how the gem slowly made its way through her body where her heart was.As soon as it reached there, she felt pain the likes of which she has never felt before. She sensed how the Heart was eating her own, replacing it and attaching itself to Raven's body for all time. The process took only a few minutes, but to Raven it felt like a lot more,leaving her on her knees and panting heavily. However, after the Heart was done placing itself in her body, she felt an incredible power surge through her, a power much stronger than all others she has seen before merged into one. She could feel it pulse just like how a normal heart would and with every pulse she felt stronger and stronger. Another thing she noticed was the strands of hair in front of her eyes. She didn't remember having them this long or as silky. When she got back up she noticed 2 things: 1) the floor seemed way farther down than usual and she wasn't even flying; 2)there were two very large beanbag-sized orbs attached to her chest were her breasts should be, jiggling aroung wildly at the slightest of movements, along with two orbs of equal size were her butt was. She went looking for a mirror, found one and even though it was partially cracked she could see herself clearly: she was huge. Her body looked like that of a 20-year old, with breasts that protruded proudly from her chest, covering her waist and a butt that made exercise balls look like golf balls; her hair became incredibly long, thin and silky, going down to just below her now nicely enlarged hips, to accompany her butt. Her outfit has also somehow changed:her cape has somehow disappeared and her usual attire was replaced with a very thin V-string bikini that did nothing to hide her curves. 'Oh great,this definitely doesn't leave anything to the imagination\" she said in a dry tone.She would have to get back to these changes later, right now she had someone's butt to kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile flying to the location where her father was, she noticed that she had flown there instantly,as if by teleportation, but it was definitely flying. She also noticed that her attributes weren't heavy at all, in fact she felt lighter than ever before. Standing before her father, she said:\"You have taken from me what I cherished the most, prepare for a merciless beating.\" This in turn only got a mocking laugh from him,\"My,my, it has been a while, Raven. Looks while you've developed into a woman I never thought you were capable of, oh well, more flesh for me to devour. Now come, be a good little girl and feed your daddy for all time sakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong choice of words, old goat - ETERNIA XESIUM NEVAR!\" A flash of majestic blue light emanated from her, blinding Trigun for a few moments before finally making out what was before him:a fingernail. Not just any fingernail though. This one belonged to a toe attached to a continent-sized Raven, her breasts now reaching the ground even though she was standing straight, with her butt now so big it reached her neck while also touching the ground. Trigun was simply stunned with terror,he never met a being as big as him, and now he couldn't even reach the size of his own daughter's toenail.\" I surrender?\" he stuttered. She raised her foot. \"Wrong answer,insect\" And she stepped hard, so hard it was half-way to the center of the Earth. She then rubbed her foot on the ground, twisting it again and again until his remains would be burned by the friction she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Trigun now defeated once and for all, she truned her attention to the now desolate planet, saying that with her friends gone, the Universe has no meaning and if the Universe has no meaning than what's the point of it even existing. Since there was no turning back for her now, why not use her powers to punish the Universe since it dared to mock her friends' efforts by simply existing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would chant the words that will help her for this great cause:\"ETERNIA XESIUM NEVAR\". The effects were instant. In a matter of seconds, her size grew so big, the Earth looked like the size of a pea. In order to her to finally detach herself from the pain, she immediately consumed everything that reminded her of the tragic event,starting with the planet she came from,then the entire Solar System and now she needed to consume everything else. She said those words once again, this time with a slightly content smile on her lips:\"Eternia Xesium Nevar!\". She now entered a new growth spurt,one which will never cease and will only accelerate the more she consumes.Her breasts and booty also started expanding;they were now twice the size of her own body,then they grew three timew, ten times, hundred fold and would only continue increasing their growth rate with each thing in the Universe raven would consume. Raven couldn't help but rub her endowments in ecstasy, she never felt a pleasure like this and now she had all the time she wanted to play with them. The Milky Way was next to go,then other galaxies,before Raven could even blink the entire Universe was now consumed by her and she was still growing. Is this enough? NOT BY A LONG SHOT. Raven is still far from satisfied,so she continues growing, continuously seeking for anything to consume and avenge her friends even further. But was this what Raven really wanted or was it what the jewel wanted her to think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows?</span></div></div>",
