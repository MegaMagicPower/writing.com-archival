The Major Allen Project was a local band and it consisted of five members.<br>\r\n First There was Steven Cannete, Steven was what most would consider to be 'White Trash', he lives with his father and younger brother and was pretty infamous around Detriot as a dick. <br>\r\nNext There was Spider, he was the goth of the group, he wasn't the social type to strangers but surprisingly excellent at flirting, everyone called him Spider because he had a birthmark on his neck that looked like an hourglass, he loved it. <br>\r\nThen there was Ricky Akmun, Ricky isn't the type of kind  most would hang out with, but he was good for laughs, and he was on hell of a songwriter, he looked up to the rest of the band <br>\r\nThere was also Alex Crusan, Most people called him Spade because he knew his way around a deck of cards, he was also rumored to have the fastest hands in Detroit, he had top scores on a lot of arcade games, and his guitar skills were legendary for a kid of his status <br>\r\nLastly There was Alan Johnson, Everyone Called him Major Because His Band's Name was Major Allen, he was sort of the big brother of the group, he was considered the only one who truly knew The 'MA Sound'  meaning he would abandon entire finished songs if they didn't meet his approval.<br>\r\nThe five boys were sitting at the table sparring conversations as Major pulled out a piece of paper setting it on the table <br>\r\n\"What's That\" Spade asked as Major responded<br>\r\n\"It's the funding for that tour bus we've been wanting\" Major said as the band cheered<br>\r\n\"How did you get that much money\" Spider asked confused<br>\r\n\"I got us a job\" Major replied picking up a wing <br>\r\n\"A Job?\" Steven asked stuffing his face with French Fries as Major handed his the paper<br>\r\n\"We're teaching music to a bunch of girls?\" Steven replied in confusion<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't Like it either but The headmistress said she pays well\" Major replied as Alex held up his glass <br>\r\n\"A toast to the Project\" he said the other 4 did the same<br>\r\n\"Then It's settled Let's Hit the road\" Major said as the boys stood up putting money on the table leaving the bar heading into an old rusted van and driving off as they came to       </span></span></div></div>",

Tanis yawned finding the conversation boring walking to the bathroom as she closed the door taking up her pajamas as she placed the cork in the tub loosening the value making a squeaking noise as the water flowed. Tanis then picked up a bottle of body wash squirting a huge glob in the ceramic tub as the water became foamy. She then placed her toes in the water making sure the water was at a perfect temperature as picked up a washcloth running it thru the cloudy suds-filled water  rubbing her arms with it, she managed to collect an amount of grime off as noticed the tub was full she turned off the water and just laid back wringing out the cloth before placing the it over her eyes as the warm water soaked her skin in a pleasant feeling as the whole school was quiet. Tanis was able to hear the crickets chirping as her mind clouded with various thoughts as Tanis placed her hand on her stomach rubbing herself finding pleasure in the act. Tanis was no stranger to physical acts spending most most of her life with older girls, being by herself has been somewhat of a late night and all alone ritual. as Tanis decided now she was alone, Tanis was so out of it that she didn't even hear the footsteps coming from outside the bathroom as the single thought of enjoyment ran thru Tanis' head, she was so sure she was the only one up that she didn't bother locking the door as the wooden door to the bathroom slowly opened making a creak as a figure walked into the steam filled room<br>\r\n\"Tanis\" The figure whispered somewhat surprised to see her as Tanis suddenly stopped what she was doing and turned her head unable to identify the figure due to the washcloth blocking her vision.as a set of finger pinched the corner of the cloth lifting it up as Tanis' eyes focused on the girl infront of her </span></span></div></div>",

Winnie turned around and saw the two of them laughing, but Winnie focused more on Brevin. <br>\r\nWhen she first met Brevin he was rough looking, and seemed free.<br>\r\nBut now he seemed terribly tense,' does he have women problems?' <br>\r\nWhen Winnie walked up to the two of them, they stopped and watched her approach, and when she sat next to sibella she saw differing expressions on their faces.<br>\r\nSibella was smiling, but Brevin had look of concern on his face.<br>\r\n\"Sibella was just telling me what kinds of monsters you all are\", he said.<br>\r\n\"Sibella! You weren't supposed to-\", \"Winnie Ive already known about the monster thing since last night\", Brevin said interrupting Winnie. <br>\r\nBrevin then told Winnie about his conversation with sibella last night, and how sibella apoligized to him and so forth, Winnie simply sat there taking in the whole story.<br>\r\n\"Honestley Winnie I didn't expect you to be the werewolf, I figured you where a gargoyle.\"<br>\r\n \"A gargoyle?!\", the two girls said in unison, \"what? They're awesome, they fly even though they are born of stone.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, just so you know its about time to go\", said a voice. <br>\r\nThe trio looked and saw a puppy around winnies size. <br>\r\n\"Thanks scrappy,\" sibella said to the young pup.<br>\r\nBrevin stood up and said, \" I'm heading out to the car, sibella you should gather the other girls, if you'd please.\" <br>\r\n\"Sure thing\", sibella said with a smile. <br>\r\nAs the four girls made their way to Brevins car, they noticed something off.<br>\r\n Brevin was standing outside his car not unusual, but he was standing on the passenger side. <br>\r\n\"Sibella, can you drive?\" \"No\", sibella replied. \"Good, this should be fun here are the keys\", he said handing them to her. \"I'm certified to give driving exams, consider this practice. Now let's get to the picnic\", he said getting in the passenger side. <br>\r\nWhen the girls got inside Brevin was, holding a clipboard and wearing a tie.<br>\r\n\"Hello sibella, my name is Brevin and I will be your driving instructor today\", he said in a deep, monotone voice. <br>\r\n\"Please note we have passengers in the back seat, so caution is a necessity.\" \"Um, OK\", sibella said when she got in the seat.<br>\r\n\"Now the first two steps are obvious. Seatbelts, and the ignition, got your seatbelts on girls? Good, now sibella start the car please.\" <br>\r\nSibella turned the key in the ignition, and the Cadillac hummed to life.<br>\r\n\"Good\", Brevin said writing things down on the clipboard. <br>\r\nBrevin then told sibella to put the car in reverse, then lightly hit the gas, she did both perfectley.<br>\r\n\"Great! That was wonderful\", Brevin said writing on the clipboard again.<br>\r\n\"Now put it in drive, then hit the gas smoothley, we need to get with the others\", major and shaggy where leaving the parking lot, at that moment.<br>\r\n Sibella quickly and carefully caught up with the others. <br>\r\n\"Sibella, your a natural, you know that?\", Brevin said. <br>\r\nSibella blushed, \"thanks Mr beard, this is fun\", she said. <br>\r\nBrevin then asked sibella a series of questions, keeping his face stoic as sibella answered them. <br>\r\nBrevin also briefed sibella on lights and signs, quickley and efficientley, sibella missed no signs she came to.<br>\r\n\"Sibella, you did great I'll save these papers and take you to the DMV tomorrow\", Brevin said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Brevin, really I can't wait. Not even daddy has a licence\", sibella said, smiling.<br>\r\nUp ahead shaggy and major where turning into a small, lot where a big rusty bus sat. \"Fantastic, were here\", sibella said.</span></div></div>",

She was outdoor, and that's where the young girl felt the most free as she sat on the ground laying down to nap as Tanis swam up to her<br>\r\n\"Jessica you want to talk?\" The young Mummy asked <br>\r\n\"Go away\" Jessica replied without even turning  <br>\r\n\"Something troubling you, i'm here for you\" Tanis replied<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk to you\" Jessica replied<br>\r\n\"You'll feel better if you talk about it, I'm your friend Jessica\" Tanis replied as Jessica sigh<br>\r\n\"Tanis we are not <i>friends</i> we are <i>classmates</i> that is a difference and unless were in class i'm not obligated to talk to you, so go bother Mary or whatever you do, just as long as your not here\" Jessica said as Tanis turned away swimming away<br>\r\n\"What crawled up her butt and died\" Winnie whispered to Chika as unknowingly the kids were being watched by a shady figure standing on a tree branch in the distance glancing thou binoculars as the unknown assailant  picked up a walkie-talkie<br>\r\n\"I have confirmed targets, Permission to proceed\" The figure asked<br>\r\n\"Permission denied, you on O&amp;R duty stay down\" The voice said thru the head phone<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress what a minute... is that who I think it is\" The figure said hanging up the device and pulling a red blade from it sheath attached on the figure's back<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch\" the figure said </span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:2.0;\"> \"Actually I'm pretty curious, so tell me\", Jessica said. The stranger looked quite surprised, she wasn't expecting manners. <br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't well expecting manners you undead h\u00fcndin\", she said. <br>\r\n\"My name is Shedra. I am on assignment to, watch you and your friends\", the redhead added . <br>\r\n\"Who hired you to watch us?\", Jessica asked angrily. <br>\r\n\"My superiors don't tell me things like that. But I'm simply on orders to, observe and report duty\", Shedra replied.<br>\r\n \"Shedra, you better answer me, or else. So believe me, its better if you answer\", Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"Wow, you're sounding an awful lot like major right now\", Shedra chuckled. <br>\r\n\"You know major and his friends...Exactley who are you?\", Jessica asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm an ex-girlfriend actually\", Shedra said. \"You dated one of my teachers!?!\", Jessica yelled. Shedra almost laughed, <br>\r\n\"don't be ridiculous, of course I didn't date your teachers\", she said. <br>\r\n\"But if you didn't date the band, then that leaves--\", Jessica didn't finish before she noticed a bright red dot was seen by the two of them.<br>\r\n It started moving to Shedra, climbing her leg. The it kept going, until it stopped on Shedra's chest. Shedra waited, then ducked yelling Jessica to do the same. *BOOOM*. Jessica saw the tree behind Shedra, now had a splintering hole in it. Jessica was hearing a high-pitched pinging, and nothing else. When it stopped, she and Shedra got to their feet.<br>\r\n \"What are you  doing here Sonya\", a grim yet angry voice said. Jessica then saw Brevin standing next to her. He did not look happy, and he had a large gun in his hands. <br>\r\n\"Brevin, you almost killed us!\", Jessica yelled. <br>\r\n\"I just needed Sonya on her knees, so I could get down without a hitch\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"I had no intentions of, killing anyone.\" Shedra was standing again, with an unhappy look on her face. <br>\r\n\"Jessica, go back to the others. This may get messy\", Brevin said. Jessica left, but stopped at the bend then she hid and watched.<br>\r\n Brevin was charging Shedra like a bull and punched her gut. She went down, but gave him a swift uppercut, followed by a series of punches. Brevin grabbed her hand and twisted her arm, she grunted and he clocked her teeth. Shedra back-flipped, then kicked Brevin in his knees. Brevin though, had found an opening and brought his fists down on her skull. Shedra was on the ground, stunned from the last hit. Brevin was gonna strike once more, but Shedra had one last trick up her sleeve. She jumped up, and kissed Brevins lips.<br>\r\n Brevin stopped moving, Shedra punched him and he was down. Shedra took the opprutunity to retreat. Jessica meanwhile, waited a few minutes before she went to check brevin. He was alive, but deeply unconscious. Jessica didn't know what to do, but she did have an idea. She brought her mouth to his to give him air, and she used her hands to steadily push up and down on his chest. It didn't seem to have an effect, so she tried something else. SLAP!!!<br>\r\n \"Ow, what was that for Jessica\", Brevin said. Jessica wrapped her arms around him, nearly choking Brevin. <br>\r\n\"Thank goodness, I thought you were dead dude\", she said. <br>\r\n\"I thought a Voorhees preffered people dead\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"Well I'm not as completely cruel as most voorhees are\", Jessica said. Brevin stood up and almost stumbled, it was obvious to Jessica that he was injured in more than one place.<br>\r\n \"We need to get back to the others, Jess. I don't think its as safe at Grimwoods, as it seems. Especially if, Sonya is involved\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"That's weird, she said her name was shedra\", Jessica said. \"So she changed her name then\", Brevin said looking to the distance. </span></span></div></div>",

Brevin. put his key in the initiation starting the car as he drove up a dirt path on to the main road getting one last glance at the vans driving in the opposite direction.

Brevin was focusing on the empty streets ahead of him as he traveled down the road thinking about Sonya, she wasn't necessarily a \"bad\" girl she was intimidating, considering she was an expert killer, Brevin was sort of terrified of her, she could've killed him on multiple occasions, but has let him live, maybe was trying to prove something, Brevin thought turning the radio on to a soft rock station, Brevin tried to clear his head but couldn't get Sonya out of his head, yes She was a killer but she was still at one point his girlfriend, and that time they had together was nice, infact her hobbies were the only reason he broke up with her as he glanced at the stars just wishing they could've at least remained friends Brevin was shocked back into reality as he was caught of guard seeing two lights on the road. as he slammed the breaks slamming a raccoon in the air as a noise was heard<br>\r\n\"Ow the figure mumbled as Brevin looked at the figure it was    </span></span></div></div>",

I can't do this\" Spider replied <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sibella replied as he got off the bed leaving the room. Sibella just sat there shocked that Spider just walked out on her, HER, the daughter of Count Dracula, and a human just turned her down, she was in disbelief, she thought her seduction was flawless but how could a human just walk away. eventually the thought subsided as she laid down thinking it was his loss. Sibella just laid there still curious as to how Spider just resisted her so easily but she let the thought die after he would eventually break but for now she was willing to wait as she drifted off to sleep. the next morning came as Sibella woke up yawning as she got off the bed doing a couple stretches putting her clothes on and meeting the other girls for breakfast<br>\r\n\"Morning Sibella\" Miss Grimwood replied handing her a plate of breakfast as she sat down eating her bowl of oatmeal<br>\r\n\"Hey Miss Grimwood, where's Mr. Allen and the other teachers?\" Winnie asked eating a piece of toast as Miss Grimwood poured a cup of tea<br>\r\n\"Said something about having some errands to run\" Miss Grimwood replied as Winnie shrugged<br>\r\n\"Well I hope there back before classes\" Goonie replied<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose we better get ready for classes\" Chika said as the girls finished there breakfast going to Arts and Crafts.The girl were working on sketches with the topic \" a day of summer\" as the girls were working on the sketches as Tanis walked up to Sibella eyeing her picture<br>\r\n\"Nice drawing\" The young mummy replied looking at the pastel drawing which was a sandy beach<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks\" Sibella replied<br>\r\n\"Can i Borrow your colored pencils?\" Tanis asked as Sibella handed her the box<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm not using them\" Sibella replied as Tanis went back to her table sitting next to Mary   </span> </span></div></div>",

Tanis was building a sandcastle in her room with the sand on her floor, it made her feel more at home, Phanty was reading a magazine which Zina couldn't read the title but had a female monster on the cover, and Winnie was doing some stretching.

The air was wet and warm as Zina ran her hand across the foggy mirror getting a glance of her self as she proceeded to undo her pink dress and stepping in the shower humming as she pulled down the squeaky metal knob causing the water to fall as the first seconds made Zina shiver as it made contact on her skin, but the water heated up quickly as Zina reached for a Washcloth scrubbing herself humming a melody    </span></span></div></div>",

Jess was teleported to a dark alleyway led by a monster running thru the wet ground as rain bounced of the ground, It was a werewolf about 20, grey fur and a mohawk as a red jeep stopped infront of them and two mercs stepped out, it was Greasemonkey and Poolshark, Jessica took notice of their features as the shark mutant landed a punch on the grey monster<br>\r\n\"Hand it over\" Poolshark said to the grey creature as a punch landed on him from behind, he two turned seeing two more wolfs behind them, one black with a long beard and brown with blond dreads<br>\r\n\"You Pyramid mercs, think you're so smart\" The black wolf said pinning Poolshark and Greasemonkey to his jeep <br>\r\n\"The only reason you made it this far is because we let you\" The brown wolf said as The grey one reached in the dumpster pulling out a shotgun tossing it to the black wolf aiming it at the back Poolshark's head<br>\r\n\"Any last words\" The Grey wolf said in a cocky attitude as Poolshark smiled .Jessica was curious on this guys ability to be ballsy, eventhough he was about to be killed <br>\r\n\"You might want to look behind you\" Poolshark said with his standardattitude. <br>\r\n\"Not the old, behind you trick, that the oldest---\" The wolf was cut of feeling two hands on his his shoulder as he turned around seeing the hairy merc known as Wolfang, stepping out from the shadows as he spun the monster's head in a 360 as it spun off the neck like a top rolling on the floor. Jessica just covered her mouth, she a lotof stuff, but never saw a Monsters head get popped off like a soda cap<br>\r\n\"Bout time you showed up \" Greasemonkey said as the black wolf aimed the gun at Wolfang who quickly snatched it, discharging it in the black wolf's chest as he picked up the brown wolf with one arm tossing him on the jeep <br>\r\n\"Mama\" the wolf replied in shock as the merc jammed his hand in the creatures ribcage pulling one of the bones as the creature yelled in pain, the merc jammed his knife repeatedly in the carcass. For the first time in her life Jessica looked sqiumish, yes her father killed people, but he was brutal with her present as Wolfang pulled his knife's out. Poolshark walked up the the headless grey wolf reaching in his coat pocket taking out an envelope. as he walked to a payphone placing a few coins in and pushing a few buttons as Poolshark was speaking with an unknown contact<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Poolshark stated<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we got it, how do you, okay we'll mail it asap, you mail the money to where we agreed\" pool shark said hanging up the phone<br>\r\n\"Thanks for showing Wolfang, you saved my ass\" Greasemonkey said<br>\r\n\"Killing those fuckers, builds appetite\" Wolfang said <br>\r\n\"What you think some Tacos\" Poolshark said<br>\r\n\"Cool, Wolfang's buying\" The merc said picking up the grey head shooting it like a basketball as it bounced off the wall bouncing off the dumpster landing near Jessica.<br>\r\n\"that went in\"Wolfang said as the could help but vomit clenching her stomach as she closed the book. Part of Jessica was eager to see more, but she couldn't seem to open the book, it wasn't looked, but for for the first time she was felling something she never felt before     </span></span></div></div>",

Chika placed the outfit on the mattress of her bed  sitting beside it, the young girl picked up her classical guitar plucking  few strings. Chika noticed one of the strings out of key as she placed her fingers on the peg turning it as the string wound up tight breaking as the string slashed the girl's finger open, the cut wasnt that deep but it diffidently broke the skin. Chika placed her finger in her mouth before looking for something to wrap it in, Chika found  napkin wrapping it around her finger and securing it with tape; this would make a temporary band-aid as the chupacabra left her room setting the guitar on her bed. Chika decided she could ask Tanis from a small roll of bandages as she knocked on the stone door leading to Tanis' room as the young mummy replied <br>\r\n\"Yes\" The mummy replied opening the door as Chika looked at her <br>\r\n\"Why do you look so flustered?\" Chika asked<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I'm just a little hot\" Tanis replied shrugging her shoulders<br>\r\n\"I cut my finger, I was wondering if you had some spare bandages\" Chika asked as Tanis went to her cabinet<br>\r\n\"Of course\" the mummy said handing her a roll about as thick as a coin,<br>\r\n\"Let me help you with that\" the mummy offered taking the makeshift band-aid as Tanis looked in mild disgust<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad\" Chika said as the mummy firmly wrapped the bandages around Chika's finger using the bandage endings to make a little bow<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Chika said as Tanis smiled<br>\r\n\"Welcome, you probably keep that on\" Tanis said walking with chika out of the room closing the stone door<br>\r\n\"What is that girl doing in there?\" Chika asked herself<br>\r\n\"Hey Chika, have you seen Steven anywhere?\" Major asked who was behind her as the girl turned around<br>\r\n\"No, but I'll keep an eye out for him\" Chika replied <br>\r\n\"If you see him, tell him i'm going to the store, I already told the other guys\" Major said<br>\r\n\"Will do\" Chika said sliding her finger in her pocket.   </span></span></div></div>",

Stake made her way thru the air duct as the alarm blared she crawled to the motor pool as she stopped seeing the open lot. something was wrong, why wasn't anyone guarding the lot, she concluded they were were heading to the armory. Stake took no time getting her car and driving out of the fort crashing thru the wooden fence and skidding into Traffic.  Back in the base Thirteen was watching the camera smirking underneath the mask coating is face<br>\r\n\"Sir with all respect why did we let her get away?\" Mechuzi asked who was operating the projector <br>\r\n\"She'll lead us Right to him\" Thirteen replied showing a piece of plastic which his men recovered.

Okay major said uneasy seeing the dying monster as they rushed to door opening it seeing Jack the white wolf and two men as they busted thru the door<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere\" Jack said <br>\r\n\"Jack, Long time, how's the eye?\" Sonya asked as Jack pulled out a huge hunting knife spinning it with his fingers he charged Sonya.

Sonya threw the knife into the chest of the other grunt as he groaned. Sonya took the opportunity picking him up and throwing him on the pizza stove as he squirmed on the grill the flesh melting and burning to a crisp<br>\r\n\"Shedra, I should've killed you when I Had the chance\" Jack replied charging her as Major tossed her the stool which she used to block the knife blow as the two continued to fight as Major rummaged around looking for something that would make a good weapon as he found a rocking pizza cutter. Jack and Sonya were fighting as Sonya blew fire out of her mouth trying to hit Jack \" Hey Lucy!\" major called out as the wolf turned. major swung the cutter out of anger as it sliced thru Jack's neck. the killer gripped his throat firmly <br>\r\n\"Leave her alone, If anyone pisses her off It's gonna be me\" Major replied out of pure rage as Jack squirmed. Sonya took her chance kicking him right in the junk as he moved his hands causing his throat to flood with his own blood. major Looked at the dead body dropping the cutter in shock of what he did<br>\r\n\"I Can't believe you killed him\" Sonya said impressed<br>\r\n\"Why, he's dead, i took a man's life?\" Major said ashamed<br>\r\n\"Major, This is White Jack, he is a mass murderer, he has been our hit-list for years, and YOU just killed him\" Sonya said taking a picture <br>\r\n\"What's his beef with you?\" Major asked<br>\r\n\"You've been tagged\" Sonya replied<br>\r\n\"Now is not the time for sexual jokes!\" Major replied<br>\r\n\"No Major, You're wanted by Pyramid, They think you're working with this guy, but if you killed him, that can't be true\" Sonya replied<br>\r\n\"I've never met this guy!\" major freaked out<br>\r\n\"I know that, Come with me, If we explain what happened, I'm sure they'll believe you\" Sonya said<br>\r\n\"Okay FINE\" Major replied as Sonya popped the trunk of her car reaching for a trash bag as she placed jacks dead body in it, tying the bag as she put it in the trunk<br>\r\n\"When they find out you killed White Jack, They might even give you a medal\" Sonya said as they got in the car as drove off  <br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

She had spent a portion of the previous night, crying herself to sleep. She put her robe on, brushed her hair and went down to help Grimwood with breakfast. When Sibella reached the kitchen, miss G asked Sibella to reach in the fridge for eggs. Sibella was fine with it, and brought the eggs to her. <br>\r\n\"Sibella, is everything OK? You look like you were crying\", miss grimwood said. <br>\r\n\"Really miss Grimwood, everything's fine\", Sibella said.<br>\r\n Breakfast wasn't eventful, the girls are talking but Sibella didn't hear them. After breakfast was over, the girls were conversing on the way to class. Sibella stood from them though, she walked further behind them. Sibella didn't feel like chit-chatting. In class, miss Grimwood said to draw something to signify what they felt in their hearts. Sibella knew this was a ruse, miss grimwood wants to see what's got Sibella down. Sibella drew a happy image, her and Scooby Doo sitting on the front stairs.<br>\r\n Music class was almost just as slow, major was describing the different types of guitars. He also talked about, the differences of electric and acoustic. The other girls raised hands and asked questions, the band answering swiftly. Gym class was next of course, and the girls started running around the school. Then they lifted weights, an easy task for most girls. Then lastly, they practiced volleyball. Sibella struggled as her serve was off. Then they hit the showers, after so they were done for the day.<br>\r\n Sibella was alone under a tree, she was doodling and watching Steven, major and Brevin chop wood. Brevin tossed logs in the air, then chopped each in half. Then major and Steve would split those halves, and shaggy, Scooby, and scrappy carried the wood to the pile. 'Boys', Sibella thought as this method was dumb and dangerous. It was efficient though, the boys finished in about 30 minutes.<br>\r\n \"Hey, something wrong?\", a voice said. Sibella looked up to see Brevin standing next to her. Sibella figures someone should know, so she'll talk in private with the groundskeeper. <br>\r\n\"I'm having boy trouble\", she said. Brevin sat down with her, and closed his eyes. <br>\r\n\"Whose the guy?\", he asked. <br>\r\n\"Its spider\", Sibella replied. <br>\r\n\"OK then, so what's the trouble?\", Brevin asked. Sibella told Brevin the truth, knowing she won't get the right help otherwise. <br>\r\n \"Interesting, so spider ran because your a girl ghoul. Your sad because, you believe as such he won't like you, the real you\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, wait aren't you scared that I'm a monster?\", Sibella asked. <br>\r\n\"This isn't the first time I've met real monsters\", Brevin said to a surprised Sibella. <br>\r\n\"You've met real monsters before?\", Sibella asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes\", he said flatly. The pair spent the best part of the next hour under the tree, talking and laughing. Miss Grimwood smiled, as she watched from the window.<br>\r\n Brevin took out a small box from his pocket, with a thoughtful look on his face. <br>\r\n\"Sibella, I used to have a love of my own, we spent much together. But, sadly it did not last. We broke up only a week before the 1-year anniversary of our 1st date\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"Why would you tell me?\", Sibella asked. <br>\r\n\"To celebrate, I bought a, $1,800 necklace for her. After we broke up, I had no one to give it to. But I decided to give it to someone special, so I want you to have it\", Brevin said holding out the box.<br>\r\n Sibella opened the box and gasped, the necklace was gorgeous. The chain was cord-thick and made of gold. The piece was a cutout heart made of gold also. Inside the heart, was a cursive style S lined with diamonds. <br>\r\n\"Its beautiful, I've never seen anything like it\", Sibella said. <br>\r\n\"Brevin I love it, I owe you one\", Sibella said. Sibella put the necklace on and went inside. <br>\r\n 'She's a good kid', Brevin thought as he went back in to see what else Miss G needed.</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:2.0;\">\"Sorry girls\", Major said,'but this is a practice session, you can't listen.\" The girls walked away sadly, and in defeat. They joined the rest of the students in the den, all who were doing their own thing.<br>\r\n \"They didn't want, us listening\", Winnie said in defeat. <br>\r\n\"Its fine Winnie, well get a chance soon, I'm sure\", Sibella said.<br>\r\n \"OK girls, gather 'round\", miss grimwood said. <br>\r\n\"What is it miss Grimwood?\", Winnie asked.  <br>\r\n\"Would one of you girls like to, accompany Mr rogers to the airport? He needs to pick up, the new groundskeeper, who is just getting back to town today\", miss Grimwood said. <br>\r\n\"Sure I shall take up the honor of this traveling commission\", Mary said. <br>\r\n \"Thank you Mary, Shaggy is just getting his keys\", miss Grimwood said as Mary walked to the front door where shaggy was waiting.<br>\r\n \"Ready to go , Mary?\", shaggy asked.<br>\r\n \"Indeed Mr Rogers, but may I ask of you, your verification to allow me to interject an inquiry of earthly matters?\", Mary said as they stepped off the porch.<br>\r\n \"You wanna ask a question?\", Shaggy asked.<br>\r\n \"Affirmative\", Mary stated. \"OK then, go ahead\", shaggy said as they buckled up. <br>\r\n\"What is, an airport?\", Mary asked. <br>\r\n\"Oh an airport is, well think of it as a spaceport that is restricted to one planet. Planes can go maybe a bit over, 35000 feet. Planes get you from one place to another place on earth in a matter of hours, it takes a while but you can't beat the view\", shaggy said as they were passing calloways. As they were driving Mary, and shaggy talked a great deal.<br>\r\n \"OK were here mary, get that sign in the back please\", shaggy said. Mary turned, and for the first time she noticed a white sign in the back seat. When she got it out of the car, the words 'Brevin Beard' where visible. <br>\r\n\"Am I to assume this to be the groundskeepers name?\", Mary asked as shaggy nodded. They walked into the airport and saw a clock that said, 10:35 am. <br>\r\n\"Only 25 minutes until the plane lands\", shaggy said. Mary and shaggy went to the terminal they were looking for, stopping for snacks and restroom breaks on the way. Mary looked at the clock, 11am, a loud noise was heard it continuous for a minute or two before ceasing. <br>\r\n\"Is that the plane landing Mr rogers?\", Mary asked. Shaggy noodded, then held up the sign as people got off and were collecting their belongings. Eventually a tired, irritated, looking teenager with glasses and a black hoodie got off and looked directory at the sign. He walked to collect , four identical blue bags, that snapped together and had wheels. This darkley dressed figure made Mary uneasy, but she knew somehow he was who they were looking for. The figure walked up to shaggy, and showed an I'd. Shaggy smiled and held a hand out,the figure took it but said nothing. Brevin silentley guided them to a counter just inside the entrance, where he took out some papers and received a set of car keys. As soon as Brevins luggage was in the van, he held up his hand in a one moment gesture and ran off. A few minutes later, he returned in a white car smaller than shaggys van. Brevin gave a gesture for shaggy to lead the way, and they left the air port. </span> </span></div></div>",

The sign said, \"Deeno's bar and grill\". Shaggy turned into the parking lot, and Brevin followed suit.<br>\r\n\"Table for three?\", the waitress asked when they where inside. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks Dinah\", Brevin said finally speaking. <br>\r\n\"Right this way, Mr Beard\", Dinah said in reply. <br>\r\n\"Everyone here seems to know you\", Mary said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I come here a lot actually\", Brevin said to her. After they ordered their drinks, they browsed the menu. Brevin decided what he wanted almost instantley, and set the menu down. Brevin asked about the other students, and shaggy explained that there are ten students in all. <br>\r\n\"Believe me the girls are sweet really\", shaggy explained to him. Just then, a group of bikers burst in demanding money, threatening people with knives. Brevin was calm as the bikers were surrounded by cowboys and rednecks, all with baseballs, guns, or knives. <br>\r\n\"Nobody threatens this bar ever\", Brevin said. Immediately the bikers were all taken down, and Brevin told the owner to call the cops. Shaggy and Mary watched these events unfold with wide eyes, and open mouths. Brevin then sat down again, and ordered his food as if nothing happened. When the waitress had gone, Brevin told shaggy and Mary, that 90% of all customers are regulars who took an oath to protect this restaurant.<br>\r\n Once they had gone, they drove down the road and eventually passed calloway school. The other students, who were playing ball in the yard had watched the two vehicles park. But they watched the white Cadillac more, staring with interest as the groundskeeper got out of the car. Shaggy introduced, the girls to Brevin, and Brevin to the girls. As they approached the front door, Brevin stopped and looked at a van that was, half hidden. <br>\r\n\"I swear I've seen that van before\", Brevin said. When they reached the door, miss grimwood was waiting to greet him. <br>\r\n\"Now perhaps, you would like to meet the music teachers?\", miss grimwood asked. <br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll do that what are they like?\", Brevin asked. <br>\r\n\"See for yourself\", miss grimwood said.</span></div></span></div></div>",

Plus, they are awesome with music\", Brevin said. <br>\r\n\"That sounds like the music teachers, right Sibella?\", Winnie said to her classmate. Sibella merely nodded in response.<br>\r\n Meanwhile, the band had finished rehearsing, and were now doing they're own things. Major, was just going over some chords. Ricky and Alex, were eating chips and playing poker. Steven was thinking of Winnie, while sipping on a General Fizz. Spider in the while had taken refuge in the corner, tuning his bass while listening to a sports game with the radio on low. <br>\r\n *Knock**knock*, \"who is it?\", Major asked. <br>\r\n\"Its miss Grimwood, I have a couple of students with me. We're wondering if you boys wanna, meet the new groundskeeper?\", miss Grimwood asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm not doing anything\", Steven said getting up. When Steven opened the door, miss Grimwood said the new groundskeeper went down stairs. <br>\r\n\"Alright, that's fine\", Steven said while walking away. Just as Steve and Winnie where reaching the last stair, Steven heard a familiar-seeming voice.<br>\r\n \"But my point is, never go to western Europe without a translator\", a voice said followed by laughter. <br>\r\n\"That voice, Winnie that voice is familiar sounding\", Steven said to the wolf chick. <br>\r\n\"Really? That's the groundskeepers voice\", Winnie said. <br>\r\n\"What does he drive, do you know Winnie?\", Steven asked her. <br>\r\n\"He drives a white, 4-door Cadillac. I saw the license plate to it was, M-J-R-A-L-N-1\", Winnie said to the shocked drummer. <br>\r\n\"Winnie, the license plate says,'Major Allen #1', but it can't be. Winnie we only know one person, who drives a car like that\", Steven said to her.<br>\r\n They walked into the living room, that's when Steven saw him. <br>\r\n\"Brevin!\", Steven almost shouted the word, the groundskeeper looked at Steve but could not believe it. <br>\r\n\"Steven, man why are you-- oh No way. You and the guys are the music teachers!\", he also almost shouted.<br>\r\n \"You guys know each other?\", the girls all asked at the same time. <br>\r\n\"Oh me and the band go way back\", Brevin said.<br>\r\n \"Come on, I'm sure the band will like seeing you again\", Steve said going upstairs with Brevin following.</span></span></div></div>",
