It had already been over an hour since he\u2019d devoured his last victim, and it seemed like an eternity. The farmer had stopped struggling after about fifteen minutes, but that was nature. And it took a lot of people every day just to fuel his huge centaur body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes stifled a belch. That was probably one of the farmer\u2019s stablehands disagreeing with him. It was only 9:00 AM and already four humans had made the final plunge into his horsebelly where they were swiftly broken down. Suddenly, the centaur\u2019s belly let out a loud rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Greedy thing, you haven\u2019t even finished on the people from this morning.

He wasn't sure what it was called, but any place would do, for him to get a meal, and maybe a snack, or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he came upon a tiger-like creature sitting in a chair. Pinned to his shirt was a yellow star. Next to him, was a double-barrel shotgun, of a size that would give Wesley some trouble, if he didn't mind his manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Sheriff,\" said Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger looked at him. \"I ain't the Sheriff, otherwise I'd be in the jailhouse, watching the prisoner. He doesn't want me there, on account of how I might make things personal between me and them, especially since the little bastard knocked out three of my teeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that you didn't eat this person that caused you such an annoyance,\" said Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger looked at him more closely. \"How many, and where did you eat them at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four, and from a farm up the road a ways,\" said Wesley. \"Why do you care about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger pointed at a poster. \"Did they look like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley looked. \"Yes. I had all four of them for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger grinned. \"Karma's a real bitch. Those bastards poisoned thirty pigs at the town picnic, and got a lot of folks sick. No deaths, luckily, so we just kicked them out of town, with the understanding that if they came back here, anyone would be allowed to eat them, without paying the fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fee?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mayor's a greedy old lizard,\" the tiger said. \"That dragon figures that each human pays about five hundred dollars a year, in taxes, and figures since a human can live about fifty years, if they are lucky, each human is worth twenty-five thousand dollars in revenue, at the very least. Eat a human, and you need to pay that money, either up front, or over fifty years. Humans like this, because it reduces the odds they'll get eaten, and if a monster does eat them, then the monster pays the taxes in their place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the monsters that live here?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of alternatives for meat, and cheaper as well,\" the tiger said. \"Most don't mind, and them that do, better have the money to pay, for each human that they eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose someone was to eat and run?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger grinned. \"Then they'd be guilty of stealing twenty-five thousand dollars, and have to pay with something other than money. The Mayor likes to eat such thieves, although he does show some mercy, if the human is recovered alive, and merely snaps their neck, instead of roasting them alive, before eating them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of any place having such a law,\" said Wesley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" the tiger said. \"The lizard is a greedy one. Of course, the saloon has good food, the brothel has good whores, there's a bathhouse that does a good job if you need to wash up, and the general store is full of supplies. Just remember, no money, no humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" said Wesley.</span></div></div>",

He carefully pulled a pearl-handled revolver out of his pack. \"The one threatened me with this.\" He tossed it to the tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger took a look. \"That's Colm's revolver alright.\" He tossed it back. \"If you're short on money, show that to the barkeep, and he'll send someone to get the Sheriff. You let him see that, and he won't ask you no questions about the details. After that, you'll have yourself plenty of money for a meal - just no humans, or any other sentient peoples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much are we talking about?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hundred for Colm, plus fifty each for the other three, and another hundred for all four of the bastards,\" said the tiger. \"I do hope you have some of their personal effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did pick up a few things, as it wasn't like they'd need them anymore,\" said Wesley. \"Might have a few more things later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to clean them before you try to pawn them off,\" the tiger said. \"You might want to keep the revolver though, as that is a fine weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Wesley. \"See you when I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your time here,\" said the tiger. \"Just don't cause no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Wesley entered the saloon. While the place had plenty of dancing girls, and plenty of patrons, the one thing that surprised him were the number of humans, and the fact that none of them were going down someone's throat. That being said, the food that was being served smelled good, even if it didn't have human served with it, and the portions were generous, to say nothing about the fact that one of the more burly servers brought a raw deer to one of the more carnivorous sorts, among other things for their table guests, like a raw sheep, and a raw pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley walked up to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be?\" the barkeeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have beer?\" Wesley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeeper pulled out a couple of bottles. \"That will be a dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWesley put some money on the counter. \"What would you recommend for someone with a good sized-appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want it raw, we have deer, sheep, goat, pig, and sides of beef,\" the barkeeper said. \"If you want it cooked, you'll have to wait a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I have some business elsewhere?\" Wesley asked. \"Could I order, walk out, do my business, then come back to enjoy my meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long as your business doesn't get you locked up,\" the barkeeper said. \"Give me an order, and I'll give you this chip.\" The barkeeper got out a token. \"Cooking usually takes twenty minutes, but if you aren't here within an hour, we give it to someone else who is here, and has the money to pay for it, at a reduced rate of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Wesley. \"In that case, chili with beef meat, plus a quarter each of sheep, goat, pig, and deer, cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the barkeeper said. He opened up a window behind him and called out the order. \"So, waiting here or do you wish to conduct some other business?\"</span></div></div>",

In it, was a human, who was, more or less, recovering from having something too strong for him to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf stood up, grabbed a bucket, walked over to the cell, and tossed the contents on the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human woke up sputtering. \"What the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad that's just water, and not something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked at him, and groaned. \"My head hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guzzling down Fredrick's Firewater will do that to you,\" said Greyfur. \"Now, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your arms through the bars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human did so, and Greyfur tied his hands together. He then opened the door, and stepped inside, where he lifted the human's shirt, and dropped their pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with,\" the human said. \"You're just going to eat me afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me with that proposition,\" said Greyfur. \"Besides, I'm not going to rape you; I'm going to wash you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, just what are you going to- AHHHH That Stings! What are you doing? Pissing on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish,\" said Greyfur. \"Hot water and soap, not to mention a washcloth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't hurt like that,\" the human muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have the Doc look at you,\" said Greyfur. \"You're all covered in bruises and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should you care?\" the human asked. \"You're just going to eat me anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have an ordinance that's against that,\" said Greyfur. \"Except for certain exceptions, but, thankfully for you, getting drunk, and punching my Deputy isn't one of them, although he wishes it was. As it is, you're going to be stuck here for a month, cleaning the place out; Doc had to pull three of Charlie's teeth out, and he hates that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn cat snuck up on me,\" said the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cats do that,\" said Greyfur. \"Didn't give you the right to hit him. Anyplace else, you'd be dead by now, if not worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I give a damn,\" the human said. \"You monsters control everything, and never let humans do what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't give you an excuse for breaking the law,\" said Greyfur, as he finished washing the human. He then grabbed a dry towel, and started rubbing the human down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can wash and dry myself,\" the human said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you behave yourself,\" said Greyfur.

Now, if you were better behaved, I might let you call me Richard, or Rich, or even Dick, but, until then, Sheriff Greyfur is what you'll address me as, or just plain Sheriff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about if I called you Son of a Bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreyfur shook his head. \"Let's leave my mother out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left the office, and looked around. He looked over at the saloon, which was playing some rather bawdy music. He looked at the brothel, which always had a woman available for him. He then looked over at a traveling medicine salesbeast, which was drawing quite a crowd, with plenty of claims about what their elixirs did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went towards.....</span></div></div>",

Besides, the place had a good bath, and for a little extra, someone could help out, and for a bit more, the bath was big enough for two, for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked in, Greyfur saw the big red dragoness in the front room. \"Madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness smiled as she looked at him. \"A pleasure to see you this morning Richard.

It was a great way to relax, and he was glad that there was at least one of these things in town, let alone five. It wasn't unheard of for someone to come into the place just to take a bath in one of them, even bringing their family in with them, especially for some big event in town. The dragoness didn't mind, so long as she got paid. Of course, there were a few other baths in town, but this place had people willing to help out those bathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door knocked. \"Your helper is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" said Greyfur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came .....</span></div></div>",

You could be anyone you want, from a cowboy driving cattle to market, and battling rustlers, to a townsperson in a western town, to an outlaw who preys on the hard working and honest folk, to a Native American watching as Anglo-American Monsters and humans encroach on your tribe's traditional hunting lands. You could have a code of some sort, like that you don't eat women and children, or some such thing, or you could be downright evil, and do just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Terms of the 19th century are allowed, including those that are considered derogatory today, though try not to use them to excess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If it existed in the Old West, it's allowed, like whorehouses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Technology must be 19th century in style and such. So, when it comes to cameras and guns, no Kodaks, and no Uzis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Sex is allowed, but try to keep it casual, be it gay/lesbian, or straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Vore is allowed, but try to give a reason for the person to do it, like the person is some sort of outlaw, or they did it to protect someone that they care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You can be any monster you want, or even a human, including those with some sort of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Story is to be in the third person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Always give alternatives for different characters, especially for the different types of monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, get along little doggies.</td>",
