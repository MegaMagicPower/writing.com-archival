Luckily no citizen was harmed, but the Simic who owned the frog, reported it had heart burn, and decided to pursue a legal case against against the Izzet who's experiment got out of had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really would like you to deliver this for me.\" She said, giving you a wink.

That as well as the Izzet guild emblem stamped on the front in bright red ink told you that this was indeed an important letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeli bit her lip a bit as she tried to think. \"I'm not high enough to offer you a direct promotion... but my friend and I were talking the other day about how the head of her office is a bit short-staffed at the moment. If you do this for me I'm sure I could put in a good word for you and help you get a higher ranking job.\" she finally said as she rested a hand on your desk. \"I can't promise anything, though I'm sure someone as talented as you would make a good first impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't quite tell if she was being serious or just trying to flatter you into doing her work for her.

I won't forget this.\" Keli replies as she walks back towards her own desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess getting a little exercise will be good.\" you say as you head out of the office area and step into the main hall. This was one of the larger Azorius outposts deep in Alliance territory, though it was still impressive how truly massive and polished everything was.

Even at this early hour the place was packed with thousands of people going about their various tasks and working hard towards a better Ravnica. \"The Selesnya may think they know order, but they've got nothing on us.\" you say proudly as you admire the accomplishments and commendations of your fellow members chronicled on the walls as you pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly twenty minutes of walking you turn down a branching hallway and head up a wide staircase to the third floor. \"Let's see...where was that address at again?\" you think to yourself as you pull out the letter to check it one more time.

The interior of the library was extravagant even by guild standards with a massive domed ceiling stretching nearly two hundred feet above the floor at its highest point. Towering shelves of books lined the inside of the room and tall stained glass windows gave everything a mystic and ethereal quality with its soft rays of light breaking the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood for nearly a minute in awe before you remembered that you still had a task to complete.

Even without the Azorius robes you'd recognize head librarian Delwin anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, I have an important letter for you, presumably from the Izzet.\" you say as you hand him the letter. He takes a quick look at it and smiles as he looks over the seal. \"Ah yes, the Izzet are a strange lot but I'm sure its something important if they went to the trouble of sending a normal letter instead of some sort of prototype messenger golem or something. Thank you.\" he replies as he sits the letter on top of a stack of books he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're most welcome, sir. If you'll excuse me I have to get back to my own duties.\" you say as you bow and excuse yourself. \"Keep up the good work, I see big things in your future.\" Delwin calls as you begin heading for the main door. Just as you are about to step back out into the hallway a loud explosion echoed throughout the building. Several screams of horror and surprise follow as you slowly turn around to see the source of the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank as thin trails of smoke began rising towards the big domed ceiling from the bookshelves were Delwin had been gathering tomes. A tiny orange glow peeked through the narrow spaces as several small objects fell to the floor with sharp thudding sounds. This was bad, very bad... what should you do? </span></div></div>",

You somehow felt invincible as its power simmered at your fingertips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe life of a Boros Legionary was tough and dangerous, maybe this warhammer was just what you needed?

His most distinguishing features, however, were his dark piercing green eyes and full beard that reached the base of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome recruits were fairly surprised when he suddenly smiled and greeted them all in a loud thundering voice. \"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Hall Of Fire! It is here that we first separate the citizens from the soldiers, the Boros from the common people of this city! You are here today to compete for the honor and privilege of being recruited into the most powerful fighting force in all of Ravnica!

Chains of white mana held him down.<br>\r\n\"This better not be a trap, bub.\" You say.<br>\r\nYou  opened up the drawer under the sink and found a soggy, filthy sack. Inside was a small pile of gold. You quickly counted it and found more than sixty gold in there, well over how much you were asking for. You gleefully take it all.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. McSkuzz.

As a veteran member who had managed to last over a year in the service of Rakdos he was the one in charge of leading this particular endeavor. \"Good work my boy, this is some solid craftsmanship!\" he says with a hearty laugh as he chews on a slab of roasted meat. \"Just needs some fresh blood and some streamers and it'll be ready for the main event!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as he hands you a scroll with a list of supplies on it and tells you to have them by midnight if you want to be approved as an apprentice in the Rakdos guild. \"I won't fail you!\" you yell eagerly as you run off down the street towards the market square in the shady part of the district.

The bottle was fairly small, only about two thirds of the size of the nearby wine bottle and was capped with a blue enchanted seal on top of the stopper. Foxglove wasted no time in peeling the seal away and popping the cap off with a loud squeak. A cloudy sky blue aroma rose from the shimmering white liquid inside as it was poured and then evaporated as quickly as it had appeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This drained most of my funds, so you'd better enjoy this.\" Foxglove said teasingly as she handed you your glass.

I know this great place and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly think that can make up for all the hard work of the Conclave you've destroyed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you even care? Afraid I'll report you to the Azorius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because you weren't supposed to be growing it there anyway. You turn me in, and you incriminate yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gives her pause. She must've not realized how much thought you gave into that. She crosses her arms, still studying you, and you figure she's trying to get a read on you. \"So, then why do you care about apologizing? It's not like our guilds are allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Far from it, I know, but I really do feel bad. I mean, I would know how bad I would feel if someone inadvertently destroyed one of my inventions. Look, I know our work is different, and I really don't care all that much about what you do, but it is your work. We all take pride in what we do, and I feel bad that I ruined that. So please, just give me a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a deep breath, clearly looking like she's weighing her options. Finally, she says, \"Fine, it's actually been a while since I've ever been out on the town just for fun. But don't think this means I forgive you. I'm just giving you a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash a wide grin. \"That's all I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait that night at a local Rakdos tavern, wondering if this was really such a good idea. Chances are she wouldn't even bother coming, and all you'd end up doing is wasting precious time in the workshop. Plus, you wonder why you're even bothering with this silly notion. Has simple biology robbed you of your senses that quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to give up on the idea when you find she's standing right behind you. \"Surprised you even remembered,\" she says. \"Aren't the Izzet known for being absent-minded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we just know how to switch focus when we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes, but you can detect a slight hint of playfulness in the gesture. \"Alright, well, I'm waiting for this grand apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I apologized this morning. My offer was to make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so drinks is 'making it up.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of,\" you say. \"Look, I've got some connections with the Simics, and maybe I can get them to help recreate a bud of the plant I destroyed using some of the DNA that was left on my staticaster. Found a few remnants of it stuck inside when I got back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems slightly impressed by this, and actually at a loss for words. No snappy comeback, for once. \"Oh, well...thank you, but...why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a leery look to the hulking Rakdos fellow who drops off your drinks. On your side, they may be, but that doesn't shake the uneasiness you get when you see some of their more frightening members. \"It was something important to you, and I broke it. I thought I'd fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a very direct person,\" she says, \"and I just can't understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"Yeah, people say that a lot. So, in all of this, I never got your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inyeni,\" she answers. \"I guess I really should thank you...I never got your name either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, you hear a great commotion coming from behind you.</span></div></div>",

Your job is to figure out either a new metal or a new structure to improve the mana wells in the Izzet tunnels. Apparently, the Firemind desires something that can withstand a large increase in pressure. Hm, the possibilities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also begin to wonder what on earth this might be for. Again, that part of your mind is fairly silent because only Niv-Mizzet knows why and you shouldn't question it. You take out some parchment and begin scrawling out your ideas as well as making careful notes and measurements. You quickly realize that the best course of action is to start developing a new metal alloy that can handle great pressures without buckling. You find you have three ideas that just might work. However, while you are a great chemister, you're not much of a whiz in metallurgy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you know just the place to go. Krubex can cut, shape, and smith any kind of metal you need, and he just so happens to be a close friend and fellow guildmate. You pack up your stuff and make your way to the boiler system tunnels underground. The goblin's workshop isn't far. You find your friend hard at work, welding away, while his various assistants and automata clink and slam away at other projects. Over the din you shout out, \"Krubex, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short little goblin stops and turns around, taking off his goggles. \"Hey, how are ya?\" he says, coughing a little. \"I haven't seen you in ages. Oh, this? Eh, just some new armor for the Boros. Not a top priority. What can I do ya for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou show him your designs. \"See, this one requires...\" You begin explaining the percentages of the metals to him for each of your designs. \"Can you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratches at the stubble on his chin. \"Mizzium's harder to make alloys with, but worth a shot. You came to the right place. Most metallurgists wouldn't even try. Tell ya what, I'll work on this, and I think the old forge needs some tinkering. I swear it's leaking something. Can ya take a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's one of the things that you love about the Izzet. Usually, so long as you're willing to scratch someone else's back, work and progress get done pretty easily, not like some of the other guilds who try to micromanage themselves, like the Orzhav or the Selesnyans. You take a look at Krubex's forge. Sure enough, it's leaking fuel. Probably could use an improved coolant too, now that you think about it. It's a good thing you carry a lot of your supplies with you on a daily basis. Always be prepared, you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes most of the afternoon, but you leave Krubex's forge in better shape than when it was brand new, and he's more than satisfied with it. \"Perfect, I should be able to finish this order for the Boros on schedule. Here are your samples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you three canisters made from your new metal alloys. Your plan is to take them back to the lab and run them through some tests to see how much pressure they can stand.</span></div></div>",

The apartment was nice, but way too small for you to properly get any big projects done. You let out a sigh as you looked around your overcrowded bedroom and got dressed. Everything from books, jars, plant pots and medical tools were stacked upon the tables and shelves, leaving little to no room for anything not related to your newfound guild. After a quick breakfast you did a bit more cleaning up and organizing to make the place slightly more livable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began cooking a small lunch you noticed that it was nearly noon already, far too late in the day to have done nothing productive. \"I've got another presentation due in just over a week and I haven't made any progress whatsoever since I moved in...\" you say worriedly as you quickly look over a few papers while eating. In another hour you've only had the time to properly set up your experiment zone and sort the equipment you'd need for the tasks ahead of you.

Half of her upper face was chewed away by savage scars and a thin blindfold covered her hollow eye sockets. She had suffered some sort of near lethal attack... or torture.

If you complete this job you'll be made an initiate of the guild. A foolhardy member of the Boros has stolen a flask of my most prized brew, the Dragon Demon Mead.

Until you finish don't return here, or else you'll end up like the last leader who sat in this chair before me... you are dismissed.\" Lilith commands as she claps her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards then escort you back to the front door, which they shut behind you after wishing you luck.

The Slumbering Dragon Inn.\" you say as you check a wooden sign hanging out front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the name was right there in bold lettering with the words \"over 400 years of satisfaction\" written in smaller print just under it. This was a place where diplomats, ambassadors and even guild leaders would stay and do business. It was very cozy and luxurious... and also very very expensive to stay at for just one night. \"I doubt they'll just let me in the front without some sort of invite or a stack of gold.\" you muttered under your breath as you scoped the place out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building was very secure with guards posted at all of the doors and even a few Boros and Azorius officers making their rounds at designated checkpoints.

Luckily, you manage to duck out of the way at the last second and the man who cast the spell is cut down by a woman in a mask wielding an iron battleaxe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close, but I'm almost there!\" you mutter as a stumbling guard nearly knocks you over.

We learn many ancient arts and techniques, but mastery over black and green mana is always at the center of our learning. Once you have unlocked the secrets of our power over life and death you will be ready to serve our guild properly.\" As he speaks Master Guvoi takes a vial of bright green slime and dips the tip of the bone knife into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First you must learn the basics of proper spellcraft and how to harvest the ingredients to fuel it. Our particular branch of magic relies on mana the same as others, but to power the grandest spells you must know more than how to simply manipulate mana.\" At this point the elder shaman moves the blade to his hand and lightly slits his palm just enough to allow a few drops of blood to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny beads of red liquid hit the floor they begin to softly glow with a faint dim green light. \"I'll begin with something easy.\" Master Guvoi says as shadowy wisps encircle his bloodied hand. He kneels down and places his palm over the fresh blood and paints a small symbol with it. A few seconds pass before the blood abruptly stops glowing and turns pitch black it begins to take on a shadowy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a light gasp as the tiny swirl of dark mist takes the shape of a large rat and slowly grows in size. In under a minute the shadows were gone and in their place was a skeletal rat the size of a small dog with raw red muscles exposed under its ragged grey fur. It's eyes glowed the same hue of green as the slime on the knife had and its crooked fangs dripped acidic drool that burned tiny holes were it dripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adorable, isn't he?\" Master Guvoi said suddenly to break the silence. \"This is a fairly basic necromancy spell that allows me to pull the minerals and residue of organic matter from the ground itself and reconstruct a functioning body with it. It has its limits for such a small mana cost, but an army of these basic soldiers can be surprisingly effective.\" With that Master Guvoi waved his hand to cancel the flow of energy powering the rat zombie and it quickly collapsed back into a pile of damp dust and sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see what you can do.\" he say cheerfully as he hands you the bone knife and goes over a few more basic spells you could perform. After going over your options you grip the knife tightly in your hand and begin your first attempt at a spell as an official Golgari shaman.</span></div></div>",

You paint a rune on your hand and try to focus mana from the surrounding area into it, which was surprisingly difficult. Your hand began to glow faintly as you held it up in the musty air and tried to concentrate on collecting as much power as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad start.\" Master Guvoi said with a smile. \"But you're trying way too hard. This undercity provides a wealth of both black and green mana, there is no need to strain yourself trying to pry it all from the stones and muck. Instead, relax and let the mana flow through you rather than try to force it. Become one with your own lifeforce and the death and decay surrounding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and try to calm down a bit. Your palm begins to glow a bit brighter as the rune you drew flashes with energy. \"It's working!\" you think excitedly to yourself. \"Now I just need to follow the master's instructions.\" You clench your fist into a swirling orb of life energy and whisper a short chant to boost the power of the summoning. Just as the light begins to fade you feel several tiny legs skittering about between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Xenda gasp in awe as a swarm of tiny beetles begin pouring down the side of your arm and unto the floor. You then wave your hand and are pleased to see the swarm move in unison as the last of their number drop from your fingertips. \"Ah, very well done young initiate.\" Master Guvoi exclaimed as you instructed the swarm to fly into the air. After a few minutes of messing around you then cut off the flow of magic and watch as the freed beetles fly away into a deeper chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was pretty cool.\" Xenda says as Master Guvoi gives you both a pat on the back. \"I have a feeling you both will make the Swarm very proud someday, but for now you still have much to learn. Shall we begin the next lesson?\" You both nod and listen closely as Master Guvoi explains more about how mana and spells work. After about an hour he then asks you to follow him so that he can give you a more hands-on assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he lead you?</span></div></div>",

        "created":1357064520,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">On an alternate version of the city plane of Ravnica are two great factions made up of smaller guilds seeking to claim total control of the entire world. These factions have been at a standstill for years but upon the dawning of a new era the balance of power may yet tip. It is up to you to pick a side and shape your destiny in this strange and wonderful place, but first you need to get up to speed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: If you play Magic The Gathering and already know the setting and mechanics you can go ahead and skip down to the rules at the bottom of the page as most of the rest of this introduction is stuff you probably know. (I would advise you to keep this page open in a different tab for reference if you plan on writing a chapter though, as many guilds are slightly changed from their card game counterparts.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic Information<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRavnica: The setting of this story is a massive fantasy world, but with an urban twist. Instead of endless plains and forests Ravnica is an entire world almost completely covered in buildings. Some float in the sky overhead, some twist beneath the streets, some have grown around plants, some are built in bodies of water and some are massive enough to be considered artificial mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMana: The fuel to use magic and cast spells. Mages and magical creatures alike can interact with it to wage war, heal the sick or just about anything else they can think up. Mana comes from the land itself and each types has limits to what it can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite Mana: This mana comes from plains and favors healing, enchanting, protection and equality spells. It is the color of law, order and duty with a heavy focus on light and recovery based magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue Mana: The color of focus, curiosity and intelligence which comes from islands. This mana is excellent at countering other types of magic and granting new knowledge to its users. Blue mana focuses mostly on water, ice and psychic magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Mana: The corrupting, but not outright evil mana produced by swamps. It is the color of ambition, power and death. It's spells tend to focus on necromancy, disease, insanity and assassination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Mana: The color of freedom, randomness, and passion. This color comes from mountains and has power over dragons, fire, lightning, goblins, magma and stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Mana: The life giving color of forests that stands for growth, strength and the natural world. It focuses almost entirely on providing and empowering life with a strong focus on healing, animals, raw power, plants and removing artifacts or things that fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Factions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two main factions are each broken up into five aligned guilds. The first is the Alliance, which seeks to control and regulate the plane while the second faction, the Resistance, seeks to embrace personal freedom and choice for everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alliance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alliance are led by the Azorius Senate and seek to tightly regulate what goes on in the city at all times. Under the command of a dense network of bureaucrats and politicians are several trained soldiers and law enforcement officers seeking to bring peace to the city through a strict code of conduct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzorius Senate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: White/Blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: The Grand Overseer, a powerful mage dressed in elegant robes and a ceremonial mask. No one has seen their face or knows their true identity, even those working directly under them. The Overseer rarely passes judgment over someone personally, but is a veteran of combat and can easily bind a giant or dragon with their law magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: The Azorius Senate serves as a standing government for most of the city and is in charge of making the laws, funding federal businesses, maintaining order and keeping things running smooth and orderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: The Azorius specialize in powerful counter magic, binding spells and weakening spells. They also have access to and run most of the cities oldest libraries and keep track of all sorts of important files and personal information. If they don't have a record of it, it probably didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Trigon Of Order, which is a massive courthouse surrounded by thick steel walls and filled with a never ending maze of hallways, conference rooms and courts of law. If not for the highly trained scribes they task with keeping track of guests most visitors would never even find the main hall. Aside from legal appointments the Trigon Of Order is normally unavailable to the general public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoros Legion<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: White/Red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Azona The Fireheart. Azona was once a poor girl abandoned on the streets who learned to survive by learning fire magic from a local outcast from the Izzet guild. In her adulthood she spent several long years as a soldier and a city guard before finding a home in the Boros Legion. After many more years of hard work she was promoted to leader last year on her 40th birthday. She is strict and ruthless when it comes to enforcing the law, but has a soft sport for children and animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Law enforcement and special services. The Boros Legion carry out the law and swiftly deal with troublemakers wherever they appear. Whether the crime is coldblooded murder or a simple pickpocket they show no mercy to criminals and take their jobs deathly seriously. Though they respect the law they have no trouble breaking it if it means serving the greater good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: The Boros are hardened soldiers and even their lowest officers are fierce opponents. In addition to well-equipped soldiers and highly trained captains are a handful of skilled battle mages that assist the Legion in combat. They will hunt convicts to the ends of Ravnica and have no problem using lethal force when nessicery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Bronze Keep, a massive police station and maximum security prison rolled into one. Below the series of offices upstairs is a deep underground dungeon filled with dangerous prisoners. Each cell block has more powerful guards and magic runes the deeper it gets, with dragons and deadly wardens guarding the lowest levels. Between the dungeon and offices is a large battle area where recruits train and test their combat prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrzhov Syndicate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: White/ Black<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Claire Ivoryblood. The heiress to an aristocratic family with a long tradition of membership to the guild Claire was the perfect choice to become the new leader when the past one fell ill and died in his sleep. It was hard work to find the right poison to dispose of him discreetly along with the rest of her immediate family, but the perks of being the guild leader were too big a prize for her to ignore. Claire is corrupt and selfish, but also fair-minded when it comes to her clients and running her guild. She's willing to give second chances and excuse minor failures but those who continue to disappoint her are rarely seen or heard from again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Running loan offices, banks, pawn shops, churches and small clinics. While much of their business is legal they also run many shady businesses on the side like slavery rings and extortion rackets. To them everything has its price, even the human soul. It's just a matter of offering the correct deal to whoever is desperate enough to turn to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: Their massive stockpile of money would normally be a game changer but the Orzhov are so reluctant to spend any of it that it mostly stays locked away in vaults or stacked upon alters. One thing they do have is an army of deadly enforcers to collect their dues on time and make sure those that have no money left still pay a price. They employ everything from haunting spirits of the dead to mindless work thrulls to do their bidding, which makes them a dangerous foe if angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Platinum Haven, a massive church combined with a bank. Though it offers many services to the common citizen most of the private rooms are kept sealed off and guard thrulls can be found everywhere inside along with normal security. The entire place is literally a fortress just as much as it is a place of worship and kept under the watchful eye of spirits at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouse Dimir<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Blue/Black<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: The Nameless One. Not much is know about The Nameless One except that he is male, extremely long lived and has an extensive thirst for knowledge and secrets. Few members of even his own guild know he exists and even fewer knows what his plans or long term goals are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Running Ravnca's libraries as a front to their more shady businesses. Their specialties are discreet assassination, espionage, thievery, information gathering and covering up their clients crimes. In addition to this they also run an intricate black market network of forbidden wares all across the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: Their main skill is stealth, to the point that many people doubt that the guild even truly exists. They lack direct combat ability compared to the other guilds, but make up for it with their deadly precision and ghostly assassins. Most enemies don't see them coming until its too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Unlike the other guilds the Dimir don't have many permanent residences and tend to set up temporary outposts near important locations. The closest thing they have to a base is The Forbidden Door, a large library with several floors where many of their members meet in secret to discuss important matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelesnya Conclave <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: White/Green<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Father Gavin VIII. Nicknamed \"The Great Father\" and \"The Leader Of The Many\" Gavin VIII has been the much beloved ruler of the Conclave for the past 30 years after the death of his sister. He is known to be fair and kind to the public but many rumors have spread that he is not what he seems and will lead the guild to its ruin. Despite this he is friends with many people and treats his son and two daughters very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Providing extensive healing magic and medical care to the citizens of Ravnica. The Conclave accepts all who enter with open arms and aims to provide and care for everyone regardless of status or wealth. While they may occasionally fall short of their ideals they provide many valuable services to the community to help maintain the wellbeing of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: They focus heavily on unity and strength and have a massive and diverse army ready to defend their ideals. They lack powerful offensive magic, but their heavy defenses and healing powers give them an edge against any type of foe. In addition to powerful elementals and beasts they have several groups of weaker soldiers to hold off attacks until reinforcements arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Hall Of New Life, a massive temple overgrown with plants fused with a massive floating tree grown by the guild's founders long ago. It is one of the more massive bases, but is more lightly guarded and open to the general public at all times. It conjures an air of peace and serenity unlike anywhere else in the city and has many parks and gardens decorated with statues and pillars made by the city's finest artists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Resistance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Resistance are a massive faction led by the Gruul clans who seek to restore freedom and impose less restrictions on the ability of the average citizen to do what they want. They believe in everyone having the choice to be who they want to be and shun harsh laws in favor of a more lenient system of guidelines that giver greater choice to the common people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGruul Clans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Red/Green<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Scarlip The Fierce. An orphan raised in the savage wilds beyond the surrounding city Scarlip is a survivor and deadly in battle. Her names comes from her many scars earned during hunts and fights, with the scar on her lip being the most well known due to its magical nature. She received it from a rival barbarian lord who threatened her people when she was just a teen. His blade had been enchanted with burning light that seared her flesh as she slashed his throat with her tribe's ceremonial knife during the ensuing battle between clans. Many believe it gave her the power she wields now in her role as both the leader and head shaman of the Gruul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: They serve as rangers and protectors of Ravnica's few remaining wild lands such as forests and seek to preserve what little there is left. While none of them have official jobs they tend to live off the land and offer various goods and services for trade such as homemade weapons and animal meat. They don't get along well with most other people but still allow interaction between their members and traveling merchants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: The Gruul rely almost entirely on raw, savage strength and berserker fury along with a handful of basic nature spells and abilities to destroy their opponents in battle. Many of their weapons and equipment are primitive compared to the other guilds but their natural skills, talent and bulging muscle give them an edge in combat. They also have some of the most powerful nature shamans in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Behemoth's Claw, a massive tangled fort made of twisting, jagged rock and thick plant life that forms a natural barrier against foes. This base keeps its basic tower form most of the time but is constantly being changed by both enemy attacks and magical improvements. Deadly traps litter the cramped hallways and rooms as well, making it an extremely dangerous place for outsiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCult Of Rakdos<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Black/Red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: The Teeth Of Rakdos. Originally a goblin gifted with barely average intelligence The Teeth Of Rakdos has since become a demonic being through some sort of unknown event that made him smarter, stronger and insanely powerful. He was noticed by Rakdos himself while leading a gang of marauders in causing destruction around his home neighborhood. In exchange for loyalty and sadism he would be blessed with immortality and made the leader of the army of Rakdos. Needless to say, he gleefully accepted the terms and became a full fledged demon under his new master's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Entertainment mostly, with some assassination, torturing and other shady dealings on the side. They set up everything from circuses to clubs to pit fighting arenas all over the city. They offer many exotic treatments, spells and events that other guilds wouldn't touch, mostly because of the high mortality rate. To their credit, most of their shows are unlike anything else in all of Ravnica so they get plenty of business from eager tourists and unsuspecting partygoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: They have almost no sense of restraint, morality or decency. This makes them completely unpredictable as well as intimidating to most of their foes. They'll use any advantage they can get from spike covered goblins to goblin covered demons to achieve victory. Their only true weakness is their self destructive behavior often means they suffer heavy casualties and destroyed property, though they don't seem to mind much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Rakdos Fairgrounds, a series of tents, booths, stages, torture dungeons and taverns that stretch across miles of hollowed out caves far below the streets of the city above. The crown jewel of this vile place is the Palace Of Rakdos, a massive cathedral adorned with ballrooms to accommodate both parties and sinister rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzet League<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Blue/Red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Niv-Mizzet The Last Dragon Lord. Quite possibly the oldest and smartest being in the entire city Niv-Mizzet is the last of an unusually intelligent breed of dragons that once ruled Ravnica. He isn't actively antagonistic, but very vain and condescending to his servants and guild members. Above all else he craves luxury, nobility and respect. When not working on various projects he has the members of his guild find new ways to represent him in the technology and artwork they create. He also has very otherworldly psychic powers at his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Creating and maintaining Ravnica's technology as well as researching new ways to use and control magic and the elements. Their jobs are rarely consistent, but always involve working towards advancing technology, be it a new way to gather mana or a clock that runs on emotions. Not everything they create is practical or useful, but it is always unique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: Their unpredictability makes it very hard to form a strategy or mount an assault against them. What they lack in raw strength they make up for with their insanely powerful offensive magic. Those that oppose them often end up on the receiving end of deadly thunderstorms, freezing blizzards or fire tornadoes that can make short work of all but the most powerful enemies. They also have many strange elemental creatures that they created to do battle on their behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Mizzet's Palace, which is a grand network of labs and research facilities ruled over by the guild's leader. The inside of this wondrous place is very alien to the rest of the city with steampipes and robotic constructs lining the halls as machinery hums along to the sound of Izzet magic powering up various new experiments. Unlike most guild strongholds the Izzet don't need to bother with security... the strange noises and lights keep most trespassers away and their powerful wizards can easily protect their secrets from any prying eyes out to steal them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimic Combine <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Blue/Green<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Greenroot. As a merfolk child Greenroot was an idealistic student always searching for new ways to explore and alter her underwater home. For years she researched Ravnica's biological life and charted maps of its underground sewers and waterways. Eventually, she grew up and applied to join the Simic whom she had idolized for all of her life. After many unsuccessful experiments and setbacks she unveiled her greatest project: an intricate network of plant life connected with her own nervous system. Amazed at what she had accomplished the Simic made her the guild leader and she used her newfound powers to continue to expand her domain. Through her experiments she has lost her mobility, but has greatly expanded her horizons and continues to explore the depths of the world one small leaf or root at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Providing non-magical medicine and treatments as well as finding new ways to biologically improve the lives of everyone in the city. The Simic strive to create new forms of life that can adapt and change to thrive in any type of environment, which often leads to them making powerful hybrid mutants and other fantastic creatures. As such, they have a massive market of living weapons and guardians available to purchase for anyone needing extra protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: They focus most of their magical talent on maintaining habitats for themselves and their creations, leaving combat to their handful of warrior members and massive army of mutant beasts. Their forces are extremely adaptive and deadly even without the use of magic and their monsters have some of the strongest powers and abilities in the entire city. The fact that these abilities can be shared through mutations and evolutions makes the Simic a force to be reckoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Heart Of Progress, a massive lab filled with gardens, lakes and various types of organic technology. The entire area is overgrown with moss, algae and too many forms of exotic life to list here. Much like the Izzet, the Simic see little need for guards as their entire facility is overrun with protective hazards such as carnivorous slime or flying lizard plants. People who trespass here tend to end up as lunch for something big and hungry or small and vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolgari Swarm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColors: Black/Green<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Dren. The offspring of a Gorgon and a Basilisk Drem is a snakelike entity with deadly abilities both magical and natural. In addition to being covered in deadly poisonous spikes and scales he has masterful control over petrifying magic that can transform his victims into toxic crystal statues. Despite this, he is a relatively benign guild leader who is generally interested in just providing for the city and making his people stronger. He is constantly shapeshifting between two forms: that of a humanoid man and a giant monstrous snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRole: Providing emergency aid and food to those who need it as well as disposing of the dead and cleaning up garbage. The Golgari believe that everything has value, even rotting corpses, and strive to recycle anything and everything they can. To them the dead are just another resource that can be used to help the living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower: They lack sheer numbers, but make up for it with their power over life and death. They don't have any particular skill to help them in battle, but their shamans and necromancers can raise the fallen of any of their battles to create new soldiers once the fighting is over. Even in defeat they have the power to grow stronger and contribute to their guild. They also have powerful insects, gorgons and other nasty creatures to help them in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: The Garden Tomb, a massive underground farm used to grow food, herbs and other useful supplies for both the Golgari and the rest of the city. There is little light here, but potent magic and specialized fertilizer ensure the crops grow quickly as well as healthy. Many nightmarish creatures patrol the tunnels and chambers of the surrounding area, but to the members of this morbid guild they are just another resource to be harvested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to keep everything in line with what has been established above. You are free to use all forms of mana but keep in mind that each guild has a specific focus. I don't want to see Rakdos cultists using powerful healing spells or Selesnya members shooting fireballs everywhere. You can use a little bit of everything, but not to its full power unless your guild focuses on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Mild curse words are fine, but should be used sparingly. No really vulgar words or overusing swears, keep things PG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You may quit one guild for another, but your skills stay the same. You can't just become an instant expert in another guild after devoting so much time to a former one. On that note, you start as a low level initiate in your guild of choice and have to earn higher positions. No walking in the front door and becoming the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Keep things like they are in the actual card game. No advanced technology or other things that don't belong. Remember that spells and magic cost mana which is absorbed from the land itself. You can store some mana in containers for later use, but not too much at one time. Any really powerful spells will require help from your guild mates or artifacts to cast. (Things like adult dragons, sea monsters, meteor storms, zombie armies, living buildings, tsunamis, extensive mind control...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Keep choices and character descriptions open during the early chapters so that people who come along later can still write the story they want. Any chapters that force readers into being good or evil or having certain physical features will be edited. (Wait until about chapter 9 or 10 before you start giving your character a proper backstory or personality quirks.) Remember, no one likes being railroaded into playing some one else's fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Have fun.</td>",
