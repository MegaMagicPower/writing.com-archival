Pour in roughly 1/10 of its weight in crabmeat. Perferably king crab but any will do. Second you slide the two seals into the orcas body. this should at least fill the front stomach. Roll the orca onto its back and aply pressure to the bulge till the orcas front stoamch swallows without processing the meal. You can then roll the orca back over and pour in 1/10 the orca's weight in chopped fish, a mixture of tuna, salmon and swordfish, 3,1,1 mixture.  Then send in the otter. this completes the stuffing of the orca, the orca should weigh in at least double the inital weight, if not add more otters.(More later) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing place the orca in a large bowl, rougly half as deep as the orca is. Then pour in a mixture of coconut milk, honey, and powdered coconut. Add in pineapple and banna slices to suit fancy. Then baste the orca with a thick mixture of syrup and red wine. Finish by sticking a life pig snout first into the orca's mouth and placing fronds around it in the bowl for added effect, let it set for a half an hour to absorb the flavors and keep chilled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After you have the Panthers paws and feet secured you may commence with stuffing the panther. This consits of using a mix of white and brown rice and filling up the panthers stomach to at least half way. You should now add in any spices you would enjoy .the falavor of, it will sink in and be a nice armoa by the time of lunch. Frequently insertaing a few rabbits is also encouraged, they will give the stomach a live look when you chow down. It is then normal to feed the panther your choice of Wine, Ale or Tea, this will provide the needed slosh sound even while the stomach is slow to digest the stuffing, it can also slow the process. once stuffed take 5 bunches of grapes and put them in the panthers mouth, add in a small brace to keep the mouth fromcrushing the grapes.Shoving olives up the panthers bum can be another additon should you wish<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the stuffing is done you can take the panther and put it over an open fire or a coal pit to keep warm. Do NOT let it get to warm, or the <br>\r\ncharm of the grapes and the tenderness of the flesh could be harmed. the tail should be curled around the holding pole to keep it from getting <br>\r\nsinged. Let the panther sit for an hour, a bit of gentle teasing can help pass the time. but you should start the baste first, A baste should be full and thick, mixed to your own tastes and applied liberally to the still cooking panther. Once complete you are able to wait</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vixen Pudding, eh?  Alright, let's go.  You'll find plenty of flexibility in this recipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you'll need a vixen, of course.  Fatter ones are better, of course; preferably gut-heavy.  This is important, you see...  As the main ingredient it Vixen Pudding is fox fat...  Which you'll find plenty of in the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you'll need to extract the fat.  You can do this one of two ways:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-  You can simply slice the vixen's belly open, either along the vixen's length or width. Or, and this is my favorite, around the dome of the belly, creating a sort of \"bowl and lid\" from the vixen's gut.  I prefer this way, as it leads to a very creative serving method.  After opening, simply scoop all of the fat out.<br>\r\n-  If you prefer, you could simply make a small incision in the vixen's gut, from which you can try to suck all of the fat out...  This is very difficult without a vacuum or such, however, but may also lead to another creative serving method.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rest of the vixen, you may do as you please.  I'd suggest simply placing it in your oven and roasting it outright, using whatever recipe you desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, the pudding.  Pudding isn't very difficult to make; the only thing difficult you'll find about it is possibly getting just the right amount of ingredients to make.  I'll break down the ratio right here.  For every pound of vixen fat:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1/4 cup sugar<br>\r\n1 cup milk<br>\r\nThis pudding doesn't need a thickening agent, as the fat will be thick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you add all of this to the mix, though, you should whip the vixen fat until light and fluffy.  It shouldn't take more than a minute or so, but depending on how much you have, you may have a bit of difficulty; I'd recommend splitting the fat into smaller portions in different bowls, making this somewhat more manageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce whipped, you may begin adding the ingredients.  Simply beat them all together until the mixture is consistent and creamy.  You may have also added a flavoring of your choosing; chocolate, vanilla, butterscotch, banana...  The possibilities are endless, here.  You'll have to figure out your own ingredient-to-fat ratio, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've got all of this together, you'll need to chill it for an hour, after which it'll be ready to eat.  You can be done for now, if you'd like...  But you'll be missing out on the fun serving methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, if you'd cut along the dome like I'd suggested, earlier...  You'll realize that you have a convenient serving-bowl in the form of your vixen.  All you'll need to do is simply put the fat back in the empty belly-bowl, perhaps put the lid back on, and voila!  If you'd elected to roast the vixen, you'll have both dinner and dessert, all presented in a single \"container.\"  Just make sure you position the vixen's fatted flanks and tail to maximize the elegance of your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...  If you'd simply poked a hole in the vixen, you could try putting the pudding back in through the hole.  This would make the most sense if you'd decided to fill the vixen's gut with something else while it was empty, most preferably cake batter, and had her baked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway!  There you have it.  A lovely dessert, main-course and possibly centerpiece, all in one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, shall we dine?</span></div></div>",

How is it made? The bread rolled around on otter fur before baking and now having traces of the smell on each bite, atop that is the first layer of pizza, fresh ragu sauce dripping heavily to spread around the flavor and the sealed in by hot and steamy motzerella chese with dashes of cheddar and swiss. Cooked only lightly before a young anthro river otter is applied to the top, straped down by edible rope in spread eagle style, this version having him belly up, feet spread to the sides of the pizza underneath. Now atop the otter is doused a drenching of the same sauce, and then sprinkled on the same mixture of cheeses. the added toppings come now, currently a bit of peperoni and a few apple slices around his armpits. the gag used to keep the otter quite is a red delicious apple. the otter then is cooked slowly for a full hour, letting the heat cook him just enough so as not to risk any permenant damage and yet let his sweat and flavor sink inot every bit of the meal. this will normally cause the pizza underneath to come out a bit crisp, but the melted chease over the otter now forms enough of a bind that the ropes can be removed without any risk. the steamy otters fur will singe but not burn baddly, this aroma is as much a part of the meal as the meat. the otters fur will be a slightly darker shade too, and most likely struggling. Ready to be served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It certainly couldn't hurt to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, sir.\"  The bartender leads you behind the counter and through an \"Employees Only\" door.  You're greeted with the smell of hot barley, with hints of maple and various berries, as you weave around tables holding equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...  Maple syrup and berries make it 'special?'\" you ask.  While it was certainly novel, you weren't going to shell out good money on a glass of (most likely warm) beer with raspberries floating in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose a little...  But not really.  What makes it special are the, er...  'Kegs.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...  Kegs are 'special?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, take a look in front of you; they're right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as you are told...  And find that the 'kegs' aren't really kegs at all.  Lined up along the back wall are a number of tubby female furs, lying on their distended bellies, asses facing you.  Harnesses hold their legs to spread their fat ass-cheeks apart...  Revealing a large cork stuck in each of their tail-holes.  On their tails hang little signs, each bearing a note of the specific brew that was being made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\"  This was not what you were expecting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, <i>this</i> is what makes our micro-brews special; after making them, we put them inside of furs' asses to give them a very unique flavor.  A flavor, I'm sure, that you'll never experience anywhere else.\"  The bartender strolls along the row of 'kegs,' stopping in front of a bloated orange vixen who seemed to be \"dancing.\"  The bartender chuckled and patted her on the back.  \"Yes, you certainly are enjoying your meal, aren't you, Maple-Vixen?\"  It certainly seemed evident she was.  She jiggled quite a bit as she swayed back and forth, making it quite clear that the majority of her size didn't come from swelling, but actual fat. She paused as her stomach gurgled; she tensed her legs, lifted her tail and...  Tried to fart, but failed.  The cork was stuck in quite tight; it quivered a bit, but did not budge.  The sound of bubbling could be heard within her before she lowered her tail and continued her \"dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" the bartender said.  \"Let me explain.\"  He tugged on one of a number of hoses running along the wall; you could see that it led to a nozzle that was inserted squarely between \"Maple-Vixen's\" lips.  \"We feed them on a liquid diet (rest assured, they don't \"make\" anything; the beer is clean).  It serves two purposes:  To fatten them, and thus increase their 'capabilities,' capacity, body heat, etcetera...  And to give them a substantial amount of flatulence.  You see, that adds to the beer's flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you say.  \"Why are they all female?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The females produce hormones that the males do not; hormones that are vital to the beer's body and flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it certainly sounds...  Flavorful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me?  How about you try some?\"  The bartender wanders over to a table and fetches two mugs, a tap, and what appears to be a rather wide clamp.  He hands you a mug, and sets the other one down.  He kneels down behind \"Maple\" and pulls out her cork, yielding a loud, elastic pop and a squeal from the vixen herself.  He sniffs the new \"opening.\"  \"Ah, yes...  Good stuff.\"  He then proceeds to insert the tap firmly in her asshole, eliciting a grunt from said vixen, along with some squirming.  The next step is to install the clamp around her large, white-furred gut; you're not entirely sure what it's for, but you guess you're about to find out.  The bartender flicks a handle on the tap, and picks up his mug, placing it directly below.  With his other hand, he turns the handle on the clamp, tightening it around the fat vixen's belly.  She groans as the amber beer shoots through her asshole and out of the tap, filling the bartender's mug.  As soon as it's full enough for his liking, he flicks the tap's hand back and loosens the vixen's belly-clamp.  He smiles proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta girl...\" he says as he pats her flabby gut.  He brings the mug over to you.  \"Just <i>smell</i> that!  So rich, so full-bodied!\"  You do as you are told, once more...  And you do find that the smell is rather pleasant.  \"Bottoms up!\" he says, knocking the mug back and draining it in 20 seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it...  Warm?\" you ask.  You can't fathom why anybody would drink a beer that wasn't ice-cold, much less one that was the body-temperature of a vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's supposed to be warm.  It's freshest and purest that way...\" he says.  \"Want to try?\"  He kneels back down beside Maple.  \"The first couple ounces are free!  I'm sure you'll love it, and buy a few pints...  Hell, maybe even the whole keg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  And what would I do when she's empty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her to a barbecue!  Everyone loves some beer-bottom vixen on their plates, and you'll be bringing the best one in the history of beer-bottom <i>anything!</i>  Just slap her on the grill\"  He seemed to have already gotten a bit drunk from what little he imbibed; must be some <i>strong</i> stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you're up for it?</span></div></div>",

Get you set, uh...\"  The bartender was clearly intoxicated.  \"...  Set up.\"  He squeezed out some more of Maple's \"juice\" into a mug, just for you, as she squeaked and moaned; it seemed he even forgot about the \"sample\" part, as he filled the mug all the way up to the brim.  He hands it to you, grinning stupidly.  \"Heeeeeeeeeere you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you.\"  You stare into the mug of ass-beer; were you <i>sure</i> you were up for this?  You gave it a few more sniffs; it smelled the same as it did before.  \"Uh...  Bottoms up?\"  It's too late to back out now; you don't want to look like a wuss in front of this complete stranger, do you?  You close your eyes, and lift the mug to your lips, readying yourself to just swallow the fluid down in one gulp without actually having to taste it.  You tilt your head backward, and open wide...  But you don't manage to actually pour it all straight into your throat.  In fact, very little of it left the glass; you're not that good at \"knocking 'em back,\" it seems.  The very thing you were trying to avoid had come to fruition:  You actually had to <i>taste</i> it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  But it wasn't that bad.  In fact, it was pretty good.  <i>Damn</i> good.  It was sweet, strong, full...  Just a <i>bit</i> salty, but not in a bad way.  The maple actually did seem to complement the beer quite well.  And the vixen <i>did</i> add something to its splendor; the bartender wasn't wrong.  The little butterball gave it an earthy flavor, and possibly even made it sweeter than it would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say.  You drink the rest of the mug, savoring the sensational fluid within...  Until it's gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeell?\" the bartender says.  \"Was it gooooood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually...\" you say.  You were getting a bit slow; it <i>was</i> some powerful stuff.  You weren't quite the lightweight that the bartender seemed to be, though.  \"It was great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's goooooooood...\"  The bartender shakes his head.  \"Are you gonna wanna buy some...  Some more?\"  It figures that he <i>would</i> remember the part about you having to pay for things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might...  How much for a glass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty dollars...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"  Whatever haze you were in, you were snapped right out of it by that exorbitant price.  \"That seems <i>really</i> steep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a lot of...  A lot of effort to make this stuff.  We gotta buy equipment, ingredients...  Kegs...\"  He punctuated that last item with a sharp jab to Maple's gut.  \"And it takes a while to get 'em fat enough to make it good...  Lotsa time, and lotsa effort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"  You might have to rethink this whole thing.  Yeah, that was some good beer, but...  It wasn't <i>forty dollars</i>-good.  Although it might have been, judging by the urge to drink even more of it.  \"I don't think I can justify dropping forty dollars on this stuff.  Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\"  The bartender pours himself another mug of Maple, downing it as quickly as the first, and follows it with another.  Maybe you should stick around, and see if something happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begins to laugh, but otherwise, nothing does happen for ten minutes.  He opens his mouth:  \"What...  What if...

Her ready.\"  The bartender walks over to the enormous black sow...  And thrusts his arm right between her ass-cheeks.  He's uncorking her, but he's obviously not even <i>trying</i> to be gentle.  The bartender is rewarded by an ear-piercing squeal.  He twists the cork a couple of times, and then yanks it out as hard as he can.  \"Go ahead...\" he says, gesturing towards the now-furious swine.  Black Betty was flailing as much as she could, and kicking her hind legs quite a bit...  As fat as she was, you could also tell that she had a bit of muscle; getting kicked by her would <i>hurt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thanks...</i>\" you say, coldly.  This guy just didn't play fair.  However, this made you <i>determined</i> to beat him.  You position yourself as well as you can, receiving a few blows from her hooves; they did, indeed, hurt.  Not quite as bad as you'd thought, though, and now that you were between her thighs, she would have a difficult time getting at you.  You'd still have a difficult time \"entering\" the angry, thrashing sow.  If only there were a way to calm her down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a bit of a rub would help?  Your claws move outward to the centers of each 'cheek, and they begin to knead the swine's flesh gently.  Betty grunts, and stops thrashing for a moment.  She begins again a few seconds later, but not quite as violently.  You figure a bit more rubbing would help.  Your claws slowly run themselves along the sow's buttocks, hips and thighs, which the sow did appreciate.  She oinked a couple of times, all the while coming to a state of calm.  You could only hope that she'd remain that way as your muzzle dove into her asshole...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to knead her, working your way down to her thick gut, as you plunge inside of her.  To your surprise, she doesn't snap your face in half.  She tenses, a little, but relaxes again as you ramp up the massage.  You can't help but think that, perhaps, she thinks you're a \"mating partner.\"  You find the thought a bit odd, but shrug it off; you've got beer to drink.  You open your mouth and suck in a bit of the beer.  It's not nearly as good as Maple; the blackberries seem to \"clash\" with the beer's natural flavor, and the sow gave it a bit of a \"bacon-y\" taste...  But still, not bad.  You close your eyes and continue to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, it gets difficult; there's still beer, in there, but it's too far \"back\" to drink.  You're not sure what to do about that...  Until you remember the clamp that the bartender used on Maple.  You probably couldn't reach it from where you were, but you could still give Betty a good squeeze.  Your claws stop kneading and begin to press the sides of her gut.  It works; Betty grunts as she tenses her body,  and beer rockets from the far reaches of Betty's \"cavity\" and into your waiting muzzle.  After a few minutes of \"pressurizing,\" the flow stops.  You squeeze a little harder, to see if that would get anymore out.  Nothing comes; you're satisfied that you've gotten it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out of Betty, licking your chops.  She appears to be quite exhausted from all of this...  And slightly deflated; she seems smaller than she was when you'd started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh...\" you moan.  \"I'm going to have <i>such</i> a hangover...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't...\" the bartender says.  He seems to have come out of his fog.  \"That's one of the beautiful things about these brews...

I don't believe you've gotten it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just check...\"  The bartender undoes Betty's harness and lifts her off of the floor; she's too exhausted to fight anymore.  He gives her a big \"bear-hug\" around her midsection; she squeals weakly, and kicks her leg a bit, but nothing else.  Nothing's coming out of her, either.  \"Hmmm...\"  He drops the sow onto a table, belly up; the table creaks in protest, but holds up.  He fetches a device that looks like a combination of a milker and a vacuum cleaner, and shoves the nozzle right into Betty's ass.  She doesn't make a sound; you think she's dead, but upon further examination, she was just asleep.  The bartender flicks a switch, and the machine comes to life, whirring as he probes the bloated swine.  He looks at a collection vessel attached to the machine as he slides the nozzle up and down Betty's asshole.  \"Nothing?  ...  Damn it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I won?\" you say, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"  He shakes his head and says...</span></div></div>",

You hear the squeak of a valve turning, the rush of a flowing liquid, and the yelping of a vixen who's being pumped full of hot beer.  The two emerge moments later; Maple is looking much \"fuller\" now, and more than a little dazed.  He loads the three vixens that you've won onto a pushcart, and you follow the bartender as he wheels your prize out the door and out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette4.png\" alt=\"*Vignette4*\" title=\"Vignette4\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\u00a0<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette4.png\" alt=\"*Vignette4*\" title=\"Vignette4\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\u00a0<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette4.png\" alt=\"*Vignette4*\" title=\"Vignette4\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, you're back at home.  Your vixen-kegs are kept on your kitchen floor, situated in front of a little makeshift trough full of their liquid feed.  You've fed them quite generously. purchasing more feed from the bartender as you run out,and they've all put on quite a bit of weight; Maple's put on the most by far, however.  She was easily twice the size of the other two, greedily sucking down as much as she could.  The only reason the other two were able to get any of the food was because Maple's over-filled gut pushed her up and away from the trough, at times, making it a bit difficult for her to shove her muzzle into it.  She was always able to get back down to it, though, as you \"emptied\" her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which...  The blubbery orange vixen <i>was</i> almost empty.  As you \"tapped\" her once more, you came to find that your glass was only half-full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well...\" you say.  \"It looks like you're done here.\"  You give her gut a sharp jab, marveling at how pliant it was; her belly fat just molded around your claw as you squeezed and prodded it.  \"I'll miss your beer...\"  You give her empty rear-end a quick sniff, salivating at the sweet remnants of the ambrosia that was once within.  \"But, that can't be helped.  Now, you'll be the main course at a barbecue I'll be holding in a couple of weeks.\"  You picked her up and set her away from the other two.  \"Until then...  You'll be getting fed double.  You'll be so big and fat and round, you'll hardly fit on the grill...\"  You grab a mixing bowl from the cupboard and place it in front of Maple, filling it with the special feed.  \"How marvelous you'll look, perched on top as you roast.\"  You roll her forward so that she can reach the bowl and prop her up with a footstool.  \"Eat up, girl.\"  She happily obliges, drinking the entire bowl down in a minute flat.  You refill the bowl, smiling and kneading her belly as she eats.</span></div></div>",

The steak is fried to perfection, and the vixens are inserted, live, into the steak, at which point they are filled with beef gravy through their \"cavities,\" slathered in a savory honey-barbecue sauce and covered with melted cheese.  Served with a side of potato wedges or miniature sausages.</i><br>\r\nThe picture at left shows a fairly standard ham-steak...  With little vixens that appear to have \"buried\" themselves in the meat.  Their lower bodies jut out into the open air, with their soft, apple-sized bellies and thick, tender asses exposed and covered in toppings, while their upper bodies are stuck inside the steak.  It also appears that someone has inserted a potato wedge into one of the fatter vixen's assholes, presumably to dip it in the gravy inside.  The dish looks a bit too elaborate, and the calories are probably through the roof, but hey, why not spoil yourself with something adventurous and indulgent?  It's not like you eat like this <i>every</i> night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more dishes on the list, of course; keep reading if you'd like to order something else other than these, or if you've changed your mind about vixen, go back and choose one of the other species of meat.</span></div></div>",

The oven is now heated, and the dragoness picks up the long metal pole that the griffin was bound to. \u201cWould you mind holding her down, please?\u201d the dragon asks. You gladly grab her soft feathery shoulders, holding her down as the waitress thrusts the long iron spit through her body with a practised ease. The griffon gives a last startled squawk, then the point of the spit emerges from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe griffin lies there, transfixed on the spit, as the waitress massages herbs and spices, oils and seasoning, into her fur. She assures you they will sink through during the cooking process, leaving the griffon-meat tender and flavoured. Finally the waitress hefts the spitted avian into the oven. Her eyes widen as the door closes on her, and the spit begins turning. You can see it all through the glass: the squirms and twitches that gradually subside, the hawklike eyes that slowly drift shut, the rich aromatic steam that starts to fill the oven and seep its odours out into the room. The dragoness watches too, with a serving-tray in her hand; but you see her occasionally lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally a timer rings, though you were enjoying the show, the combination of the sight of the cooking griffin and the aromas rising from her is by now making you desperately hungry. The dragoness opens the door and your meal comes out the oven, steam rising from her cooked feathers, and is laid on the plate beside you. You gulp her down in hot, heady mouthfuls, rich in spices, pausing only to savour the exotic flavours of lion mixed with bird. The meal is soft and succulent, and you soon find yourself sitting over a plateful of griffon bones, rather than busty, cooked griffon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The discerning consumer that you are, you decide to look at her more closely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's rather fat, especially for her 5 feet in height; her thick, white-furred belly stretches nearly two feet in front of her, with a cavernous navel yawning in the center of it.  Her thighs are quite thick, as well; each one is easily two feet in diameter below the buttock, making for some rather sumptuous vixen \"drumsticks.\"  These thighs, in turn, taper into a bountiful ass, each cheek jutting about a foot and a half from the base of the leg, which would be good for some vixenchops.  Her huge rear-end lends itself to to the impression of a deep \"cavity\" below her tail (which was quite lovely, as well, but not of importance in this matter). If her ass-crack <i>did</i> prove to be as deep as one would think, it would be exceptional for stuffing, should you choose to stuff her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to her front, you take a look at her chest.  Normally, breast meat isn't as important a quality on anything that isn't a bird, as on mammals (female mammals, at least) the chest area was mostly fat; it still didn't hurt to check it anyway.  On her chest lie some rather impressive breasts, about G-cups, that jiggle a bit as the vixen breathes...  You wonder if they lactate, as vixen milk might make for an interesting ingredient for some other dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving <i>looked</i> at her enough, you decide to <i>feel</i> her.  You reach into the box with your large dragon claws and coax the little tub into a standing position, and cup the bottom of her blubbery gut as she becomes noticeably uncomfortable.  You heft it in your hand (it's got reasonable weight, and in proportion to your hand is about the size and shape of an apple), squeeze it like a tomato you're checking for ripeness (it's got a nice \"squish\" to it, but just enough firmness to keep it from having the consistency of pudding) and shake it (it bounces pleasantly in your hand).  You release it, finished with that round of tests, but think that you could perform some further tests.  You shove the butterball down; she falls over quite easily, laying on her back, with her belly in the air just as you intended.<br>\r\nSo begins the next round of tests.  First, you give her belly a slap, which sends it wobbling and jiggling, much like a Jell-O mold, but it stills itself after about ten seconds; a fine show, good for presentation.  Next, you give it a quick poke with one of your claws (being careful not to puncture her, of course) like the Pillsbury Doughboy; you find that her belly fat <i>is</i> much like dough.  Interesting.  Finally, you decide to probe her navel with the same claw, just to see how deep it is (you might decide to do something with it); your claw hovers over the cavernous navel, as the vixen eyes it nervously.  It plunges into her belly-button.<br>\r\n\"Nnnnngh!\" utters your vixen, whom, up 'til now, has remained silent, and relatively.  Her fat gut jiggles around your claw as it feels its way around the walls of this white-furred pit.<br>\r\n\"Almost done...\" you say.  \"My, this is fun.\"  You continue your spelunking within her cavernous navel.  She squirms.<br>\r\n\"Stoooooooop...\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright...  I'm done.\"  Your claw retreats from her navel; it was quite warm, and indeed, quite deep.  You give it a quick sniff; no scent.<br>\r\nYou've finished all of your examinations of her front.  You give the little tub a belly rub to calm her down, which works, to your surprise.<br>\r\nOverall, she's got a great, soft belly, with great belly fat:  Definitely a good quality in a meal.  She'll carve quite well; a knife would work its way through that flesh like <i>butter</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, you'll be examining her \"back.\"  You flip your chunky fox over onto her pillow-like belly, much to her surprise, leaving her rear end perfectly exposed for your further \"examination.\"  Your first test isn't too intrusive; you just squeeze one of her 'cheeks, and find it to be quite soft and tender.  She doesn't appreciate it; you doubt she'll like anything you're about to do to her any more, though.  Your next test is a slap to the bottom; she yelps, and her entire body begins to quiver like jelly.  You're only paying attention to her buttocks, though, which jiggle quite a bit less than her gut did; if her tummy registered a 7 on the Richter Scale, her ass only registered a 3.2 at most.  They're more \"solid\" than you thought; <i>definitely</i> good for 'chops.  Next, you give one of her asscheeks a poke, like her belly; she grunts in discomfort.  You find that they have very little \"give;\" there's some solid meat there.  Hopefully it's not so solid that it's hard to cut...<br>\r\nAnd now comes the most unpleasant test (for her, at least):  A probing.  You'll be putting your spelunkin' claw right up her asshole, to check for depth and overall cavity size.<br>\r\nShe appears calm, thinking  that all possible \"test\" have been performed; she obviously doesn't know what's coming...  If she hated the navel probe, she is going to FREAK when this happens...<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey...\" you whisper to your friend, trying as hard as possible not to be heard by your vixen.  \"I'm about to, uh, you know...  Do you have anything to make her calm?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do...  I'll get her a little berry from the planter over here...\" your friend reaches to a potted plant on the windowsill and plucks a berry; the \"berry\" will be about the size of a grapefruit to her.  \"The 'stock love 'em; they can't resist!  It keeps 'em calm, sedates 'em...  And best of all, it fattens 'em up right quick!  I give her one of these, she'll swell right before your very eyes!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm.  That sounds pretty good...  Could you give her five of 'em?\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Anything</i> for dinner, sir!  Hell, I'll give her <i>ten!</i>\"<br>\r\n\"Great.  Ummm...  Forgot to ask...  Is she, uh, 'clean' in there?  ...  I'm not going to get anything on my claw, am I?\"<br>\r\n\"No, no...  The 'stock get a good cleaning before they're put in inventory, and after that they're put on a special diet that eliminates all that \"digestive consequence\" and such...  I assure you, you'll find nothing in there.  ...  You'll probably get a little moist, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n\"Shall I get her fed, then?\"</span></div></div>",

Let's do it!\" you say with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\"Do what..?\" says the tubby orange vixen nervously.<br>\r\n\"Why, get you some treats for being such a good girl, of course!\" your friend says.  \"Now, open wide for your treats!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...  Okay.\"  The little butterball accepts the answer.  She opens her maw as much as she possibly can, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Here come the berries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend places the berries, one by one, into her mouth, upon each of which she'd clamp her jaws shut and gulp down the juice and pulp.<br>\r\nAfter the tenth one, she's become a bit tipsy.<br>\r\n\"Hee-hee!  I love those berries...  *urp*  Could I get some more?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we're all out at the moment, girl.  We'll probably get more, later, though,\" your friend tells her.<br>\r\n\"Oh...  'Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whisper to your friend, \"Isn't she supposed to be 'swelling right before my very eyes?'  I don't see that.\"<br>\r\n\"Sometimes it takes a bit to work.  You'll see it in a few minutes, probably.\"<br>\r\nAt that moment, the vixen let out a long, loud fart. *PHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT*<br>\r\n\"Oh, my...\" the vixen said as she blushed through her fur.  \"Ex-excuse me...\"<br>\r\n\"The berries do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I didn't have my claw in there.\"<br>\r\n\"Still, you'll find nothing in there!  It's clean as a whistle.\"<br>\r\n\"I believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, the little fat-ass was becoming a lot less \"little.\"  Evidently, the berries are kicking in.<br>\r\n\"Woooooooooow!  I'm growing!\" the vixen said in astonishment as her fattening belly was raising her even further off the ground.  Her belly grew from \"apple-sized\" to \"grapefruit-sized,\" expanding a full foot farther as her breasts grew from G's to JJ's.  Her thighs and ass weren't spared, either; her thighs grew an extra 2 feet in diameter each (\"Strange:  Usually the growth is proportionate.  I'm not complaining, though; it only makes for excellent drumsticks.\"), and her ass grew another foot and a half outward.  Her cankles became a bit more pronounced, and her arms just a bit more flabby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" you say.  It looks like she'll fill a pan a whole lot better now.  You give her a quick once-over, just to make sure nothing had been drastically altered; nothing had (everything was as good as it was, but perhaps more so).  You give her belly a little rub, which makes her purr a bit.  \"You're doing good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment of truth, though:  The probing.  Carefully, you aligned your claw with the center of her ass; you wanted this to be as clean and quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she's buzzed enough?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Probably.  Lemme check,\" your friend says.  \"Hey!  Girl!  We're going to shove a claw up your ass!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't tell her that!\" you scold.<br>\r\n\"'Kay.  Bring it on!  He-hee-he...\" the vixen said playfully, wriggling her huge ass and tail as if <i>you</i> were the one that needed enticing; she loosed another fart at that moment.<br>\r\n*PHHRRRT*<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think she's buzzed enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, then,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never.  Your claw rockets forward, venturing forth into her \"final frontier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite as ready as she let on, apparently.  \"NnnnnnnnnnNNNNNNNNNNNGAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAHHOOOOOOOOHhhhoooooooh!\" she moaned as she squirmed about on her belly.  She continued to make noises like that as you explored her \"cavity.\"  She even threw in a few pig squeals.  (\"Makes sense; she certainly <i>eats</i> like a pig.  Again, no complaints; makes for a better, uh...  Everything.  She gets fat, we eat more.  You get that.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, you finished quickly, leaving her relatively fast.  She whimpered a bit, but a tummy rub fixed that pretty easily.  Just to finish off your tests, you grope her thighs, and deem the A-OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's official:  This vixen is premium meat.</span></div></div>",

It's some kind of primal hunter instinct.  You like it.  She...  Doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick her up by her back in one claw while she's still flailing; her gut just jiggles even more.  It looks <i>delicious.</i>  You flip her over, bottom facing you, and you, in your feral rage, stick your tongue right into her \"cavity\" and <i>lick.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuuuuuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhahaahahhaahah!  STOP IT!\" she yells.<br>\r\nYou just laugh.  Your feral fury is fully kindled.<br>\r\n\"Bon appetit!\" you shout.<br>\r\nYour friend is just watching you, bemused...

By biting into her mammoth gut like it was a piece of fruit.  She yelps in pain as your jaws clamp down and you tear away a hunk of flesh and blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou savor it.  The texture of her fat was perfect in both its thickness and creaminess.  The warm, salty-and-<i>very</i>-sweet vixen butter literally <i>melts</i> in your mouth (it <i>is</i> fat, after all) as it mingles on your tongue.  The belly flesh isn't bad, either:  It's distinctively tangy and adds a richness of its own to the already-orgasmic flavor that has overtaken your mouth.  Your feral spirit quiets a bit, but now you're driven by flavor.  It all flows down your throat, and the first bite is gone.  \"Mmmmmmmmmmmmm...\"  ...  There are many, <i>many</i> more bites to be had though; upon looking back at the vixen's succulent, blubbery belly, you see that, despite having taken a rather large bite of it, you've barely made it 4 inches in.  You take two more bites as your \"plum\" continues to yelp in pain.  You've gone another 3 inches; you've got another 17 left to tear through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd tear you do; for 20 minutes you savor the vixen, until her belly was completely gone.</span></div></div>",

In its place, though, wells a fountain of guilt, probably to counterbalance the rage you'd experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel horrible for having submit an innocent creature to such pain (despite having had no qualms about cooking it before your \"rage\"), and are actually a little ashamed of yourself, as you stare down at the vixen.

And appears to have formed a new, flat belly?  Weird.  It's good stuff.  Anyway, you take her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she comes-to, she's lying on your kitchen table, minus her usually thick belly.  And the first thing she sees is <i>you</i>.  Understandably, she panics, trying to escape from the monster that ate her belly.  It's difficult to walk now that there's a massive change in her center of gravity.<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna die!\" she shouts.  You're not used to her actually <i>talking,</i> in actual <i>sentences</i>.<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna die...\" you say, consolingly; you don't think she'll believe you, though.  She doesn't.  She keeps running around the table, breasts knocking against her face, until she tires herself out, at which point she falls onto her still-huge ass, defeated.<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me...\" she says between gulps of air.<br>\r\n\"I won't, I won't...  You're my pet, now.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be your pet, though.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll like it.\"<br>\r\n\"...  I don't have a choice.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit.  Here, have an apple slice.\"  You place an apple wedge by her, which is about as big as one of her thighs.<br>\r\n\"That's a big apple.\"  She bends down to take a bite of the giant apple wedge.  \"It's a <i>good</i> apple.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you say, as you eat an apple wedge yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, she gets used to you; you don't seem <i>quite</i> as menacing as before, despite being over twenty times her height, and she actually trusts you to pick her up and <u>not</u> tear off a chunk of her flesh.  The master/pet relationship gels, eventually.  She sleeps on a tiny pillow on your nightstand, with a tiny collar around her neck.  Her belly has returned to its original size; maybe even bigger.  Her ass has only gotten fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still crave that fat, though.  Instead of tearing it off of her, though, you've opted for a compromise:  You've worked out a \"liposuction\" system, where she actually allows you to cut a hole in her belly and squeeze out some fat into a jar for later, provided you have some of that special ointment on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get some of her fat, you make her fatter.  Win-win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a happy ending, right?</span></div></div>",
