            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake Miller was bored. Bored, bored, bored. He was bored at school, bored at home, and bored <br>\r\neverywhere else. His family was always the same, his friends were always the same, and his <br>\r\nclasses were always the same. He often wished that things would change. Little did he <br>\r\nknow...<br>\r\nOne boring day, Jake was walking home when something strange caught his eye. He looked <br>\r\naround, and discovered a scrap of color, almost obscured by a large bush, lying in the ditch <br>\r\nat the side of the road. Intrigued for some reason, Jake moved closer to it, so he gould get <br>\r\na better look. It was a light blue shoebox, with 'X-39' sloppily scrawled on it in black <br>\r\nmarker. Jake knelt down to pull it out of its spot in the bush, and as he touched it, he <br>\r\nfelt a strange sense of... rightness. Somehow, he knew that this was what he was looking <br>\r\nfor. This was the answer to his boredom. Excitedly, Jake stuffed the box into his backpack <br>\r\nand hurried back to his house.<br>\r\nOnce he got home, he ran straight up to his room, ignoring his father's greeting from the <br>\r\nother room. He shut the door to his room, ensuring that his bratty sister wouldn't bother <br>\r\nhim while he examined his discovery. Gingerly, he opened the box and dumped its contents <br>\r\nonto his bed. Inside was a strange device, about the size and shape of a TV remote, but a <br>\r\nlittle lighter. It had three buttons, marked 'Gender', 'Swap', and 'Copy/Paste', as well as <br>\r\na number of smaller buttons. There was also an illuminated screen, divided into five <br>\r\nsections- 'Body', 'Clothes', 'Mind', 'Life', and 'Other'. Also inside was a small sheet of <br>\r\npaper and a large instruction manual. Jake picked up the paper and read it.<br>\r\n'Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of an X-39 Attribute Alterator, the latest in <br>\r\nalteration technology! The X-39 is an amazing and powerful device, capable of changing <br>\r\npeople in a limitless number of ways. And the best part is, they won't even realize it! The <br>\r\nX-39's patented RealityLok(tm) feature ensures that the people you change think they've <br>\r\nalways been that way. Only you know the difference!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake grinned. This was an amazing find. He wouldn't be bored now!</span></div></div>",

Her prude of a brother would probably get angry at her for being in his room anyway. Not that she really cared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of his room, she headed for the bathroom.

His father was usually out of touch and wrong in his comments, but that was a pretty good burn. Jake couldn't come up with a comeback at the time, so he just stuck his tongue out at him. His father wore a satisfied smirk with Allison's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready, everyone, and I'm hungry! So I'm not waiting; hurry if you want to eat.\"  Some Allison said in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and his father were also quite hungry, so they quickly made their ways to the dinner table. Where an Allison in his mother's business suit had started eating. Jake looked at his plate to find spaghetti and meatballs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at it in contempt. If mom wasn't so lazy, she wouldn't force her family to eat this crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh, what a tasty meal we have here.\" Jake said sarcastically. His father snorted than covered his face in an attempt to stifle his laugh, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, you're so annoying, can you for once in your life respect and appreciate me? I swear you don't even realize the how difficult you are!\" His mom almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could be a bit annoying sometimes, but his mother never listened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why are we eating this again!\" Allison groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously! We should have like chicken salad or something,\" Zach added walking in with his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounds sooooo good right now, Jake thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother in a much different tone replied, \"Oh, you're totally right, I'm sorry Allison; I don't listen to you enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's draw nearly dropped to the floor. \"UGH!\" He could not believe his mom right now. \"You are so unfair!\" How could she treat her children so differently. \"I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't soil your panties over something so trivial Jake!\" Allison quipped producing laughter from his entire family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jake stomped back to his room, he pulled out the remote. I was having a good day till the change. I have to change this back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jake attempted to turn himself back however, all he felt was disgust at his old form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" Jake realized how much Allison's mind was impacting him.

I know she works, but it wouldn't take a little more effort to do something different?. \"Jack always had a problem with his mother, she never tried to understand him ... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisson raised an eyebrow in doubt because that is exactly what she thinks of their mother, but as has been said, Jack has always defended her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, next question and our father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lacks attitude! He is always lost if he is pressured a little more, the remote has made an incredible improvement on him for having finally given the courage to respond. Jack answers without noticing that he\u2019s speaking more and more like Alisson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisson was impressed, either Jack is an excellent actor and he never told or that remote is true.

Last question, what do you think of Jack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Alisson's personality completely dominated Jack's brain: Argh I'm an idiot, a nerd, a lazy person who can only complain. My god, how unbearable I was before the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisson was legitimately impressed that Jack would never agree with her and described to himself exactly how she thinks of him. It seems that this remote is true, in this case ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, Jack, I believe you for now and I can see that you have made great improvement, that was the best thing that happened in your life.

She said, challenging Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlisson was always a privileged girl, with grades above average and high intelligence, she always saw herself \"above\" the rules, as they only served those who could not circumvent them. And as much as she liked the people she considered friends, she always felt superior, beyond what she really was, that's why she never found someone she could really call \u2018equal\u201d, to share her difficulties, but now that chance existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could just copy everything from herself and paste it into Jack, but no ... she wanted more, she wanted to see him admit that he would much rather be like her and abandon his old life and soon she would have that pleasure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only one of us needs to get dressed and the controller can copy the look, said Alisson excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally ... Wait, no ... That was just now, I'm going back to normal tonight! Jack said in agreement and stepped back a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you will, Jack ... said Alisson \"agreeing\" with his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Jack went down to the cafe with his sister where two bowls of cereal were waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKids, I have to leave earlier today so please contain yourself with the cereal ok?

His body rejected the smoke, and Jake almost fell from the seat into a deep coughing fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-39 device suddenly fell from Jake's pocket onto the ground between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sarah wondered, as she picked up the box from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Paste</b> flashed on the display as it was pointed inadvertently at Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jake heard the click of a button, the coughing fit dissipated.  Jake sat back up on the swing seat, and looked towards the burning cigarette between his fingers with new emotions.  The smoke no longer irritated his eyes, and the horrid taste of ash in his mouth had evaporated.  Jake could feel a voice inside his head instruct him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smoke</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake tapped the ash from the cigarette and raised to his lips, as he attempted to fend off the new urges.  With the filter between his lips, Jake inhaled immediately, and could feel the nicotine surge through him.  The feeling was if electricity was passing through his body, elevating his all his senses.  Moments later, Jake exhaled a cloud of smoke towards his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Sarah repeated at her spellbound friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake continued to devour each drag on the cigarette, feeding his new implanted addiction, he explained how he came across the X-39 Alterator.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you used this on me?  How could you?\" Sarah dragged on her shrinking cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Sarah, I was curious to see if the device could work.\" Jake inhaled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stared at the burning cigarette between her fingers, and took a final puff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mad at you for using me as your guinea pig! However, it appears we are even.\" Sarah responded, nodding towards Jake's own new smoking habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you know, with the device, I can get rid of these addictions from ourselves.  Unlike real smokers, we are not stuck with this for life thanks to this device.\"  Jake inhaled again on the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah looked at the half-empty pack of cigarettes, she reflected on her own change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you, but I don't feel like quitting this anytime soon.  Right or wrong, I never understood my sister's habit until now. Now I get why she does it.  Smoking relaxes me, and gives me a chance to think.\" Sarah said, as she toyed with the pack and lighter between her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded as he exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah watched Jake finished his cigarette, the friends considered their next options.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins, Jake acknowledged that Sarah was right; he didn't want to quit any time soon, either. Besides, he knew in truth what most smokers only told themselves as a convenient lie: he could quit any time he wanted. In the meantime, why not enjoy his new habit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do want to keep at this for a while, but I have a problem you don't have. Nobody smokes at my house. I guess eventually we'll have to work out a way to get our own supply, but just for now, could you give me some out of Samantha's pack?\" Jake asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, already a zealous convert, tutted. With clear reluctance, she gave Jake two of the remaining cigarettes from the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, is that all I get?\" he asked petulantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want more for myself, and besides, you caused this. I get to keep the lighter, too.\" she added, a little defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake began to formulate a counter argument, but stopped himself. This wasn't worth falling out over, and besides, two cigarettes was more than the none he'd have otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two set off in different directions for their respective homes. As Jake walked home, he began to wonder about the possibilities inherent in the remote. He also reflected on his new addiction; ironically, he and his sister Allison had just a few short years ago persuaded their mother to quit smoking herself, after years of pressure. He wondered how his mother would react to his hypocrisy, now he was a smoker? He hoped to delay that reckoning as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered his house, Jake realised he had underestimated the strength of his addiction. He already wanted another cigarette, but knew it would be some time before he got the opportunity. Throughout the family meal, he grew ever more preoccupied and irritable, and wished that his remote could make time go faster somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time everyone else was safely in bed, Jake no longer wanted a cigarette, he NEEDED one. He had worked out his plan of attack: the family kept a lighter in the kitchen drawer to light candles on birthdays and such, so he would procure that as his new lighter. Then he would hide in the trees at the end of the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was less stealthy than he had hoped to be, as by now he was feeling desperate and uncoordinated. He was almost shaking; he had never known deprivation like this! Fumbling with his lighter briefly, he felt immense relief as his cigarette lit, and a sense of blissful well-being as the smoke entered his lungs. If he had never known what it was to be deprived until earlier, he had never know release until this moment. He devoured the cigarette almost without noticing, and as he crushed it out beneath his sneaker he realised he still did not feel quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, he examined the second cigarette. He knew he needed it, right now. He also knew that it represented the end of his supply. He momentarily considered saving it, but before he quite knew it his will had collapsed, the cigarette was lit, and he was exhaling his first drag. Had he once known freedom, willpower? All he knew in that moment was that he needed to smoke, and to solve the lack of cigarettes, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea hit Jake: his mother used to smoke! If he pasted the addiction back onto her, it would be reasonably assumed she'd just relapsed. Few eyebrows would be raised. That would give him a supply to loot, and also set a less contentious scene for his own inevitable debut as a smoker. And unlike with Sarah, his conscience would be clear; his mother chose to smoke already, so all he was doing was reinforcing that choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd half talked himself into this plan before the nicotine began to work it's magic, and return him to his senses. In a more rational state, he felt a little ashamed that he'd decided to do such a morally ambiguous thing simply to serve his own addiction. As he blew away the last of his smoke, he closed his eyes and made a decision...</span></div></div>",

He knew Zach took great delight in ratting out his fellow brothers and sister to their parents, whilst enhancing his own role model status in the family.  Jake envisaged divulging Zach's smoker status would further solidify his position within the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Zach behind him, Jake was marched back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday morning soon arrived, and Jake awoke with a dry throat and a desperate craving for another cigarette.  As he read through the settings on the X39 for anything which might alleviate his nicotine fix, he realised being able to satisfy his urge was one of the major drawbacks of being a smoker.  In that moment, Jake realised the agony his mother went through when quitting at the mercy of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of last night flooded back, and he knew his secret would soon be unveiled by his brother to the family.  Eventually, Jake emerged from the bedroom down the landing towards the stairs.  As Jake stood, he could hear no arguing or debating from downstairs - instead just snoring from Zach's room.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>He isn't up yet!</b> Jake beamed to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a new plan to retain his secret and provide a steady source of cigarettes formed in his mind as he returned to his bedroom to retrieve the X-39...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tiptoeing very carefully into his elder brother's room, Jake readied the X-39. This plan worked on so many levels: not only would it prevent Zach from telling Mom and Dad about his smoking, it would also likely provide a ready source of cigarettes, since Zach was 18 and could actually buy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach was sleeping peacefully as Jake aimed the device. With the click of a button, the deed was done, but Zach did not move or react at all. It was as though nothing had happened. Jake felt momentarily worried that his plan had failed, but reassured himself with the thought that the change was only immediately noticeable for himself and Sarah due to circumstances; in contrast Zach was sleeping. What was he expecting him to do, sit bolt upright and beg for a cigarette? Jake retreated, hoping that his plan would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the breakfast table, Jake picked at his food and tried to ignore his ever growing craving. Allison was irritatingly chirpy today, but Jake could only hear her words as noise. His spirits lifted a little, however, when he saw that Zach was just as preoccupied and miserable. As his brother came downstairs, Jake had feared that he was about to immediately divulge his discovery from the night before, but he had instead took a seat opposite and sat sulking silently, likely tormented by his own sudden urge to smoke. Or maybe it hadn't worked, and Zach was just coincidentally ill or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake wondered what this must feel like for Zach, since he had no idea what had been done to him. The instructions on the device said that the target would not know they had changed; himself and Sarah were exceptions as they knew about the device, had both used it and told each other. Still, even Jake had noticed strange things following the paste; changes in his muscle memory, brief flashes of images he knew to be false of smoking before yesterday. Was Zach being plagued by similar symptoms?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rushed to meet with Sarah to walk to school as soon as he could, planning to ask for another of her cigarettes. He was to be sorely disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smoked them all last night\" murmured Sarah awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them?! There was still just under half a pack!\" Jake gasped incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted all of them. In fact, I kind of wanted more...\" came her wistful reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt like screaming, but instead decided to distract himself by taking the opportunity to ask Sarah about her own experience of having been made into a smoker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you actually paste it?\" she asked him in response, a thoughtful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your room, after you'd told me what Sam was arguing with your Mom about. You'd just told me it was a horrible habit, and then as soon as it was transferred, you wanted a smoke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah concentrated hard. \"Hmm... I remember saying that. But it's funny, I didn't feel like it was a new thing, wanting to smoke. And now I actually think about it, I remember secretly smoking for as long as Sam has been, but never telling anyone, or doing it in front of anyone. Nobody even suspected. If there is anything that doesn't add up about that story, it's that I suddenly felt fine doing it in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt a sense of recognition. \"Didn't we start together? Because I have a second set of memories where we tried it together and I smoked in secret ever since?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head. \"Think about it Jake, where would you have been getting the cigarettes? You never smoked until yesterday, that's how I know the X-39 really works... I guess I never did either, as weird as that feels to acknowledge now I've really thought about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded. \"So I guess that's what it does. It creates plausible new memories to justify the changes, but also adds caveats and excuses for why events weren't different for everybody else. It's kind of like dream logic. So I guess Zach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake caught himself. He hadn't actually told Sarah that part yet. He hadn't been sure he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess Zach what?\" said Sarah in confusion, before it dawned on her. \"Oh, Jake. You didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the ground, ashamed, Jake replied. \"He caught me smoking. And he can buy cigarettes for us. So I thought it made sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grimaced. \"I want to feel annoyed at you, disgusted even, but at this point, anything than can get us cigarettes has to be a good thing. I'm gasping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gritted his teeth. He was desperate too. The two of them had reached the gates of their High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we might have a solution long term, but I only have one idea in the short term, and I don't much like it.\" said Jake, nodding in the direction of a cluster of students hiding around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shuddered. The established smokers. Those people were delinquents and future drop outs; neither Jake nor Sarah associated with any of them, or wanted to. They had absolutely nothing in common. But they had something both of them of needed. And besides, weren't they themselves smokers now too? As much as she hated the humiliating idea, the nicotine receptors in Sarah's brain screamed at her to just ask for one, or at least a drag. Paralysed, the best she could do was absolve herself of responsibility for the choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't pick. It's up to you, Jake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed. He'd been hoping Sarah would make the choice. Well, if he had to choose...</span></div></div>",

With each step taken forward, his rational mind fought against the nicotine cravings, begging him to walk away and resist the voices inside.  As he got closer to the group, the smoke hung overhead, and his nostrils widened as he breathed the toxic smoke in to quench his hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one group in the corner that caught his attention - as he recognised two of the pupils; Vicky Darlington, who was in the year above and Mark Foy, whom he shared classes with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the group, the smokers looked at Jake, while sucking on their cigarettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hiya.\" Jake stuttered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Mark grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm...I was h-hoping I could have a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a...a?\" one of the smokers teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake could feel the sweat run down his forehead, as he now noted he was way out of his comfort zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A smoke?\" Jake responded as he looked towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group burst out laughing, soon attracting the attention of the others in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned as she watched Jake being teased mercilessly by the smokers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake Miller wants a smoke?!\" Mark laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we on candid camera?\" Another joked as they inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we being Punk'ed?\" Another joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky took a deep draw from her cigarette and approached Jake, who stared at the ground, wanting it to swallow him whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake.

She began to outline her plan:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looking through the instructions of the X-39, it says that under 'Other' we can tweak specific attributes, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was struggling to concentrate because he want to smoke so badly, a situation only exacerbated by watching the regular smokers light up in the distance, but he thought he remembered seeing that, so mumbled an affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, check this out: there's a 'will' attribute in there, plus 'loyalty' and 'obedience'. How about we target those bastards over there, dial down the 'will', dial up the 'obedience', and make them loyal to us? Then they'd give us anything we asked for. Happily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt uncomfortable. \"I dunno Sarah, wouldn't that be kind of... enslaving them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but they deserve it, the way they treated us earlier. There was no reason for them to be as cruel as that, and this gets us what we want as well as teaching them a lesson. Two birds with one stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Jake could hardly recognise this girl as his kind-hearted Sarah, who just this morning had objected to what he'd done to Zach, something which seemed a much lesser sin than this suggestion. He felt kind of chilled to realise the X-39 could be used for something like this; why had he not realised sooner? But on the other hand, he was feeling desperate enough, and angry enough at the way he'd been treated, that he could almost see the wisdom in it; he reflected that Sarah was probably having her temper frayed by the new cravings too, which led to this idea entering her head. He had to at least try and talk her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure this is...\" he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what the fuck is your solution?\"exploded Sarah, showing a thunderclap of a stormy temper Jake had never before seen in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe momentarily couldn't think of anything, and was about to concede, but then inspiration struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... we don't need to go anywhere near as far as that!\" he said with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on it with Jake, I feel like I'm dying.\" spat Sarah, shifting nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way they treated us this morning was only possible because of our relative positions on the High School Caste System/Food Web. If that were different, we'd have interacted very differently, right? Well, the X-39 has a 'Life' option. All we do is target ourselves and any two of those delinquents over there, though for reasons of justice it should definitely be Foy and Darlington. Then we fire away and boom! Our positions, and the way everybody else reacts to us, are flipped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sarah looked uncomfortable. \"I want them to give us something to smoke. I don't want to BE them. Eww.\" She shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake beamed: \"That's the best part: all it changes is other people's reactions, nothing mental or physical about us or them! So we get to smoke, and they get to walk a mile in our shoes instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked thoughtful. \"Hmmm... I like that. But I still like my plan to. I'll let you pick, but do it quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake thought carefully, and as he did, saw Zach walking out of the gates looking shifty. He'd almost forgotten his long term plan; would it be more rewarding to continue working on that instead of this? Jake's rational mind said yes, but just then he caught a whiff of the heavenly smoke that could be his much quicker by using the X-39 right now.

It was clear from their stances, that they were looked up to amongst their classmates, inside a blue ring of smoke overlooking them protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah noted keenly that Jake tapped a few buttons on the device towards Mark then Vicky, capturing their profiles, then proceeded to point the device towards Sarah.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it already.  I can't stand not being able to smoke!\" Sarah demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, he handed the device to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will need to complete the profile store for me.\" Jake instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah complied, pointing the device at Jake and flicking through the options to store his profile on memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done.\" Sarah handed the X39 back to Jake as the nicotine cravings ramped up with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.  Give me a moment.\" Jake insisted as he brought up options to complete the complicated Swap.  On screen, Jake could see a table of two columns, with the header titled <b>Swap Procedure</b>.  Underneath the columns was the names of those being transferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned to Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is ready to go. In the case this doesn't work, I wanted to say I love you, no matter what.\" Jake said as he held her hand with his left holding the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled back as he pressed the <b>Complete</b> button on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the button was pressed, everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly his vision returned, blurry to start with, as people came into focus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Jake?\" someone asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Seemed to lose you for a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake soon realised he was now standing in the smokers corner, and could see the burning cigarette between his fingers.  Nicotine cravings soon kicked in, and he raised the cigarette for a deep, long satisfied draw.  His body shuddered in ecstasy as he could feel the smoke caress his deprived lungs. Tilting his head back, Jake exhaled towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second pull on the cigarette, Jake observed his surroundings with greater detail; Here he was, standing with the other smokers in one of the alcoves of his school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stranger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned his head to see Sarah standing, cigarette dangling, caressing his new leather jacket.  Sarah herself stood with her blouse top buttons undone, revealing the strapline of her bra seductively, while her lips wore vibrant purple lipstick.  Her new look excited him in ways he never thought of before.  As they continued to smoke silently to the amusement of their new classmates, Jake looked out towards the spot they had been standing to see Mark and Vicky standing.  Their clothes and appearance now matched what Jake and Sarah had been wearing.  Mark was now even wearing the spectacles which Jake had been wearing out of necessity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not talking to us?\" another smoking classmate muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin.\" Jake responded as his memory adjusted to blend with the environment, recalling the names of the fellow student smokers puffing away.  Jake turned to the classmate, as he exhaled again, \"Shut the fuck up. All you do is yap.\" Jake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah inhaled and smiled, noting Jake's out of character outburst.  Before the transfer, Jake was extremely timid in personality.  Sarah assumed new assertion was part of the transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I like this new you.\" Sarah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from the physical stuff, are your memories intact?\" Jake responded as he tapped ash from his cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.  Samantha is my sister, Mark is my brother.  We live at home with Mom. Dad left us long ago.  I still have the same classes here.  What about you?\" Sarah recalled as she inhaled again on her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still live with Mom and Dad, and Allison and Zach.\" Jake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I got here.\" Sarah smiled as she extracted a pack of Kools from her blouse pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check your pockets.\" Sarah urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt around his leather jacket, and took out his own pack of Marlboros.  In the other pocket, he could feel the familiar feel of the X39 device, worried in case this remained with Mark and Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two confused students approached the group of smokers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...what did you do to us Jake?\" Mark cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you talking about?  Once a nerd, always a nerd.\" Jake groaned in Mark's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled as Jake stepped forward to continue his tirade, after taking a drag from his cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing, Vicky.  How does it feel being on the outside?\" Jake smiled as he exhaled straight into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance of a smoke?  We are dying here.\"  Vicky inhaled the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  Answer is no.  You are not one of us, and will never be.  Now piss off the pair of you, before I kick your asses!\" Jake threatened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah burst out laughing at Jake's new attitude, he strolled back to the corner with purpose, smoke trailing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vicky and Mark ran off, Jake turned to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from instant access to cigarettes, I feel fucking amazing!  Like I am unstoppable.\" Jake beamed as he exhaled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.  Before, I was driven purely by my need to smoke.  Now, I feel unstoppable and completely free of all fears.\" Sarah responded with her own inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.  I was shitting myself about being found out as a smoker, but now?  Who gives a fuck!\" Jake replied, as Sarah noted his more vulgar vocabulary come into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say folks, who wants to see us recruit a new member to our little smokin' posse?\" Sarah asked her smoking pupils as Jake had the same idea form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the fellow smokers hung on every word of their new ringleaders Jake and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake removed the X39 from his jacket pocket and tapped up the <b>Obedience</b> trait, now feeling the urge to brainwash someone else within the school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea Sarah!  Now who should we recruit?\" Jake wondered as they smoked and watched pupils walk by...<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fiddling with the settings, Jake set Maria's <b></b>Obiedience<b></b> trait to 100%, and made himself the sole target of it: she would remain perfectly unchanged in every other way, but feel compelled to obey his, and only his, commands. He knew why he wanted to do this; he had always been a little envious of Maria's quiet self confidence, the way she simply lived her life the way she felt was right with no view to the opinions of others, of her peers. He was thrilled at the notion of forcing her to do things she didn't really want to, while having her remain painfully aware that she didn't want to do them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pressed the button, he wondered why he suddenly didn't feel guilty about this. Part of him wanted to tell himself he had inherited some of Mark's cruelty, but in his heart he knew that wasn't true. The setting he had used didn't change anything mental or physical; the differences in his thinking now came only from his new found power and status. Now that everyone around him was reacting with fear and deference, and now he knew that the X-39 gave him power enough to never truly have to fear consequences again, he felt less morally constrained. All of this new attitude had always been inside him, held back only by his own fear. He felt half ashamed of this, but as he took another drag on his cigarette, he decided he was having far too much fun to care. And things were about to get even more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Maria! Come over here!\" he called tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked startled, and clearly didn't want to approach the group. She looked confused by the fact that she was approaching anyway, and a gathering panic was evident on her face. As she reached him, he very deliberately blew smoke in her direction, and noted with amusement that Sarah had had the exact same, simultaneous idea. Maria coughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you want, Jake?\" she stuttered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to talk is all. It strikes me that I've never really got to know you properly. Cigarette?\" he offered, holding his open pack out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I don't smoke.\" she managed to say politely, struggling to keep her evident disgust in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one.\" said Jake forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria reluctantly extracted a cigarette with a frown, clearly very disturbed that she was doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now put it in your mouth.\" said Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria obeyed without question but then began to speak, the unlit cigarette bobbing between her lips: \"Please Jake, I don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, bitch!\" he spat. \"Good, now suck on that a little, and get ready for a whole new world...\" he said gently, extending his lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria dutifully did as Jake commanded, coughing slightly and spitting out the smoke that had flooded her mouth with a look of distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now try again, and this time breathe the smoke in.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria inhaled for the first time, and went into a horrific coughing fit provoke paroxysms of laughter from everyone else present, except Jake, who merely cracked a cruel smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up until it's all gone.\" came his next command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smoked quietly and nervously, often coughing (although with ever less intensity). Every drag seem to be hellish to her, and at no point did she seem to be enjoying herself. By the end she was in tears, and Jake felt a pang of pity that he nonetheless suppressed. As she awkwardly stamped out the completely spent tip of her first ever cigarette, Maria softly asked \"Can I go now, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just yet. First, some long term instructions: you have to come here every morning with a new pack of cigarettes. Without fail. You will report to this position during every break thereafter. Secondly, you will do all my assigned homework, and will present it to me here, every morning. Every time I get less than an A+, there will be consequences. And finally: you will kiss my feet. Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stunned silence descended on the group. Nobody really believed that Maria would go through with this. But, wiping her tears and trying to maintain some kind of dignity, she knelt and kissed Jake's dirty boot. Everybody cheered in disbelief, and Maria scampered away, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grabbed Jake by the ass and pulled him around into a tight embrace, kissing him with a new passion; Jake enjoyed the taste of her smoke mingling with his, and as she pulled away to speak to him, he saw the animal lust he was feeling for her mirrored in her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucked up!\" she said, admiringly. \"Fuck the rest of this day, let's hit the town, see what mayhem we can cause with the X-39!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake hesitated. The possibilities were endless! He could make the whole town his bitch in one way or another now. That was an attractive prospect, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both have classes with Mark and Maria, and I'm sure we'll see Vicky around. Don't you want you want to fuck with them some more?\" he said, and saw by her sadistic grin that she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hard decision: the whole world was theirs to play with, after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The school bell rung, as Jake headed off to his next class - home economics. With his new-found attitude, thanks to the life swap, Jake felt more confident than he had ever done before. The change had shifted his moral compass in such a manner he never expected, although he embraced the new feelings building with him.  He could feel his mind still evolve, having been moulded on Mark's former lifestyle to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students gathered around their cookers awaiting instructions from their frail teacher, Dana Milton, Jake struggled to retain an interest as the lesson begun.  Ms Milton was serving her final year with the high school before retirement, but her traditional teaching format made her unpopular with the pupils.  Suddenly, a devious thought ran through his mind as Dana demonstrated a recipe for her class to copy.  Slipping the X-39 out of his pocket, he scanned the device, under the desk in the direction of the teacher, and began punching buttons relating to her <b>body</b>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana's wrinkles slowly began to recede and flatten from her face, whilst her bent over posture straightened out.  Her once blonde hair returned to its full glory whilst the rattle in her voice from years of smoking had dissipated.  As Dana continued to teach, she and the pupils were unaware of her transformation into a younger version of herself.  Jake went one further and increased the size of her breasts to a fuller figure as the class remained unmoved by the changes in front of them.  After making changes to the <b>body</b>, Jake made subtle changes to her <b>personality</b>.  As buttons were clicked and the device pointed in her direction, her demeanor adjusted to the new settings.  Dana now found herself referring to her pupils by name, and her tone was more engaging, improving the learning experience for all.  As the class began to copy the cooking recipe shown, Dana found herself inadvertently flirting with Mark - another change added to her personality.  By the time the bell went, Dana thought she would be reconsidering retirement as an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch soon arrived, and Jake's nicotine cravings raged through him.  Sarah caught up with Jake and a few of his new disciples at the school gates, ready to head into town for the hour.  Once out of sight, they all lit up cigarettes (Maria reluctantly complied by command of Jake) and walked down the street.  Jake and Sarah caught up while walking and smoking with their new posse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be assed with classes now, I just couldn't focus.  I spent the duration of history watching poor Vicky squirm in her chair.  Thanks to your magic box, she is still struggling with her new reality, and I love it!\" Sarah beamed as she smoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded in agreement as he sucked down on his cigarette forcefully - he loved the feeling of power at his fingertips.  They both acknowledged they felt their personalities still evolving as corrupt thoughts began filling their mind.  The blind fellowship of his new gang further emboldened them as they enjoyed the rebellious chill run through their bodies as much as the surging nicotine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter buying and consuming food from the bakery, Jake and the group strolled back towards high school, all smoking.  As Sarah inhaled, she noticed Maria continue to struggle with her new forced addiction, still coughing with each drag.  Inside, Maria was embarrassed to be associated with the group, and felt trapped, thanks to the obedience from the X-39.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love what you've done with Maria.  You have made her smoke <i>against</i> her will. I wanna have a go using the Obedience setting, but take it a stage further.  I don't wanna have a target struggle or attempt to resist...I want them to fully comply and immerse themselves to my will, while being fully obedient.\" Sarah insisted after one final drag on her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's attention was on the students now approaching the school gate, returning from their travels during lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we got ten minutes left.  Who you got in mind?\" Jake inquired.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jake and Sarah approached Jen and Sally, returning from their lunch, the X-39 changed hands and Sarah felt anticipation building. Jake could see her enthusiasm, and thought he knew exactly where it was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the changes of today, in the old status quo, Jen and Sally had been Sarah's closest female friends since early childhood. Sarah had always been the most tomboyish of the trio as a little girl, which had led to her friendship with Jake sometimes being a stronger force in her life, even before puberty had shifted the nature of that particular bond, but she'd always needed these two for female companionship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a benign, unintentional way, they had always dominated and excluded Sarah. It wasn't a deliberate choice, and it had no malice in it, but the two were simply closer to each other than to her. It didn't help that they'd both grown to overshadow her in one way or another; Sarah was above average in all respects, but Jen was the smartest girl in the school (without ever being awkward enough socially to be seen as a dork) and Sally was the star of the Girl's Soccer team. Worse, both girls were physically stunning, in different ways: Jen was a slight, pale beauty with raven hair and dark eyes and a faux-shy, alluring smile, while Sally was an athletic, tanned blonde with striking green eyes. Sarah was in no way plain, but compared to these two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Jake knew Sarah had carried an unspoken resentment of her two friends in her heart, growing like a tumour, for most of her life. As the girls caught sight of her, their previously relaxed manner stiffened. To them, this wasn't a girl who had been their overlooked bestie just this morning. This was a childhood friend who had gone off the rails in an epic manner, some years previously. Jake knew from his shadow memories that in the version of events Jen and Sally would remember, Sarah had been a bitter, threatening presence for years. He could see in her face that she was enjoying seeing their fear, that she felt it made up for the years of hurt, but he also caught a glimpse of a fleeting sadness. Part of Sarah was still hurt and confused by seeing that reaction on the faces of people so close to her, even if the speed with which the look passed suggested it was a small, dying part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Hi, Sarah! H-how... How are you?\" said Jen in response to the long stare Sarah had given her, clearly unnerved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great, Jess! How are you, Jess?\" said Sarah mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... It's.... My name is Jen, Sarah, if you remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Jess.\" smiled Sarah. \"Now, I bet you're wondering why I've come over to you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I can guess. You came to be a bitch, right?\" scowled Sally, more assertive, although even she had to subtly steel herself first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, dumbshit. I'm here to do the greatest favour anyone will ever do you, in honour of how close we used to be in the pre-pube days! You should thank me in advance!\" beamed Sarah malevolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally rolled her eyes. \"And what would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulled out the X-39, and both girls flinched and ducked, clearly fearing that Sarah had pulled out a gun or some other weapon. Sarah laughed uproariously, and the panic receded as both girls saw that the X-39 was some sort of remote. Jen laughed nervously in relief, but Sally was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asshole! What is that, some sort of toy? I'm not really getting the joke.\" she ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is your salvation.\" said Sarah in mock earnestness, before giggling derisively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had obviously gone insane, they concluded. It made Jen more nervous, but Sally just tutted dismissively. And then Jen aimed the X-39 at one, and then the other, triggering the cocktail of settings she had built for them. Now, both simply looked dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to explain what just happened. I have made you both my slaves, but I also made it so obeying my commands will make you happy. Obedience, and Joy, both redefined. From now on, you will be my personal posse, my handmaidens... my bitches. Beyond that, I don't want to change your minds by force though; I'm sure they'll change in time. I just want you to be my friends... and occasionally polish my shoes for me. Maybe other stuff, if I'm the mood.\" she winked suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's test this out, and your first command is to answer me truthfully... If I remember correctly, Sally, you come from a sporty family; none of them have ever smoked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, none.\" said Sally, and then smiled very slightly at the small release of endorphins that came from obeying her new domina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Jen, still a Mormon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my family is. I don't believe in the religious aspects but I follow the lifestyle because I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't ask for your life story, moron.\" said Sarah dismissively. \"So, to the point, neither of you have ever even tried smoking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever even thought about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Sally with clear disgust, while Jen hesitantly said \"I have sometimes wondered what it's like. So there are times I've thought about it. Especially when you first started, Sarah. And there's a boy I like, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, Jen, there is no shutting you up all of a sudden. Shut. the. fuck. up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen's expression was conflicted as she stopped talking. She clearly felt stung by the insult, and yet happy to obey. It more or less cancelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jen, today is your lucky day! You get to find out what it's like to smoke!\" said Sarah, taking out her cigarettes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't actually want to, I've just wondered about it...\" came Jen's response, as she looked at the ground while Sarah lit up, obviously ashamed to have admitted even her limited curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExtending her cigarette, Sarah spoke with a cruel glint in her eye as she exhaled: \"Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen took a cigarette and immediately felt happier, as Sally looked on open mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to smoke it.\" said Sarah, and Jen knew it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her first tentative drag, and coughed. She didn't seem sure about that experience; the obedience felt good but the smoking was a bit nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the best thing you've ever felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen took another drag and felt wonderful. She exhaled with a smile, and didn't need to wait for Sarah's instruction to take another drag; she did it of her own volition, and knew this would be a part of her life from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally finally found words: \"Jen! What are you doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm smoking, Sal. It's really nice.\" said Jen through another exhale, before extending it towards her friend. \"Do you want to try it? I promise it's better than you're expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could reply, Sarah interjected \"Yeah, Sally, you DO want to try. And you will find it to your liking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sally took the cigarette, inhaled, and sighed with relief, the end of which was smoky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you girls to adjust to this change first, but I hope you'll be ready to attend me as soon as I want you.\" said Sarah grandly, as she turned to leave. After a few steps, she half turned, as if remembering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Jen? Homework task: every thing you want that you've been forbidding yourself? Try it. All of it.\" she said with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen nodded happily; she'd enjoy that command, just like all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally and Jen passed their cigarette back and forth in the background, smoking and chatting happily, Jake and Sarah kissed passionately. Coming up for air, Sarah said \"Did you fucking SEE that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. Enjoy yourself?\" said Jake admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm going to enjoy the fruits of it more. Just see.\" she said with a grin. Jake grinned too; he was also curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang to call the students back to class, Sarah passed the X-39 back to Jake. Both of them looked at the remote longingly, and both knew what they were thinking. Could they really go back to class when they had this to play with?</span></div></div>",

It was, presumably due to a glitch, the exact paper he had written and handed in previously, which he knew he had aced. However, it was marked as a fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's this bull? I know this is high quality work Rutherford, why did you fail my ass?\" he asked indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least have the common sense to get whoever does your homework for you to produce work you possibly could, Mr Miller. At least then I can credit you with THAT.\" he said mockingly, to the laughter of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was in a fury. So THIS was the downside to Mark's position: lack of reputation for integrity. Constant prejudice. Why even bother trying to do anything better, nobler or harder, when this was all he'd ever get for it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stewing for a while, concocting various revenges the X-39 would allow him to visit, Jake came to a decision in the last minute of the lesson and deleted Rutherford's ability to speak English and any other language he knew, except Klingon. That was going to be a fun one to watch the results of, long term, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to his next lesson (English), Jake suddenly found himself pulled into the girls toilets. Preparing to defend himself, he was stunned to turn and see the petite frame of Jen, who lept at him and kissed him passionately.<br>\r\nHe could taste the faint traces of her first ever cigarette on her tongue, although unlike the new Sarah she had taken pains to hide it under mints and strawberry lip gloss. As she kissed him, releasing years of sexual frustration, she pushed him into a cubicle, and locked it behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, Jen?\" he said, stunned, pushing her away (a little reluctantly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted you, Jake. You were the first boy I ever saw in that way, even back in Grade School when you were nice. And I want you all the more now.\" she said breathlessly. \"But back then you were all about Sarah and now, you're... you. And besides, I couldn't really have boyfriends and I had to be a virgin until marriage only now I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jen, shut up. Sarah will fucking kill you for this.\" said Jake reasonably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah told me to do this!\" she blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence followed by a confused reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen bit her lip and looked away nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly, but she told me to do whatever I always wanted to. And what I want to do most is you.\" she sighed desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was torn. In his new position, he felt less need to be faithful, but he did still love Sarah. He'd also seen a new side to her, that he knew he didn't want to cross. But this was one of the hottest girls in school, throwing herself at him. What would he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jake attempted to debate the situation with Jen, he suddenly felt a hunger take over, as his eyes scanned up and down her body.  Jake could feel an attraction build up as Jen tried her best to seduce him, unbuttoning the top of her blouse to reveal a white bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Jake, you can't ignore me.  I want you now.\" Jen panted, her eyes widening with anticipation and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen clutched the wrists of Jake and placed them on her hips, as she slowly gyrated against his body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it.\" Jake said suddenly as the lust was unbearable, he moved in and leaned into kiss her passionately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jake.\" Jen moaned as Jake kissed her neck, any inhibitions of cheating now pushed to the back of his lust-filled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilet cubicle door closed and locked, as Jen and Jake were Engaged with each other for session of sexual exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ten minutes later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, coast is clear.\" Jen whispered as she peered out from the bathroom door to the school corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake pushed his shirt back into his jeans, as he emerged from the girls bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to do this again, Jake.  I love you.\" Jen blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go, Jen.  Teacher will be sending out the hunting party for us.\" Jake replied, avoiding Jen's confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...but I want you....I need you.  Screw Sarah.\" Jen groaned, frustrated at Jake's apparent lack of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jen, the bathroom time was fun, but that's all it was.\" Jake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? I wonder if that's how Sarah would see it?\" Jen threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't dare do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me.\" Jen said as she paced down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked out the X-39 and pointed it towards Jen, and went through the options on the device.  He found a menu with <b>Memory</b>, and selected <b>Delete</b>.  From here, he was able to program the time range he wanted removed, and press OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jen reached the school door, she stood, looking at her reflection momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything OK, Jen?\" Jake approached, wondering if the X-39 was able to make changes long distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, Jake.  Kinda wondering why I'm not in class.\" Jen blinked, trying to recall the last fifteen minutes of her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've all had days like that.  What's last thing you remember?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outside with you guys, having my first smoke.  It was great!\" Jen replied, as the nicotine reminded her of her new addiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, take some of these.  Practice.\" Jake suggested as he handed a few cigarettes from his pack and placed in her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers Jake.\" Jen smiled as she walked through and joined her classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed as Jen sat in class; As he walked back down the corridor, he was briefly concerned about his behaviour.  The old Jake was fully committed to Sarah, and had never betrayed her ever before.  He reasoned that it may have been another of Mark's characteristics he inherited as part of the Life Swap.  Maybe Mark and Vicky were not faithful, he considered as he made his way down the corridor back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell sounded for the last time of the day, and the pupils streamed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake and Sarah waved goodbye to their new posse of smoking friends, they lit up the last of their cigarettes and headed home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was your afternoon?\" Sarah asked as she inhaled, her free arm linked in with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was boring.  Since swapping livestyles with Mark, I have no appetite for studies.  What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.  For some reason, I found myself fantasizing over my maths teacher.  I kinda wondered what he would look like naked.  I would never act on it, coz I'm with you, but I think Vicky maybe had a thing for Mr Hendry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Jake nodded, as he inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the cigarettes, the feeling of power, popularity, but lusting over older men was not something I was counting on.  You felt anything like that so far?\" Sarah asked as she exhaled towards the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I've not lusted over men.\" Jake laughed nervously, his mind fresh from his involvement with Jen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Jake lied.  Thanks to the device, he appeared to get away with his cheating, which empowered him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could have my way with anyone, and wipe their memories of it.  Sarah would never know.</i> Jake's mind considered, as Mark's mentality further tred on his personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they took final drags from their cigarettes, they stood outside an Off-Licence and exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going in for smokes.\" Sarah declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that.\" Jake held his girlfriend back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take off my school blazer, you know.\"  Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even doing that, you still look young.\" Jake said, as he took out his device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started tapping buttons on the LCD display of the unit, he pointed at Sarah and clicked OK.  Sarah's body slowly started morphing before him; her height grew a few inches, her face matured, and her acne receded.  Her young body also altered, giving her curves and athletic, tanned legs.  Her ponytails disappeared, allowing her long hair to flow down her upper back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before Jake, she now looked in her mid twenties at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a glance in the shop window at her reflection, Sarah smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it!\"  Sarah beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the schoolgirl emerged from the shop, clutching two packs of cigarettes, giving one to her spellbound boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the street, Sarah's body reverted to its original shape and size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another round of cigarettes, Sarah arrived at her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better go in and face Mom, sis and brother.\" Sarah sighed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how it feels, I dunno how I'm going to be able to go another night with a smoke.\" Jake considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you got the X-39 to solve any issues.\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  But remember - get Sam on your side and your Mom is limited to what she can do.  At least with Sam, you will have an ally.\" Jake reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK honey, I gotta go.\" Sarah kissed Jake on the cheek, and walked through the front garden gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" Jake replied, as his earlier infidelity awakened a new lust within him.  As Jake began walking home, he lit up another cigarette, and began re-evaluating his relationship.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking into the house from the woodland side, at the bottom of the garden while openly and nonchalantly smoking his cigarette, Jake saw Zach nervously looking around from the same position he had been in the previous night. Amused, he realised what was about to happen; it had long since ceased to matter, as events had overtaken this old plan, but he could still have a little fun with this. He settled down to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had a box of matches and a Virginia Slim Menthol (why the fuck was he smoking a woman's cigarette?), and after lighting his cigarette, exhaled with a relieved look. However, the relief soon turned to confusion. He shook his head and dragged again. Jake decided to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here, dipshit?\" he said mockingly, before making a huge show of 'noticing' the lit cigarette. \"Oh, this is great! Mom is going to fucking crucify you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't, man. It's my first one ever. I dunno why, but today I was feeling really weird and I just wanted to try it for some reason.\" Hmm. So Zach didn't get the false memories? Maybe the Paste function got a little glitchier each time a trait was pasted directly without copying it again first? So in this case the addiction was here without the rationalisations? That was worth remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You felt a little weird, huh? Maybe it's your period? Not to worry, I'm sure you've come a long way now, baby.\" said Jake sarcastically, enjoying this new power dynamic with his formerly dominant brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.\" said Zach nervously. That had been a little of the old Jake there; too smart for his own good, remembering and referencing things nobody else really got. That joke had been so bad anyway; dorky. He cringed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fucking cigarette, dumbshit!\" said Jake in exasperation. Now THAT was all the new Jake. \"Why you smoking a woman's cigarette like some sort of faggot for?\" There; the old Jake would never have said that one. Either he was becoming more Mark like or overcompensating to prove to himself that he really was a different person. Nah, totally Mark, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? I felt weird buying so I chickened out and had to sneak one of Mom's.\" said Zach defensively. \"Please don't tell her. And don't tell Emily; her Grandmother just died of lung cancer and she'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" said Jake, taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily's grandmother just died of lung cancer so she's on this big anti-smoking kick...\" said Zach, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, fucko, not some old bitch dying, who gives a quarter of the tiniest of shits about that? The bit about Mom.\" said Jake angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Mom?\" said Zach, perplexed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake thought hard. Of course. In the blended life that was part his (in family structure) and part Mark (in choices), he'd been starting smoking himself right around the time that he'd originally been teaming up with Allison to pressure Mom to quit; so of course he hadn't tried to cut off his own supply. Mom still smoked now. He grinned; that was good. He was an established smoker, and his Mom couldn't rag on him without being a hypocrite, but golden boy Zach still had a halo to taint. This was priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't rat me out!\" said Zach desperately, a single tear literally coming to his eye as he took another drag on his incongruous feminine cigarette. Jake laughed at his brother hysterically for a full half minute before finally composing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a pussy! Are you a fucking woman, Zach, between the bitching, whining and the girly cigs? Do I need to start calling you Zarah, sis? And to think you used to have such power over me!\" he managed to breathe out between bouts of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a wonderful, terrible idea began to form in his head. The perfect joke. He grinned menacingly; Zach dragged on his cigarette nervously, a look of fear in his eyes. Jake's hand reached for the X-39.</span></div></div>",

His six-pack torso receded and reformed as Jake continued programming the device to transform his athletic brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach's attire also altered to mirror his new gender, while he exhaled a small smoke cloud to mask the transformation in his sensitive area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you doing?\" Zach queried, his voice far lighter as part of the physical restructure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake smiled at his work, as Zach continued to struggle with his new tender body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you the makeover you deserve, you wuss!\u201d Jake declared as he watched his new sister take another tentative puff off the cigarette.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get you for what you have done to me.  I look ridiculous!\u201d Zach cried as he exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna do nothing.  Now what name we gonna give you\u2026How about Zoe?\u201d Jake joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Zach, you won\u2019t get away with this you bastard.\u201d Zach/Zoe shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all the noise out here?\u201d Martha shouted from the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already got away with it.\u201d Jake responded as he reset Zach\u2019s short term memory.  He reasoned the X-39 would \u201cfill the gaps\u201d if Zach\u2019s immediate memory was wiped.  After several buttons were pressed, Zoe stood wide-eyed with the Virginia Slim between her fingers.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just caught Zoe having one of your smokes!\u201d Jake declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?  Zoe, give me that, and go straight to your room! You\u2019re grounded.\u201d Martha moaned, as she approached her offspring.  Jake smiled as his mother instantly referred to her former son as now an elder daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no memory of Zach, Zoe surrender the part-smoked cigarette to her mother, and walked inside the house.<br>\r\n\u201cThat lady should know not to steel from her mother.\u201d Martha shook her head, before taking an unapologetic drag.<br>\r\nJake smiled at the development of his mother being open about her habit.  To further test the waters, Jake took out his Marlboros and placed one between his lips.  Any fear of reaction was quenched when Martha offered to light him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a fog of smoke between mother and son, Jake found out more about the new reality at home; Martha had tried to quit smoking but was too addicted, her only smoking ally in the family was Jake, whom she caught years ago sneaking about.  Edgar and Allison remained fully opposed to her indulging, and she had been forced to smoke outside after her last quit attempt failed.  Finding out Zoe was now sneaking cigarettes made Martha smile as she took another drag.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after dinner, Martha headed out onto the patio to feed her addiction.  Jake soon followed her out to join her with an after meal cigarette to the disapproval of his father and younger sister.  With Martha now open with her smoking, the dynamics had now made it that Jake\u2019s own burgeoning habit was now public knowledge in the family.  As Jake and Martha filled their bodies with smoke, they noticed Zoe look from her bedroom window in envy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember we have your grandparents staying with us over the weekend.  Try and keep your smoking to a minimal.\u201d Martha advised as she exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake knew his grandparents loathed the habit, and were anti-smoking zealots, who constantly gave their own daughter a hard time over her addiction.  As Jake inhaled, he thought the forthcoming visit might bring an opportunity to bring much-need harmony within the Miller household.<br>\r\nAfter their smoke, Jake returned inside and went upstairs.  As he made his way to his room, he could hear Zoe cry from the landing.<br>\r\n\u201cYou OK?\u201d Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off!\u201d Zoe cried.  Jake noticed the gender change had also altered the furnishings of his older brother\u2019s bedroom; Gone were the posters of ska bands, replaced by paintings of butterflies and dolphins.  The dark blue wallpaper was replaced with floral design.  The changes made by the X-39 were far-reaching and could change reality beyond his understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how long you been sneaking Mom\u2019s smokes?\u201d Jake queried the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout a few weeks, Mom seems so relaxed when smoking, I just got curious.  Me and her don\u2019t really bond so I wanted something to bring us closer together.  Because you can\u2019t keep your mouth shut, that won\u2019t happen now.  On top of that, Dad is raging at me for smoking.  Says Mom and you are a bad influence.\u201d Zoe moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen that window up.\u201d Jake instructed as he closed and locked the bedroom door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake removed his Marlboros and offered the pack to his new elder sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe complied, placing the cigarette to her lips as they leaned out the window and lit up.  Jake noted Zoe continued to struggle with inhaling, so used the X-39 to give another dose of the addiction trait.  As soon as the button was pressed, Zoe relaxed and sighed as the smoke worked its magic.  Her new breasts heaved as she inhaled into her lungs.  Without any signs of struggle, Zoe smiled and exhaled a perfect cone of smoke out of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d Jake asked as he inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  I feel a lot calmer.  I like your cigarettes better.\u201d Zoe considered as she stared at the burning cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few drags, Zoe\u2019s posture relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I gonna do?\u201d Zoe asked, smoke punctuating her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am gonna help you\u2026after all I got you into this mess.\u201d Jake said, as a new plan formed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me.\" Jake insisted as he dragged again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake found his Dad in the yard, preparing for the BBQ later, for the scrutiny of his in-laws. Jake found that he had conflicting feelings towards his father; he had had a good relationship with him in his original memories, but also remembered the years of conflict in the new set of memories. Things like this were still disorienting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad, got a minute?\" he asked, his tone uncertain, halfway between conciliatory and hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Jake?\" asked his father without looking at him, speaking with a maddeningly dismissive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk to you about Zoe.\" said Jake, more steely now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, about how you corrupted her?\" came the sarcastic, unfair response. Jake felt tempted to take a swing at his Dad, but lit a cigarette to calm himself. This did not help matters. Edgar wrinkled his nose and continued:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly that. That filthy habit of yours. It's contagious. What's your next trick? Are you going to get Allison hooked too?\" he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe is 18. She's an adult.\" exhaled Jake, keeping his cool as best he could. \"Nobody made her do this, she chose it. You should respect her decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's so adult that she's made the dumbest decision she could have made. And I thought her head at least was screwed on straight. I don't have to respect stupid decisions, Jake. If somebody jumped off a building, I don't have to pretend that was a valid choice just because somebody chose it. So why should I respect Zoe's suicide method any more than that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCondescending prick, thought Jake. He'd initially considered just converting him to smoking too, but no, fuck this guy; why should he get to experience this feeling, he thought as he took another drag and felt a wave of calm spread out from his lungs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his opposition would be a pain in the ass, and that needed to be dealt with. Taking the X-39 in hand, Jake scrolled through his father's stats. He dialed his Confidence and Bravery down to 0, and his Compliance up to 100: not quite the slavery that came with the Obedience trait, but possibly crueler, since it left his will theoretically intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that now his father would be unable to threaten the dominance of the smokers of the house, Jake made one more spiteful alteration, going into \"Dislikes\" and moving \"Smoking\" from 73 to 100 strength. Now his Dad would despise smoking even more strongly but be utterly powerless to do anything to act on that dislike. It would be hell, thought Jake with a smirk as he aimed the remote and applied the new settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Dad looked momentarily confused, as seemed to be the pattern as alterations were made, and Jake exhaled a huge cloud of smoke directly into his face, causing him to cough. His displeasure clear, Edgar could not muster the will to say a word in protest, shaking in impotent rage instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe can smoke in the house, as can we all, and you won't utter one single fucking word, old man.\" said Jake menacingly, turning to walk back to the house. \"And don't forget to make sure there are plenty of ashtrays out here unless you want butts all over your precious lawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked towards the house, Jake noticed movement in the small patch of woodland at the yard's end, that he himself and Zoe had both used for their secret smoking. Curious, and worried, he made his way into the undergrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, crouching and watching him, was Jen. Jake groaned inwardly. He could see where this was going immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are doing here, Jen?\" he asked wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I came here to see you. Because I want to...\" she paused and looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to fuck me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right I want to fu... make love to you! I have to do whatever I want and I want to be with you. I'm a virgin, there's never been anyone else.\" she said, smiling shyly. You're half right, thought Jake, remembering the liason he had wiped from Jen's memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, uh... even if you don't want to make love to me, could you do me a favour? I smoked all the cigarettes you gave me, and I can't get any more. I got IDd: Sally didn't, but she only gave me one of hers and wouldn't share any more and I'd really like to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, just stop talking!\" spat Jake in exasperation, extending his pack to Jen. She took a cigarette with gratitude and lit up with her own lighter, flashing him her shy, sweet smile as she exhaled. Jake found that this unexpectedly turned him on; there was something about watching this girl, who would never have smoked willingly, smoking with the same mannerisms and sweet nature she had always had that was just as fascinating to him as the utter transformation Sarah had gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a flash of guilt (that he couldn't quite suppress) as he realised that he was interested in this girl too. He wasn't sure if he was just as attracted to her as he was to Sarah, or more, or less; what was certain is he was attracted to her. The thought crossed his mind that, with his absolute power now, he could have both girls if he wanted, he was sure there was some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jen shyly took another enthusiastic drag, watching him with a longing, Jake made a decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overcome with lust, giving into temptation, Jake lunged at Jen, and placed his lips on top of hers.  He stuck his tongue down her throat, and could taste her inhaled smoke from her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey embraced passionately, as he ran the fingers of his free hand up and down her spine.  Eventually, they parted to allow Jen to exhale the last of her smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Jen smiled at Jake while he took a quick drag from his cigarette to calm his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen returned the gesture with another drag from her own cigarette, noting how Jake's attention was now fully on her seductive act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she exhaled, Jake followed the cloud fly overhead into the sky. Jake couldn't help but be spellbound by the enchantress before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me.\" Jake urged, as he motioned Jen to follow him into the house.  Both ground out their cigarette butts on the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?  Where did she come from?\" Edgar asked as he set up the BBQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off!\" Jake shouted as he and Jen paced into the house towards his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Edgar felt he should punish Jake for his uncharacteristic outburst, he couldn't muster the assertiveness to exert his authority.  Instead, Edgar sighed, and returned to preparing the BBQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice room.\" Jen beamed as Jake closed the bedroom door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake considered his next actions as Jen stood smiling at him at the foot of his bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light up.\" Jake commanded as Jen complied, grabbing his pack and lighting up another Marlboro. As she took a deep drag, the smoke rose towards the ceiling, and Jake could feel a definitive stirring in his groin while she exhaled. Without doubt, Jake concluded that Mark must have had a secret smoking fetish, as he never got aroused by smoking before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jen could take a second inhale, Jake pounced on her, undressing her top and kissing her passionately.  As the embraced and frolicked on the bed, Jake felt animal instincts take over, and his lust was now fully blown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, the two friends lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling reflecting on their \"first encounter\".  Jake took two cigarettes from his pack, stuck them between his lips and fired them up.  Passing one to Jen, they inhaled simultaneously in silence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" Jen exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.\" Jake agreed as he took another drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait til we go exclusive.\" Jen said as she rubbed her free hand against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jake coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, we are meant to be.  Why hide it?\" Jen smiled as she inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah suddenly entered his thoughts, and a pang of guilt - Jake's original trait - briefly returned.  Jake sat up and removed the X39 from his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scanning the device over Jen as she lay and smoked, Jake made some alterations, in particular, increasing her Obedience to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen carefully, this was fun, I don't deny that.  However, we won't be going exclusive.  Never.  Sarah is my soulmate and I would never betray her.  However, you have shown me I could have some fun independently.  So, we might do this again, but you will never disclose this to anyone.  Do you understand?\" Jake commanded as he pressed the OK button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen nodded, as she smoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake found a section on her profile marked <b>Anxieties</b> and added a stipulation that she feared disappointing Jake in any way. Jen took one last drag of the cigarette, ground it out on a used dinner plate, and walked towards Jake, pecking him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret is safe with me, Jake.  It is fun but I can also be discreet.\" Jen reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kids, your grandparents will be here shortly.\" Jake could hear his mother shout from the foot of the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Jen, you gotta go.  I got to spend some quality time with the family.  See you at school.\" Jake said as Jen smiled innocently.  Before Jen left, she wrote down her mobile number on his notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything.  Until next time?\" Jen kissed him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"  Jake responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jen left the Miller household, Jake prepared for the arrival of his grandparents.  Lighting another cigarette, he considered the challenge they would face.  Like Dad, they were outspoken, and despised smokers.  Even though Dad would no longer openly challenge smoking in the household, the arrival of Dad's own parents could potentially act as a balance.  To make the forthcoming weekend tolerable, Jake knew he had to make further changes before and during their stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Jen's mobile number, Jake began noting ideas on his notepad while stealing glances at the X-39.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was work to do, he thought as he puffed deeply on his cigarette. </span></div></div>",

I know our sister and I know she'd never start smoking unless you did something to her to make her do it!\" she shouted. Jake sighed; Allison was actually less than one year younger than him, only one school year below. But it never felt like that. She still had a kid's black and white morality, and was prone to sulks and irrational rages, such as this one. Still, in other ways she was wise beyond her years and had a strange tendency towards sudden outbreaks of wisdom and thoughtfulness. He had been close to her before, in spite of her being sometimes a little bit too much. The current dynamic, though, was very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what in the fuck am I supposed to have done to her? Taped cigarettes to her mouth, held her nose until she inhaled? You can't force someone to smoke, retard.\" said Jake in a tone of mockery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison rolled her eyes. \"I don't know how you did it, but you did it. You did... something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I admit it. I did make this happen.\" said Jake, raising his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked triumphant. \"Aha! I knew it! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just made it look too cool to resist trying.\" he said, dragging. Allison rolled her eyes as he exhaled in her direction, before flinching away from the nearly spent cigarette thrust towards her face. \"Maybe you'd like to find out what the big deal is yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked furious and disgusted as she batted away the smoke and the cigarette alike. For a moment, she looked like she might storm out, but then she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try. You won't distract me like that, Jake. I know you've done something and I demand to know what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, Jake decided to try a double bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. You win. I have this remote. It's a magic remote.\" he said, producing the X-39 as he spoke. \"None of this is how it's supposed to be. I'm supposed to be this hopeless fucking nerd. You and I got Mom to quit smoking years ago; nobody in this house smoked until the last two days. Oh, and Zoe is really an athletic guy named Zach.\" he said in mock sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fully expected an infuriated, incredulous response, but to his surprise saw that Allison was deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As crazy as all that seems, I believe you.\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?!\" gasped Jake, open-mouthed. \"Why? Everything I just said is completely insane!\". Allison had always been oddly perceptive and strong willed, but surely she couldn't remember the other life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is, but everything just feels... wrong. I can kind of half remember having two brothers. I remember one kind, smart one I looked up to, and one who was kind of a dick. It just felt like you were both of them somehow. And none of my memories of Zoe seem quite real to me...\" her eyes suddenly widened \"and my god, Sarah! I feel like there's some sweet side to her that's just gone. Is it all your fault, for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake found himself feeling strangely sad, ashamed. It moved him to hear his sister speaking of him in positive terms, even as a half remembered shade. Who would say that about the new him? He looked at the floor, which Allison took as an affirmative response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, you have to set it all right. You can, can't you? So set it right!\" she implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was torn. Part of him wanted to. Part of him loved the power too much. The latter side won, barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I want to, sis.\" he said unsurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm telling Sarah what you just did with Jen.\" came the cold, blunt response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt his guts tighten. \"What?\" he asked, betraying his guilt as well as his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, she wasn't exactly quiet. I know what you just did.\" said Allison mockingly. \"And unless you put everything back, so will Sarah, very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rage built within Jake. She'd just found out the power he held, and she thought THREATS were a good idea. That wouldn't do. Bitch had to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake theatrically aimed the remote and started conspicuously applying settings. Allison looked nervous, but managed to remain assertive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do Jake, make me a smoker like Zoe? I'll resist, I'm not so weak minded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you could resist one or two things. But this won't be one or two, Ally. It'll be a cocktail. I'll make you into your own anti-thesis; you'll make me look like a saint. You'll be the dumbest, sluttiest, shallowest, druggiest girl in town, maybe the whole world. You'll smoke three packs a day, and when you can't get cigarettes you'll suck dicks for them. You'll reach ebbs so low that neither of us can imagine them, and you'll be too confused and addled to do anything about it. But like you say, you have a stronger will than most. Maybe you'll be strong enough to resist just enough to sometimes know how far you've fallen, how much you disgust yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was crying silently now. All the confidence was gone, and it was clear the fate that Jake had outlined terrified her. He'd found the perfect threat to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jake. No. Please.\" she begged quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then fuck off and don't breath one word about what happened today to Sarah. Or I promise I'll be as good as my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison backed out of the room in a panic, and Jake could soon hear her frantic footsteps and sobs as she ran away, utterly distraught. Part of him gloried in this, but some small part still felt ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wouldn't be enough, of course. He'd stopped her from ratting, almost definitely, but the bitch had to pay for the threat she'd made. He resolved to change Allison forever, but without ever once pointing the X-39 at her. No, not her, but lots of other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd make all her friends start smoking and trying adventurous new activities, for one thing. Not so conspicuously or as instantaneously as usual; he'd just subtly nudge their traits towards it, make one or two recent secret smokers. Nothing so far removed from normal teenage experimentation that Allison would know that it wasn't exactly that. Of course, she'd still be just as sanctimonious about it all at first, but not to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as all her friends changed around her, let's see how well the little bitch handled good old fashioned peer pressure. She'd either eventually cave or end up totally alone and miserable. Either outcome was fine by him, thought Jake with a savage grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could start today at the BBQ in fact: Allison was allowed to have her \"boyfriend\" Charlie over. He was among the most boring people Jake had ever met, and he'd formed that opinion as the old Jake. Which was probably why he was invited, along with Allison's best friend Lisa and Zoe's \"special friend\" Emily (she had been Zach's girlfriend, for sure, but now there were only unsubstantiated rumours that her very close friendship with Zoe was a little... sapphic), while Sarah wasn't. Sarah just wasn't the kind of friend Jesus would pick, after all, thought Jake angrily. God, he hated this fucking family sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the distraction passed, Jake returned to his earlier planning. Even with the new sideshow with Allison, which would take some time to bear fruit, he could expect immediate satisfaction here. He twirled the X-39 happily and smiled a cold smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since Allison's encounter with Jake, she struggled to process the new reality she was a part of.  Looking around the home, the signs of change were all around, from Martha unapologetic smoking behaviour to Edgar's subdued personality.  As she watched Zoe light up another cigarette with her mother, Allison frowned at the \"possibility\" she was looking at her older brother in another reality.  If Jake's story was true, then he truly was dangerous.  She vowed not to become part of his game, and was adamant she would find a way of restoring the natural order within the Miller household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar called a \"family briefing\" later that day.  Prior to Edgar's transformation, the \"family briefings\" took the form of a one-dimensional tirade, threatening repercussions if the family unit didn't behave in front of guests.  In these days, no-one would dare challenge Edgar's authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Martha, Zoe and Jake all smoked around him, creating a dense fog of cigarette smoke, Edgar begged the family members not to refrain from smoking in front of his own parents during their stay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really have to smoke, please do it in private.  They will go berserk if they find you all smoke.\" Edgar pleaded with the smokers.  Allison just shook her head in disarray while the rest puffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but we will do it for you, just to keep the peace.\" Martha responded, with a powerful puff on her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, last drags then we need to clean up before your grandparents arrive.\" Martha ordered her fellow smokers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Edgar tended to the barbeque, Martha and the children hid all evidence of smoking within the house, removing all ashtrays, packs and lighters, overloading each room with air freshener. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake was helping Zoe in the dining room polishing, Allison snuck back upstairs and into Jake's room.  She soon pocketed the device and text her best friend Lisa to meet her away from the house and compose a plan to reverse Jake's changes.  After the text was sent, she returned to help clean in the kitchen, hiding the remote in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuests started arriving, with grandparents Jacob and Betty the main guests.  Margaret and Trevor, the neighbours, also invited, joined the Millers for the barbeque.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom, how was your trip?\" Edgar hugged them while Martha took their coats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could spark up.  Cravings are killing me.\" Zoe confessed to Jake as they looked after the barbeque in the back garden.  Jake nodded in agreement, feeling the urge to light up intensify with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake wanted to make sure all guests had arrived before retrieving the X39 and making further changes.  Soon Jacob and Betty joined them out the back at the BBQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my grandson?\" Betty asked as she hugged Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake noted they hugged Zoe as if they always had another granddaughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.  We are outta milk.  I will go and get some.\" Allison lied as she felt the time was right to plot her escape with the X39.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked towards the front door, she checked her phone to see if Lisa had replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C u soon.\" the message read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Allison walked outside, she walked right into another guest, causing her to fall backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you doing with this?  Does Jake know you have the X-39?\" Sarah stood over Allison, as she picked up the X39 which fell out of Allison's pocket.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison struggled to respond, Sarah considered her options...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake sat in the garden scowling at nothing in particular. He needed a cigarette badly and was beginning to feel a directionless misanthropy towards the world in general. He couldn't wait until he could go get the X-39 and unleash some more hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Sunshine is taking a long time with that milk, isn't she?\" enquired Betty. Jake's Grandparents always called Allison their sunshine; they saw her as perfect and spoiled her. Probably where that bratty, sanctimonious self confidence came from, thought Jake furiously. It did occur to him that his sister WAS taking a long time, though: part of him worried that she'd decided to take her chances and told Sarah about Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he had a strange feeling, like deja vu or lightheadedness, as though something wasn't quite right. A disturbance in the force, thought Jake, then immediately hated himself for the lameness of his silent reference. It soon passed, however, and everything seemed normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to pass slowly for Jake, and after another 5 minutes that felt like days he felt ready to scream. Suddenly he was aware of murmurs of disapproval from his grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching across the lawn was Sarah, accompanied by his little sister. Jake momentarily felt like he didn't recognise her, but that was absurd; she was definitely the same Allison as ever. Wearing vivid purple lipstick and a look of sullen dislike, her hair dyed jet black and her tight leather skirt ending well above her knee, it would already be clear that she was seeking to shock and offend even if she hadn't picked her most offensive band t-shirt and tied it open above her clearly pregnant belly. She made Sarah look tame in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down while every guest watched her with disapproval, Allison sat staring nonchalantly at her phone, sending texts. She did not engage with or look at anyone, and soon conversation began to awkardly pick up around her, as though everyone present was trying to pretend she wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I have\" whispered Sarah to Jake, showing him the X-39.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get that?!\" gasped Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison had it? Fuck, even I'M glad you got it back from her. I can't imagine what she'd have done with it.\" said Jake, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt a little confused by that statement for a second, then realised that for Jake, this Allison was the only Allison that had existed. Whatever had gone on between them today, he had no memory of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you remember what Allison was like before we changed our lives?\" she asked Jake, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was fucking terrifying! I can kind of relate to her now, but before I felt like puberty had replaced my little sister with some sort of demon; the way she changed so completely overnight. It was only a matter of time until she got in her current situation.\" he said, pointing towards his sister's swollen stomach. \"Why do you ask?\" he added, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just curious. It's hard to keep everything straight now everything keeps changing.\" she smiled. In fact, she'd frogmarched Allison to the store to equip her new recruit, refining her attributes the whole way. The pregnancy was pure luck, though; they'd passed a pregnant woman, and Sarah had recalled Allison's lectures about consequences and chuckled. She'd already dialled up her hedonism and promiscuity, so why not prove her right about those choices inevitably leading to bad outcomes using the Copy/Paste function?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another silence descended. Allison had taken out some cigarette papers and rolling tobacco, and was making herself a cigarette in silence. All eyes were on her, but nobody dared speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought not be smoking, young lady!\" said Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not smoking, I'm just rolling a cigarette.\" said Allison sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get smart with me! Not only are you too young, but the baby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The baby is a big reason why I'm smoking so much lately. Health warnings promise me that it reduces birth weight, and I don't want my vagina wrecking too badly; it's my favourite thing.\" interrupted Allison in a matter of fact tone. There were gasps of shock, and a deeper tension descended on all present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a monster.\" said Betty finally. \"Just the worst person I've ever known. I can't believe you're my granddaughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it either. I'm pretty sure somebody less lame just left me in the bushes, most of the time.\" spat Allison dismissively, rising as she did. \"Well, this has been fucking miserable, like always. I'm off to smoke my cigarette in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison drew further away, the tension began to lift and a nervous chattering returned. Jake smiled at Sarah; both had found that display to be awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, babe, give me the X-39. We can make that shit look dull by comparison.\" grinned Jake, keen to enact his plans at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at Jake; she was torn between curiosity about what he would do next and an unwillingness to relinquish the X-39 and the power it gave her. Why should he have all the fun, when her creation had made the biggest scene so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn an empty playground, the pregnant Allison walked uncomfortably across to the swings and took a seat. Taking out the cigarette she had rolled earlier, she lit it with her Zippo and took a deep drag. Holding in the strong, heavy smoke, Ally felt feelings of bliss before finally, reluctantly exhaling from her nose. After taking a second drag, she looked at the cigarette between her fingers and thought of her history with these beautiful things as she exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered meeting a friend in the summer before high school who convinced her to take that fateful first drag, that showed her how wrong she'd always been. She remembered the new friends her habit had led her to fall in with when school started, and how all her old ones had fallen away. She remembered parties, sex,a whole new life and whole new outlook. And the party ending with a positive pregnancy test, nobody letting her smoke and drink in peace since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she took another drag, frowning, she reminded herself that none of it had been real, that this was only her first cigarette ever. Her original memories had stayed in place, as she willed, but it was very hard to resist. She had to admit it was hard to keep straight what was real, and her memories of sex and debauchery did hold a certain base appeal to boot. And she loved this cigarette; she had to fight to feel disgusted by that fact. Had Jake enacted his threat, it doubtless would have been impossible to resist her new reality, but with fewer changes, she was managing. Maybe if Sarah hadn't gone too far and made her a teen mother, a fate she abhorred in either form, new or old, Allison might have just given in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she could resist Jake without arousing his suspicion. She had felt awful about being this way in front of her grandparents, who adored her real self; that was why, as much as she needed to smoke, she had gone out of her way to not do it in front of them. And she had hopefully made an ally, even though the text chain had been an awkward and disbelieving one; a long lost best friend from years ago who had still been her best friend earlier today. She had arranged this meeting, and now Allison could only hope that Lisa would come and help her plan. Grinding out her cigarette, Allison immediately began to nervously roll another, and waited...</span></div></div>",

As the smoke whispered around her, she could see someone emerge from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa!\" Allison smiled as she stood up, minding the bump she was now carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair hugged awkwardly, as Lisa barely recognised her former best friend.  After Sarah's changes, the reality had shifted.  Now, Lisa and Allison had drifted apart years before, as Allison was a thrillseeker, and drawn to a bad crowd.  Together, they were infamous for trying everything, from drinking to drugs, and everything in between.   They both sat down on the brick wall, facing the deserted school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as Allison puffed on her cigarette, Lisa could barely take her eyes away from the pot belly sticking out from Allison's tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been?  Two years?\"  Lisa joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just yesterday, actually.\" Allison corrected as she inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than challenge, Lisa listened intently as Allison recapped the events over the last two days, emanating with Jake finding the X-39, and using it on his family, and concluding with her own transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not me, Lisa.  I need you to believe me.\" Allison begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that wacky baccy you are on?  Am I being Punk'd?\" Lisa joked in disbelief.  She found Allison's story unbelievable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true, my mind is completely clear. Can't say the same about my body though.\" Allison felt her stomach bump, carrying child, feeling their kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta be honest, Ally, I'm struggling to get my head around this.\" Lisa confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember us meeting yesterday after school to talk?  You were teasing me about Charlie.  Does that ring a bell?\" Allison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Lisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you remember about yesterday?\" Allison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat and thought for a moment.  Allison could see her friend struggle to recall events just 24 hours previously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can prove it.  You say we haven't spoken in years.  I can tell you a secret you told me just the other day.  Something no-one outside your family know about, apart from me.\" Allison suggested as she took another inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lisa shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me last week about your crush on Derek in Maths class.  I told you to go for it as I know he is single.\" Allison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...?\" Lisa gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you.  Why the hell would you come to meet me without hesitation today, if we haven't spoken in years?  None of this was real.  Sarah made it so.\"  Allison explained as she dragged one last time on the cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa placed her hand on Allison's bump, and could feel the child's kicking. This <i>felt</i> real, Lisa considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lisa, have I convinced you yet?  What else do you need?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I guess.  So what now?\" Lisa responded, as she continued to imagine a life-altering device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get the device back from Jake and Sarah.  I can only imagine the havoc they are causing with it.  But I need your assistance.  I have a plan, and think I could use my current predicament to my advantage.\" Allison said, gently stroking her stomach carrying the unborn child.</span></div></div>",

So far, it seems like Sarah is mostly just loving the power, and she'll do whatever crosses her mind with no worries about subtlety or creativity, just as long as she gets to be boss. Jake though; it seems like he's already almost bored of that. Like he's got to the point that it needs to be this whole byzantine web to entertain him at all anymore\" she involuntarily shuddered at the memory of his earlier threat as she put her cigarette in her mouth. \"I'm not sure which one is more dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of her old friend lighting up yet again while heavily pregnant made Lisa feel uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to do that so much?\" she said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" came the curt response, followed by a more civil afterthought: \"Sorry, but yes.

The first drag was relief having abstained during the visit of Jacob and Betty, and Martha followed the drag with others in quick succession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar could see Jake and Zoe sneak puffs off their mother's cigarette while he drove down the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you smoke with your daughter here about to give birth?

She grinned involuntarily at the thought that she'd get her best friend back: she'd never really replaced Allison with anyone else. Finally, she reached the jacket and picked it up. She was reaching for the pocket when she heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what do you think you're doing, young lady?\" asked Betty, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa froze and turned. She had to think fast to come up with an excuse. Unfortunately, panic stalled her, and she could only stand with her jaw slack. Some small measure of recognition crossed Betty's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, perfect! Lisa knew exactly what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have met, I'm a friend of Allison's! She told me her brother had forgot his coat so I should bring it to her at the hospital!\" she announced, a little too triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't born yesterday. I think I did see you with Allison before, but it was years ago. The old Allison. I know who my granddaughter is now, and I can tell by looking at you that you're no friend of hers.\" said Betty, icily, as Lisa's face dropped. \"and I'm supposed to believe that in the middle of the agony of childbirth, she noticed that her brother didn't have his jacket and sent you a text about it? And my grandson found it necessary to also call me and request I collect it in spite of that? No. I don't know what you're after and I don't care. Just give me the jacket and be on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed. She'd been caught out. But wait... she had the X-39! All she had to do was use it on this woman. Her expression hardened, and she reached towards the pocket... but it was no use. She couldn't do it. She couldn't use the instrument of all this chaos, even if it was to fix it. She had to keep the high ground. Deflated, she handed over the jacket, remote and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now be on your way before I call the police, and we'll forget this ever happened.\" said Betty evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at the hospital, Allison stepped out of the front doors and immediately lit a cigarette, drawing many disapproving gazes. She didn't care; she'd been gasping, and it was heavenly. As she watched her exhale dissipate, she felt a pang of sadness that soon she wouldn't smoke anymore. She understood it better now, and almost wondered if she might start again, or even just keep the elevated hedonism and addictions when she put everything else back. It'd be nice to have a celebratory drink or twelve when there was no more baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! That was the corruption subtly overriding her will. She knew that. She was glad she would soon be free, because eventually it might still win, otherwise. She looked at Lisa's message again and grinned, taking another drag as she did. Lisa had it in the bag! Soon all would be well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison heard the click of another lighter, and turned to see her brother lighting up at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy night, huh, sis?\" he said sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Can't believe it wasn't the real deal.\" she said with a twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did the white coat in there say it was? Braxy-Hiss contractions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braxton-Hicks. I think it just means 'fake'\" she laughed. She realised that she was breaking character a fraction of a second too late, and saw her brother's eyes narrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem, like, all that surprised, though.\" he said, with a hint of suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I was just too busy being relieved that I didn't have to push a baby out of my pussy today after all.\" she said with a lopsided grin, hoping the vulgarity restored the facade completely. Her brother did let out a snort of laughter, and she relaxed inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny story though; did you know I left my jacket at home?\" said Jake innocently. Allison stared at him in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck do you mean? You're wearing your jacket.\" she said, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had Grandma bring it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so special about a dumb jacket? Didn't think fashion was such a big deal to you.\" she said dismissively, exhaling smoke mid-speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's a really good jacket! Seriously, Grandma told me that she even caught some asian chick trying to steal it. Said she was a friend of yours and you'd texted her to ask her to get it. That was kind of you, sis. But wait... you didn't know I left it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison stared at him, trying to keep a poker face. She knew she was smarter than him. She knew she was a good enough liar to get out of this. But she also hated him, wanted to gloat. He didn't have the X-39 anymore, and he couldn't do anything. So why should she lie? Far better to tell him how dumb and beaten he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, an alarm bell was ringing, but her impulsive side was driving her toward striking. The old, cautious Allison, though, was trying to puzzle this out. She opened her mouth...</span></div></div>",

That is twice you have now tried to steal the X39.\" Jake declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a shit liar, Ally.  No bullshit, what do you want with the device?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be pregnant!  I don't wanna smoke! You changed me out of spite!

We are not monsters, ya know.\" Jake smiled as Allison struggled with the physical adjustments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the device from his jacket, he sneered at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake punched settings into the device, Allison could feel pain shoot through her stomach.  The baby was without doubt kicking, and making her feel nauseous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...\"  Allison begged as she could feel her unborn baby grow inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I can progress your pregnancy to any period.  Do you want to go back to how you were?\" Jake teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Allison clutched her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will drop your attitude towards us as of immediately.  You wont oppose anything I choose to do with the X39.  I want your word you will accept everything as it is from now on.  Agree and I will change you back.\" Jake demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was unbearable - the contraptions now intense as Jake had advanced her pregnant state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK you win.  Please stop this!\" Allison pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep puff, Jake pointed the device at Allison and started customizing the physical and mental attributes added previously.  Before their eyes, they could see Allison change;  The baby bump receded slowly into a flat stomach, her dyed jet-black hair returned to its auburn color, the purple lipstick also disappeared.  Her clothing attire also changed, from short tartan skirt to her conventional trousers, and white blouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked back at her reflection in a hospital window and smiled in relief.  No longer carrying a baby, she saw her appearance had reverted before she was changed.  However, she still felt something inside lingering, unchanged from her metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember our agreement, Ally - if you plot against me, I can easily turn you back into teen mother, or worse.\" Jake warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right kids, let's go!\" Martha declared as they piled into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they hit the highway, they family, with exception of Allison and Jake, had no recollection of why they had just been at hospital.  Collective amnesia, Jake smiled as he took out his cigarettes, desperate for another fix. Offering the pack around the passengers, they all accepted, with exception of Allison.  As each lit up, the smoke tickled her senses, and the lingering sensation raged within her.  Without thinking, she found herself inhaling the secondhand smoke as Martha, Zoe and Jake all smoked around her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want one?\" Jake teased as he offered to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I don't smoke.\" Allison replied, fighting the urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when?\" Martha laughed as she dragged, thinking Allison had smoked for as long as Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cravings raged, Allison gave in, taking a Marlboro from her brother and placing between her lips.  She accepted the light and sucked deeply, her eyes closing as the smoke worked its magic into her body.  After a few moments, she removed the cigarette and exhaled casually - at least it wasn't the rollups she was smoking, she considered as she took another drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar coughed as he fanned the smoke out the driver seat window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling empowered by his victory over Allison, Jake pointed the device at the back of Martha and copied her addiction and devotion to smoking.  Thereafter, he pointed the device to the back of Edgar's head and Pasted the attribute into his father.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell, doesn't the driver get a smoke?\" Edgar moaned suddenly, as the attribute kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey.\" Martha smiled as she removed her pack of Salems and placed a filter between Edgar's lips.  Lighting up her husband, Martha took a deep drag off her cigarette while he sucked deeply the smoke into his virgin lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been gasping for ages!\" Edgar declared, as he took another powerful pump from the cigarette.  Allison frowned at Jake for turning her father into a smoker, while nursing her own cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miller car sped down the highway, leaving a trail of cigarette smoke in its wake as the family now shared a mutual bond and love of tobacco.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everybody smoked now, including her, and she'd lost the element of surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at the sight of the pack of Marlboro in her hand; somehow smoking seemed so much worse now she was fully herself again. She wasn't sure if it was the loss of the enhanced hedonism trait or just that wearing her own clothes, having her old life mostly back, simply stripped away the insulating, dream-like haze that had made it seem less bad when she was pregnant and fighting against her personal corruption. On the whole though, effects of smoking aside, she felt so much better physically. She had never drank, and her virginity was restored. She found she couldn't even remember the backstory memories of her corrupted self, only the things that had actually happened to her while in that form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs wrong as it felt, she'd taken the cigarettes and the lighter though. She remembered Jake gloating \"You'll be needing these\". She remembered hating him so much. But she had also known he was right, and had taken them with a feeling of shame and resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she hadn't actually smoked. The cravings had been clawing at her soul for hours now, but she hadn't given in. She opened the pack and saw the 20 brown filters; her heart skipped in anticipation, knowing that all her anxiety could go away with one quick flick of the lighter in her other hand. Sobbing, she snapped the pack back shut, unwilling to give in. At least, not just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard approaching footsteps, and began to feel nervous, twitchy. She turned and saw Lisa approaching, and sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this all about, Al?\" said Lisa, clearly confused. Her friend sighed. This was complicated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think Lisa, don't you know?\" pleaded Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... sort of do. I feel like something weird happened today. But I don't remember what, I just have a bunch of confused images in my head.\" replied Lisa sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What images? Come on, Lisa.\" encouraged Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... remember you being pregnant, and a burnout, and that we weren't friends anymore... but we always have been! And I remember some kind of magic remote... Did someone drug us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Lisa, it's all real. Jake has a magic remote. He changed me and the world changed around that. But then he changed me back, mostly, and that's why you remember the truth now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused, trying to digest this baffling information. She looked frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do we still have to stop him? If he changed you back, maybe that's our cue to leave him to it?\" came her eventual, cautious statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison leapt to her feet, and started pacing angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you say that! No matter what he threatens us with, we have a moral duty to stop him! It'll take more effort now, more guile to be sure, but we still have to try! He can't be left to run amok! He can't be allowed to control everyone, just corrupting the entire world on a whim! He's already made my entire family smoke, which is such a filthy habit, and who knows where he'll stop, if we don't put a stop to this ourselves!\" ranted Allison. She felt better now, less tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Allison... if smoking is so awful to you, why are you smoking?\" said a puzzled Lisa after a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison took a drag and frowned. She had been so distracted, so stressed, that her body had gone into autopilot. She'd lit up as she spoke without even noticed, taken two drags, talked before exhaling. None of that had registered consciously, so natural was it. She exhaled, and began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa... everything is back to normal now. We've been friends forever. I'm ME. Why do I smoke? Why did I start? There's no backstory it fits into anymore, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked puzzled. \"But... you've smoked for years. Nobody but me and your family know about it really, because you're so embarrassed about it and you're right, it doesn't fit your image, but you do smoke. I guess it is a little odd, and I admit it was weird to me at first but... you know, your whole family does, and so I guess it just made sense that you would too.\" said Lisa apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison smiled. \"No, this is a good sign. That logic is so weak; maybe when the changes are hard to rationalise, the effect of the X-39 on reality is weaker? That would explain why you can kind of remember the other me; this trait belongs to that form, only really make sense there, so it echoes. Maybe if we can create enough inconsistencies, that could end this somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't convinced. \"How would that end this? It'd make everyone confused, sure, but past that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison took an enthusiastic drag on her cigarette, and visibly relaxed. She sighed with pleasure as she exhaled, and Lisa had to admit to herself that at times like this her friend made smoking seem appealing; she banished the thought that it made her a little curious from her head before it even took conscious form, and Allison opened her eyes and spoke again, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly how yet, but I think I'm on to something. It means taking a different tack, though: instead of openly acting against Jake, stealing the X-39 or whatever, I'm going to have to pretend to be on his side. Manipulate him into overextending himself.\" Allison dropped her cigarette and crushed it out, letting out a huge, satisfied exhale as she did. \"So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought about the question. It seemed to her that there was a big risk of being corrupted in the same way Jake had been by this, but this was Allison; if anyone could resist temptation, it was her. Part of her wanted to just stay out of the way of all this. On the whole, though, the plan seemed good. She gave her reply.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison soon returned home, opening the door to the Miller household.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first reaction was to the stale smell of cigarette smoke permeating the atmosphere.  Debate could be heard in the living room next door.  As she creeped past the door, she could see her mother and father arguing with Betty and Jacob over smoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long you been smoking behind our back?\" Betty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done it for years!\" Edgar groaned, taking a puff of his cigarette to exclaim the point.  Since Jake turned him into a smoker, reality shifted to accept his new habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty and Jacob shook their heads as Edgar explained how he kept his smoking habit secret from them for years, out of shame.  Contrary to the old reality where Edgar tried to get Martha to quit smoking, the new version was Martha seduced Edgar into taking up the habit when they first met.  Martha supported her husband as he chain-smoked in front of his parents for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I could be treated as an adult, for once.  It is our house, after all.  You will just have to respect our decision to partake, and we will respect your space while you are here.\" Edgar continued, as he lit up Martha's cigarette to the bewilderment of his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The X39 is very powerful</i>, Allison thought as she continued upstairs to begin part of her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison tapped her brother's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you want?\" Jake asked as he saw his sister stand nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A truce.  Can we talk?\" Allison pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Allison sat on Jake's bed, she took out her Marlboros and offered the pack to her brother.  Jake accepted, placing the filter between his lips before lighting up with his zippo.  Allison followed suit, taking a deep drag off her cigarette.  While her plan to intercept Jake's device was still in effect, she couldn't deny the joy that smoking was giving her.  Even with undoing the corruption thus far, she struggled to comprehend returning to her life as a non-smoker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have to be quick, I got Jen coming over soon.\" Jake exhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than comment on his infidelity, Allison took another puff off her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to apologize for trying to steal the X39 from you.  I was misguided.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot mentioning the <b>two</b> attempts made to rob me off the device.  Why should I trust you ever again?\" Jake asked as he inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my brother, I love you, and I don't want us to fight amongst each other as it is.  Family is very important, and its important we keep a close bond.\" Allison lied while exhaling towards the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering his sister the makeshift ashtray to de-ash, Allison continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of fighting you over the X39, I want to learn more about it.  In hindsight, I'm curious to see how the tool works in real-time.  Would you allow me to work with you?\" Allison asked as she exhaled a cloud of smoke towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I trust you?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith?\" Allison blew another cloud of smoke towards her brother, provoking a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith doesn't cut the mustard.  However, a test would.\" Jake replied as he returned the gift - a cloud of smoke aimed at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am thinking a challenge would be in order.  Pass the challenge and I will let you in.\" Jake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I have to do?\" Allison asked, exhaling yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cigarette dangling, Jake pressed buttons on the X39.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have set up the X39 to make changes.  All you have to do is approach the target, or targets, and <b>Apply</b>.  No questions asked, no tampering.  I will be with you during the challenge.\" Jake explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the target?\" Allison queried  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I've always hated the smell, but now I like it.\" She brought the cigarette to her lips and took a deep drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exhaled directly into his face, making him cough. \"I should be.

Early twenties, nicely curved and all made-up to impress her guy.  He had heard rumours about her, a taste for older men and rather slutty about it too. Wearing a clingy shirt and skin-tight skirt, she did look trampy. He wondered what those brightly colored lips tasted like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned towards the livingroom, where her mother was lounging in front of the TV. Wearing joga-pants and a tank-top, she was enjoying a quick smoke-break from doing the laundry. An overflowing basket of dirty clothes next to her.</span></div></div>",

Then, there was a group of about a dozen guys playing volleyball. In classic 'shirts vs skins' tradition, one team was wearing t-shirts over their trunks, while the other team sported bare chests. Finally, there was a group of college students lounging around in beach chairs and on blankets.

Their personalities hadn't changed, though, so at first the woman remained asleep while the dog continued to play Frisbee with her husband and kids. Soon, though, the father announced that he was done with the game. As they returned to their seats, the son suggested to his father, 'Hey dad, I think I'm gonna go wake Susan up and take her for a walk. The vet did say she needed some exercise.' After he left, the father turned to his new canine wife. 'Aah, there they go, dear. The kids sure do love Susan, don't they? I'm glad we rescued her from the pound.

Is she pure bred\u201d Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so, but my father would know for sure. I know she\u2019s a rescue, but I think she had papers. Her owner died and his family couldn\u2019t take care of her, so they had no choice but to put her up for adoption. Luckily, we got to her before anything happened. She\u2019s a really good dog.\u201d Tommy relayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy she found a good home. Do you know if she was fixed, is there any way we could find out, and if she has papers. I\u2019m looking to breed Shepards\u2019 and want to have mine studded out. He\u2019s got champion bloodlines.\u201d Bill explained, \u201cI saw you walking yours and just had to find out. She\u2019s got great muscle tone and a beautiful coat\u201d, as he rubbed Susan behind her ears, and belly. Susan immediately turned submissive, rolling onto her back and spreading her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good girl\u2026 What\u2019s her name, again?\u201d Bill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan\u201d Tommy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill got down into the sand and started rubbing Susan vigorously from her face, down her torso to her crotch. Susan pawed at Bill, as she barked her approval in a playful manner. This went on for several moments, until Bill got back on his feet. Susan turned back over, getting onto all fours. \u201cMy family is back this way, if you want to talk to my father\u201d Tommy motioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most other people will not even realize you have it, and those that do realize <br>\r\nwill not be able to take it from you or use it in any fashion.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo operate: First, use the touchpad to select the attribute you wish to alter. Four default <br>\r\noptions are provided; additionally, you may select the attribute from a list, or enter it <br>\r\nmanually. Next, aim the Attribute Alterator at the target and press the button corresponding <br>\r\nto the desired alteration. If Gender was chosen, the change will happen immediately. If Swap <br>\r\nor Copy/Paste were chosen, time will freeze until you choose a second target. (As a <br>\r\nfailsafe, time will unfreeze and the first target will be unselected if no second target is <br>\r\nchosen within five minutes of subjective time.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlterations<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender- Changes the gender associated with the selected attribute from female to male, or <br>\r\nfrom male to female. (For information on this function's interaction with transgendered, <br>\r\nneuter, or intersexed targets, please see Appendix G-6.)<br>\r\nSwap- Exchanges the selected attribute between the two targets.<br>\r\nCopy/Paste- Like Swap, but only one-way. Changes the second target's attribute to match the <br>\r\ncorresponding one of the first target. As a new feature in the X-39 model, the overwritten <br>\r\nattribute is stored in the Attribute Alterator for easy retrieval, as well as to enable <br>\r\n'chains' of copied attributes. The attribute belonging to the first target is not stored; if <br>\r\nyou wish to make a second copy, you must retarget the attribute's source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttributes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody- The physical form of the target.<br>\r\nClothes- The attire of the target. The alteration also applies to apparel belonging to the <br>\r\ntarget but not currently worn. By default, accessories like jewelery and make up are <br>\r\nincluded; to change this setting, see Appendix B-12. <br>\r\nMind- The mentality of the target. This includes things like personality, knowledge, <br>\r\nbehavior, etc. If the user is a target, the alteration will take the form of a noninvasive <br>\r\nmental overlay.<br>\r\nLife- The target's role in life. If Swap was chosen, each target will live the life of the <br>\r\nother, and be treated appropriately by others. The targets' first names will not change, but <br>\r\ntheir last names will. If Gender was chosen, others will treat the target appropriately for <br>\r\ntheir new gender, and the target's first name will change. If the user is a target, a <br>\r\nnoninvasive mental overlay will be provided to allow the user to act appropriately for their <br>\r\nnew role. Note that only others' treatment of the target will be affected; no physical or <br>\r\nmental alterations to the target will be made. (See Appendix D-9 for more information.)<br>\r\nOther- Specific parts of attributes may also be altered, as well as any number of attributes <br>\r\nnot listed above. This includes things like age, relation to another person, job, etc. To <br>\r\nselect one of these, choose the 'Other' option on the touchscreen.
