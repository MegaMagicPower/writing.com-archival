            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matthew was walking home from school, talking on his phone with his friend Rachelle. He was an average looking guy, shoulder length brown hair that was a strange cross between wavy and curly hair. He was tall, a little over 6'2\". He had blue-gray eyes and a slightly deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Matthew was walking up his driveway and towards the garage of the house. <i>Oh crap! I need to chat with Sydney!</i> Matthew screamed inside head as the revelation came across him. Looking down at his watch, it read 4:15. Crap! He was supposed to be talking with her right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rachelle, gotta go. I was supposed to be talking with Sydney already.\" They both exchanged goodbyes before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew quickly ran up to his room, barely avoiding running into walls and furniture as he furiously typed across his phones keyboard to let Sydney know he was going to get on soon. He had only just sent the message, which was stuffed full of profuse apologies, when he arrived at his bedroom at last. Scanning his room for his laptop, Matthew finally found it on his bed. Matthew jumped, lunging for what would be his savior. Matthew was quick to start up the modern age piece of technology, but as it was turning on, Matthew nearly died right there and then. <i>Oh noooo! I still need to get a new video chat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days before, Matthew was happily video chatting with his best bud Jasper when Skype, the universal video chat program, decided to epically crash the party, if you know what I mean. All in all, Matthew was tired of shit like that happening, and vowed to himself that it would never happen again. Of course, being the procrastinator that he is, Matthew had yet to find another way of video chatting, thus leaving him in this precarious situation that he was in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, no big deal,\" Matthew consoled himself. \"I'll just text Sydney, and tell her that I need I found a note saying I needed to go visit dad at work. I'll say it's for a, umm, a company meet-and-greet, and that he wants me to be there. Yeah, that'll work.\" And so Matthew did just that. Thankfully Sydney was, to Matthew's relief, understanding. Incredibly annoyed, but understanding. They could work later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did, however, mean that Matthew was free for the rest of the afternoon. It was Friday, so he would save his homework for Sunday, as he always did. There was one thing that Matthew would do and that was find a new video chat program. He would need it for later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew began his search across the internet. There were big ones, like FaceTime, but Matthew wasn't really going for those. He suspected them of being the same as Skype. Not to long after, though, did Matthew come across one that he had never heard of. RC Talk was what it was called. The website talked about how it was more for using it's wide variety of effects to make the chat fun than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew downloaded it, thinking it could be worth a try. Now the only thing to do was to call someone and talk them into getting it as well, but who? There was Rachelle, or Jasper. He could try risking it with Sydney, and tell her that he was able to get out of the thing with his dad. There was his neighbor Daniel, who was also working on a project with Matthew. Or his other neighbor Shaun, if he really got desperate for something to do.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long before the two of them were both online talking with one another. They had started off talking about the project for the class they had together, History, but it didn't take long before the two were discussing the different effects. Both were trying them out, there was the basics, like spinning the camera feed, or adding something in the background. It was all fun and games, but the two got bored of that pretty quickly as well.The two were just about to sign off when Matthew noticed something next to the Effects tab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hold on. What's this?\" Matthew clicked on the new tab, causing a window to open up next to the image of Daniel, who was looking at Matthew with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new window was entirely white, with only two things written on it. On the top half was the word Self, and the bottom half O-Self. Matthew clicked on Self and a bunch of pictures popped up in yet another window. There were rows upon rows of different symbols on the page, none of which were labeled. Each and everyone of them were different from the others. There were a few that Matthew easily recognized, such as a heart or an A with a curved line coming out the back. Most however, he wasn't  completely sure about. One reminded Matthew of the body of a well-endowed woman, another an extremely fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew cocked his head slightly as he read the title of the window. Perma-Effects: Selfs, it said. \"I don't know. Going by the title, I guess it's just more of the effects from earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Click on one.\" Daniel told him, his curiosity rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew nodded his head before clicking on a random effect on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one did Matthew pick?</span></div></div>",

What is it?\" Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you want us to just be friends, but ... will you go out with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was shocked.  \"You ... you're gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  I didn't mean to come out of the closet like this, but I love you and I want you to know that.\"  Reality had changed, making it so that Matthew was a closeted gay boy.  He didn't remember anything from the previous reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew.  This is really weird.  I ... I'm straight.  I'm into girls.  Uh, sorry.\"  He really wasn't sure what to say.  All this time one of his closest friends was gay?  Thinking back, he supposed that there were some telltale signs, like the fact that Matthew never had a girlfriend, but he just figured that he hadn't found the right girl yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew's heart sank.

The only problem was, he needed a new program to do so. After a little bit of searching the internet, he finally found RC Talk. What he doesn't know is that \"RC\" stands for Reality Change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll transformations are allowed, but as a default on RC Talk I'm implying that reality will change so that no one, not even the changed person, is aware of what has happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll changes are based off effects that are available for the chatters to use. There are some effects, known just as Effects, that do nothing to either person. There are also the Perma-Effects, that do effect the people. There will be two kinds of Perma-Effects: Selfs and O-Selfs. \"Selfs\" affect the person using them, and O-Selfs affect the person the user is chatting with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\">RULES</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Descriptive lemons~ Sex is fine, just don't go into detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Indiscriminate Murder/Death~ People can be killed off, but have an actual reason, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Plot~ Keep the story on track. It's fine if you put in a big plot changer, but don't randomly have the character be in one place in one chapter then another in the next without reason.
