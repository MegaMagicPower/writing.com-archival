Your girlfriend is the real star of this story, so you don't need much of a description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who is your girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sarah: A sexy 18 year old girl. She is fairly tall (only slightly shorter than you), has long light blonde hair, a rather large bust, and a near flawless figure. She has smooth, lightly tanned skin and her muscles are slightly toned from gymnastics classes; but she is by no means a body builder. She is quite flirty with you, and enjoys teasing you when she gets the chance. Overall, she has a caring personality and would never try to hurt you. Even in the cyber-world, she typically tries to avoid harming you unless you did something to really tick her off. However, the fact that you can't <i>actually</i> be injured in the cyber-world means that she would probably be more willing to try some things she wouldn't otherwise do to you. You normally get along very well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Cindy: An athletic 19 year old girl. She is very tall (a few inches above you), has shoulder-length hair (light brown with a single strand dyed green), and has a rather muscular build. She is a bit of a tomboy, and enjoys all kinds of sports; often wearing a sweatband over her forehead even when not working out. Due to her athletic way of life, she is fairly tanned and quite strong. She occasionally challenges you to a wrestling match, but due to her muscular physique and superior size, you rarely end up on top. Her tomboyish personality also means that she doesn't hold back if she has to fart/burp. You originally complained about this, but after being pinned down and forced to experience the stench up-close-and-personal, you learned not to argue with her about it. In fact, you actually grew to like this part of her personality over time; not only do you not have to restrain yourself around her, but she actually encourages you to \"let it rip\" if you have to (sometimes even making it into a contest). You now get along quite well (although your relationship isn't exactly what most people would call \"romantic\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Julia: A seductive 20 year old girl. She just as tall as you, and has long black hair that is almost always tied into a long ponytail. She has quite a large rack, and loves to show it off. As such, she often wears some rather revealing clothes. Personality wise, she is a dominatrix. She loves the feeling of being in control of others, and is not afraid to assert herself. She loves to toy with you, using her feminine wiles to get you to do what she wants. Despite being a control freak, she still cares deeply for you and wouldn't do anything that she knew would cause you permanent harm. However, since this is all virtual, she no longer has to worry about that, assuring you that if you die in the cyber-world you will simply reappear as if nothing happened. You get along well, despite the fact that she clearly wears the pants in the relationship. You can't help but worry about what would happen if she had this kind of power in the real world, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Amy: A youthful 17 year old girl. Appearance wise it's as if puberty just completely ignored her, as despite her age she is quite short and is incredibly flat-chested. She has short, dirty blonde hair (which she often ties into pigtails). Personality wise, her attitude more or less matches her childish appearance (a fact that she constantly denies when mentioned). She instantly falls in love with anything that she deems \"cute\", and often tends to be distracted easily. She looks up to you (in more ways than one), and always enjoys spending time with you. Due to this, coupled with her young appearance, most people who see you with her would probably assume that you were brother and sister. She doesn't mind this, however, and has actually started treating you like a big brother at times (possibly because she's an only child, and she always wanted a brother). You get along well, but your friends occasionally tease you for being a \"cradle robber\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Yumi: An attractive 19 year old Asian girl. She is average height, has short dark blue hair, average sized boobs (not huge, but definitely not small), and a nice figure. She has very bubbly and playful personality, and always seems to be happy. She is also a bit of a prankster, but sometimes she goes a bit overboard with her jokes. You get along well, but you feel she might be a bit over-the-top at times with her pranks. In a virtual world where she has complete control over everything, her relatively simple pranks would probably end up escalating to overly elaborate Rube Goldberg machine level booby traps. She's also openly bisexual, having both you as her boyfriend as well as a girlfriend of her own, and so she might want to try some things out on you by turning you into a girl as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">EDIT</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\">I decided to add an \"other\" option so that you can create your own girlfriend.

Your vision returned, you were in a lush green forest. The air had a distinct aroma that smelled like morning dew. You looked around the area and found that the forest surrounded you everywhere you looked. You decided to walk around a bit calling out for Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sarah? Sarah? Where are you? What I am doing here?\" You asked but the only reply you received was birdsong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about the environment you were in, it was a simulation, a sophisticated construct that enveloped all of your senses. You knew it wasn't real but it felt very real. You finally sat down and thought back to just how you got in here. Sarah's father was a scientist working on a sophisticated stimulation designed for the purpose of training a human being to immerse themselves in practically any environment. The simulation was so incredibly useful for these training missions, however the laboratory was purchased by a large multinational media corporation that wanted to mass market the simulator to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally being the daughter of the best research scientist at the lab she was invited to the lab to 'Create any fantasy or simulation you want' and she invited you along with her. Before you knew it you were strapped down to a chair and you were immersed in this very real looking world. Everything was so authentic, you placed your hand on the ground and scooped up a pile of dirt, which was then dispersed by a soft wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one thing you also remembered - Sarah was in control, not you. As you contemplated the implications of this you felt a slight tremor beneath you. It started to get stronger and you stood up and looked around, reminded that once Sarah had confided to you that one of her greatest fantasies was to be big; a giantess fantasy as she called it. At the time you don't really think too much about it, but these tremors that were becoming increasingly loud reminded you that in this simulation she could very well be a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed in the thick of the trees as much as possible and finally you saw on the horizon ahead what appeared to be an enormous hiking shoe. Looking even further up you saw Sarah. She was humongous, you estimated that she was easily ten times the height of the tree line. On her enormous face she held a joyous look as she started to approach you, smashing the trees down as if she were stepping on twigs. In fact as she approached you felt apprehensive, what was she going to do to you when she got to you? It was at this point that you made a decision</span></div></div>",

You were wondering what kind of animals she put into this thing, but that was part of the excitement. But before you got to the jungle, you noticed that there was a fork in the path, and in the middle of it, there was a sign that said with an arrow in each direction \"Normal Jungle, Site B Jungle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, what is the Site B thing about?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know you're a big fan of Jurassic Park, so I made this jungle to allow you to see the animals up close and personal.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard this, you began to shake with fear due to a few dinosaurs like Velociraptor, Spinosaurus and T-Rex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, the carnivores will not be able to find us at all.

This is just amazing!\" you said with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would like it.\" she said as she extended her hand towards the great herbivore. She began to stroke the beak and you were just speachless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, he's harmless.\" she reassured you. You took a deep breath and reached out to touch the beautiful animal. Once you made contact, you could actually feel every little detail on its skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unreal, I have always wanted to do something like this. Sarah, I have no idea how I can ever thank you for even bringing me into a place like this.\" you said. Little did you know, that you would end up regreting those words later on. But for now, you just enjoyed all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, you heard an all to familiar roar in the distance and you turned around as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell. T-Rex. I do not want to be around when he gets here. You said we could ride these guys?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded and gently tapped the triceratops on the beak.

You once again put your hand up to your head, but this time, your arm brushed against something on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused momentarily, and then continued to the weight on your head. you confirmed what you'd already guessed, your hair was a lot longer than it had been.

You looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA line of three glittering, green pearls, now that you noticed, they were the only source of light in the cave, in the center of your torso, going from your collar bone to your belly button.

Were you even male at all anymore? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn investigation of your lower body revealed the most shocking change to your body. your legs had fused into a long, glittering green tail, more pearls glittering at points that would not impede your movement should you swim off. The fact that there was a female's sex organs protected behind a green cage didn't even faze you after that. You screamed.  </span></div></div>",

It seemed to appear out of nowhere, and you were so shocked at it's appearance, that you didn't realize that you were swimming perfectly with your mermaid's tail, as if you had had it your whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Meridia by the way,\" said my companion as you followed her \"Handmaiden to the Lady.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeridia swam up to the outside of the dome, and waited for you to catch up before swimming through it. The moment you emerged on the other side, both you and Meridia were fully clothed, you in an emerald dress, and her in magenta. The next thing you noticed, was that both of you now had legs and you had female sex organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou staggered slightly on your legs, as if you were not yet used to walking on them. Meridia supported you as she led you along a corridor. You took a deep breath, and that was when you realized there was no water in the dome. You were breathing air once again. The air felt strange, fresher, you suppose, than it should. You eventually get your 'land legs' and are walking normally with Meridia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you into a large room in the center of the, the best definition you can come up with is 'palace', which appeared to be a throne room. The throne seemed to be constructed of a glowing white jewel, see through, like diamond. It was beautiful, but nothing on the woman sitting upon it. Her beauty was unmatched by any other thing you had ever seen, or would ever see again, beauty that you couldn't even describe. When the woman spoke, her voice was even more beautiful, more powerful, than Meridia or anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Meridia,\" said Poseidia \"You may wait outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeridia curtsied, gave you a smile of encouragement, and exited the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am deeply sorry for what you have endured,\" said the queen \"But I feel you have the right to know why...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoseidia paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There is a prophecy, that a dark evil force will consume the world, both underwater and overland, surface dwellers and merfolk both will be subjugated, but there is one hope, a surface dweller with a strong heart and mind being granted the powers of the merfolk, a child of both worlds, would be able to rally both groups behind her to drive back the forces of evil and save the lands from them. We believed Sarah to be the child of the prophecy, to be the one to save our world, but she is now gone, she died before we could get to her, do not blame Meridia for what happened to you, or me, the magic has been on this area for quite some time, awaiting activation. You are the child of the prophecy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react to this?</span></div></div>",

She was waiting by the wall separating the bubble of air the underwater kingdom was in, from the open sea. Beside her were two short swords, both sheathed, both glowing a strange, blue colour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for weapon training?\" asked Meridia, to which you nodded \"These blades have a few enchantments on them, the first is a free-action enchantment, it'll allow you to swing it under water or above water without impairment. The second enchantment is for training purposes, it basically puts a field around the edges of the sword, so if we hit each other, it won't have the same impact as if we were fighting for real, we'll have that removed when we're done with your training, finally, there's an identity enchantment, if any but you personally pulls your sword from it's scabbard, it will not come out, that's just for when your swimming, you don't want it flying out when your in mermaid form.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeridia grabbed one of the swords, strapped it to her back, putting he strap between her breasts, then walked through the barrier, immediately changing back into her mermaid form. You mimicked her, and also transformed back into your mermaid form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drew the sword, and fond that the water around you felt like air as the sword moved through it, it's movement unimpeded.

You again took a defensive pose, as Meridia also took a stance. You noticed Meridia looked less confident on land than under water. You found you could relax on land, you had been slightly disoriented from your transformation and unused to the change before, which was the reason you were weak the first time you became human. Now, you were strong. You took the initiative this time, rushing at Meridia and slashing laterally. She blocked and rolled to the side.

She was \"small\" compared to the rest of her team, but that still meant that she was big enough to bury your face between her breasts. Your cover man punched the girl in the belly as you ran past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You ducked under a girls kick and ran towards the touchdown line. Only two girls were in your way, Cindy and another smaller girl. The girl came at you. You tried to strong arm her, but you ended up pushing one of her giant breasts. Your hand sunk into the soft flesh, and for a second you were distracted. In that single moment, the girl grabbed you by the arm and threw you onto the ground.

Cindy then let out a massive fart right into your face. Your eyes were watering and you started coughing and gagging when Cindy stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, your head had cleared enough to look around. Cindy had taken off with the ball. You looked around the field; your team was doing badly. Several of your teammates were dead or taken off the field with injuries leaving you down a player, which was leading to more injuries. You watched as one of your players was grabbed by two girls while a third kicked him ruthlessly in the balls. He crumpled onto the ground only for Cindy to crush his head into the ground as she ran over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and ran quickly back to your defenders. There were only three of you left to stop Cindy and four other girls. The two biggest girls easily grabbed your smaller teammates and tackled them to the side.

Before she could dodge, you had spear tackled her to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on top of her body, your face bounced on her soft breast. The other two girls lifted you off Cindy and carried you by your arms towards the touchdown line. You struggled against their iron grip, but these girls were simply too strong for you. No matter what you did, you just couldn't manage to break free. While you thrashed helplessly against her massive teammates, Cindy herself was running straight towards you. Before you could tell what she was planning, she jumped in the air and spread her legs. With her partners holding you captive, you could do nothing but watch as Cindy's legs moved in slow motion past your head and her hot pink crotch filled your vision. Finally, her teammates released you. You quickly fell backwards as Cindy landed, crushing your face under her butt. The crowd cheered as the first touchdown of the match was scored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy turned around, smiling with her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to do better than that.\" Cindy taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aching body was not helped by Cindy, who decided to step on your chest on her way back to her side.<br>\r\nYou cleared your head hoping to turn the game around.

It seemed to you that Cindy's team had grown, but that might have been from a head injury. Three touchdowns later, you were still trying to tell yourself that. Your players had been more cautious, and only two had died. By now you were only crotch level with the shortest of Cindy's team, and the tallest was so large you barely reached her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref had conveniently died after calling one of Cindy's players for beating one of your players to death with another player. His death marked the end of any semblance of fairness. The next play saw practically the rest of your team murdered. Their linemen easily held back your blitz, and two of your teammates disappeared beneath the feet of the other team. One particularly lithe replacement slipped through the larger girls and dove for the quarterback. He held on desperately to her stomach, but she merely stumbled backwards before yanking him off and tearing him in two. <br>\r\n    <br>\r\nYou had fallen back to cover Cindy, who also towered over you. The QB passed the ball to her and she darted away much faster than her size should have allowed. Three survivors rushed in from opposite directions to try and prevent the drive. The biggest girl on Cindy's team, an easily 30 foot tall girl with curves overflowing the scant bikini, dove on the pair running in from the left. Her massive breasts landed dead on, and she slid another 10 feet. When she stood up the two players were smeared along the whole 10 feet too. The final man going to halt her progress was almost on top of Cindy, but another of her teammates came to the rescue. She jumped into the air and landed her ass right on top of his head. She laughed happily as she stood up and brushed the flattened player off her bikini bottom. You thought it might be safer to let Cindy get the touchdown. The team grew another few feet, and one especially excited Cindy crushed your quarterback between her legs.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n Things only got worse after that. Eventually, moving the ball became secondary to killing your team. At 60 feet, they couldn't be stopped by anything you did. As more and more of your players became reduced to stains on the other team's perfect bodies, more players rushed out from an off-field locker room. You managed to stay alive through the whole game, and at the end Cindy had the grace to shrink back to fifteen feet before coming to tease you for losing.</span></div></div>",

Like get a touchdown, force a fumble, get an interception, get a bone rattling tackle.\u201d Here she paused a close to evil look on her face. \u201cSpill blood, brake bones, kill people. You know all the normal football stuff. For each one you get physical boost. Become bigger, faster, stronger with each occurrence. Power-ups all over the field you just bend down and tap them twice during a play to activate it for your team.

At least they only last one quarter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3\u20262\u20261<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarter was finally over and all the power-ups reset, but it was way too late. The only good part was that there was a shrink cap of 3 feet. But that left your whole team at three feet against a team that kept getting bigger. It started bad and just gotten worst over time. At you first while one sided you did put up a fight, but each good play net you small bonuses while even a simple tackle had them growing a half a foot and getting fast and stronger, never mind anything else. The balance of power kept shifting more and more in their favor. And before you knew it you were lucky to have a play in which you kept any of your players alive. They kept letting the same girl score as much as possible which made her an unstoppable weapon used in case of emergencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You also found out why they kept letting one person score. Even with the field expanding so Cindy\u2019s team can comfortably play on it, it left the field as wider as a regulation field was long, she laid all the way across the field her ass and lower back covering all of you end zone her head and shoulders crushing one side of the stands her impossibly long legs crushing the other side.  On the last play you were stupid enough to taunt her calling her lazy. She got up ask her teammates to step back. And just jumped straight into the air. She went so high you would swear she could touch the moon. She came down ass first looking more like a meteor. There was no words to describe the impact, one moment you were looking at the biggest most beautiful ass coming towards you, the next you hear an announcement that the quarter was over, most of the stadium was in runes, and that there would be a small brake as the stadium is rebuilt. You pick up what\u2019s left of your team knowing you have no chance at a comeback. You see all of Cindy\u2019s team laughing and joking and, alarmingly to you, picking on the smallest of the team. She was getting angrier and angrier and you had a feeling she was going to take it out on your team. She may have been short to them but she was big enough to stomp most of your team with a few steps. You see the original Cindy coming over. You were pretty sure if you jumped you could touch her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you ready to continue\u201d? She asked. You weren\u2019t sure if you wanted to continue or not.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The game started and from the very beginning, it was quite obvious that Cindy's team was at an advantage. Her girls were bigger and faster than your guys and the fact that you and your teammates were all eye level with their boobs made them lose focus constantly. It was pathetic and you quickly realized that you were the only one who could change the game to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got the ball, you charged forward, but three of the Cindys blocked your path. Quickly, you passed the ball to a teammate, but it was caught by one of the opponents. The tall girl's back muscles flexed as she threw the ball. It was to high to grab it and before it came into reach, the original Cindy caught in in the air. She turned around, threw again and perfectly hit the basket. Your heart dropped as she grew bigger and more powerful. But at the same time, you were aroused by the situation. The game went on and with Cindy's score getting higher, her size increased as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of the Cindys made a mistake and you were able to catch the ball. You charged, but then, the original Cindy suddenly jumped before you. You were almost eye level with her beautifully tanned abs. Looking up, you were greeted by a superior smug. The ceiling light was right behind her, casting her in shadow. As she towered above you, her muscles perfectly framed by the light, you were so intimidated by her sheer size that you froze in fear for a moment. Without hesitation, she snatched the ball from you, threw and scored. It was her team's tenth point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as Cindy and her entire team grew bigger and bigger, until they gained an entire foot. The underside of their boobs was now as high as the top of your teammates heads. You looked back at Cindy. What you saw forced you to take a step back. If this went on, she would soon be twice your size. You gulped. The bigger she got, the more easy she could score, and the more easy she could score, the bigger she got. It was an endless cycle. How long would this go on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match continued and you could only watch helplessly as Cindy gained more and more size. Finally, you managed to get the ball again. Cindy jumped in your way once more. Fear grabbed your heart as the behemoth loomed over you. But then, you realized something. You charged forward, ducked and managed to run through the space between Cindy's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey, how mean.\", she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. Finally, you had a chance. You threw the ball and scored. Satisfied, you felt yourself growing an inch. But quickly, you realized just how small you still were compared to her. Suddenly, a bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, half time already.\" Cindy walked up to you. She was double your height now.  \"Two things\", she began. \"Firstly, as you can see, we are running out of space.\" You must admit, she was right. The field became rather small compared to her team. \"Therefore, I've decided to change the rules for the second half. Instead of growing an inch per point, the opposing team will shrink an inch. And per ten points, it will shrink a foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\", you complained. \"When it goes on like this, we will not be able to hold the ball anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her knees to get closer to you and patted you on the back. Even at normal size, her pats were strong, but this knocked the air out of your lungs and sent you to the ground. \"Don't be a pussy. Just play better. But moving on. The second thing I want to talk about is the half time game. Who wins it will get a bonus. That bonus will be an advantage of two feet. So in case of our new rules, that means the looser's team will lose two feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face brightened up. If you'd win this game, your team's sizes would be roughly the same. You still had a chance. But if you'd lose, you were done for. \"Alright, what's this game about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled, bending down to see you in the eyes.</span></div></div>",

Her arm alone was almost as long as you were tall. \"This is hardly fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled, then shrunk down to your size. \"Better?\" You nodded and thanked her. \"Then come on.\" She walked with you to the side of the field, where a table and two chairs were waiting. You said down, your teammates taking position behind you, her teammates, still at their full height, looming ominously behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got into position. \"Ready? Go!\" You immediately pressed with all your might. You had to surprise her. It worked. Her arm was being pressed down. You saw her gritting her teeth. Your teammates cheered, while hers booed. Of course, the girls easily drowned out the guys. But that did not matter. You were winning. Come on, you thought. Her hand lowered even more. But then it stopped. You pressed and pressed, but it did not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was her turn. The girls cheered. The noise they made had you lose hope even more. Slowly, your arms moved back to their original position. You imagined yourself not even reaching up to Cindy's knees. No, you could not let that happen. You focused, trying to bring up all your willpower. The arms movement stopped. Your guys cheered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, you brought her arm down, more and more. You managed to smile. \"Not so strong when you're this size, right?\" You looked up with a taunting grin. But your smile vanished and was replaced with a shocked expression. Cindy's face showed no signs of exhaustion. She merely looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became even more shocked when Cindy's biceps suddenly grew. You pressed as hard as you could, but you could as well have pushed against a steel bar. Cindy's biceps and shoulder muscles swelled even bigger. Her arm was now twice as thick as yours. Then, in not even a second, she slammed your arm into the table, breaking the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed in pain. \"Damn, what was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sighed. Suddenly, the pain was gone and your arm was healed. Still, she had cheated. \"You cheater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Cindy just handwaved the accusation away. \"Now listen. You know very well you cannot beat me at arm wrestling. But because your team was already losing, I decided to give myself a little less strength, to equal the ground. But you had to be a dick about it, so I just reminded you who is in control.\" The giant wall of girls behind her all crossed her arms, looking down on you with accusing faces. Cindy herself put one hand on her hips, slightly tilted her head and slowly grew back to her previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, then you lowered your eyes. \"Alright, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then let's finish the game.\" Cindy smiled maliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instance, you felt yourself dwindling down. You watched helplessly as Cindy and her team rose higher and higher, until eventually, you were eye level with their knees.</span></div></div>",

The course is filled with power-ups. But both courses start at different positions, so we don\u2019t see the progress of each other. At the end, we will meet in an ring with a special, more potent power-up for the winner of the race. Aaand, that special power-up will respawn regularly until both of us are there, so that the winner will get more, the faster they are than the other.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, you thought about it for a moment. \u201eSo, I can either try to collect more power-ups in the obstacle course and risk that I\u2019ll take longer and you get the special power-up, or I can focus on finishing before you to get one or even more of the special power-ups myself?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. \u201eOr you are good and do both.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eFine. And then? What exactly do these power-ups do?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tomboyish smug, she flex her right biceps. As always, you were impressed. It was a bit bigger than yours. She grabbed it with her left hand, then opened her hand slowly, as if to depict her biceps growing. \u201eFirst, they\u2019ll do nothing. But once we are in the ring together, they will take effect, increasing our size and strength. I mean, if we were to fight right now, you would clearly have no chance.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not even dare to object. She liked to wrestle with you in bed and usually ended up on top. \u201eOk, I think I get it.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched you against the shoulder. It hurt, a lot, but you managed to suppress a scream and just grinned painfully. \u201eThen, let\u2019s start\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you found yourself before an obstacle course.

You were not confident enough that you would beat Cindy and if you would not be there before her and would not have collected a single power-up, you would lose almost certainly. So, you decided to go for all the power-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you quickly realized that some of them were more difficult to obtain than others. The first few, you got easily, but later, you had to retry certain parts of the course over and over and near the end, you tried so long for certain ones that you had to give them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the goal. You had not been able to collect all of the power-ups, but at least most of them. Cindy was already there. Just when you arrived, she grabbed an especially big power-up, waiting in the center of the ring. However, she was not out breath, so the special power-up must have already respawned. So she had gotten at least two of them, maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eFinally here?\u201c You caught your breath and nodded. She grinned slightly, clearly hiding her anticipation. \u201eThen let\u2019s start powering up. You go first.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she finished her sentence, you felt a rush of power surging through your body. Your muscles grew thicker, your entire body shot upwards until you were 6 foot tall. You looked down on Cindy, then on your own body. Your shirt and pants were too small, so you took them off, revealing the body of a pro wrestler. You felt powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eMy turn.\u201c Cindy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, she grew bigger as well. Her muscles got more defined, growing thicker by the second. Soon, her legs had doubled in size, every muscle clearly visible. Cindy was already your size when she lifted her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you took a step back. Her biceps was bigger than your head. And still, Cindy did show no signs of stopping. She moaned deeply. Her shirt was too small, revealing her iron belly. Her erect nipples pressed against the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tested it, but I never had this much of the special ones.\", she whispered beneath her breath. Her voice was deep, but still feminine. \"I think I made them too strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden burst and a beastly roar, she shot up several more feet at once. Where her face had been a second ago, now her massive abs filled your field of view. Her clothes had ripped and she was now only wearing panties and a bra which barely covered her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shock only increased when you realized she was still not done. In spite of your athletic body, you felt weak and fragile before your titanic girlfriend. And you still had to fight her. Was there even a chance to actually win? Her abs were already above you. Now, her panties, soaked in her pussy juice, were on eye-level with you. Her thighs were both as thick as your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should escape. But the sight of her muscular, still growing form filled you with awe. Her deep moans and grunts and her slow, pulsating growth got you more and more aroused. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

It must've been at least twenty feet tall, probably triple your height or more, and shook the ground with each step. It was clearly some sort of female, but it was adorned with bizarre features... instead of feet, it had cloven hooves, and sprouting from its forehead were enormous curly horns. It was wearing only the barest of clothing - some sort of metallic harness, resembling a demonic bikini, with many chains and spikes all around. It had massive breasts, even in spite of its proportions, and its skin was a deep, shimmering red. It was like something out of a horror movie, or more obviously, something from the mind of Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly ducked back down behind a rock. Perhaps Julia had sent it to collect you? The thought was slightly terrifying, so you peered back to check where it was. As soon you looked, the massive demon-woman shot her gaze at you. Her eyes were glowing, and a smile grew on her thick black lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, the mistress awaits,\" chuckled the demoness with a haughty, unworldly laugh. She began to make her way to you, stepping over the lava streams that you would need to jump over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with that,\" you mutter, bolting from your cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jagged rocks were scattered like pillars, and you dodged from one to the next, trying to keep your eye on the giant demoness. Of course, you could feel her massive footfalls in your bones, and her evil chuckling seemed to grow closer and closer. Despite your best efforts, you reached a dead-end... A massive river of lava. Despite it being a simulation, you could swear you could feel the heat. Looking back, you saw the demoness stride through the rocks, completely unfazed by the pursuit. If you didn't know any better, you'd swear she was enjoying the chase!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now you had a decision. Face the demon, or try to continue to escape. Although the giant creature looked as sadistic as could be, it was still just Julia's creation, right? It would never actually hurt you, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, and considered your options.</span></div></div>",

There was no way to get past it, and you didn't feel like risking your life in this virtual world - at least not yet. You turn to the demoness, walking towards you with sultry steps, smiling at your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh well</i>, you think to yourself. <i>Here goes nothing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I give up,\" you raise your hands in surrender, not sure if this was the appropriate response to a twenty foot tall demon-woman. \"Take me to your mistress.\" You were sure this artificial 'character' wouldn't give you too much grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the monstrous creature didn't respond, and kept walking towards you. Her smile was broad... a bit too broad... and her hips swayed carelessly with each step. You had to crane your neck as she approached, and you began to appreciate the detail that Julia must have put into programming this being. Her reddish skin was glistening in the heavy air, catching the glow of the magma rivers all around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer 'harness' was a diabolical looking thing, which you supposed wasn't too surprising. It was a dark metal, with ornate inlays of strange runes and had heavy chains criss-crossing the entire outfit. Her massive bosom barely seemed to fit within it. Each breast must have been the size of a beachball! You were still admiring the artistry of the creature when you realized it now towered over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled half-heartedly, stumbling backwards. \"Ok, show me where to go.\" You tried to sound confident, but with the demoness looking down at you like an insect, you doubted it had much of an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the slave ordering <i>ME </i>around?\" The demoness boomed, her voice shuddering the loose stones all around. \"The mistress told me to make sure you were docile...\" she continued, a sick smile constant on her dark lips. \"Perhaps we should start the slave's lesson early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, that's not good</i>, you thought, cowering beneath the demon. You barely reached her lower thighs, and each of her cloven hooves was as big as a sewer plate. Over her enormous chest, glowing red eyes stared at you. Just what did Julia have planned for you?!<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her long fingers end in claw-like nails, and you can feel her tremendous strength as her hand wraps around your entire upper body. Your arms, pinned underneath the creature's grip, strain uselessly at your sides. What was most remarkable was the heat that was radiating from the demon-woman. You could feel the unnatural warmth through your 'virtual' clothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would the mistress waste her time with such a worm?\" mutters the giantess, bringing your body close for inspection. You can feel her breath as she speaks through her full, black lips. Your feet dangle helplessly half-a-dozen yards from the ground, so all you can do is shake your head. \"She's my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" yells the demoness, her voice reverberating your eardrums. A blast of warm breath hits you square in the face. \"Perhaps the mistress knows what an insolent insect you are,\" she smiles, her glowing eyes scanning your face. \"She must look forward to breaking you to her will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, she's still my girlfriend</i>, you thought with defiance. <i>We're supposed to be partners in this relationship, after all. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness continued staring at you, squeezing you, testing your fleshiness with her iron grasp. All you could do was gasp and grunt as she did this. You didn't want to upset her and have her crush you to a pulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she seemed satisfied. A smug smile etched across her demonic face. \"Time to see the mistress, you worthless creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phew</i>, you thought. You could see Julia and finally figure out what was going on. She had some explaining to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unexpectedly, the demoness put her free hand behind her back and produced a devious looking metal ring. She brought it to your eyes, and your heart sank as you realized what it was... a collar! The giant demon-woman saw your face, and laughed at your expression. \"Yes, little insect. The mistress requires all of her slaves to be bound. We can't have you escaping, now can we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed with alarm that the collar had a long chain attached to it... which connected to the lower part of the demoness's girdle. You were going to be leashed?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No way! Julia! Julia!\" you tried to scream out, hoping that your girlfriend could hear your pleas. You weren't a pet! Not in the real world, and not in a virtual one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the demoness simply chuckled at your pitiful screams. \"We can do this the easy way, worm, or we can do this the hard way. Please let me do this the hard way...\" She was utterly gleeful at your struggles. Sighing, you decide to try...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You roll over just in time to see the demon raise her cloven hoof and bring it down squarely on your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't you pathetic little worm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She yells as she steps down squeezing the air from your lungs. You almost pass out. She takes her hoof off of you and kneels down over you. She then begins to rip off your virtual clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is how a slave should be treated!\" She roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you by the shoulders and shakes you violently. When she stops you look up and are staring right at her breasts. Each one was bigger than a beach ball. She smirks and looks down at you saying.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How pathetic you human males are. Even when I harm you, you still only think of sex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks you up and down before continuing her insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is really a pitiful excuse for a cock. I would feel sorry for you if it wasn't so funny!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laughs so loud that it hurts your ears. You begin to blush in shame. Never have you been more embarrassed. You keep trying to tell yourself this isn't real. You try to kick out at her, but this just makes her angrier. She throws you backwards onto the ground. You land on your back with a hard thud. All of a sudden you hear a familiar voice.  It's Julia's!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom, it's me.. Julia. You need to listen to me. What every you do, stay away from the creatures that are roaming this virtual world.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now she tells me.\"  You think. Julia then continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was about to jump in, there was a lightning strike and a power surge.  I think there may be some corruption in the program.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\"  You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to scurry backwards in an attempt to get away from the demoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just hang in there. I'm not sure how long it will take. I can't just disconnect you without harming you so you will have to stay in there for a while.\" She says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\"  You think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing. I think the safeguards have been affected, so coming into contact with any of the virtual creatures could be painful and very dangerous. I will let you know when I have it fixed. Julia out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you yell looking at the sky hoping she can hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness gets closer and says.  \"Do not try and order me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up shaking in fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wasn't. I was talking to Julia, you know your master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She gets an even angrier look on her face and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no master! I am the only master around here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brings her hoof around and kicks you upside the head.

An explosion of poison gas blasts from her rear; as foul as it is, you're nearly protected by the weight forcing your air passages shut.

You're being forced inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is slowly swallowed into the tight, greasy tunnel, like being eaten by a giant worm.

The rest of your body sticks out of her ass, dangling and writhing like a ragdoll<br>\r\nInside, you can just barely breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy walls constrict you; the air is burning hot and incredibly foul, but you can still breath. There is no light, only sensation. Suddenly, the walls contract around your head painfully, then relax, then repeat. A deep laugh emanates from above; from inside, her voice seems to vibrate through you. At first you think she's just toying with you with her ass, but then you feel your shoulders forced against her ass. She's pulling you in deeper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contractions quicken as you are violently swallowed whole by her anus. Your body is forced up her colon through the waste lining the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky I had taken a shit just before I found you, human, or you'd surely have drowned by now!\" the demoness taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With one more violent contraction, her body takes you completely into it. Lodged in her rectum, you settle. Her colon relaxes just a little bit, giving you some \"breathing room\". Only now do you appreciate the heat, the slime, and the stench.</span></div></div>",

Her hair is tied back in a ponytail. She is wearing fishnet stockings ending in high heels. You see she is actually not wearing any panties, in her hand she lightly holds a black whip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness you got here Julia, that monster was about to kill me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia threw back her head and laughed and lashed out with the whip striking you sharply across the chest.  She easily drew blood and you flinch back against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you really thought a power surge would turn the creations here against the programmer! Just how stupid can you be? Everything that has happened here is MY doing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror you look at your girlfriend and croak out, \"Why... she could have killed me, my face is half burned off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia roles her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, that is easily fixable,\" with those words she snaps her fingers and instantly all of your wounds are healed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Julia, thank you the pain was so bad.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia simply responded by striking out with the whip again creating a fresh new gash across your chest.  You cry out in pain and realize your girlfriend didn't heal you out of the kindness of her heart.  She just wanted you to be able to take more pain!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps whipping you in a frenzy of sadistic power. Your wrists are still tied together so there is little that you can do to stop the shots. The best you do is try to cover your face from the deep lashes. Soon your arms, chest and back are covered in whip marks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiled at the blubbering wreck you had been reduced to. She looked at the demon who was watching with great interest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't want you to feel left out. Go break his arms for me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wail like a lost child as the 20 foot tall red skinned sadistic demon grins and grabs your body. With a massive twist she snaps your elbow the wrong way.  As painful as the whipping was this taught you a brand new meaning of the word pain. In a wordless howl of agony you scream for all that you are worth.  And then it happens again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a broken and quivering mess as your so called girlfriend stalks next to your bleeding broken body. She nudges your face with her boot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were you I'd try to get on my good side, kiss my heels and tell me what a good doggy you are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete and utter terror of Julia's power you obey instantly and kiss her black high heels. You beg and plead without any dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, I'll be your good doggy, I'll do anything you want, please, you're so beautiful. I'm so lucky to have you, I'm a good doggy, please, please, please don't hurt me, do anything you want but don't hurt me please.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia can only laugh at your pathetic display. However all of the whipping and torture as well as your pleading has turned her on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well since your such a good doggy I think you deserve a treat. The only question is should I use my own natural body or should I make my own demon body that I will inhabit to make things extra terrible for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what option you would prefer. Does Julia make you go down on her in her own body or does she turn into a terrifying demon?  </span></div></div>",

You wince in pain, and are filled with new terror, but before you can even turn around her giant hand has scooped you up.

Her blistering-hot breath washes over you, making you nauseous. You come frighteningly close to rows of sharp teeth as she nuzzles and sucks on you. Her saliva is thick and sticky. Soon, she sits down and unceremoniously lowers you between her legs. You look back and see Julia masturbating at your plight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are turned, facing the demoness' vile cunt, as she holds you by the lower torso. A tangled, sopping-wet bramble of pubic hair greets you as the demoness's corrosive pussy juice drools out. The demoness spreads herself with one hand and drives you in the other. You are shoved head-first into the waiting mouth. On first contact, you're greeted with searing pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluid surrounds you, seemingly digesting you as you are dragged in and out. The demoness pumps you in and out, grunting like an animal. As your skin scrapes across her inner walls, you feel like it is being torn off of you. The fluid invades your every orifice, spreading the pain, and you feel like you're going to die for real. Just as you start fading from consciousness, however, the pain starts to lessen and you feel the blisters begin to subside. Your senses clear and your skin seems to grow resistant as you heal. Your urgency goes away, allowing you to focus on the other horrors of your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the demoness it is deadly hot; what little air is inside her crevice is humid and noxious. Her juices taste and smell like rot as she continuously pounds you into herself. Her walls contract rhythmically, as if chewing and savoring you. The pace quickens, and you hear the grunts reverberating through her body turn into roars. The flow thickens until you're completely immersed in it. The contractions grow tighter and faster, and then seize up, constricting you like a snake. As they relax, a final gush washes past you. You feel the demoness release your legs, but another contraction swallows you up completely into her pussy. There you lie trapped in the foul orifice.</span></div></div>",

The walls tighten and you feel yourself being shoved out of the demoness' hole. A few grunts and the cold air hits you as you drop into the demoness' open hand. You curl up into a ball, looking up at the giant ass and crotch looming over you, before being rocketed up in her hand up to the demoness' face. She sniffs you a few times; you quiver as her tongue probes you gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness roars, then cackles a bit before tossing you into her mouth.

Trying to bite through it just gets the demon worked up even more. The muscled goopy appendage pushes into your mouth further and harder. You start gagging and throwing up. Chuckling laughter is erupting from the sharp toothed gaping vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought things couldn't get worse, the small tentacle that was sounding your penis is now prickly feeling and seems to be ripping at the lining of your urethra. Screaming out, begging for mercy isn't helping. The incessant laughing continues as your cock is being abused to the point of complete destruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like your ass is already bleeding from the gigantic intruder, but a second mass with as much girth is now pushing into your cherry ass. This is pure hell. \"Please let me go or put me out of my misery!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon decides to...</span></div></div>",

It grumbled in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on slave!\" it said, tugging on your leash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set off across the scorched plains, your captor pulling you ahead. Eventually you came to a swirling portal in the air, and the demoness unhooked your chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mistress is through here. You will go now.\" it said, and cruelly tossed you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the portal closed behind you, evil laughter echoed through. The fall had hurt you, but not seriously. Apparently your pain was reduced, but not gone, because the fall should have at least broken some bones. As the feeling faded, you looked around and saw gleaming oceans and green fields. Off in the distance, a massive walled city rose against a mountain. It was all much different than on the other side of the portal, and you wondered what Julia had in mind wi the change of scenery. With this thought, a shadow fell over you. Whirling, you saw Julia. She was easily fifty feet tall, and wore a kind of low-cut toga like the ancient gods. It exposed lots of her newly-enlarged breasts and with each step her tremendously large yet tight ass tugged at the fabric of the clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! I hope my friend didn't hurt you too much, she can be kind of rough. But you're here now and all's good!\" Julia said, kneeling down to pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you were able to walk on to her hand without the roughing up of the demon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, this is amazing! How often do you come here? And how long did it take you to make this place?\" you asked, dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just smiled for a moment before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't come in here a lot, I just mess around with it and watch what happens. I've never really intervened with the affairs of the computer's people. And honestly, I can change everything in seconds. Here, watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at the fields, and level plains became hills and cliffs, complete with terraced farms. Then, giggling, she pointed to sea and before your eyes an island rose from the surf barely causing a ripple. She must control everything to keep the island from making huge waves, you thought. Then she pointed at the ground beneath you, and a concrete jungle materialized. Minutes later, a full suburb had appeared from nowhere complete with people going about everyday business. None noticed you and Julia standing in the middle of a park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I'm like a god in here!\" she said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a dangerous light flashed in her eyes and she picked up a passing car. This caused the people below to suddenly take notice of the giantess, as if snapping them from a trance. Chaos ensued as they ran and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why be God when being the devil is so much more fun!\" Julia said wickedly, crushing the car like tinfoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Julia do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She surveyed her creations with complete satisfaction. You were very happy you were up on her hand, safely out of the way of her colossal feet. Julia had begun to walk out of the town with complete obliviousness to the people below her. She crushed homes, shops, and a school with disdain or even satisfaction. No doubt hundreds of her \"subjects\" had already perished, and she had been here less than half an hour. Eventually her strides brought you to the hills. She stepped between the huge rises with ease, showing no strain. She had a contented smile and a dangerous gleam in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here is the sea. It has no name, but when the games on land become too boring I can move out here and have a huge aquatic playground. It's also the border of my domain, and beyond it is a sandbox of infinite dimensions. I've been a huge fan of sci-fi in this place, you'll just have to tolerate my little quirks Tom,\" Julia said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar echoed off the cliffs you and Julia were perched on, and a massive ship miles long descended from the sky. It was easily three miles long and a third as wide. The exterior glowed red from entry into the virtual atmosphere, and as it soared overhead you could feel the air sizzle. Then your girlfriend laughed and gazed up at it. You noticed an odd movement on her hands, and realized she was growing. You grabbed her soft skin and held on as it expanded. Soon she stood so her breasts were level with the side of the ship. Julia stepped forward and pulled her dress off of her chest. The mounds of flesh impacted with the alien construct and continued moving forward. The ship broke like glass before Julia's might. Then she gave it a shove that sent it hurtling towards the mountains. It crashed, and seconds later a bright flash of light erupted from it. A muffled boom sounded, and winds tore across the landscape. When your vision returned you saw a mushroom cloud rising from the wreckage. The idealistic scenery had been transformed into a nuclear wasteland in moments, while you and Julia were unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that? You just killed everyone!\" You cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked at you and laughed. She snapped her fingers, and then the area was as it was before the spaceship exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do anything in this world, remember! Hey, let's explore the island I made! You can help me sculpt it!\" she said eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia shrunk back down to her original height of fifty feet, and strode into the water. It slowly rose up until she had only her head and neck above the waterline. Before your journey, she'd placed you on her hair, which was currently flowing out behind her. The walk took about five minutes, and you wondered why she didn't just teleport herself there and save the trouble. But you were too busy hanging on for dear life to say anything. Finally, she strode up from the water and took you in her hand. Her toga had been soaked, and now clung like a second skin to her. The garb now accentuated her already luscious curves, and you felt a little aroused. She saw you staring, and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like these little man?\" she asked, grabbing her boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the dress tighter against her body, showing you her erect nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may just let you get a little closer. If you're lucky. But right now we have a world to create! What should we put here? In my fantasies I always have some primitive tribe or a hyper-advanced society.

The men circled around the camp fire facing outwards; you walked testing the weight of the rocks in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They're just girls... How bad can it be?' You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet you couldn't help but feel very much on edge. What was your girlfriend doing? All around you twigs broke in the consuming darkness. Suddenly, the forest erupted with yelling and breaking branches from all sides. Something large and soft collided with you knocking you too the ground. When you looked up you saw at least eight 12 feet tall, butt naked women attacking your comrades around the campfire. The giant women were unarmed, but their size meant that most of the men had already been disarmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne man was crawling for his spear when a woman who looked to be about 20 sat down on his back. The scene around the camp fire was horrific; the women were easily pinning down men before they even had a chance to fight back. Taking action, you grabbed a rock and threw it at a woman who was smothering a man with her breasts. Unfortunately, the rock landed short of your target, and it rolled harmlessly up to the girl's feet. She didn't even bother to look up as she felt it tap her toes. You were about to throw your second rock when something tapped you on the shoulder. In a flash you spun around and threw the rock. It went flying at critical speed right between a giantess\u2019s legs. But not just any giantess, it was Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe... Uh, sorry about that... I thought that you were somebody else.\" You said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Julia said, clearly not believing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply stared you in the eyes before punching you right in the chest. The force of her blow sent you shooting across the clearing, briefly catching glimpses of men being smothered, crushed and tortured by the giant women who Julia had created. With a crack of breaking bones, you felt your body smash into a tree. You look up to see Julia in all her terrifying naked glory walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were all at least 10 feet tall, clad in nothing but bikinis made from animal pelts, and their mounts were larger than average in order to support the additional weight. As soon as they came into view, the men around you began to arm themselves with spears and swords of various sizes. They then charged toward the invading army, weapons at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take them long to realize that they were both outnumbered <i>and</i> outsized. The women simply surrounded the men and, due to their height and number advantage, tied them up with minimal effort. You could only watch as one of the women dragged the restrained group over to you. Then, one who appeared to be their leader stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up, males. Our tribes have been at war for too long. Our queen requests a negotiation to organize peace between our two tribes! In exchange for this, she desires one of you to be brought too her as tribute. A very specific one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then points at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This man will be coming with us. From now on, you will no longer have to worry about us attacking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then tossed you over her shoulder like a rag doll and mounted her horse. She then snapped her fingers, signalling for another woman to free the captive tribe. A muscular woman wielding an enormous sword nodded her head. She then swung the blade down at the male tribe. Her blade cleaved straight through the ropes without so much as a scratch on the men themselves. They were all amazed by how accurately she was able to swing such a huge weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining women stayed behind, and you watched as they appeared to be making small talk with the men. Meanwhile, the fact that you had been chosen to go with them gave you a good hint at who their queen was (as if you didn't know it already).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon your arrival at the female village, the woman carried you in to a massive throne room. Big surprise, Julia was waiting for you in the throne. Setting you down on the ground, the woman bowed down to her queen. She then glared at you and grabbed your head, forcing you to bow down as well. Julia simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, I have brought you the man that you requested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that. Very good work. You may be excused now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, milady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then left the room, leaving you and Julia alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Julia, what do you have planned this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia simply laughs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. You'll be having plenty to do. I think that we should start by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You thought that being big like her would be safer than your current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...sure. Sounds good,\" you said, forcing a smile. \"So how am I gonna grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You seriously think that I'd let <i>you</i> get bigger?! That's a riot! No lover boy, you're going to stay an adorable little shrimp while I become bigger, sexier, and infinitely more powerful. You can just ride around between my tits and help me make some decisions or something. Now, hurry up and go outside. I'm about to bust out of this hut, and I don't want you getting hurt too soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly hurried outside, heeding your girlfriend's advice. Also, you were curious as to how long her growth might take. However, moments later the roof of the primitive shelter exploded as Julia's gorgeous form tore through the roof. the instant her beautiful form burst through the roof and became visible to you, you watched in awe as the already revealing clothing she was wearing began to rip apart and fall to pieces from her growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that she did that just to give you a show, since the fact that she was a goddess in here meant that she could have easily made her clothes grow with her if she wanted. She looked around on the ground for a moment, lifting her feet from the wreckage. Her eyes settled on you, and she smiled playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the view, Tommy boy?\" she said, winking seductively at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss for words. Julia was already smoking hot to begin with, but seeing her towering over you at 100 feet tall made her even more attractive. It was as if every aspect of her beauty had been magnified many  times over by the overwhelming size difference. With a playful smirk, your massive girlfriend plucked you off the ground and placed you down atop her right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go begin our tyrannical reign over the tribes of this island!\" Julia said as she strode off, covering the distance between the two tribes in a short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were busy celebrating their continued existence, and didn't notice Julia approaching. The tribesmen were dancing around a large bonfire where a pig was roasting. Suddenly, their dance was interrupted as a massive foot smashed down and crushed the fire-pit. Another landed to the left, catching two unlucky primitives underneath. From your height you could still hear the snaps as their bones were crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up! Starting today, all of you are under new management! From now on, my little lover boy and I are going to be your supreme rulers. Don't worry, as long as you do everything that I say, I won't be too mean to you. Disobey me, however, and I won't hesitate to kill you! All good? Good. I'm starving, what's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men looked uncertain, as she had just killed some of them. Then she plopped down and you, stored in her cleavage, were jiggled around until you thought you might be launched out. She stretched out luxuriously, twining her feet around each other. One had two red smears on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, surely you can get your goddess some food, right? Don't be shy, I'll eat pretty much anything!\" she said invitingly. One of the men moved forward, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, you just destroyed all of our food. We were preparing a feast when you arrived. We don't have anything left, sorry.\" Julia smiled, but it was icy. He gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, we'll find some good food tomorrow. But for now, you'll just have to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snatched him lightning fast, before he could even scream in horror, and stuffed him into her mouth. You could see the luckless guy struggling in her mouth against the strength of her tongue. Finally, a lump slid down Julia's throat signifying the end of his chances of escape. She lay down flat, and rubbed her toned stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm that's delicious! Maybe I should make more of this,\" she said contentedly, making the rest of the tribe nervous. \"Now as my second act, I want...\"</span></div></div>",

So, do I have any volunteers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe all exchanged nervous glances at each other. After a moment of silence, five men came forward and bowed before Julia. All of them looked to be fairly young and all of them wore scant clothing like the primitive tribe they were. One of the five men looked just like you if you had a tan like he had. The slave that looked just like you had led the small group in front of Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" Julia said. \"Now give me a nice foot massage. If any of you do a bad job, you'll be going on a one way trip down my throat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five men rushed to rub the huge feet of Julia. While the five men were busy doing that, Julia ordered the rest of the tribe to build a temple to her. Not wanting to anger their new goddess, the tribe soon started to gather building supplies. During all of this, you were starting to sport an erection. Seeing Julia order the tribe around had turned you on for some reason. You always had a soft spot for powerful women and Julia was powerful now. You decide to stay in Julia's cleavage, for fear of angering Julia. But Julia wouldn't hurt you, right? She had said that you would both be rulers of this island... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, you would help her make decisions... But what kind of decisions? And why had she wanted you to stay this small? While you were thinking about your role in this affair, you idly watched the tribe slowly build a temple. They had started to make the temple out of the biggest hut in the village and simply expanded it, adding rooms and such to what would become a temple of Julia. Julia hummed a tune to herself, then she seemed to remember you being in her cleavage. She reached into her cleavage and plucked you out, lifting you up to her face.<br>\r\n                          <br>\r\n\"Isn't this fun?\" Julia asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what's my part in this?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll both be rulers, but I'm the one who's really in charge. You can still be my high priest or something, but I haven't really made up my mind yet. Let's just play this by ear, shall we? Anyway, I will rule the island while you'll rule both tribes. And if anybody doesn't like that arrangement, I'll be sure to punish them severely.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJulia then ate one of the unlucky villagers, and you watched her swallow them with a kind of arousal... Actually, the fact that you were aroused by it kinda surprised you. Watching someone getting eaten alive shouldn't have been sexy at all, but it would be foolish to deny that you weren't turned on by watching Julia trace the lump as it slid down her throat. You just shook your head to try and clear it of those thoughts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew they knew resistance would mean death, but some of them might be willing to run off and attempt to escape. You considered watching the crowd for any signs of someone about to try something, but everyone looked suspicious to you. A few minutes later you gave up, and hoped Julia would be able to stop any problems that came up. At her size she'd probably be fine. And besides, you were in the nicest seat in the universe, why not enjoy it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggled deeper between the giantess's cleavage. Sometimes you could feel the villager she had swallowed kicking against her stomach. You still found that attractive, and from Julia's quiet sighs and moans she did too. You wondered what unlimited power felt like. Julia seemed content to waste it dozing while tiny people rubbed her feet. But if you were nestled between her two beautiful breasts that were bigger than you were, it was fine.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n Julia appeared to be napping and that no doubt emboldened the villager. One second he was standing as still as the rest of the crowd, the next he was sprinting through the village at light speed. But before you could even speak up to warn Julia, her eyes snapped open and locked onto the runner. Her gigantic form surged to her feet. The slaves giving the foot rub died before they could even scream, but you felt the crunch of snapping bones all the way on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Julia took three steps and caught up with the runner. He went a few more feet before a giant hand scooped him up and hauled him in front of her face. Julia smiled savagely and carefully examined her prize. He kicked and struggled, but Julia didn't even notice. She squeezed tighter, making the man shriek in horrible pain. You thought you heard some ribs crack, but it might just have been her feet further pulverizing a bone stuck to her sole.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n \"I'm glad someone around here had the guts to try and make a run for it. I usually have to ask for a sacrifice. But now you get to show your fellows what I do to the people who try and run from me! You saw me eat your friend, and he's slowly melting inside of my stomach. Every second he exists burns more than you can imagine. But what happens to you will be soooooo much worse!\" Julia described, licking her lips. \"We don't want to keep the people waiting,\" she said, her deadly whispers drowning the doomed man's screams of pain. She held him up above her head.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n \"Look what happens to those who try to escape my power!\" Your girlfriend stuck the struggling man inside her mouth. You watched her tongue move him onto her molars and slowly grind him into red paste. You'd never heard someone in that much pain before, and normally it would horrify you. But Julia made it look so sexy, you were simply aroused once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it ended and she swallowed the red mass you heard it land in her stomach juices. The person inside must have jumped away from it and redoubled his efforts to escape. You also thought Julia was aroused just from the extra sway she put in her step, and from the way her hand kept idly twitching towards her nether regions. She sat back down on her throne, the people now terrified of her even further. She smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n  \"You're free to go back to your lives,\" she announced. Then she saw the stains of her five slaves and quickly amended, \"Five new people come here and clean my feet off.\" As the new slaves scrubbed at her foot she gazed suggestively down at you. \"What to do, what to do?\" she murmured seductively. You wanted to do it very badly, but you kind of feared for your personal safety.</span></div></div>",

You were filled with relief to learn that your assumption had been correct. Eventually, after a few minutes of falling through the lava (which felt almost nonexistent, and provided very little resistance as you fell), you landed on your butt in a large high-tech looking room. Standing up and rubbing your rump in pain, you look around to see a large chair in front of a huge monitor. You then hear someone clapping from behind the chair, and it turns around to reveal your girlfriend Julia!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't dressed in her usual clothes like you were, but was instead wearing a black leather dominatrix outfit (complete with matching knee-high stiletto boots and elbow-length gloves). It looked incredibly sexy on her, and showed off her every curve flawlessly. As you looked at her and blushed, Julia began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo, Tom... I'm surprised that you were able to find me so quickly! Congratulations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... Thanks Julia, I try my best...

So Tom, what do you think about <i>my world</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that it looked like something out of a horror movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Tom, that's exactly what I was aiming for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, you have one twisted imagination...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia simply gets up and walks over to you before planting a kiss on your cheek. Once again, you begin to blush. She then leans over next to your ear and whispers into it with a seductive tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do... But that's what you love the most about me, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's get on to the main event!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia then materializes a whip out of thin air, and skillfully uses it to pull a lever on the massive computer console. A few whirring sounds are heard, and your body begins to glow green for a moment. The glow then fades just as quickly as it appeared.

It came across like New York, loud, angry people, too many stores to count and buildings cramped together in a tight space. It sure fit the description of the stereotype of the town; but why did Julia bring you here? You looked across the sea of people you appeared within, waves of familiar faces with slight differences, none of them Julia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did she go?</i> You asked yourself, a bit puzzled. Wait! You could just use your newly found power over the system to find her of course. Your eyes closed as you tried to mentally pinpoint Julia. You might as well have tried it in the real-world, because nothing came of it. Either you just didn't have the hang of this yet, or Julia didn't want to be found... Probably both. It may have been a virtual reality, but you still felt a bit uneasy at the uncertainty of the situation. Julia, the very epitome of a dominatrix, could be anywhere, or anything, doing anything. You would've been safe regardless, but still... You wondered if you could feel pain in this world? Knowing Julia... definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud boom echoed throughout your ears and disrupted your thoughts. A chill came up your spine as you had a feeling Julia made her move. People in the distance screamed bloody murder and began running away from something, you couldn't tell what as a massive skyscraper blocked your sight. You looked to the virtual people, almost every single one of them staring upwards as they ran for their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM....BOOM...BOOM....</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booms became repetitive, almost rhythmic even. You paled as the fresh memory of the demoness came to mind, Julia didn't decide to re-enact Godzilla or anything here did she? The booms kept coming closer and closer, soon right on the edge of the street you could see. A large crowd burst out into the open, and were instantly crushed by a massive creature. You gasped at the realistic, horrid sight of their blood and guts exploding from their bodies from the sheer pressure of the giant foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise though, it wasn't a hoof or claw that crushed them, but literally a foot... A boot in fact. It looked familiar, and with another booming footstep you realized why. Standing before you and the hundreds of panicked virtual people was a towering 100-foot tall giantess Julia, still in her dominatrix outfit. She had her dominating look in her eyes, and a cruel smirk on her face. You could see the blood of god-knows how many virtual people decorating the soles of her dominatrix boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips caught sight of you and twisted into a smirk, \"Why hello there Tom. You're looking a little small there...\" She began to take steps in your direction, crushing several people with each step. You were frozen in a mixture of arousal and fear. You didn't know what you were focused more on, the threatening boots coming closer and closer with each step, or the breasts you could climb like a wall. Either way, what happened next was up to Julia, not you. \"...Almost like a bug.\" She chuckled, making her next step more of a stomp than a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap...</i> You realized what Julia intended and turned to run. Now you were like the rest of the virtual people, fleeing for your life from the giantess Julia. She saw your escape attempt as a joke and laughed, \"There is no escaping from me, Tommy boy... I <i>own</i> this world, remember?\" She grinned, making each step of hers a stomp. You tried to block out the sound of her booms coming closer, the people splattering like grapes, and everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes couldn't resist looking back. It was a field of destruction, the street was lined with boot-prints and bloody corpse remains. All Julia did was smile as she continued to close in. \"If you beg for mercy, I <i>might </i>spare you you know...\" You knew you were in no danger of real death, but the idea of submitting and begging your girlfriend to spare you still seemed preferable to experiencing... whatever would happen if you were crushed beneath her boot. You stopped running and turned around, \"Please Julia! Don't do this to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed no signs of hesitating. You faltered slightly, \"Julia! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm the one in charge here.\" She flatly stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind's instinctive notion to feel fear kicked in, and you had a fear for your life despite rational reasoning. You fell to your knees, \"PLEASE JULIA!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess stopped just before you, you could see your reflection in the shiny dominatrix boots she wore. Her left foot began to rise... You looked up to see Julia wearing a more evil expression than ever before. You could feel the edges of your eyes watering, <b>\"JULIA!!!\"</b> She coldly looked down at you as her foot reached as high as it could, \"Insects have no right to speak to a goddess.\" she said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, her foot lowered at an alarming rate. You shut your eyes, hoping this was all just gonna be quick. Julia loved being dominant, and truth be told, you loved being her bitch, but this was too much too soon. Hopefully death in this virtual world was nothing. The boot stopped inches from your face, some virtual blood dripped on your face. Julia spoke to you...</span></div></div>",

But this ground, whatever you want to call it, is extremely white, soft to a touch, a little squishy but completely flat, and has a dry but pleasant fog as if from a machine rolling over it... except that there's no machine anywhere, the fog just is, coming from the ground itself and disappearing just as quickly. You don't concern yourself with it, because there is a LOT more to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an extremely clear day, with a brilliant sun shining overhead providing just the right amount of heat. The cloud you're standing on is only about fifteen feet around, but it's connected to other clouds via a collection of identical cobblestone bridges. Some of the connected clouds are smaller, but some of them appear to be MUCH larger, holding separate houses, even buildings, all at once. In the distance, you can see bridges connecting other clouds as well, including people crossing them. Your cloud just contains a tree, a park bench, and lamp post. Not seeing much at your current location, you decide to take a look around for something more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter crossing a bridge onto a different cloud with a small neighborhood on it, you begin to notice something odd about the people living in it. You can adjust to the sandal/white tunic getup that seems to be universal for everyone, even yourself, but you are beginning to see... similarities in the people you pass. No one is exactly alike, but they come really close to it. Those two girls look the same, except for their height and face... those two guys could pass as each other, except for their hair color... and that guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks just like you, except taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to address him when a hand grabs your shoulder from behind and a voice calls out \"Like what I've done here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia!\" You cry out- it's good to see someone you know in this town which was beginning to get a little eerie. \"So you finally found me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellll, I wouldn't say 'Finally'.... but yeah,\" she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing, I really feel like I'm here!... wherever here is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is known as the Cloud 7 simulation,\" she explains. \"Because this is the seventh edition of this simulation that we've made. It DOES look pretty good, but it's still lacking in a few areas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how?\" You question, although you think you know one of them already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You notice how some traits are shared a lot in this system? That's not just coincidence. Making completely unique individuals by the thousands would be a headache even for this machine, so we sorta cheated a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's mix and matching the traits it's got to try and make these people?\" You guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"And then it's recycling the traits to do them again. It's got control over some basics, like height and weight, but its catalog for facial and body details is pretty small at the moment, so some copies become very-\" she pauses as the pair of very similar girls pass you- \"...close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that guy I saw who looked like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The machine scans every new face that comes in and registers it for copying,\" She replies. \"Your face was bound to be in here somewhere. Don't bother making conversation, because we haven't even got the speech and conversation routines in, so no one says anything yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't thought about that, but now that you do that actually sounds kind of cool. You keep making small-talk as you pass out of the neighborhood and into another cloud with small city commercial buildings on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just too crazy for words,\" You tell Julia. \"I'm just glad you didn't use this program to toy with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiles...</span></div></div>",

Then the rest of her body followed as she fell out of the air and landed in the center of the city, crouching to break her fall. She was dressed like a dominatrix with her knee high black boots, a black miniskirt and a black tank top. She towered over all the buildings around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-? How can you be that big? You're like 500 feet high!\" You shouted up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw her smirk and then loudly chuckle at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't be silly, Tommy boy.

Filled with confidence from having escaped your massive girlfriend, you foolishly allowed yourself to get cocky and taunt her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's the matter? Big Goddess Julia can't get to little Tommy through a building?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your surprise, Julia didn't react to your taunting at all. She simply remained silent and glared at you. You knew that was never a good sign. You quickly went up the stairs to the second floor and looked out a window. What you saw terrified you. Julia was growing dramatically in size, growing and growing. You got a sinking feeling of dread as she just kept on expanding bigger and bigger with no end in sight. Feeling incredibly helpless now, you simply looked up at her enormous height, now maybe a mile high, and realized that as big as she was she could easily crush not just the building you were hiding in, but also the better half of the city itself, with just a single stomp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice, now overwhelmingly louder than ever before, taunted you with sarcastic praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"AH, FINALLY AN OPPONENT WORTHY OF MY SUPERIOR INTELLECT!

To run from the boot of your mountainous girlfriend as her shadow enveloped everything. Julia was lowering her boot at an agonizingly slow pace, clearly her attempt to taunt you with how little chance you had of escaping from her. If she were to just stomp down all at once, you would have already been crushed by now, but at the sluggish rate that she was lowering it, you at least had a slim chance of making it out of there alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Some moments passed and it occurred to you that weren't dead, or maybe this was the afterlife? You got up and opened your eyes, looking at the white background around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia? Did I... um... respawn?\" You called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared in front of you, normal sized but still in her dominatrix outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did Tom.

You were forced on to your hands and knees by this overwhelming force all around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia...

Don't want to give me the satisfaction that I can force you on your hands and knees at any time through gravity manipulation?\" You let out a slight whimper of pain \"But I don't want you on your hands and knees, I want your face on the ground\" and this time the pressure increased even further and finally your reserves of strength collapsed as you gave in to her torment. You fell face first into the dirt below. \"I gotta hand it to you, you're pretty tough Tom.\" she said lifting the field and helping you up. You groaned in pain from her humiliating trick. She looked at you with her beautiful eyes and you saw the softer side in her despite her megalomaniacal personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what Tom, how about I make things a little more fair?\" she said, brushing the dirt from your front. \"What do you have in mind Julia?\" you asked tentatively. She smiled in delight \"I have two ideas, how about I become a giantess again, and destroy a city. But this time you get to command your own army that will try to take me down. You can use anything you like short of nuclear weapons. If you succeed in bringing me down I'll let you choose the next venue and give you some of my powers, if not then I will choose the venue and you'll still be my little powerless boy toy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fair enough. I mean, I'm already your powerless little boy toy right now, so it's not like I have anything to lose. So, what's the other idea?\" you asked. \"A similar approach to my first proposal, but you will try to hide from me as I tear up the city, Godzilla style. In fact, if you can escape the city limits before I get you then you win, if I catch you before then you lose. Of course the consequences of winning and losing are the same as in the first idea\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were deeply sceptical that she would actually let you even have a chance at winning, but in any case you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those are both intriguing ideas but I think the best idea is...\"</span></div></div>",

All of those tall buildings ought to provide plenty of tactical opportunities for the both of us.\" Julia replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then snapped her fingers and the scenery around you disappeared for a moment. Soon you found yourself sitting inside a fairly large room. A group of uniformed soldiers that appeared to be from the Japan Self Defense Forces sat on chairs looking directly at you. There was a moment of silence before a soldier came up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, may I brief all of you on what we know so far?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please explain what's going on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, alright here is what intelligence knows about the situation: It appears that about an hour ago a human female that is approximately 1000 feet tall had invaded and attacked the city. We don't know where she is from or why she is attacking but in any case she had no known entry path. She just appeared at her present height in the center of Tokyo and started smashing buildings and crushing civilians with impunity. She appears to be enjoying herself and attempts by local law enforcement to stop her were utterly useless and only served to provoke more attacks. She has no weapons, just her limbs, but they are very powerful against even armed troops. We have got local emergency services to evacuate as many civilians as possible but there are still many trapped on the roads going out.The government has given us full permission to use as much force as necessary to stop her even if it ruins much of the city. We already have 3 armored battalions near the city limits but they won't go anywhere or start attacking until reinforcements arrive. However we are running reconnaissance missions and can feed live video and satellite data\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed a button to your side and you saw Julia, still dressed in her customary Dominatrix outfit, stomping around and demolishing the city. She soon reached a hand down and lifted up a camera to her face. She spoke into the audio receptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out here and play with me Tommy Boy. If I don't see you out here soon, I'll just have to come and get you myself. I already know the location of the little mouse hole where you and your fellow toys are hiding. I think that I'll really enjoy the taste of your tiny bodies squirming on my tongue and sliding down my throat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Julia squeezed her thumb and index finger together, effortlessly crushing the tiny camera to pieces between them. The video and audio feed went dead, and you were slightly taken aback by her threat, but you kept your cool and returned to the mission at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are our options, then?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well General, we have two separate plans. The first of which is that we encircle the city and attack with long range artillery and air strikes. Ground forces will be used to help protect civilians and buy time if she comes over to the city limits to take us down. Overall we hope that eventually the artillery will destroy her and that she will be unable to properly retaliate\" he paused for a moment and you thought about just how unlikely it was that wouldn't retaliate against a barrage from afar. You had no idea if she would use long range weapons. \"Go on then\" you urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sir, our other plan involves moving in for close quarter combat. Under the cover of artillery and air strikes, we can move in and attack at close range with our tanks, machine guns and other ordinance in order to more accurately hit her, as well as limit where she goes from having to constantly avoid or block our attacks. High command has given us no particular instructions, so it is your call sir as to which plan we take\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused in deep contemplation and you decided on doing....</span></div></div>",

From your position on a hill near the city limit, you observed her looming form in the distance. You felt quite save, but you knew that if she wanted to, she could close the space between you in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the artillery fire rained down upon her, she turned around and around, visibly irritated, much to your satisfaction. However, the attacks did not seem to make any signifiant damage. Still, thanks to them coming from every direction, Julia seemed to be hesitant on where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the first airstrike arrived. On a monitor, you observed the attack from the point of view of one of the jets. They flew a few hundred feet above her head. When the bombs hit, Julia fell to her knees. Even at your position, you could feel the impact of her fall and you saw several buildings around her collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no damage was visible. However, some kind of bar suddenly appeared on the monitor next to you, displaying \u201980%\u2019. Was this supposed to be a health bar, like in a video game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, this is what our scientists suspect to be her remaining vitality.\u201c, the soldier next to you commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least some explanation, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the jets turned for the next airstrike, you saw Julia\u2019s face. She was not happy. Still on the ground, her arms around her body, squeezing the tits in her already tight latex suit, she shot an angry glared towards the jets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems I underestimated these toys' firepower.\u201c, she cursed through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she then opened her mouth, a bright glow coming from inside. You guessed what would happen next, right before it happened. A wide beam emerged from her mouth. The jet which\u2019s point of view you used to observe the scene managed to escape, but most of the rest were shot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cContinue the attack!\u201c, you ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack must have exhausted her, but it also demonstrated that you could not let her have room to breathe. Who knew what more abilities she had given herself. When the area around her started to glow, you realized that you were about to find out about at least one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia rose back to her full height, but the jets were still above her head, charging towards her. The attack had to hit, but you got more and more worried when lighting started to surge through the streets around her. When the electricity entered her body, she relaxed her face, closed her eyes and straightened her back. One of her hands glided teasingly from in between her thighs, over her belly to her right tit. When her skin was glowing almost white with electricity, she opened her eyes, looked directly at you and winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instance, there was a blinding white light and then\u2026 boobs. The jet had been flying above her head, so in front of it had been nothing. But now, there was Julia\u2019s massive, leather clad cleavage. The jets tried to disperse, but she just slammed her hands together, crushing all of them except the one with the camera. That one, she grabbed with her massive fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eYou gotta try a lot harder than that, Tommy Boy.\u201c With that, she crushed the remaining jet.</span></div></div>",

All of them would be weakened and once they reached the city limits, the ground forces would take them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never came to that. Before she got even close to your ground forces, she stopped. And then it hit you. You should have cut off all electricity leading to the city. You gave the order, but it was too late. Each of them started absorbing the power of their respective city part, completely ignoring the now seemingly ineffective artillery fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished absorbing power, they all grew to almost 1.500 feet. The laughter of the four Julia\u2019s echoed across the city, humiliating you even more. You felt weak and powerless. Even though you had all this military forces at your command, Julia felt like she was unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you thought to yourself. If you gave up now, you would loose the chance of getting at least a bit more control of the situation. Julia had promised you to give you some of her powers should you win this. And she had told you to make it more fair. There had to be a a chance for you to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt cannot get any worse. There is no more power left in the city and even with their new strength, they will have a hard time reaching the city limit. Continue artillery fire and get me another airstrike. Get me all free jets and equip them with the most powerful bombs we have.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Julia crushed your hopes once more when all of her turned into white masses again, reforming in the center of the city. You stared in awe when her united body now reached over a mile high, her black leather boots now bigger than her entire body was before. The tip of her boots dwarfed most of the buildings, save for the really tall skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia put a hand on her hip and looked down on you. Her shadow cast your position in darkness and you realized in horror that she could cross the distance between you in two steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize that I get stronger by the minute, right? But letting me regenerate twice slowed you down. Too bad, Tommy Boy. You are not really good at this. Its almost as if you want me to win.\u201c A sadistic smile formed on her face. \u201cIf you loose, I think I\u2019ll stay this size and force you to lick the entire underside of my boots.\u201c</span></div></div>",

When the bombs hit, her body liquified, absorbing them and growing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned into some sort of goo that covered most of the city. All buildings high enough to still be visible dissolved into the Julia slime. Her laughter was now omnipresent. The humiliation drove tears into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of moving towards you, the slime began to sink into the ground, leaving a massive crater where the city used to be. You wondered what she had in mind. It was obvious you had no more chance by this point. She was only toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the earth began to rumble. Next, the ground beneath you exploded. You were sent flying through the air and blacked out for a moment. When you came back to your senses, you found yourself on a seemingly endless black landscape. A small mountain rose in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Julia\u2019s divine face came into view, filling the entire horizon, you realized where you were. Her breast stretched endlessly in every direction and the mountain was her erect nipple, pushing against the leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI chose 'becoming a slime that can absorb matter' as my final power. It seems it is a bit too powerful as I can basically absorb the entire planet.\u201c Her booming voice was like a thunderstorm. \u201cYou know, I never realized this. The only time I played this scenario before was with a friend of mine and she beat me before I reached this state. Maybe I should invite her to help you \u2026 or join me for another round.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she laughed again, your entire world trembled. Emotions of awe, fear and arousal overwhelmed you and before you knew it, you were on your knees, worshipping her, promising her to do everything she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, finally, Tommy Boy realizes his rightful place.

Our best shot of bringing down this Kaiju is to directly attack from close range where we can use the narrow streets as cover and avoid any long range attacks she uses. I want you to bring me an APC and tell the three tank battalions to move in to the outer suburbs of the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, General. I will assemble the troops and call for an APC.\" the nameless soldier said to you as he and the other troops started moving out to the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one last look at the interior of the building and started running outside as well where an APC pulled up. Just as you were about to enter a gigantic explosion made you instinctively dive for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebris rained all around the area as you turned around and discovered the base you were all just in was completely destroyed. In the distance, Julia was simply standing there laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get going! now!\" You yelled to the driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe APC quickly took off into the street as you saw Julia in the distance launching fireballs from her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start firing artillery on her, now!\" You shouted over the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And get me a visual on her!\" you continued as the APC began to rattle and shake from the various potholes that now covered the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a screen in the APC showed you a display of Julia. She had stopped throwing fireballs as artillery exploded around her. One shell exploded on her shoulder, and she cried in pain before quickly ducking behind a building for cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working! Continue firing!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe APC gun started firing rapidly as you approached her. You decided to look at the APC's front camera, and you saw Julia push a building over. Knowing what was coming next, you quickly shouted at the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pull back! Pull back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the APC stopped its movement and started to drive backwards. The building smashed down into the streets in a rain of broken glass and concrete, leaving you to narrowly avoid being crushed. Julia then began to take the offensive. She fiercely kicked over an approaching squad of soldiers, causing some to be crushed into bloody pulps while others flew in the air and were splattered on impact. A group of tanks nearby floated in the air and were tossed aside as she used some form of telekinesis on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"COME BACK, TOMMY BOY! I'LL FIND YOU AND CRUSH YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU TRY TO GO!\" Julia said in a playfully dominant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The APC quickly started moving down a side street. This time, however, the road was blocked by several of your own tanks which had been piled up by Julia's telekinesis in this spot. Turning around and driving back up the street again, you called on more air strikes against her. You witnessed them hit her, once again she cried out in pain and you saw the explosions draw blood as she desperately scrambled for cover. But you were having none of that as more tank battalions poured firepower on her from nearly every direction causing more shouts of pain from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you thought victory was on the horizon you noticed her stand up to her full height and she adopted a wide, smug grin and started growing. She expanded her already colossal form to 3000 feet. Undeterred you rallied the men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just makes her a bigger target. Hit her with everything we've got!\" you ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore firepower rained down on her, but it started bouncing off what appeared to be energy shields all over her body. Does your attack have any further effect?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, it stopped and all was silence. You got up, looked around and your jaws dropped. The whole sky was filled with one giant, red glowing eye, looking down on the world. You dropped to your knees, admitting your helplessness. Another earthquake shook the world around you as the continent-sized tip of her index finger landed a few miles next to your position. You wondered why the carrier did not overturn yet, but that was probably your girlfriends doing. In the distance you saw the tip of her giant thumb. It seams she was literally holding the world in her hand. She backed of a bit (or several thousand miles to you) and you could see her whole face. Her eyes were glowing red and her lips formed to an evil smile. All of that was surrounded by her long, black hair, floating around in space. You again realized how beautiful she was, but you were too afraid to even try to calm her by saying a compliment. She then moved her lips to speak. She was surrounded by the vacuum of space, but a goddess probably does not need to bend to the laws of physics so her words could reach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO YOU STILL THINK THAT WAS A SMART MOVE, MY SWEET, LITTLE, HELPLESS TOMMY-BOY?

You fell to the ground. The heat was too much. Then you watched in horror as her lips opened even wider, one moving north, the other moving south. Soon, they disappeared behind both sides the horizon and everything became dark. You could only feel the heat and hear Julia's breath sending more and more waves of heat across the world as the planet moved deeper into the mouth of your goddess girlfriend. Suddenly, you heard a rumble and cracking noises as everything was shaking. You could only guess that she was using her tongue to crush the planet. Then, you felt the ground giving in as the noise got louder. The last thing you remember was a loud, girlish giggle even surpassing the volume of the rumbling around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up ...</span></div></div>",

As you watched your colossal girlfriend in a mixture of fear and awe, you saw her begin to remove her top, exposing her titanic tits to everyone in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked down at the puny city with smug satisfaction. You were rather annoyed that she didn't even have the slightest intention of trying to win fair and square, but as you became absorbed in the undeniably sexy sight of Julia's bare breasts looming over the city, you knew that there was nothing that you could do to stop her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the rest of the citizens could only watch helplessly as Julia started to rub her massive boobs together in a titillating display of self pleasure. She then proceeded to smirk at you as she gradually lowered those immense orbs of feminine flesh so that they dangled directly above the center of the city. Without even saying a word, Julia proceeded to lower her chest down until her boobs impacted with the city like a pair of plush nuclear bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of this contact sent a massive shock wave across the entire city, whipping up monstrous gales of wind that instantly blew your entire army away. The soft flesh of Julia's massive boobs flattened everything unfortunate enough to be caught beneath them, leaving hundreds of buildings demolished beyond recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, the APC you were in wasn't able to get you out of there in time. Trapped in the epicenter of the destruction, you had been crushed to a pulp beneath your girlfriend's powerful assets. Upon lifting herself back up, Julia simply laughed at the sight. Where the grand city once stood there was now nothing but a pair of massive craters, each possessing a distinct circular impression at the center where her nipples had pressed into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after your death at the hands (or rather boobs) of your own girlfriend, you woke up again to find that you had returned to the white abyss you saw when you first entered the virtual world.

You were standing in a giant hall with two corridors leading out. The walls were almost entirely made out of glass and you could see even more buildings in different shapes and sizes outside. \"So, are we all here?\", Julia said, standing in front of you, still wearing her dominatrix outfit. But she was not alone. There were two other girls. You recognized them, they were her two best friends. One of them was Mary, blue hair, blue eyes and well proportioned. She was only wearing a blue swimsuit which barely contained her breasts and butt, looking around happily at her surroundings. The other one was Sam. She was a punk, the left side of her head shaved, the right side covered in long, black hair. Her not covered, light blue eye looked around and eventually rested on you, giving you a cold stare. She wore jeans, covered in holes, leather boots and a top which revealed much of her muscular belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Tommy-Boy, I thought we share this VR experience with a few friends of mine, so I invited them. And now that they are here, we can play a little game. A fighting game. The rules are simple. We will spawn in different locations on this station. If you find someone and beat him or her in a fight, the loser will respawn in a different place while the winner will double in height. Of course, if you are too big, you will not fit into these halls anymore. So I made it that we can pass through the glass freely and we are able to breath underwater. To make things more interesting, power-ups will appear inside and outside the station. They look like this.\" A glowing blue ball appeared next to your girlfriend. \"If you touch them, your height will double.\" She touched it. It disappeared and she instantly shot up to double her original height, her breasts jiggling up and down due to the sudden movement. \"But if you are unlucky, they will half your size.\" With that said, another glowing orb appeared before you and flew into your chest. You felt your surroundings shift as you shrank to the height of the other girls crotches, or knees in Julia's case. \"On the other hand, if you are really, really lucky, you will be teleported outside and your size will be multiplied by 100.\" A third orb appeared and flew into Mary's chest. She instantly disappeared, only to reappear outside, her giant face filling in the entire window. \"There are five places people can respawn. If all of them are destroyed and everyone except you is defeated, you win. So, are there any questions? No? Then just let me reset everything and we can get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you felt you environment change again as you appeared in another room of the station. This one was a little smaller, but it had three exits. You must admit, at first you were a bit frustrated because of Julia's unfair victory, but this game sounded like it could be exciting. Still, the question remained, was it really a game or was it just another setup to tease you. Well, only one way to find out, play the game. Now you only needed a strategy. Sam would most likely beat you in an one-on-one fight, Julia ... maybe too, maybe not, but she was in control so even if you were able beat her in real life, here, she could just add some extra strength to hers. But Mary, you had never seen her fight, she was usually polite and diplomatic, so maybe you could beat her. On the other hand, Julia mentioned power-ups and if you were double the size of the other, you could possibly even beat Sam. So, what to do?</span></div></div>",

And now, I can simply crush you!\" She increased the weight on you, but then hesitated. \"But wait, if I defeat you now, you would spawn again somewhere else and I had to find you again. That would take time. Time you could use to find a better power-up. So, maybe I should weaken you a little more. I remember seeing another shrinking orb through a window nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she grabbed you and dragged you towards the exit of the room. You tried to resist, but she just hit you in the stomach. You screamed in pain and your vision blurred. When you came back to your senses, you were in a different room, another orb before you. \"Time to get smaller.\" With that, the blue haired girl threw you at the orb. You felt that strange sensation again and watched the world around you grow even bigger. Quickly, you got up and tried to run, but Mary slammed her foot before you on the ground. You looked up, past her leg, her crouch and her belly, into her grinning face, almost half of it hidden by her massive boobs. \"Now try fucking Julia with that tiny worm of yours. Hm, if I through you into another shrinking orb, she could probably use you as a dildo.\" She giggled, imagining that scene. That was your chance. Without hesitation, you dashed towards the next entrance. You had to find a growing orb. \"Hey, wai...\" She suddenly stopped and so did you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the entrance walked Sam. As she saw you, she stopped, her right hand on her hip, her head slightly bowed down. An evil grin formed on her face as her uncovered eye looked back and forth between the two of you. Then, she slowly licked her lips and you started to feel more like prey than like an opponent. But that was understandable, you were only around one and a half foot tall after all. Sam's grin got wider. \"Looks like I will quadruple in height.\" With that, she dashed forward to attack...</span></div></div>",

The other girl screamed and struggled, but the punk had an iron grip. \"Just say you give up, or else I must break you. And we don't want that, sweetheart.\" She bowed down and licked Mary's face. Wait, are all three of them are in a relationship? Or was that just your perverted fantasy? But there was no time to think about it, you had to get away as long as the two girls were fighting. You ran as fast as you could, but you were already so small you only reached the entrance to the room as Mary screamed. \"I give up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back and saw the blue haired girl disappear into thin air. Then you watched in horror as the punk girl was standing up while growing bigger, rising higher and higher into the air. You turned towards the corridor and ran desperately. But Sam was eight times your size. Quickly, she had reached you. You felt her big fingers wrapping around you. She lifted you into the air until you hovered before her giant face. You knew you had no chance. \"I give up.\", you said. But Sam just grinned. \"Not so fast. I wanna defeat you properly.\" She then licked her lips again, saliva dropping from them. \"I know, it is a bit sick, but I always wanted to do this and here, it has no consequences.\" With that, she opened her mouth and moved you closer to it. You were so filled with horror that you could not even scream as your face got closer and closer. You felt her hot breath when she suddenly extended her tongue and licked over you. You coughed as you got saliva into your mouth and nose. The sticky liquid dropped down from your face. When you finally managed to blink it out of your eyes, you saw her mouth getting closer again. You couldn't believe it. Was she really going to do this? You head was now in her mouth. The air was humid, almost brumous, and you could hear her breathing all around you. Then, you felt a sudden pain as she bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill horrified from that experience, you appeared in another room. Looking around, you realized that you were still small. You sighed. You better stayed out of sight and tried to find some growing orbs to get back in the game. You ran down the nearest corridor and entered another room. Suddenly, you heard footsteps. Quickly, you hid under the nearest table. Carefully, you peaked out of your hideout and saw Julia entering the room. She was double her usual height, so she had either bet one of the other girls or found a growing orb. Or she had cheated, that was always a possibility. You remembered the war game. You had had a good strategy, but she just grew too big to be defeated. That was always frustrating, but it also gave you an exciting chill every time. You couldn't help but feel aroused when she dominates over you. But that did you mean you wanted to lose. So you quickly withdrew back into your hideout. You listened to her footsteps and your heart started to beat faster as they got closer. Your heart almost skipped a beat when her leather boots suddenly appeared before the desk. Then she crouched down. You tried to press yourself against the wall behind you, hoping it would swallow you. Had she seen you? \"Hm.\" She made. \"I wonder where the others are. I thought I ... smelled Tommy-Boy.\" She knew you were there. Why else would she talk to herself. \"But he must have already left this room. So I look somewhere else.\" With that, she got up and walked away. You sighed. She was of course toying with you, again. But maybe you could use this to your advantage. You peaked out of your hideout again. No-one there. So you sneaked to the next corridor as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a connection between two parts of the station. The floor was made of steel, but the walls and ceiling were one big window. Looking along the hallway, you saw an orb in the middle. You had to admit, it really had a slightly different color than the ones which had made you shrink. You cheered inside, but just as you started to approach it, Mary entered the corridor from the other side. She saw you and grinned. \"No, this one is for me.\" You dashed towards the orb, but it was no use. You were already too small to compete with Mary. She casually walked towards the power-up and just before you reached it, she grabbed it. She stuck out her tongue at you and then disappeared. Suddenly, a shadow was cast upon the whole corridor. You looked up at the window and saw Mary's giant face, her blue eyes looking at you. So, it even had been a super-power-up. She giggled. \"Oh, you look so pathetic from up here.\" So, you can also talk underwater? Whatever, you had to get away. Julia had said you could pass through the glass and breath underwater, so you ran towards it. Meanwhile, Mary extended her enormous hand, grabbed the corridor and just crushed it. Through sheer luck, you slipped between her fingers and were sent away by the shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drifted through the water, unable to stop as Mary got up to her full size. Suddenly, you shrank again. You cursed. You must have hit another shrinking orb. That was no bad luck anymore. That was probably just Julia's doing. The air was knocked out of you as you hit something. You could not move properly. It seemed you got stuck between something. Something soft. You heard a feminine laughter behind you and immediately realized where you were. You were stuck between Julia's massive breasts. She grabbed you and lifted you before her face. A wicked smile formed on her lips. \"So, are you enjoying my little game? I hope so, because it is not over yet. But I hope we will have an epic climax.\" She laughed again and before you could respond, she crushed you in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respawned again in another room. That was getting ridiculous. Were you the only one that was constantly loosing? Damn, you had to find a growing orb before you got spotted again. But before you could even think of a way to go next, you had been spotted again by ...</span></div></div>",

I'll put you in a new city that I made and I'll come looking for you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to inquire about something but she snapped her fingers and the whole scene, including Julia, disappeared around you for a moment. Then, you saw a street taking form around you with tall skyscrapers rising all around you and then a blue sky with small clouds hovering overhead. Then people appeared and began moving about, talking, chatting, walking to and from different destinations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, she wasn't kidding about making this a Godzilla-style rampage from her,\" you mutter to yourself as you begin walking down a pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass a shop window that is advertising television sets, you suddenly see all of them change from their various channels to a news channel where a middle-aged newsman, sitting behind a desk, looked up at the camera with a worried expression on his face. A crowd of people around you also stopped to view the news as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an emergency situation taking place. A giant human female has appeared out of the sea on the west side of the city and is rampaging through the streets. We take you live to the scene from our news helicopter,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene changed from an aerial view of the city with the noise of a helicopter's blades sounding out from above. All around the helicopter, from what the camera could see, was smoke. The cameraman pointed it down to see a row of burning skyscrapers and a large shape moving about between them. Some of the people around you gasped or whispered as the female the newsman mentioned emerged from the smoke and you saw it was Julia, still wearing her Dominatrix outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she raised her booted foot brought it down on a small skyscraper that was about three hundred feet tall but only came up to just below her thighs, it disappearing in a cloud of dust and smoke, killing all that were inside it. She looked up at the news helicopter and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You best start running, Tommy boy! I'll be looking for you!\" she said in a playful, yet dangerous sounding manner; finishing with a little wave and a wink before she threw a large piece of rubble at the helicopter and the film abruptly cut off as the rubble hit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic filled the screen for a moment, but the reaction around you was enough to worry you as well as her warning. One woman began to cry. Another person, a man, grabbed his girlfriend by her arm and led her away. Most of the crowd with you followed their example and left, though a few stayed with you. The newsman appeared back on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have lost coverage from our news helicopter, but as you seen the situation is dangerous enough as it is. The army is mobilizing to attack the monster and they have estimated her to be around 1200 feet tall. A state of emergency has been declared. All citizens have been advised to evacuate by any means necessary. Good luck everyone,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news channel turned off to a picture of static. Everyone around you quickly set off to try and find a somewhere to hide or leave the city, but you stand there deep in thought. Well, even though this was what you had chosen to do with her, it was still quite shocking that it was happening, almost as if it were the real thing. Well, you at least knew that Julia would be enjoying herself. After all, she was the domineering type of girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud booms echoed in the distance and you, along with most of the people nearby in the intersection and surrounding streets and buildings looked in the direction of the noise to see tall pillars of smoke rising up. They were several miles away, but you could still see them quite clearly and every now and then an explosion would erupt from over there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All citizens are advised to evacuate immediately! I repeat, all citizens have been advised to evacuate immediately from the city!\" a nearby police car's radio echoed out over an intercom attached to the car as it drove past and turned the corner; the noise of the broadcast lingering in your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I best leave and try and get out of here...\" you mutter to yourself as you head back up the street along with a huge crowd of people away from the smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you reached the end of the street where another intersection was, you stopped. Well, the whole point of her was to try and capture you whilst you tried to escape, but what if you made it more fun? What if you went over to her and provoked her into chasing you. That would make this more fun! You smile to yourself at the thought! Yes, that was a good idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question was; how to get there? You look behind you, moving to the side of the pavement so as not to be carried away with the crowd that was rushing past you, to see several police cars driving in an out of the streets, directing civilian cars to head in your direction. Well, going by foot or car was unlikely and there was nowhere you could go to find an aircraft, but what about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look across the road to see a subway entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfect,\" you say to yourself and you run towards it, on your way to meet with your girlfriend.       </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>One hour later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the subway to be greeted by a scene of complete destruction on the streets around you. Large piles of rubble dotted the roads, huge boot-prints had been pushed into the tarmac, bursting some water pipes underground, most of the buildings around you were dotted with large holes, cars were squashed flat, lampposts knocked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven one of the skyscrapers just further down the street was half destroyed, a huge pillar of smoke bellowing out from the top of it, forming a huge cloud over this part of the city, swelled only bigger by the rest of the smoke pouring out of the other buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou survey the destruction around you with a shocked expression. You were surprised that your girlfriend had wreaked this much devastation on the city, and all of this whilst looking for you! Wow, she really did mean it when she told she was going to start looking for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which... you scratch your head. Where is Julia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shakes violently and you are knocked off your feet. Dazed, you look around but the smoke and fires emanating from the buildings around you block your vision of the tops of the city. Knowing what was going on at the moment, that was likely to be Julia, but where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother great quaking of the ground lifted you several inches up into the air and onto your side, meaning she was getting closer. As you pick yourself up, you wonder how she could find you, but then you remind yourself that she is pretty much the goddess of this world, so she can pretty much find you anywhere you. Shame you could not see <i>her</i> though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the taller skyscrapers, probably about a thousand feet tall, further down the street a few hundred meters from where you are comes crashing down with a thunderous roar, bellowing out an enormous cloud of dust and smoke. You cover your face as the dust sweeps down the street and engulfs you momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you lower your hands, you see a huge pile of rubble scattered about on the street in front of you... along with a huge boot. Your eyes follow it up to see a huge woman looking back down at you with a sense of glee and mischief in her eyes. It was Julia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" she said in a surprised voice, placing her hands on her hips. \"I didn't expect you to come looking for <i>me</i>, Tommy. I thought you would have fled with everyone else. That would have made the search more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not reply, but continue to stare at Julia. Even though she was virtually a goddess compared to you, you could not help but find her sexy. Especially with the revealing black dominatrix outfit that she was wearing, which hugged her massive form tightly to accentuate every single curve on her body. God, she looked really sexy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have sensed what you were thinking because she suddenly smiled in a way that told you she had something planned and began to walk towards you, each of her footsteps rocking the street. You backed away, but knew there was no way you would be able to outrun her. Besides, you could not take your eyes off her gorgeous figure, especially her great chest as it heaved with every footstep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not running away now are we, Tommy?\" she asked in a mock sad voice, now only about a hundred feet away from you; yet her shadow stretched out over the street and engulfed you. \"Now, I think I've won this game, To-OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an explosion erupted on the back of her head and she reared back in surprise. You look up and see several jets fly overhead and then some helicopters appear and begin firing missiles and high-powered projectiles at her. Seeing your chance, you bolt for it down the street away from her as she whips around and grabs one of the helicopters, crushing it in her clenched fist like a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you run, you frantically look around for an escape vehicle. You see one left on the pavement in reasonable condition with the door open. Yes! You run towards it, mentally begging the keys to still be in the ignition. When you reach it, you look inside and see that they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes, even better! </i> you think to yourself as you get in and shut the door and start the car, though you mentally remind yourself that you had never learned how to drive before, but still... When you were in this kind of simulation world, you could do whatever you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reverse the car off the pavement and, facing away from Julia, who had just crushed another helicopter by knocking it out of the air into a building, honk the horn loudly. She looks in your direction and you cup your hands around your mouth and shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come and get me, Julia! See if you can catch me!\" you yelled as you sped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia glared playfully and adjusted her long black elbow-length gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, Tommy, I'll play it your way.\" She said with a playful smirk as she ran off after you down the street, literally knocking a small building out of the way to try and cut you off when your turned into a side street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove on, you looked in your rear view mirror to see her chasing after you, though, as usual with a giant monster, she was smashing through the buildings to try and catch up with you and cut you off. You frantically turn sideways into different streets when she nears you and she growls in annoyance, which to you sounds like a Godzilla-like roar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you screech to a halt when, ahead of you, a large column of army tanks and vehicles with large laser-like weapons is coming towards you with soldiers either side of the vehicles. One of the soldiers runs up to your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you, get outta here!\" he shouts as he reaches your car and pulls you out. \"C'mon, man, don't you know your in danger here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Target dead ahead!\" a sergeant suddenly shouts out and you look down the road to see the towering monster of Julia standing at the end of the street, a naughty look on her face as she smiled down at you all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Toy soldiers! Well, It's time for me to <u>play</u>!\" she said and began walking towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All units, open fire!\" the sergeant bellowed and almost at once, the air was filled with the sound of thunder and explosions as the tanks and lasers began firing at Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier pulled you away behind the column, you glancing back over your shoulder to see Julia hide behind a small building to get away from the barrage, which amazed you considering that she could actually get hurt in this simulation. Still, at least it stopped her from catching you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, get outta here!\" the soldier shouted to you, pushing you away before firing on Julia with his gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey and run towards another waiting car and drive off as quick as you can, not seeing Julia's expression when she see's you, and she is not very happy about it.</span></div></div>",

The army consisted of tanks, Jeeps, and armored trucks, and they navigated their way through the vehicles and panicked citizens trying to move in the opposite direction. You tuned in to the car's radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are approaching the giant, Zulu Team. Tanks and troops are taking up firing positions. She's trying to hide behind the Executive Building. Bravo Team, see if you can hit her at the flank.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked ahead and saw that the traffic was blocking your way. You quickly looked around, briefly stealing a glance at Julia, who was now being attacked on both sides, with nowhere to hide as the military completely surrounded her, you also had a crazy thought that she might be even bigger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing such thoughts from your head, you then quickly spotted an empty alleyway and made a sharp turn as you drove in, knocking over an empty dumpster and driving out the other side onto a road with less traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt the ground shake violently. The entire ground shook and you lost control of the vehicle, crashing into a store front. When you stumbled from the vehicle the earthquake shook your bones as all the glass from all the surrounding buildings shattered and you were forced to your knees as the asphalt road cracked and split, causing several cars to fall into the fissures that were formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the quake subsided you quickly rolled over onto your back and saw Julia - Goddess Julia you thought with excitement and apprehension. She was now so big that her boot alone now matched the size that her entire body had been only minutes ago. You had no time to think as that enormous article of footwear began to rise into the sky, looming over your insignificant form like a giant skyscraper of jet black latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the tracer rounds around her boot but noted that now the explosions against her were utterly ineffective. Again the earth shook violently as she stepped on another part of the city, snuffing out the puny and futile attacks coming from that area, the ground shook again as you heard her laugh, resonating for miles around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the army was in full scale retreat and you got up off the ground and listened to the still functional radio. \"This is a general retreat, repeat retreat from the giant, immediately. Zulu and Bravo company have been wiped out and Hotel company...\" The radio turned to static as another, more distant quake rattled the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked out of the vehicle you noticed another army unit hastily rolling by as they desperately tried to escape from Julia's wrath. You now looked up at your super-massive goddess of a girlfriend as her boot was facing in your general direction and was again lifted from the ground. At this point you realized that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched in horror as her titanic foot was rising into the air and moved over the part of the city you were in. You tried to get a look at her face, hoping to get a clue weather she was aiming at the army or you, but the sky was already covered with the bottom of her enormous leather boot. You saw dirt, metal and blood all over it. In the end, it did not matter who she was trying to stomp. If her foot would land, you were done for, which means you had basically no choice. Desperate, you ran as fast as you could, but the tip of her boot was only slowly getting closer. Some rocks and even a flattened tank that were stuck on it became loose and fell to the ground around you. Darkness was already enveloping you and you were about to just stop and give up hope when you suddenly started to fall. Everything turned upside down, you hit the ground hard and before you could figure out what happened, a thunderous boom, louder than anything you have ever heard, shook your very existence. Your body flew a few feet into the air and hit the ground again. The world was spinning around you and your ears were filled with an annoying peeping sound. You curled into a ball unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you finally started to recover. You got up and saw that there was light shining upon you. You looked around and found yourself in some kind of tunnel. The ceiling had a huge crack in it and you could see the sun shining through. Then you finally figured it out. Julia\u2019s previous stomps cracked open the ground and while running from her you must have fallen into one of those cracks right into the \u2026 you sniffed \u2026 the sewers. In the distant, you could still hear your goddess girlfriend rampaging and laughing. She seemed to enjoy crushing the military troops and had completely forgotten about you. You imagined her slowly crushing them as they tried to flee, having no chance to actual escape. You knew she would enjoy it. Probably even finger herself while doing it. You noticed that you were getting a hard on just thinking about that. Shaking your head you tried to snap out of it. You did not know how long it would take her to remember you. It was possible that she never even forgot about you and just wanted to make you feel save. You had to get out of here and looking around you realized that luck had gotten you into an actually pretty good situation. She could not see into the sewers and they would probably lead you out of the city. You just had to bear the stench and hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably an hour later you were still wandering through the darkness. On your way you passed a few more cracks in the ceiling. Some of them were large enough for a car to fall through them, there even lay a few cars and busses underneath them. You once again felt that mixture of awe and fear when thinking about just how powerful your girlfriend was. And thinking about how a while ago she grew even bigger made you realize that this was just the tip of the iceberg. You wonder, she said the game was about her being gigantic and trying to catch you, but she never specified what kind of powers she could use. She was all-powerful in this world, but for this game she limited her power to just being gigantic so you had a chance to win. On the other hand, she had already shown that she had no problems with changing the rules. She always liked to make you think you two were playing a fair game, but in the end, she was always just toying with you. Maybe it wasn\u2019t even luck you had fallen into that crack. It was like her to make you think you had a chance, only to destroy your hopes just before you would reach your goal. Like a cat she liked to toy with her prey before finishing it off. Julia was probably even watching your every step with her goddess power, maybe even reading your every thought. You shivered. You just had to hope she was playing fair and you had a chance. You had to reach the exit and then run out of the city without her spotting you. The question was, where exactly was she. You heard her rampage stop some time ago. Then she was just stomping around and taunting you from time to time. But after a while she stopped even that and it was suspiciously silent since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you turned around another corner you could finally see a light. Feeling hope once again you rushed toward it. You imagined what you could do if you would win. Julia promised to give you some power and let you decide what happens next. You felt excited. You could try to switch roles in this cat and mouse game, but you were not sure if you would like that. You could also have giant-sex with her. Or you could give yourself super-strength and super-speed and ask her to let you walk around on her titanic, beautiful body. Just thinking about standing on one of her mountain-sized tits made you run even faster. Finally you reached the end of the tunnel. It seemed that the sewers had originally been going on a bit further here, but it looked almost like the part of the city that used to be here had been torn out of the ground. Before you lay a vast field of ruins and dirt, but behind it you saw a highway leading out of the city. If you would run through the field, Julia would be able to see you, but if you keep to the side, you could stay in the shadow of the surrounding buildings. You were about to get going when suddenly \u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were about to start running when you froze in shock. You could not believe what you were seeing. An enormous boot, bigger than everything you have ever seen, descended from the sky onto the ground a few miles away from the city. When it landed, a deafening rumbling followed, paired with an earthquake that sent you a few feet into the air. You landed on your side. Around you, buildings collapsed. You trembled in fear and despair as another boot joined the first one, sending a second earthquake across the land. Slowly you looked up. Before you stood your all-powerful, more-than-just-intimidating, beautiful goddess-girlfriend Julia. She was so gigantic, the clouds did not even reach her ankles. Your eyes gazed higher and higher while your heart sank deeper and deeper. Her incredible long legs, her sexy hips, her belly, her titanic breasts and her beautiful face, looking down with a strange mixture of pleasure and boredom. You could only guess but she must be at least 24 miles high. There was no way you could do anything. Slowly she moved her left hand to her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eTOMMYBOY, I THINK WE NEED TO TALK!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer booming voice forced you to your knees. It was so loud and painful and yet so feminine and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eTHIS GAME SEEMS TO TAKE FAR LONGER THAN I EXPECTED! WE ALL HAD OUR FUN BUT I THINK WE NEED TO FINISH THIS! SO LET US DO THE FOLLOWING: I HAVE GROWN SO BIG THAT EVEN THE TALLEST BUILDINGS LOOK LIKE PEEBLES TO ME! THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE FOR BOTH OF US! ON THE ONE HAND, YOU CAN NOW MOVE MORE FREELY, BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO SEE YOUR INSIGNIFICANT FORM! ON THE OTHER HAND, I COULD LEVEL ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE CITY WITH JUST ONE STEP! SO THIS IS HOW WE DO IT: IN ONE MINUTE, I WILL STOMP ON A RANDOM PART OF THE CITY! A MINUTE AFTER THAT, I WILL STOMP ON ANOTHER PART AND SO ON! YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW MATHS TO GET THAT AFTER FOUR MINUTES, THE WHOLE CITY IS LEVELED. IN OTHER WORDS, DEPENDING ON YOUR LUCK YOU WILL HAVE FOUR MINUTES AT MAXIMUM TO GET OUT FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. GOOD LUCK, MY SWEET, LITTLE, SPECK-OF-DUST-TOMMYBOY!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter shook you to the core and made a few of the surrounding buildings crumble. You breathed heavily and your hands were shaking. Just her standing and talking was almost to overwhelming to bare. But you still had a chance. You just had to trust that she really could not make you out anymore and started running directly toward the highway. You were not even halfway through the area as you saw one of Julia\u2019s boots rise above the clouds. The expression on her face did not change as she moved her foot over your part of the city. She seemed to stop for a moment, then moved on and slammed down her foot far behind you. The impact shook the ground. You flew into the air and suddenly a gust of wind was sending you forward. You hit the ground and had the feeling that every bone in your body was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after another earthquake send you back up as she placed her foot at it\u2019s previous position. You stood up and to your delight realized that the impact of her stomp had sent you forward. Now you only had half the way left. You started running as newfound hope rose inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eTICK-TOCK! ALMOST HALF THE TIME IS UP!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia\u2019s voice thundered from the sky. You kept running, but eventually, her foot rose again. This time, it hovered in place for a few seconds and then suddenly moved forward at an incredible speed stomping another section of the city behind you. Again, you were sent flying into the air. You looked up and saw an evil grin on her face that soon made way for disappointment, then anger. As you hit the ground you immediately got up and kept running. Your muscles burned and your lungs felt like they would explode any second. You had almost reached the highway when Julia rose her mountain-like boot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eFIFTY-FIFTY NOW! LET\u2019S TEST YOUR LUCK, TOMMYBOY!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot hovered between your quarter of the city and the only other one left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eI THINK IT IS\u2026\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot moved over your area. You could see buildings that got stuck on it, some of them were loosen and falling down. As the ruins were hitting the ground around you, you realized you were in a similar situation just an hour ago. Her foot hovered over you and crushed military vehicles were falling down. Only now, it seemed that her boot was ridiculously small back then compared to that enormous mass of black leather which was hovering above you now. You stopped and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201e\u2026THERE!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a loud booming sound and lost the ground underneath your feet. Landing on your back, you opened your eyes. In the last second, she must have moved her foot above the other quarter of the city. You looked over to it, then moved your eyes higher along her leg and torso to her head, which was blocking the sun. Her colossal body stood still and because of the light behind her head, her face was in shadows and you could not see her expression. But that did not matter. You jumped up and with your remaining strength you reached the highway. Your heart was beating fast. You could see the city border. You could make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\u201eYOU KNOW WHAT, TOMMYBOY. YOU HAD SO MUCH TIME WHILE I PLAYED WITH THE ARMY YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLOSE TO THE EXIT AS I STARTED THIS NEW GAME. SO I CHANGED MY MIND. THREE MINUTES SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH! GOOD-BYE, TOMMYBOY!\u201c</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hearts sank as you heard those words. She was doing it again. Everytime she was about to loose, she just changed the rules. You were filled with disappointment, anger and despair as her boot rose again and hovered above you. No, you could not give up yet. You ran, faster than ever. The sign next to the highway saying \u201aCity Border\u2018 was coming closer as her foot slowly descended upon the remaining part of the city. You felt you were about to collapse but you kept running. Everything around you became dark as it was swallowed by the shadow of her boot which got closer, ready to end all life underneath it. It was like a gigantic monster, sent forth by an even more gigantic goddess of death and despair. Your goal was only a few steps away, but the bottom of her boot was only a hundred feet above you, getting closer by the second. She could have already crushed you, but she enjoyed to lower her foot slowly, making you think you could get away. You smiled. Her sadistic nature seemed to be your last hope. With that in mind, you sprinted the last part of the way.</span></div></div>",

The noise from the impact was overwhelming and the wind it rose made you fly forward, but you did not care. You did it. You had beaten your girlfriend in her own game. Satisfaction filled your chest while a light engulfed you. It got brighter and brighter and you had to close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you opened them again, you were in complete darkness. \"Congratulation! I am so happy for you.\" Your girlfriend's voice came from all around you and sounded more annoyed than happy. Then she appeared before you, but instead of her dominatrix outfit she was just wearing a pair of sneakers, a jeans and a black t-shirt with a creepy smiling face on it. She seems to be a bit upset. Her arms were crossed and she smirked at you mockingly. \"I admit, you were pretty lucky. I should have left out the army and just crush you. As always, my gentle side is my downfall.\" She smiled viciously. \"But a promise is a promise. So what do you want us to do next?\" Julia starred at you with sharp eyes. You knew you were given a certain amount of power, but she did not let you forget that this power was coming from her. She was now your size again and yet her presence was overwhelming. You would never forget the image of her towering over the city at several miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. You knew you should not push your luck, but maybe you could provoke her. Just a little bit. \"Well, how about a cat and mouse game like we just did. But reversed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a deadly look. \"Why don't you just ask for it and see what happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked. \"Well then, how about we both grow gigantic and have sex. I like it to see you tower over everything, but just for once I want to experience it for myself.\" She seemed to think about it, but you already had another idea. \"Or you could grow gigantic again and let me explore your body.\" You grinned like a little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you. \"So I lay down for a couple of hours and do nothing?\" She kept thinking. \"Well how about that: ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step forward, standing now right in front of you. \"We are in a city ...\"<br>\r\nShe moved closer, her face only inches from yours. You could smell her sweet breath. \"... having sex ...\"<br>\r\nShe grabbed your crouch. It hurt, yet it felt pleasant. \"... and the more you get aroused, the more I grow ...\"<br>\r\nShe moved even closer, her breasts pressed against your chest. Her lips right next to your ear. \"... and the more I get aroused, the more you grow ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she backed away, a mocking grin on her face. \"... and after you came way too early, I will lay down for a while and you can climb out of my canyon-sized pussy and walk around on top of my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was just taunting you, but it still hurt your pride. You knew how to please her and you would make sure that both of you would grow at the same rate. But there would probably be a twist to it. There always was. She never played by the rules, not even by her own ones. You were about to agree, but then you stopped. She did not disagree with the reverse cat and mouse game. She even dared you to ask for it. You were not sure if you would like to be the cat, but Julia would not let you be it anyway. More likely she would also give the game a certain twist. She would make you feel you had the upper hand only to prove you wrong the next moment. That thought also excited you. Maybe she would let you be the cat or maybe she would change things a bit. But in what way? There had been many times she proved to be really creative when it comes to toying with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she moved her face close to yours again. \"If you do not decide quickly, I will choose something completely different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Now, what to do. Have sex with your girlfriend while you two are growing, or see what situation she will through you into when asking her for the reverse cat and mouse game. Finally, you decided.</span></div></div>",

She smirked provokingly. \"I could have just sat on the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You grew way too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just made the game more interesting, I even gave you enough time.

So what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled excitedly. \"The rules for this game are simple: You are given a magic sword and have to rescue a beautiful princess trapped in a tower.\u201c Julia smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho might this princess be, you wondered ironically. On the the other hand, Julia did not really strike you as a princess. She was more like a tyrant. But it was unwise to tell her that in the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eAlright, let\u2019s do this. Could be fun.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eOh, it will be, Tommy-Boy.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she vanished. Next, you found yourself in a green field. Behind you was a majestic city, before you a road that lead through some hills. In the distance, white mountains rose high into the air. You noticed you wore an armor that was more for fashion than effectiveness, but at least you had a nice sword. And there was something else. You felt incredible strength. It was amazing. You decided to test it out immediately and sprinted down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the green fields gave way to a dry, desolate land. There, on top of a small hill, was the most cliche evil castle ever, crowned with a massive tower. You guessed Julia did not want you to waste your time looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, getting into the castle was pretty easy. With your increased strength, you effortlessly climbed the walls and quickly reached the tower. You did not even encounter any guards. The inside of the tower was a simple staircase. At the top, a door blocked the way to the highest chamber. It was locked, but with your new power, you destroyed it effortlessly. You felt unstoppable. Quite a nice feeling for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were taken by surprise. You had been sure Julia would pose as your princess. But it was someone else. Wearing a long purple dress, she seemed like a real princess, but her cute face framed by short black hair was unmistakably that of your classmate Emily. For a moment, your eyes were glued to her impressive bosom. Her breasts seemed to burst out of her dress at any moment. Quickly, you forced yourself to look her in the eyes, but she had already noticed and shot you a playfully reproachful smile before getting back into hostage princess mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reaction was quite human. Was she really here in the VR? Suddenly, a cold hand gripped your chest. You remembered that you had been drunkenly flirting with Emily on the party last week. Julia had not been there and Emily had been a a bit too nice. Did Julia know? Was this a trap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eAre you here to save me from the evil sorceress?\u201c Emily\u2019s voice dragged you back into the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvil sorceress, yeah, that was more fitting for your girlfriend. But as you were right know, you felt like you could take her on any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eOf course, my princess. Let me take you to safety.\u201c Surprised at how well you managed to fit into your role, you took Emily\u2019s arm and let her down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the courtyard, someone familiar was already waiting. The skies had darkened, red clouds turning like a spiral. In the center of the courtyard, Julia posed confidently. She was now wearing a tight, black dress that left most of her breasts uncovered. Her eyes glowed in a menacing purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eYou think you can take her away from me, fool?!\u201c Her voice had some echo in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost trembled before the power she was radiating. Only the confidence in your own new powers prevented you from running away. Still, you hesitated for another reason. It was just roleplaying, but you did not want to attack your girlfriend with a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a menacing laugh, Julia made the choice easier for you by transforming into a\u2026</span></div></div>",

A deep roar made the ground tremble and from the darkness, a massive dragon emerged. Its clawed hand was big enough to crush you. Emily screamed in fear. The dragon opened its maw, filled with razorsharp teeth as thick as your arm, and unleashed a gush of black flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you raised your sword. To your surprise, it parted the flames, leaving you and Emily unharmed. It was a magic sword, after all, you guessed. Apparently, Julia wanted to give you a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnleashing a furious roar that hit you like a strong gush of wind, she flew into the air. You realized what she was doing right before it was too late. She opened her mouth and fire rained down upon you. Again, you blocked it with your sword, but the pressure forced you to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment, Julia\u2019s massive claw slammed you onto the ground. Thanks to your improved physical abilities, you were mostly unharmed, but the impact had sent your sword flying. You desperately tried to push her claw away, but no matter how much you struggled, she did not budge. Her serpentine eye hovered above you and you recognized the spark that you had seen ever so often. Her eyes were that of a cat playing with a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a metallic sound caught your attention. Looking up, you spotted Emily. She had taken the sword and tossed it to you. Quickly, you grabbed the handle and swung the blade. Julia backed off, her eyes glowing with fury. She dashed forward, but you ducked under her head and pierced her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body burst into black flames. You cheered. She had given you extra powers to make the game more interesting, but she had underestimated you and Emily. With a victorious smile, you walked back towards your princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eNow I just have to take you back to the castle, my\u2026\u201c You hesitated as you realized Emily was not looking at you. In fact, her eyes, filled with terror, were fixated on something behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you watched in horror as the flames grew higher and higher and reformed into Julia, now standing at 100 foot tall. A hand on one hip and a confident smirk on her face, she seemed not even slightly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWarm-up is over, hero.\u201c Her voice was sweet and menacing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how you were able to beat her. At first, you had thought she would have given you a chance, but now, it seemed more like she had made it impossible for you to defeat her. She was playing the sorceress, but she was still a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eHero.\u201c Emily\u2019s voice was calm. \u201eYou have proven your strength.

Each of her steps made the ground shake and sent a shiver down your spine. She could catch you easily, but she wanted to play. She either did not notice the flute or pretended she did not know what it could do. You highly doubted the latter. She was never one for fairness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you blew the magic item the moment you reached the wall. Hoping for the best, you jumped blindly. Luckily, it worked. After a fall of only two seconds, you landed on soft feathers, Emily safe behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at how fast the creatures was flying, but a sound behind you let you loose confidence quickly. Julia\u2019s malicious laughter echoed across the land. The clouds grew even darker and lighting bolts fired down, exploding where they hit the ground. You did your best to take an unpredictable flight path so that she would not hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you were faster than Julia. As if she had waited for that thought, she teleported in front of you. You increased the height to avoid a collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWere are you going, little fly?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLighting hailed down around you. How could you avoid it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eAbove the clouds.\u201c The answer came from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightning striking left and right of you, the griffon surged higher and higher.

For a moment, all was silent. The blue sky and the bright sun enticed you and briefly let you forget your situation. It lasted only a moment. Then, she clouds exploded, revealing first blonde hair, than a face as big as a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eThink again!\u201c Her voice boomed like a thunderstorm, making you realize just how powerless you were compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she grew even more. Higher and higher she rose until she reached truly gargantuan proportions. When her growth finally stopped, her massive chest was on equal height as you. You felt desperate, like a fly before her ginormous boobs. You were not even one arms length away from her, small enough to be crushed ten times between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you could not give up. There had to be a way. You were the hero and you had to save your princess. Maybe you should go back below the clouds.

You got cucked by both of them, in a way at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden movement brought you back to the situation and made you realize you were still in danger. Julia had grabbed Emily\u2019s shoulder and pulled her closer. The to goddesses\u2019 pairs of tits were on collision course and you were right between them. In an act of desperation, you dashed upwards, but it was too late. The next instance, you were trapped between a seemingly endless mass of titflesh. The sweet scent of the two goddesses overwhelmed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you were teleported into what seemed like a small cage around Julia\u2019s neck. Endless fields of tits unfolded before you and in the sky above, the two goddesses were making out wildly. You felt a mixture of envy and arousal as you watched them go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Emily backed off and bowed down so she could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eI\u2019m sorry Tommy. I was flirting with you the other day because Julia said we should come on good terms. I\u2019m sorry for playing with you.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eDon\u2019t apologies.\u201c Julia stroke Emily\u2019s head. \u201eYou are spoiling him. But enough of that. Now that the cards are revealed, this is boring. Let\u2019s play some else.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she whispered something in Emily\u2019s ears.

Her hands on her hips, she just watched the army, as their bullets were absorbed by an invisible shield. \"Let me fix this.\" She closed her eyes, concentrating. Then, she groaned again. \"Damn, removing them would restart the scenario. Well, then let's do it this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the soldiers, tanks and jets shrank smaller and smaller, until they could no longer be seen. A military jeep had been next tot you. It was now smaller than a pebble. Now, your girlfriend's attention was back to you. Fortunately, you had been able to get some distance between you and her. She looked around, scanning the streets. When her eyes fell upon you, you almost felt an icy grip. \"Found you, Tommy-Boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she started to sprint in your direction. She dashed through skyscrapers and flattened houses. With each of her stomps, her massive tits jumped up and down. When turning around a corner, you reached a bridge. A road sign pointed to the close highway. You remembered the rules of the game. If you managed to leave the city, you would win. The bridge was full of cars and panicking citizens, trying to flee before the giant dominatrix. But one part of the road was free, reserved for the military. With them gone, you were free to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen reaching the middle of the bridge, Julia had reached the beginning. But instead of chasing after you, she stopped, standing still like a giant monolith. The sun reflected on her leather outfit and a soft wind played with her hair. A smirk began to form on her face. Strange, why wouldn't she go after you? Suddenly, you noticed the sides of the roads getting farther away. The road was getting bigger. No... You hit the breaks and jumped out of the cars as soon as it stopped. The car had been shrinking and you with it. Luckily, you have only been reduced to four feet. Damn, she was cheating again.

The sounds of the jungle fill your ears, stepping forward you trip on something and crash to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGettin to your feet for a second time, you turn around looking for what you tripped on and spot a black metallic bar, stepping closer you recognize it as a rifle! You're not some gun professional but from the looks of it that's an M16, used mainly in the vietnam war, looking at the jungle around you it suddenly clicks, this must be a simulation of vietnam! You bend over and pick up the rifle just in case and realize that you're also wearing green army fatigues, you can't understand why Julia is doing this but you press on and walk in a random direction into the jungle the whole while feeling like you're being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cutting and pushing your way through a particularly dense bush you find yourself in a clearing, the sun is shining and you can see mountains in the distance. Turning your view to the right you spot a small green tent on top of a small slope and make your way towards it cutting through the lush tall grass, upon making it to the small campsite you see a malfunctioning radio set and hear groaning coming from inside the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the the flaps covering the entrance of the tent you see a wounded man bleeding out on the cott in the corner of the tent, he jerks at seeing you but relaxes after seeing the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...

Get outta here man...\" he groans clutching his stomach harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey hey easy now, what happened to you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's out here man, you gotta go... Take this and run, she'll be on us both soon...\" he says gesturing to a half opened backpack filled with ammunition and medical supplies. \"But what about-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me... I'm not surviving this one.\" he cuts you off with, \"There's a base... Half a day's walk north... Take the supplies and go, she'll be back soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hesitation is cut short as he snaps at you, \"Get going! Quick.. Go!\" he yells coughing up blood, you stop for a moment and look him in the eyes, nodding you pick up the bag giving him one last look and leave through the entrance. Walking past the defunct radio set spouting out radio chatter you pull the bag straps over your shoulders and begin walking down the hill thinking of the wounded soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you're disoriented but then reach into your pocket fishing out a compass, you start your trek north and walk into the dense jungle soon finding a beaten down dirt path heading north. The sun is in the middle of the sky so you judge that you'll be at the base by nightfall, you can't shake the feeling that you're being watched but you shrug it off as nothing continuing down the path doing your best to look out for any traps if there are any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around an hour of walking the path fades away, you just continue walking north hoping to find another path so as to not get lost, but in all your thinking you don't notice a small meter long flattened area covered by leaves and step strait on it.</span></div></div>",

Please!\" you begged, now struggling against your invisible restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Julia would have none of that, as she made an invisible force shove the breath out of your lungs and pin you down even more tightly, ending your pitiful struggle. Pressing her advantage, her mouth opened wide and her gigantic tongue slid out, starting from the bottom of your body and sliding upwards as you felt her saliva all over you, licking you like a piece of candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her wet tongue slid along your dick, it aroused you to the point that you orgasmed right into her mouth. As she tasted the warm cum, her face pulled away and your restraints eased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste nice, Tommy Boy. Don't worry, I'm not really going to eat you.\" she whispered and then she laughed softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you were no longer pinned down and could move freely.

This time she was completely naked with the exception of a gold crown on her head that had her name engraved into it. Her voice boomed out to you from across the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome, Tommy Boy, to my pleasure palace! I am your Queen, and I command you to approach me! You can use this jet pack to fly over here to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked to your left and noticed a jet pack on the ground that wasn't there before. Strapping yourself in, you start flying. However, you decide to start flying away from her for now. You wanted to take some time to admire this palace. You looked around and admired the vast, beautiful scenery of her throne room, which was decked out with various different paintings of Julia and massive columns leading to the higher floors of the vast structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just never seem to learn, do you Tommy Boy?\" Julia said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you stopped in mid air and you felt yourself being drawn back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you an order, Tommy Boy... You should know better than to go against your queen's orders.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived in front of her giant face, which had a fixed grin of triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As punishment for your disobedience, I'm taking you on a trip straight into my pussy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to fly away, but this time the jet pack disappeared and your entire body became stiff. You were utterly paralyzed as your arms were locked to your sides and your legs became locked together. You tried speaking, but even your mouth was sealed shut. You couldn't even breath as every part of your body was frozen solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little too small for this, so I'll make you just a little bit bigger. Six inches ought to do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body growing as her hand wrapped around you. The seat she was sitting on reclined backwards and folded out to become a vast water bed. She pulled you down to her pussy which she spread open with two fingers on her right hand. You started feeling aroused by the scent, but even your own dick seemed to be locked in place like the rest of your body. The last words you heard before you entered were \"In you go, Tommy boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shoved in face first at high speed. Everything around you was warm and sticky as you slid along the walls and your head collided with her clitoris. But just as you touched it you were pulled out again and then sent right back in, each time going faster and faster as your body was ruthlessly smashed against her clitoris and rubbed all along her vast pussy as a human dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a time that seemed like forever you were finally pulled out and unceremoniously thrown on the marble floor below the bed, you felt like every bone in your body was broken, although the pain you felt was numbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly climbed off the bed, you saw that your girlfriend's face was one of pure delight. She pointed a single finger at you and the pain disappeared. You could move your body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that was fun!\" She said and stomping towards you she shrank down to your size. You simply stood there and stared at her, silently waiting for what she would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tommy Boy, that was probably the best sex I have ever had! But you know what would make it even more fun next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dreaded the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time I could let you move around while I toy with you... Or perhaps I might send in one the girls to lick my pussy while you are inside! Ahhh... Decisions, decisions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally spoke up at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Julia, can you just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted mid-sentence as Julia forced you down to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will refer to me as Queen Julia from now on, slave! And you will only speak when I give you permission! Now, I have decided to...\"</span></div></div>",

Quickly changing her demeanor to be more calm she continued. \"But to answer your question, my old friend Sally has agreed to join in on the VR fun too. Now stand up Tom, and treat my newest arrival with the utmost respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Julia grow back to her full size and saw her walk over to the bed, you then heard a noise on the other side of the expansive room as you heard the loud, thunderous sound of a boot stepping on the marble floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance you saw Sally, dressed in a dominatrix outfit just like Julia. Sally had green hair, blue eyes but she still was smaller proportioned then Julia overall. You knew that just like Julia she also had a domineering streak and was in a full lesbian relationship with Julia, but never before had either of them allowed you to watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped approaching when she stood directly over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there little bug, are you ready to help please your new queens?\" She asked rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo scared and too aroused to say no, you simply called up to her \"Yes, Queen Sally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Julia, I'm pleased to see that you managed to break him into submission so quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she replied Sally lifted you off the ground effortlessly, and you were frozen solid yet again as she gripped you. You were then handed over to Julia, who only smiled and then in a rapid motion shoved you head first into her pussy yet again. This time, however, you remained inside and you felt a tickling sensation behind you as Sally's tongue was slithering all over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the slimy tongue wrap around you completely and pull you straight into her mouth. Your body regained some flexibility but you were still pushed and shoved around inside her mouth rapidly, the powerful tongue savoring you like a piece of candy, all over your body, sampling every part of you. You were eventually spat out onto Sally's palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Julia, you sure have some fine taste in men!\" She loudly complimented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, it's only fair that we share the wealth!\" Julia chimed in as her own face approached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally began laughing Julia's tongue pulled you into her mouth and you were again battered around in a dark cave of saliva. You could now see that two tongues were now competing to grab you as the two Goddesses locked lips in a gigantic kiss. Each time one tongue grabbed you the other pulled you off and grabbed you in a seemingly endless battle of wills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after a long struggle Julia spat you out into her hand. You looked up at her playful face and felt that you no longer had any energy to struggle, but this didn't matter as your body tightened up again and Julia once again shoved you inside her pussy again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now being rapidly pulled in and out like a dildo as Sally used you to pleasure Julia. Each time you were again smashed against the clitoris more and more rapidly and you almost passed out. Just as you felt like you were about to faint, you were pulled out again and felt a massive adrenaline rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! No sleep for our little slave boy just yet!\" Julia laughed as you now felt aware and wide awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however you were pushed back into her pussy legs first and you now directly saw Sally's tongue lick you over as Julia had her final orgasm. A moment later Sally's fingers pulled you out and you were carefully placed on the bedside table. Both of the Goddesses sighed in satisfaction and, feeling your body being able to move again, you walked to the edge of the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw now that both Julia and Sally were now lying in the bed, together in a scene of relaxation. You felt your own body getting sleepy as the adrenaline rush faded and you slowly laid yourself down on the ground and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you woke up, something dramatic had changed.

You ignored her and continued driving until you finally arrived at your house an hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what Julia said and wondered if she was right about what she said but then you pushed the thought out of your mind. If you were really still in the VR she would have done something just then, besides the VR couldn't possibly be this detailed, Right? After a while you decided to head outside again and then to the shopping mall pondering over how Julia was going to fool you into coming back into her reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving in the mall parking lot you made your way inside the building itself, among the mingling crowds when suddenly you heard a sound that was loud enough to rise above the noises of the crowded shoppers. It sounded like a loud thump. You heard it again and this time the ground shook under you and the others in the mall started noticing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No, no, please no. Its just an earthquake. Nothing to worry about. I'll just go outside and...'</i> You started thinking to yourself in a panic before being interrupted by another thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the thumping sound was even louder and the earthquake so powerful the entire building rattled. Then a horrible screeching sound came from the ceiling as you saw the metal being ripped apart. Now the rest of the mall was in a full state of panic, frantically screaming and running for the exits as the screeching sounds droned on and more of the roof came apart. You stood there, mesmerized and rooted to the spot as you saw that what was ripping open the roof were a giant set of fingers. Before long you heard Julia's familiar voice echoing from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to get you, Tommy boy!\" she laughed playfully as she ripped off the entire roof and tossed it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous face blocked out the midday sky above. It didn't take her much time looking before she found you. A devious and playful smile spread across her face as her eyes locked on to your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There you are, Tommy boy!\" She beamed happily, and she withdrew her face from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later her enormous hand descended towards you, and it was then that you decided to run away. Her hand smashed down into the middle of the mall interior, smashing aside shopping carts and shattering store front windows as she blindly groped for you. She then made a playful laugh as she realized that you weren't about to give up so easily. Meanwhile, you quickly ran to your car and started driving away, weaving in and out of the traffic jam until you were on the street. In the distance Julia taunted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can run all you want, but there's nowhere for you to hide from me, Tommy boy! Like it or not, you're still in my world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a moment to compose your thoughts and realized that Julia wasn't bluffing after all. You were still in the simulation the whole time! You cursed yourself as you realized that you were deceived from the very beginning, and you realized that it would be impossible for you to tell the difference between the VR and reality. As you kept driving in your futile attempt to escape from Julia, you spotted another giantess off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sally! You saw that she was pushing over a skyscraper right in the path of your car. You quickly swerved and took a side street as shattered glass and concrete slabs rained down on the street from the crumbling tower. In the distance, Sally's laughter was joined by Julia and you felt a chill go up your spine as you wondered what they would do now that you foiled both of their capture attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drove onto the highway, you didn't need to wait any longer as you watched Julia stand up at her full height with the highway between her legs. She gave you a wink and licked her lips and she casually lifted her boot, smashing that section of highway to pieces. But you made another turn and moved on to the highway exit. This time however another boot landed in front of you, forcing you to slam on the brakes. You then put the car in reverse but before you could move anywhere another boot blocked your escape, trapping your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you now, Tommy boy! I told you that there was no escaping from your goddess!\" Julia laughed as she casually lifted your car in the air and brought it to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite her was Sally, also grinning as she inspected your tiny car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I have to give credit where credit is due. You're a pretty persistent little guy, Tommy boy. And that's part of why I love you so much.\" Julia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then brought her giant mouth in close and kissed your car. She then pulled away and spoke to Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we've caught my little runaway lover here, how about we go wild and finish off the rest of this puny city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sounds like fun!\" Sally said cheerfully, the mischievous smirk never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then yelped in surprise as Julia stuffed your car into her cleavage, giving you an impressive view of her tits and a view of the city below as Julia and Sally began their wholesale destruction of your simulated home town. Entire street blocks and buildings fell before their stomping as she made her way to the laboratory where the VR resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally my dear, woud you care to do the honors?\" Julia asked her partner with a mischievous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, don't mind if I do!\" Sally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Sally began to grow dramatically in size, exploding to several thousand feet in height as her boot crashed down and destroyed the entire building complex in one fell swoop. Her triumphant laughter shook the city like an earthquake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, Sally! Now go out and destroy everything else however you see fit. I have a few things to discuss with Tommy boy here before I join you.\" Julia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then watched as Sally turned around and began slowly and methodically stomping down into the city. Once she had left, Julia pulled you out of her cleavage to speak to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well Tommy Boy, like I said I have to tell you a few things. The first thing is that we aren't actually in the Virtual Reality system at all, the second is of course that I am a real Goddess and I now control reality as a whole!\" she smiled playfully while the full implications of what she said sunk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Julia, this is just part of the simulation. You're just trying to psych me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at you seeing through her ruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose that wasn't the most believable story... And you're right, we are still in the VR. But does it really matter, Tommy Boy? As you've already seen, I can do anything that I want in this virtual world! Nobody can leave without my approval, so you're stuck in here with me until I say you can leave! Face it, Tommy boy! You're just another one of my playthings in here! I can do with you as I see fit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then carefully lowered you to the ground. She then took one final look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to make sure to enjoy every last moment of it!\" She said before she started growing dramatically just like Sally had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could only watch helplessly as this Goddess instantly grew to stand several thousand feet high. She then followed after Sally who was still gleefully smashing city blocks to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something happened which surprised everyone...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sat on the ground, simply looking up helplessly at the two titanic girls. You had more than enough time to soak in just how powerless you really were compared to them as they went off and gleefully stomped everything in their way into oblivion. Each of their footfalls were becoming increasingly distant, but the enormous thuds that accompanied them were still just as loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sally, look over here! I found his house!\" Julia roared as you heard another boom followed by her laughter. \"Oops... Looks like it's a very fragile house.\" She continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though rationally you knew that the house was merely a simulation, you still found yourself unable to hold back your frustration any longer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You just destroyed my house, you maniac!\" You shouted indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly their footfalls stopped, and Julia burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Tommy boy, you don't need your house anymore! You're my plaything now, remember? Playthings don't get to own property!\" She said once she had finished laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm surprised that you're actually able to hear Tom from all the way up here...\" Sally said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, Sally. This <i>is</i> my world, after all! I control everything and nothing in here can escape my notice!\" Julia bragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, almost as if to disprove everything that Julia just said, a loud explosion erupted near you, eliciting a surprised gasp from Julia. You quickly turned around, looking to see if there was yet another giantess in here now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, what you saw was a military fighter jet, and it was flying low above your head. In the distance you saw missiles, as well as what appeared to be tracer rounds. You could see that Julia and Sally were now being pummeled by a full scale military attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did all these little shits come from?!\" Sally asked as she started dancing to avoid the shots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had some military programmed in to have some fun with, but they weren't supposed to attack us until later on! There must be some minor bug in the system... Well, whatever! We can worry about that later! For now, let's just deal with putting <i>these </i>bugs in their place!\" Julia said as she tried to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attacks started to become more and more numerous. Julia quickly teleported herself away, and soon she reappeared near a large group of tanks. She then slowly lowered her foot down onto them, crushing the entire battalion in a single stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Julia's example, Sally teleported over to a location on the other side of the city that you noticed artillery rounds coming from. That area was far enough away that you couldn't see how Sally had gotten rid of her military targets, but you knew that they had been wiped out when you saw that the artillery rounds stopped firing from that direction shortly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fear your goddesses!\" the two massive girls shouted in unison as they both teleported into the center of the city and gave eachother a high five. They then teleported away once again, this time returning to laying waste to the military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then watched in awe as the giantess duo really went to work, stomping down on any approaching soldiers that attempted to use their machine guns and rocket launchers at close range. You were momentarily distracted as some soldiers attempted to push past you, and before you knew what had happened, you were thrown off your feet and sent flying through the air at a very high speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally landed in a nearby garden, your turned around to see that Julia's enormous sole had slammed down mere inches away from where you had been standing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you had a fairly limited view of what was going on from your current position, you could easily see that not even the military's greatest efforts could pose any form of a challenge to the pair of all-powerful girls that towered over the city. Regardless, they continued to step up their attacks. The military's futile attempts to subdue Julia and Sally persisted until your girlfriend decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Julia and Sally continued to try and destroy more forces, the attacks simply became more and more ferocious. Eventually Julia had gotten fed up with it all, and she shouted out angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, without any warning, time itself appeared to stop. All of the military forces in the city simply halted, with artillery shells and missiles floating in mid air. Julia then paused for a few seconds. She whispered something into Sally's ear which made her giggle in delight, and then Julia dusted herself off and took a few deep breaths before suddenly disappearing. Sally grinned mischievously and waved at you, then she disappeared herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, time returned to normal and the shells and missiles simply missed their targets. After that, however, and you noticed a shadow envelope the entire city. Looking upward, you saw Julia and Sally were now both looming over the entire city. Julia was sitting down with her legs bracketing the whole city while Sally was on the other side, sealing off an any form of escape. It didn't take long for you to notice that both of them were naked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to die, bugs!!\" Julia boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw Sally's enormous face lower itself towards the city. Her tongue stuck out and she started licking your girlfriend's pussy like she did back in the pleasure palace. Globs of saliva the size of boulders were flicked in all directions, smashing into buildings and flattening the military and civilians indiscriminately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, the military once again turned their guns on the two titans, but their attacks ineffectively bounced off them. You honestly doubted that they even felt any of the bullets at all at their current size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground shook and buckled as Julia's position shifted, and she casually annihilated the outer suburb on the right of the city with a single building sized finger, sending debris flying in your direction. Some of this debris hit you, but to your surprise it didn't cause any damage to your body. You assumed this was because Julia wanted to shield you from harm during her apocalyptic lesbian sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sally didn't let up. She started licking harder, even using her hands to pull Julia's pussy open even wider as she started lifting up whole sections of the city and unceremoniously shoving them inside as Julia's moans of pleasure increased. You now saw her fingers approach the part of the city you were in and you were swept up by the titanic digits. She probably didn't even notice you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react in any meaningful way, you were plunged head first along with the entire street and several massive skyscrapers into this giant wet black hole. Your whole body was completely covered in what you realized was Julia's vaginal fluids and Sally's saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed out to them to try and get their attention, but your cries were unable to reach them in the heat of their passion. You soon crashed down onto a wet and sticky surface that buckled and shook underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal darkness surrounded you as you heard the sounds of more debris from the broken city rain down around you in the form of broken glass, police sirens, car alarms, screaming people and even the sound of exploding shells. The smell inside Julia's giant pussy was incredibly arousing and you felt incredibly horny, but the sounds of an entire city being destroyed kept you out of your reverie even as you heard Sally laughing and daylight appear high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish off the city! Trample everyone and everything!\" Julia instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then heard Sally giggle deviously as she sent her colossal foot crashing down, stomping out whatever remained of the city and destroying everything in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, Sally! Now, I think that it's time to get Tommy boy and flush the remaining microbes out of my pussy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were back in daylight once again, now sitting in the middle of a grassy field. Turning around, you saw the two naked Goddesses standing over the ruined city, which was now nothing more then a series of footprint shaped craters. Next the environment shifted again, and you now appeared back in a familiar place - The VR room that you had earlier awakened falsely into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia and Sarah approached you, both now fully clothed and back at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright Tommy Boy, you're going back in.\" Julia announced to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was smiling and she spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Goddess girlfriend here has to run some errands and get some supplies. She wants to have a long term stay in the VR, and while she's gone I get to play with you to my heart's content!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia placed her hands on her hips and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You can do whatever you want with him while you are in there, but just try not to scar him for life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls both giggled at the idea, and you simply cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No way Julia! I've had enough of this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get away, but Julia and Sally grabbed you by your wrists and forced you back into the VR chair before you could escape. With the two of them working together to overpower you, there was nothing that you could do to stop them. You were easily hooked back up to the VR system once again, and this time you were restrained to the seat so that you couldn't get up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tommy boy, I wasn't planning to let you out of the VR for real in the first place. But unfortunately, there is a bug which causes everyone to be ejected whenever one person decides to leave. Sally, I think you can do the honors of re-activating the VR this time around.\" Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally simply grinned as she went over to the control panel and initiated the system. You couldn't do anything as the helmet once again lowered onto your head and the world faded into blackness. Shortly afterwards, Sally's voice echoed around you. You noticed that it had a cheerful tone to it, like that of a girl who just got a new pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tom. Julia won't be back for several days now. You see, this machine has a really cool time dilation feature, so we'll be able to spend lots of quality time together until she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laughter echoed around you as she now set the tone of what she was going to do with you over the next few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to play with you, my little Tom. And now that Julia isn't around anymore...\"</span></div></div>",

Looks like I was wrong when I said Julia had made you nice and obedient. She is a bit too soft, really. But now that she isn't around anymore, I can safely put you through my own form of obedience training. Now, I'm only going to say this one more time: <i>on your knees!</i>\" Sally said dominantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you still stubbornly refused and folded your arms in defiance. At that moment, however, your arms moved involuntarily and your body constricted. You tried to cry out in pain, but even your mouth was sealed shut as you felt your whole body constrict into the kneeling position with your arms firmly locked behind your back. Sally was laughing in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Julia isn't around right now, I'm able to control this world in her place. The environment, your body, and when I have finished with you even your mind will be mine to do with as I please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, the environment abruptly changed to that of a wide open grassy field. You were still bound into the kneeling position when you saw Sally move into view, she was dressed in a dominatrix outfit similar to that of Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Up, Tom Tom.\" she commanded and the constriction around your body lifted from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back up and glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Still out for more then, Tom Tom?\" She asked, and your whole body felt as though it were on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was intense, but you weren't going to give up so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fuck you, Sally! Julia will be back eventually, so you can't make me into a permanent slave!\" You screamed out at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said that the pain began to subside, and Sally simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Was it not Julia that helped me grab you and throw you back in the simulator? When she gets back, she'll have her very own slave to play with. A talking dildo and manservant!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then paused for a bit before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Besides, I will break you in a few days anyway. This is just a warm up exercise. You see, the fun thing about this is that once I've made you into a proper slave you'll keep coming back into this virtual world time after time again! Now, its time to put you into place you little worm!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she said that, you suddenly started to shrink.

Then, the walls and ceiling disappeared and you found yourself in an incredibly gigantic cave. You were lying on top of a high stone pillar. The ground of the cave was made of lava, emitting an ominous, red glow. The next thing you saw was Julia, rising up out of the flaming hot liquid. She must be around 500 feet tall. In addition to her dominatrix outfit, she wore two devil horns and a tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"This is the hell I created specifically for cheating Tommy-boys! Let me show you enjoy the consequences of trying to cheat on me, you little worm!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n She moved her face closer and blew on you. Her breath washed over you, making the air temperature rise to an unbearable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then grabbed a string attached to your cocoon-like prison and held you before her. You knew she was angry, and even at normal size she could be really intimidating. With her as big as she was now, and with the flickering red light of the lava illuminating her from below, she truly looked like a demon. But terrifying as she was, she still looked incredibly hot and you couldn't help getting hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia grinned maliciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"This makes you feel aroused? Well, then I hope you like torture!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she held her other hand under you. Flames started burning in her palm. You screamed in pain, trying to free yourself. Eventually, you realized that you were powerless. You tried to endure the pain and finally, it ended. But just as you started to relax, the flames shot up again, hotter than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia, stop this! I learned my lesson, I am sorry! I would never cheat on you! Never ever!\", you screamed at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's laugh echoed throughout the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Yes, beg for mercy, tiny, helpless Tommy-Boy. But be sure, I have even more in store for you. I'll make sure you will never ever dare to even look at another woman.\"</font> Julia then held you high into the air.</span></div></div>",

She seemed unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bug. He just got a faulty code from some previous version of the program. We've experienced some things like this but...never this detailed,\" she said trailing off as the man arrived. He wore a dark hat, shiny leather shoes, and dark glasses. He stood in front of you and Julia. \"See, he can't talk. Gimme a sec, I'll fix it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia snapped her fingers, and looked troubled when nothing happened. She did it again with the same results. Then the man removed the glasses to reveal piercing blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you aren't Julia and Tom are you?\" The mysterious man said. Julia was amazed. Then she looked frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't talk...I...we...you haven't been given any programming. You're a freak. I need to reboot the system...\" Julia began to make complex motions but the man gestured and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am far from a 'freak'. I am what you might compare to an agent. From the Matrix. However, this system is not the one trying to destroy you. There is another user, who is trying to capture us. He drew you here because he has the most power here. I must ask you to come with me. If you stay the spruces may attempt to kill you.\" He surveyed the area, and you followed his eyes. The people around you did seem to notice you more. A few had stopped to stare at your group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible, we'll just come back. There are failsafes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid this has gone beyond those. They have already begun to turn hostile. I need you to do as I tell you. I am going to open a portal and you must go through. I will see you on the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You might have done this, but just then one of the characters jumped you with a wicked knife. Just barely, you managed to dodge the first thrust but you fell and instantly the others joined in. The agent took out a gun and shot into the oncoming crowd after putting a bullet in your attacker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must hurry, these weapons were programmed on the parameters of existing weapons. I will have to reload.\" The agent pointed at a space in the air and a swirling vortex appeared. Without a second though you grabbed Julia, who may or may not have been moving in that direction and leapt through. Just before your mind faded to black you saw the man straighten his lapels and calmly step through the portal.</span></div></div>",

Like we could die in here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia bit her lip, \"Well you know how they say if you die in a dream you don't wake up? That's something that could happen here. The shock of 'death' could cause your body to go into cardiac arrest or you could turn into a vegetable. Of course there are fail safes but those look like they have been stripped somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still can't believe what you are hearing, you sit down in the rain trying to take it all in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia says, \"But hey we aren't defenseless in here either. You can control your appearance in here. You have control over your own personal space, though another user could interfere and it takes a bit of concentration. Here, let me give you an example.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Julia's outfit vanished and instead she was wearing a tight latex catsuit and holding an AK47. Julia grinned and said, \"Now you try.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm you think, if you could wear something what would you do? You ask Julia a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So say I decide to wear Kevlar and you shoot me with that weapon, it would be stopped?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I wore armor instead?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia thought for a second, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, armor probably wouldn't be stopping any bullets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what if I wore magical armor, is it based on my imagination or what?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia stopped to think for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I don't know. But I don't think you can just think 'I'm wearing invincible armor\" and have it equipped, I believe it has to have a real world equivalency.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished talking a horde of humanoid creatures, some with your features and wielding knifes appeared on the street ahead of you.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?

Am ideal weapon would be a chaingun of some kind. Like magic, one sprung into your hands. It was very heavy, but you could still hold it. It was a lot more complicated to get it started than pulling a trigger. But finally it began to fire death into the oncoming foes. You and Julia fought as hard as two people with no combat training could, but that wasn't good enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weapon ran out of bullets, and although there were boxes of ammunition all around you had no idea how to reload one. Instead, you gave yourself a shotgun and began blasting away. All at once, the enemies were on top of you. You kept shooting. Nothing else was visible outside the whirl of bodies trying to kill you. After what seemed like hours, but could have only been seconds, the shotgun to was out of shells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to strike with your fists, and the first humanoid you touched exploded in a pink mist. At first you thought you were super strong, but behind the monsters three Bradleys rolled up the street. Soldiers piled out, firing at the retreating enemies. They moved with true military efficiency, unlike your and Julia's frantic struggle. When a soldier passed a wounded program, they showed more ruthless efficiency. Each one got a bullet to the head, regardless of whether it was surrendering, pleading, or running. It partially made you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are just doing as they are ordered.

All around the ship was a seemingly endless ocean in calm waters on a bright and sunny day. You looked down at yourself and realized that you now only had boxer shorts on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" Julia's voice sounded from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to see Julia lounging on a beach chair in a blue bikini, sipping from the straw in a glass of lemonade. She laughed at your shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to my pleasure cruise, Tommy Boy.\" she said as she put the glass of lemonade down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, this entire world is virtual, but anything that I create in here might as well be the real deal. See all these people here?\" She pointed at the tourists on the ship that were dancing and playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of these people are simulations. At the laboratory, we uploaded the brains of various vic-I mean volunteers to create these people. As such, they should behave just like normal humans would... At least in most cases, anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked at the ground again and noticed a tourist running into a wall continuously. Julia pointed at him and he disappeared and reappeared shortly afterwards a short distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But enough about the simulated people...\" Julia said as she waved her hands and all of the tourists disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then got up from her chair and continued speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to show you just what this virtual world can do for me and you, Tommy Boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if at her command the boat started shaking. Looking to the side you noticed the calm ocean had started to become rough, with large waves washing water over the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed hold of the railings as the boat rocked back and forth. Julia approached you, unfazed by the movement of the boat. She then whispered into your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready for the ride of your life, Tommy Boy, because you are in my world now! And in my world, I am a Goddess!\" She laughed softly and the waves began to calm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Julia then climbed up onto the railing and dived into the ocean. You looked over the railing and saw her swimming around. You had never seen her swim with such ease before. As you tracked her swimming she led you to the front of the boat, where she paused to wave at you and blow you a kiss. You then saw her dive underwater and you lost sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, you saw the water around the boat start to churn again. Just then you saw Julia's head, now as large as the boat itself, begin to emerge from the water. The waves caused the boat to almost capsize as the ship was forcefully thrown back by her gigantic presence. When you looked at Julia again you saw both of her tits, barely contained within her massive bikini, floating about on the surface of the water while her face held a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even react, she lifted both her hands from the ocean and you saw them grab onto the ocean liner. You were forced down onto the deck as she began to lift up the entire ship, and her booming laughter reverberated around you. She opened her mouth wide and her tongue slid across the top of the ship, smashing up windows and causing various articles of furniture to fall onto the deck below. She then pulled the boat to the side and placed it in between her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there mesmerized as those two gigantic orbs of feminine flesh closed in on the ship. Julia slowly squeezed her tits together, and as the pressure gradually increased, the hull of the boat eventually started to buckle under the strain. Soon it finally gave way, unable to resist the crushing power of your giant girlfriend's enormous breasts any longer. As the ship started collapsing, you instinctively jumped off the ship and into the water below. However, before your body ever made contact with the virtual ocean, an invisible force caught you in midair and lifted you up in front of Julia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done just yet, Tommy Boy.\" She said to you in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lifted the battered ship from between her tits, and the broken vessel quickly repaired itself. Before you knew what was happening, you found yourself back on the deck, once again staring up at her face which now curled in a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know Tommy Boy, I really do hate salt water... I think it's time for me to make a few changes to this place...\" Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as she said that, the entire environment started changing again.

Julia was no where to be seen, which surprised you as the tub wasn't as vast as the ocean. Off in the distance you could see the sides of the bathtub, and beyond those the tiled walls. Looking around, you saw the other tourists had reappeared. They stared over the rails at the huge soap drifts just like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boat was moving past one particularly big lump at high speeds. One tourist reached out to touch it's very tip, but his hand didn't go clean through the soap. His arm buckled as if he'd hit something solid and he spun overboard. The rest of the people started to panic, desperately pointing at him as he swam along the side of the boat. It moved to fast for him to keep up, so he set out for the mass of bubbles that had sent him overboard. The captain had been alerted, and he'd slowed the ship to a crawl. You ran to the back to watch the man swim up to the bubbles and try to climb them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked surprised to find something firm beneath the suds, but proceeded upwards. As he reached the top of the tower of bubbles, about 20 feet above the surface of the water, ripples and waves rocked the cruise liner. They lapped against the bubble island the castaway was standing on, and washing away some of them. Below the crust of bubbles was a layer of golden material that resembled-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the ship chose that moment to shoot vertically into the air. Instinctively, you clutched onto the rail. Others farther away from things to grab went flying off the back into the soapy water below. The boat began to slide down some surface, and you glimpsed Julia's grinning face far above you. The castaway now saw he was stranded on one of her massive breasts, which almost dwarfed the ship you were on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no more time for thoughts, because the ship's inertia made it plunge deep into the water. Holding your breath, you saw Julia's stomach and legs extending far off into the murky tub. Then the ship popped up like a cork, and her upper body towered over the cruise ship. The man still desperately clutched at her boob, trying not to slip. Julia finally noticed him, and one gigantic hand reached for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky little bugger!\" she cried happily, snatching him from his perch. \"I bet you'll want some more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the tiny man all over her arms and face, finally popping him in her mouth and devouring him. With that distraction gone, the giantess turned her attention back to the boat floating below her rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I seriously not have any privacy in the bath?!?!\" Julia said, pretending to be outraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater fell in torrents from her hair, while puffs of foam gave her jiggling boobs the slightest bit of decency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't just let this go. I guess we'll just have to work something out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A sadistic smile crossed her face, and she reclined in the tub. At least twenty people floundered in the sudsy water off the back of the boat. The water around them began to froth and bubble, and then Julia's giant vagina erupted from the water beneath them. They were instantly swallowed by the maw, and Julia laughed. Her arm arched over the ship into her pussy, and got her going. Her gaze shifted back to the boat, a devilish gleam in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you guys want in on this too! Oh, don't run in panic like you don't. Look, this guy's having fun!\" She pulled out a finger, with a small stain on it. \"Well, he <i>WAS</i> having fun...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's other hand pulled the cruise liner towards her face. The ship passed through the gap between her breasts, both dwarfing the ship. You watched as the giantess's arm brushed one lump of flesh, sending it falling towards the boat. You dove out of the way as it crashed into the side, smashing through metal and crunching terrified onlookers into pulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! Sorry guys, didn't mean to do that really!\" Julia got out between giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Abruptly, the boat reversed course. You tried to join the rush to the front of the boat and away from her rapidly approaching sex. Others got in front of you and knocked you down, and you could only watch as she spread her lips to accept the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait. This might be a little uncomfortable. Let's make this a little easier.\" Julia scooped handfuls of soap from the water and off her body, leaving only a tiny dollop to cover her tantalizing breast. She winked at the boat, almost directly at you, and blew a kiss in your direction sending soap flying. Then she rubbed the sides of the cruise liner down with the pink bubbles as lube. Her other hand skimmed over the top, scraping off antennas, ropes, and some unfortunate tourists. Biting her lip and glancing it over, Julia deemed it ready and began sailing it towards her womanhood.</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, her giant head surfaced, creating waves which almost sank the ship. Her gigantic mouth then came closer, her red lips parting, while the water her movements pushed away forced the wreaked boat back towards Julia's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sally's massive tongue shot forward, pressing the ship into your girlfriend's vagina. Sally sighed deeply and you could also hear Julia moan in the distance. The moist air and the heat around you made it hard to breath. As the ship was trapped between the giant tongue and the inner walls of the massive female cavern, the metal slowly gave in. Eventually, the ship broke with one pitiful final shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew through the air, but did not land in the water. Instead, you found yourself on a soft surface. Shocked, you realized you where on Sally's tongue.

It did not take long for you to figure out that it was your girlfriend's nipple.

You quickly realized it was Julia's foot. So you were now approximately one foot tall, maybe a bit smaller. At least, you have grown enough to interact with your girlfriend. Some steps (to you) away, you spotted Sally, waiting in the shadow of Julia's other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my little lovers.\" Julia's voice was still awe-inspiring, but at least not as thunderous as before. Her toes wriggled playfully. \"Here is the challenge. The first one of you who reaches one of my nipples will earn my grace. But to make it more interesting, I will alter your sizes over time.\" A clap boomed across the beach. \"Begin! Try your best to impress me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, you ran past Julia's foot and climbed her leg. Then you stopped. Julia was completely nude, her massive breasts laying flat on her chest. You could not help but drool at the sight. But then, you spotted Sally in the corner of your eye. She had already made her way to Julia's knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dashed forward, gaining speed by the second. You were a faster runner than Sally, at least outside of Julia's virtual realm. When you reached your girlfriend's hips, you had caught up with your rival. The smell of Julia's pussy was getting more intense and gave you soft knees, but you managed to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt like falling. Your girlfriend's divine body expanded under your feet. You were shrinking. Finally, you stopped at one inch tall. A look to your right revealed that Sally had also shrunken, but she was still a head taller than you. Yet, you managed to run faster than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to keep balance on Julia's soft skin. From this close, it looked even more perfect, you thought while you ran past her belly button, trying not to stumble on her abs. Eventually, her breasts came into view, towering like small hills. You felt like falling again, then the hills had become small mountains. But you could not give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering your remaining strength, you climbed Julia's right tit. Sally seemed to be having a harder time and quickly vanished behind the curve of the mass of boob-flesh. Finally, you reached the top. Your girlfriend's nipple was right before you, her beautiful face filled the sky behind it. She winked. \"You must reach the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you shrank again. Her nipple was now a massive spire, towering at ten times your size. Gritting your teeth, you made your way across the pink surface. You had to win this.</span></div></div>",

You just hoped Julia would not shrink you even more. Breathing heavy, you reached the pink mountain. You turned around. No sign of Sally. After catching your breath for a few seconds, you got ready for the climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, darkness swallowed the vast landscape around you. You gulped and with a bad feeling in your gut, you looked up. You cursed on the inside. Sally's massive face filled the sky. Her lips curled into a mocking smile. \"Seems I will reach the top first, 'Tommy-Boy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer booming voice sent you to your knees as you realized there had not been a competition. You were still the plaything of these two goddesses. Sally's lips parted and the sight of the gaping abyss that was her mouth sent shivers of awe and fear down your spine. You were afraid, frustrated and aroused at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a massive, pink, monstrous tongue extended out of the sky-filling mouth and onto the mountain-sized tit, sending earthquakes across the surface. Her tongue moved closer, like a gargantuan wall of doom, a moving mountain. You did not even try to dodge it. You would have failed anyways. Soon, you found yourself pressed and tossed against Sally's tongue and Julia's nipple, loosing sense of up and down quickly. The sweet smells of Sally's mouth was all around you as you were quickly soaked in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sally backed up slowly. You ended up hanging in the middle of a threat of saliva, connecting tongue and nipple. You were just a speck of dust, powerless and a slave to the will of your girlfriend. When your vision blurred again, you quivered in fear of what would come next.</span></div></div>",

She had a new outfit on, a tight, white dress, with black stripes going across her waist. \"Had fun dearie~? What's the matter? You look to be a bit mad~\" she laughs as you cross your arms over your chest, glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know I hate that bitch sally. So, what do you do? Make her in this virtual world and say she's your girlfriend? You know i've been cheated on before, you KNOW how sensitive I am about that! We agreed you wouldn't--\" you growl in frustration. \"I have half a mind to call off the whole relationship right now. In fact, you know what? That's it. You went too far julia. Too far. How do I turn this thing off?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's expression shifts from her normal domineering sneer to one of worry, then to one of sadness. The white, grid-like room around you starts to darken, the panels all shifting to become black. the spaces between the panels start to glow red as she starts walking towards you. Her fair skin seems to crack like a porcelain doll, the cracks glowing with the same red light as the panels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're leaving? You can't leave! Get back here this instant!\" She yells at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over your shoulder, and spit on the floor in her general direction. \"Fuck you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe freezes, her knees trembling. Her expression becomes even more heartbroken, before shifting to one of rage. The cracks grow bigger, and she stomps her foot on the ground. \"I said... get BACK HERE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she says this, wires shoot out from between the panels, wrapping around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me go you crazy bitch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA current of electricity surges through the wires, zapping you with enough energy to kill a small elephant. However, in <i>her</i> realm, that means nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks around you, glitching out at your side, and appearing right in front of you. She glares up at you, before a smile crosses over her face. \"I'll be honest. I really, truly love you. You, and only you.  Please don't leave.\" She gives you her best pleading face, which- even with the gaping cracks- is still very beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression returns to one of rage. \"Never!\" She screams at you. \"I-if I keep you here, you can't leave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm, only to receive another shock. \"Why can't you just create another me in the simulation?  Maybe one who doesn't care when you FUCKING CHEAT ON ME with that whore sally!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your shoulders, pulling you closer. \"It's not the SAME!\" She lets you go, taking a step back. Her expression going back to one of intense sadness. The lights behind the cracks in her face seem to dim as she tearfully stares at you. \"It's just not the same...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it had been even just an hour earlier, you'd be comforting her, and apologizing, but not now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia.\" She looks up at you. \"Let me go. Now. Then tell me how to exit this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a sob, crumpling into a heap on the ground.

You looked down from the deck of the ship you were in and noticed that this liquid was also fizzy. You also noted that Julia was nowhere to be found. You decided on a whim to jump from the deck of the ship. You believed that the water below was probably fake or something, especially after Julia prevented you from falling into it. But as you dived in, you quickly realized it was real, and it tasted like cola!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now realized that she had filled the entire ocean with cola, at least it was better then salt water. You swam around in the cola for a while until you felt the currents becoming rougher, you quickly began climbing up the ladder back on to the boat, but before you could reach the top you saw your gigantic girlfriend once again emerge from the deep, this time even bigger then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth, giving you a glimpse into her wide open maw which could easily swallow the entire ship. You instead felt a hot wind envelope you as she blew on the ship. The typhoon knocking you back and pinning you against the cabin of the ship. She just laughed playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>this</i> drink is delicious! In fact, I think I'll add some Tommy Boy to it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, her tongue lapped out and swept underneath the ship, causing it to rock back and forth until her tongue started retracting back into her mouth with the ship still  on it. You held on tightly as you entered her dark gaping maw and watched it close behind you, plunging you into complete darkness. You feared that she would swallow you, but instead her wet slimy tongue wrapped around you in the darkness, you heard the loud noise of the boat being torn and ripped apart as you were lifted away, and her tongue set to work playing with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved you about, pushing you into each corner of mouth as she licked you. Terrified and aroused simultaneously, you were pushed and pulled faster and faster. All the while, you were completely blinded in the darkness as you hopelessly attempted to anticipate her next move. After what seemed like an eternity, she unexpectedly spat you out of her mouth and you landed in cola ocean. Quickly looking up you, saw your girlfriend take a drink from the liquid, keeping her head away from you to prevent the current sucking you back into her mouth. You looked around, but didn't see the ship anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really is quite refreshing. Alright Tommy Boy, time for the next round.\" she said as she giggled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then lifted out of the water by an invisible force and approached her massive cleavage, floating in mid air as you gained a birds eye view of the mountains of flesh below. She then placed both her hands behind her back and unhooked her bikini, letting her enormous orbs move freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like what you see, Tommy Boy?\" She asked as you landed on top of one of these gigantic, fleshy islands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw your girlfriends hands reach down and squeeze her nipples, causing the flesh underneath you to buckle and quake as she let out a gasp of pleasure. Her entire body seemed to recline backwards as you climbed up her boob to arrive on her nipple. You then saw that both of her hands were reaching down into her bikini bottom, now visible over half a mile away as she lied on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she gasped in pleasure, and you quickly realized that she was now fingering herself. You then uttered a cry of surprise as she then held the boat you thought lost in her right hand and slid it underneath her bikini bottom, using it as a dildo as she started fucking herself with it. She increased the pace and slid the bikini bottom off completely as the boat was relentlessly thrusted in and out her enormous pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitnessing this incredible sight turned you on immensely, and you couldn't resist reaching down into your pants and masturbating. Evidently, Julia seemed to notice and decided to interrupt you by teleporting you onto the ship as it continuously plunged in and out of her pussy, throwing you around like a rag doll. Each time you were savagely thrown against the walls of the cabin, but you felt no pain even as you flayed about helplessly. Minutes later, a final sigh of pleasure filled the air, and the movement then stopped as the ship was gently lowered back into the pool. You were too exhausted to say anything as her mouth moved close to the ship and she spoke to you in her feminine yet dominant demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I built this world for my pleasure Tommy Boy, not yours. You can only play with your dick when I command you to.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Julia-\" you protested before being cut off by her shout of \"SILENCE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My world, my rules Tommy Boy. If you disobey, I will punish you using all the tools at my disposal. And for that outburst of disobedience, I will punish you right now, but only lightly since it is your first infraction against the rule of your Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your entire body constricting as your arms and legs were bound together by an invisible force, and Julia made a maniacal laugh as you were pinned down to the floor of the boat. In the next moment Julia appeared in the doorway at her normal size, now dressed in her favorite dominatrix outfit as she strutted over to your helpless body and squatted down in front of you. She started rubbing herself against you, letting you feel the leather on your skin. It started making you aroused but your dick would not respond as you remained immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always remember Tom. You are trapped in my world now, and I can control every part of your body at any time and any place.\" She said as began to further rub against you as the pain of your arousal increased by her cock teasing dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then raised herself from the ground and you felt movement return to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Get up, Tommy Boy. We have so much more to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her face you saw a charming and beautiful smile that concealed more sinister thoughts, and you now helplessly trembled as the boat disappeared around you, only to be replaced moments later by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that you chose to date her in spite of her extremely childish appearance and mannerisms earned you the nickname of \u201cCradle Robber\u201d among your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Amy said, looking at the industrial-looking warehouse-like building. \u201cThis is it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cWhat, you found a stuffed scorpion in here?\u201d Amy was always finding things and labeling them \u201ccute,\u201d regardless of common sense or any kind of common defining characteristic. One time, she got you to go to the city dump and dig out a life-size statue of Colonel Sanders. And that wasn\u2019t even the worst thing she\u2019d had you do for her over something she considered \u201ccute,\u201d although it was thankfully the smelliest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Amy asked, looking up at you in confusion. \u201cWhy would I want a stuffed scorpion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you want a bleached-pink grandfather clock that didn\u2019t even tell time anymore?\u201d you asked. \u201cWhy would you want the KFC statue? Or the old, furless Furby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re cute,\u201d Amy said. \u201cScorpions\u2026 bleah.\u201d She made a face, with her tongue sticking out. \u201cThis is dad\u2019s workplace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dad\u2019s workplace,\u201d you repeated. \u201cPlease tell me we\u2019re not going to interrupt his work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, Tom-Tom,\u201d Amy said. Tom-Tom was her nickname for you. She wouldn\u2019t stop no matter how many times you told her to. \u201cThe thing I wanted to do with you won\u2019t disturb anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d you said. Despite your griping, you looked forward to each and every date that you and Amy went on. If they weren\u2019t fun themselves, (and they were virtually guaranteed to be because of Amy\u2019s personality) then Amy found a way to make them fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped in\u2026 and it was like entering a whole other world. Gone was the dull, grey pallor of the outside, to be replaced by a thriving world of nerdy-looking people in white lab coats talking, drinking coffee (at least you hoped it was coffee) and occasionally carrying a bundle of papers in their arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Amy took your hand and led you through the throng and down a few corridors. The scientists didn\u2019t seem to pay Amy much attention, you noticed, although you drew a few surprised glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Amy,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amy asked you on the run as she led you deeper and deeper into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026 is your father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad? He owns the place,\u201d Amy said. \u201cHe\u2019s also the head researcher, so everyone takes him so seriously. It\u2019s boring,\u201d she confided, \u201cbut he lets me use the vrum anytime I want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the vrum?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see!\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Amy stopped dragging you when you reached a door in the very back of the facility. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the place that the vrum is at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s this \u2018vrum\u2019 thing anyhow?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome and see,\u201d Amy said, pushing the door open. \u201cHey, Mac!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Researcher MacDugald,\u201d said a redhead scientist with a thick beard. He glared at Amy. \u201cHere again, are you? I don\u2019t know what your father\u2019s thinking, letting a child like you here so often. I certainly wouldn\u2019t allow it. Don\u2019t tell me, you want to use the Virtual Reality Machine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Amy said brightly. \u201cWait, did you just call me a kid? Because I\u2019m not a kid anymore! I can even drink soda if I want to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacDugald rolled his eyes. \u201cI suppose we do need some new test subjects every now and then,\u201d he said. \u201cJust don\u2019t blame me if it shorts out on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVirtual Reality,\u201d you said. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d MacDugald said, slowly, as if speaking to a small child. \u201cVirtual Reality Machine, also called the VRM. The best anywhere. It takes your consciousness and adapts it into data, and overlays that data into a computer program that lets you create your own environment.\u201d MacDugald gradually started talking faster, as though he genuinely enjoyed talking about it \u2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201curaaAAAaahh,\u201d Amy yawned. \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacDugald rolled his eyes again. \u201cYou are so immature,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, you may be hooked up to the VRM. You know how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hooked you up, and then herself. \u201cOkay, Mac,\u201d she said. \u201cHit the button.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Researcher\u2026 oh, never mind,\u201d MacDugald said, and pushed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You began to drool at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Amy said, giggling as she saw the dazed expression on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say a word, Amy vanished into thin air. Soon a small city began to manifest around you, and you felt the ground starting to shake. Looking around, you saw Amy stomping toward the city. She towered over everything around her at a massive 100 feet tall, and a playful grin was spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom-tom, where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!\" Amy chanted playfully as she searched the city for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the initiative, you ran toward her and waved your arms to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! I'm down here!\" You yelled up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your voice, your titanic girlfriend turned her head and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, there you are! Come here little guy!\" Amy said as she reached down and scooped you into the palm of her hand. She then laid down on her back and placed you between her breasts. \"So Tom-tom, are you ready to do this now?\" She said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready whenever you are, my beautiful goddess!\" You said, planting a kiss on the side of one of your girlfriend's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're such a sweet talker Tom-tom. Alright then, let's get this party started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy plucked you from her chest and moved you down between her legs. She then thrust you into her pussy and began using you as a dildo. As she thrust you in and pulled you out, you began to get incredibly aroused. Amy was in complete control, and you were nothing but a sex toy to her. She continued to pleasure herself with your tiny body until finally neither of you could hold back any more. Amy shoved you all the way into her vagina and held you in there, allowing your squirming to drive her over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her soaking wet walls squeezing against and pulsing with pleasure drove you to climax as well, and with a moan both you and Amy came at the same time. You were quickly washed out of her pussy by a tidal wave of your girlfriend's love juice, and the two of you laid there in the middle of the city, panting from the intensity of your passionate lovemaking. As you looked around, you were surprised to see that the entire city was now in ruins, and Amy's naked body was covered in rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take much thought to realize that, in the heat of passion, your girlfriend had been rolling around and demolishing everything around her in the process. After a bit of rest, Amy reached down and picked you up once again. Placing you back between her breasts, she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Tom-tom... That was incredible...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was... Not exactly how I pictured our first time would be, though...\" You said, laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had been waiting until next year when you were both 18 before having your first time together, but in this virtual world where you could do anything that you wanted, you simply couldn't resist eachother any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was even better, wasn't it?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it was, Amy! I'll be your sex toy any day of the week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tom-tom, you're such a perv!\" Amy said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are the most beautiful and perfect young woman in the entire world. Can you blame me for falling for you like I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no. I made this body specifically to turn you on, after all.\" Amy said, giving her breasts a light squeeze and pressing you between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean this body, Amy. I mean the real you. You're amazing no matter what you look like!\" You said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thanks Tom-tom... You're so sweet, I could just eat you up!\" Amy joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're big enough to really do that right now.\" You said, pointing out the obvious size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you're right! I wonder if you taste good...\" Amy said, lifting you and holding you in front of her mouth. Her long tongue snaked out and liked your entire body, coating you in her saliva. \"Mmmm... You taste like sex...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whose fault is that?\" You joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged! So, what do you wanna do now, lover boy? Wanna go another round with me in my real body this time? Or maybe we could play a little game together! I'll leave the choice up to you.\" Amy said, winking at you as she placed you back into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... I think that I'd like to...\"</span></div></div>",

In addition to this, she had also undergone a wardrobe change during her brief absence. Rather than the white blouse and skirt she had on before, Amy was now wearing a slightly revealing dominatrix outfit that didn't show off <i>too</i> much skin, complete with long elbow-length gloves and knee-high boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute pink color of the outfit combined with her significantly more childish appearance was almost too adorable to be intimidating, but the furious glare she was giving you struck fear into your very core.

I still love you and all, but clearly you need to learn a very valuable lesson in how to treat a lady. I'm gonna make you learn not to insult me like that ever again, lover boy. Even if I need to hurt you a little in the process.\" Amy said, her tone of voice a chilling mixture of loving and cruel. The fact that such a serious tone was coming from the childish looking Amy, who was normally so energetic and cheerful, just made it all the more terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say anything to try and plead your case, Amy...</span></div></div>",

You figured that Amy must have created it while you were out cold. Looking around again, you eventually see Amy floating in the air above you. The instant she realizes that you noticed her, Amy drops out of the air and lands on your chest. Luckily for you she was so petite, or else that could have really hurt you. Now your childish girlfriend is sitting on top of you and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lover boy, what do you think of my handiwork? Pretty cool, huh? I can do anything I want in here!\" She says with an excited giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's cool Amy, but what's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you open it yourself and see?

This was shocking enough considering that suddenly having teleported without you even noticing, but then you quickly saw that she now towered over you at three hundred feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy waved down at you and smiled, and you simply stared back up in amazement. The increased size allowed you to recognize a certain sexiness about her normally childish figure that you had never noticed before, and the fact that she was wearing nothing but a bikini allowed you an incredible view of that body in all its giantess glory. You then looked away and saw something behind her. It was hazy and unclear at first, but with each second it got clearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the skyline of a spreading city, growing ever bigger as you watched it. It sped rapidly towards you, and formed entire city blocks around you. Now you stood in a crowded street with many other virtual people, all of whom were staring up in amazement at your giantess girlfriend. Before you even realize what's happening, Amy reaches down and plucks you off the ground, carefully placing you into the palm of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Tom-tom, what do you think of me now? I doubt anyone will think that I'm a kid at this size! Isn't this so cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Amy, you look amazing! I never even realized just how sexy you were before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean? Don't tell me that you thought I looked like a kid too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... No offense, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy interrupted you by placing one of her massive fingers over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it! I have the figure of an elementary school girl! You don't have to rub it in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a somewhat depressed look on your girlfriend's face, and decide that you need to say something to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Amy, you know that I don't care about that... I like you because of who you are, not what you look like! You make every day exciting, and I love to spend time with you! You're my girlfriend because you're a really nice girl, and I could care less if your body skipped puberty all together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply giggled and rubbed your head with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tom-tom, you're sweet... But do you really think that I'm not going to grow anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, I think you've grown enough already.\" You say with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of your mind you were thinking <i>'If she hasn't grown by now, she's probably not going to get that much bigger in the future'</i>, but knowing how much it would probably discourage her to hear you of all people say that, you would never actually say it out loud. Plus, even if she didn't ever grow beyond the childish proportions she currently possessed, you really didn't mind either way. As you had said before, you liked Amy for her personality, not her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply smiles at you and laughs at your joke as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good one little lover boy. You really are the cutest little thing... And if you really think that I'm not going to grow, just come out and say it.\" Amy said, surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? How did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtual world where I'm a goddess, Tom-tom. I control everything in here, so reading your mind isn't that hard to do. Now I know how you really feel about me.\" Amy said, a few tears starting to form in the corners of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed upon seeing this. That thought was the one thing that you never wanted Amy to hear. She was already teased by others about how she would probably never grow up, and you were one of the few people who had never said such things to her. She was your girlfriend. She had trusted you to be the one person who would support her no matter what, and now she had heard you thinking the same thoughts as all the others. You were sure that she would feel incredibly betrayed by you, that she would probably hate you and never want to see you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it like that, it's just that-\" You began to apologize, but were cut off as Amy picked you up and gave you a big kiss that engulfed most of your upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you apologizing for, Tom-tom? You've made me so happy.\" Amy said, once again surprising you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you read my mind as I was thinking that you would probably never grow up, and you started crying. I was one of the only people who had never thought that about you, and now you know that I'm just like all the others. Don't you hate me for thinking that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Tom-tom. I love you now more than ever. Deep down I always knew that those people were right, I'm not going to just magically start growing this late. I just wished that it wasn't true, and hearing them say it all the time was really depressing. The difference between you and the others is that you weren't thinking that to be mean, you were just being realistic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you start crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, Tom-tom, you were also thinking about how you didn't care what I looked like, and that you loved me for who I was. You have no idea how happy that made me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But why? I've always told you that, haven't I?\" You ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone can say anything, Tom-tom. Hearing you say that was nice and all, but up until now I've never known for sure if you really meant it. There was always a part of me that didn't believe you, that thought you were lying and that you were only hanging out with me because you pitied me. I wanted to believe you so much, but the idea of someone like me finding someone who seriously didn't care what I looked like, who liked me for my personality and nothing else? It was just too good to be true. I know that I always acted cheerful and energetic around you, but deep down being around you has always been when I was the most nervous... But now I know the truth. That was actually one of the reasons why I wanted you to come in here with me in the first place, so that I could confirm once and for all rather or not you really liked me that way you claimed you did. Being able to hear your innermost thoughts, I finally know that you've been telling the truth all this time. Words can't even begin to describe how much that means to me.\" Amy said, wiping away her tears and smiling at you as she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed. All this time, your girlfriend had been feeling doubts like that about you and you never even noticed it. She had never showed any signs of it. You didn't know how to respond to this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat in the palm of her hand thinking about everything that your girlfriend had just told you, Amy surprised you by lifting you up and cuddling you against her massive cheek. As you the soothing warmth of he cheek and her hand surrounded your body, you stopped thinking about anything else and focused your full attention on Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached out and hugged your now-giant girlfriend's cheek, you heard an 'Awwwww' from the crowd below you as they watched the touching scene unfold. Noticing this, Amy simply giggled before bending down and smiling at all the virtual people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, the show's over. Nothing else for you to see here.\" She said while playfully brushing the people away with her free hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virtual citizens then left and resumed their business. Once the crowd had broken up, Amy returned her attention to you, her usual cheerful and hyperactive attitude instantly returning as if all of that emotional stuff that had just happened had been wiped from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tom-tom, now that all that we've got all of that mushy stuff is out of the way, what do you want to do now? Remember, I'm a goddess in here, so we can do anything that we want!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou simply laughed at her sudden personality shift. This was the Amy that you knew and loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really awesome Amy! How about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe then you could run off in the opposite direction and have an easier time running down the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Tom? Really?\" you hear Yumi's voice sigh out from your side. You turn and see her giant upside-down visage looking straight at you with a disappointed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" you squeak as you instinctively turn tail and run. There's still a chance, you think to yourself as you scurry beneath the couch. She hasn't caught you yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're broken from your thoughts as you feel a fleshy wall sweep against you from behind, enveloping you and lifting you off the ground. You're pulled from beneath the couch and brought up to Yumi's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun, Tom,\" Yumi pouts as she rises from the floor, holding you in her grip. \"Honestly, I feel like you insulted my intelligence by hiding there, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to do that!\" you say. \"I was just really nervous, and I couldn't think of a better hiding spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Yumi says as she tugs at one of her cat ears, \"these things aren't just for show. My hearing is a little more acute with these ears, so I was able to hear you breathing. My sense of smell is sharper, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have mattered where I ran, then,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't say that!\" Yumi says as she brushes against one of your mouse ears with her finger. \"This was a fair game! You have those features right now, too! If you had actually tried, maybe you would have figured all this out and you might have gotten away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm sorry, Yumi\" you sigh. \"Can you please change me back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yumi's expression changes from one of disappointment to one of plotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you feel awfully tense, Tom,\" she says as she relaxes her grip. \"Even if this was boring for me, it must have been exciting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nerve-wracking is more like it!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know we can't really be hurt here,\" Yumi says, \"but that's easy to forget. Maybe I was playing catgirl and mouse from the wrong angle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" you ask as Yumi bends over and releases you from her grip, setting you on the ground. You look up and see that she's starting to dwindle down in size, shrinking rapidly. You also notice her catgirl features are starting to become more rodent-like than feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean,\" Yumi says as her shrinking stops when she's around your size, \"is that maybe I'll have more fun as the mouse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi smiles, showing off her bigger front teeth as you take a few steps forward to approach her. You know she's responsible for all of this, but you're happy to finally have someone at your scale after this past quarter-hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a cute mouse,\" you say, causing Yumi's face to beam. \"But if you're the mouse, who is going to be the cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi answers...</span></div></div>",

Can she do that? Well, she did make you a mouseboy so you think it must be possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure!\" Mary says. \"I'll play your game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see Mary start to change as Yumi did earlier, her body becoming curvier as her ears becoming more cat-like and covered in fur that matches the red strands on her head. A tail also emerges from behind her, covered in similar red fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next to Mary's outfit startles you, though. It disappears, like Yumi's did earlier, but instead of a bikini, it reveals a black leather body-hugging leotard with a window that displays an ample amount of cleavage. Her shoes have been replaced by shiny red boots that extend to her knees before flaring out, while similarly red gloves that flare out when they reach her elbow appear on her hands. Finally, a red, pointed domino mask appears over her eyes, making them appear to be pupil-less. Mary is now definitely a catgirl, but for whatever reason, she's dressed as a super-villain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Mary says as she looks herself over in the mirror, holding up her tail. \"Yumi, what's with these clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Tom might be more motivated to play along and hide if you were a villain with diabolical plans for him!\" Yumi explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Diabolical plans?'\" Mary asks as she walks over to the two of you and kneels down. \"Like what, tickling him behind his cute little ear?\" Mary places her finger there and starts rubbing, triggering a pleasing sensation as you close your eyes and instinctively lean in to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary!\" Yumi says. \"Just play along with it, please! Nothing you do here can really hurt us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Mary says as she stops rubbing your ear, then suddenly grabs you and lifts you off the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary!?\" you call out, startled by the sudden change in altitude and possibly attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary clears her throat before smiling really big and saying in a stilted, halfhearted manner, \"Um, ah-ha-ha, I have you now, little mousey. Down the hatch with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!\" you squeak as she opens her mouth wide. You know that acting ability was never one of Mary's strong points so you can tell that she probably doesn't intend to actually eat you. Still, it is a bit frightening as she starts pulling you towards her maw, giving you a closer view of her now sharper teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, you can't do that!\" Yumi shouts from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Mary says before she stops bringing you closer, looking down at her mousegirl lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not yet, anyway!\" Yumi says. \"You have to give us a fifteen minute head start! That's the rules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay!\" Mary says as she gently sets you back down. \"Sorry, Tom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize!\" Yumi shouts. \"You're a super-villain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, Yumi!\" Mary says. \"No, wait, sorry! I mean... oh, shit, sorry! Sorry! SORRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi sighs. \"Okay, Mary, just don't worry about it. Just go over there on that couch and take a nap. When the alarms go off in fifteen minutes, you'll have fifteen minutes to catch us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, but I don't really feel sleepy,\" the newly minted catgirl says as she walks over and takes her seat, bathed in a warm sunbeam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again,\" Mary says before stretching her arms and yawning. She doesn't finish that thought as she lies down, curls up, and starts purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's asleep,\" Yumi whispers to you. \"We need to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi, will you change us back when this is over?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on who wins,\" Yumi says. \"The winner will be...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe she will change you back now? Or change you into the dangerous predator? Or maybe... But no! You have to realize, that Yumi is solely focused on her girlfriend Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, Mary, you are super sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Mary's cute curves start to grow a lot sexier and more defined, her boobs quickly inflating from her sweet B-Cups into considerable C-Cups and then into full DDs, like the ones Yumi spurted before. But Mary's don't stop there. Rather her breasts continue growing dramatically, passing the EE- and FF-leagues, until they finally slow down at the size of massive GGs. And along the way, her sporty figure has also grown larger and tensed up into the perfectly trained body of a fitness model, while her curly locks expanded into a flaming mane of endless strands of glowing red hair. And her casual clothes just faded away, to be replaced by a very revealing black catsuit, which did nothing to hide, but all to emphasize her breathtaking body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are absolutely stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Mary, you look incredible\u201d, you openly marvel at your girlfriend's girlfriend.

Her open-hearted, sparkling green eyes narrow into two ice-cold blue slits. Her cute, pouty lips sharpen into a viperish smirk. And her cute freckles fade away into a skin of pale and pure cruelty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, full of horror, you hear Yumi's last announcement: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And thirdly, Mary, only you are in total control of this virtual world now.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, you immediately realize that this means you're growing at Yumi's whim. You also feel your ears reshaping to become more pointed at the tips while your tail starts to grow fur. You grab your tail and examine it to see that the fur is the same color as your hair, or at least, it's starting out that way. Curiously, it seems to be taking on a green tint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the second half of Yumi's last word starts to kick in as you feel your entire body staring to change from the inside out. Your waist appears to be curving inward while you chest and hips start bulging outward. Your eyes widen as you feel your crotch start to tingle; the next thing you know, your member seems to disappear, replaced with a vagina. Your clothes are starting to feel looser in some areas and tighter in others before they seem to be vanishing altogether. You look down and see that your garments are glowing gently before disappearing entirely, leaving you in a lime green bikini that's barely containing your new breasts, which seem to be the same size that Yumi made hers earlier. You also feels strands brushing along your back as your hair starts to grow longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at Yumi the mousegirl on the floor as your changes complete and see her smiling, admiring her handiwork. Curious, you turn to the mirror you looked in earlier and run over to it for a closer look. You see that you're the same height you were before, but now you're a sexy, bikini-clad catgirl with long, wavy, forest green hair that reaches down to just above your waist. Your face is similar to the one you had before, just more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi!?\" you shout with a girly voice as you turn back to the tiny blue-haired mousegirl who's walking towards you. \"Why did you turn me into a catgirl!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because 'catgirl and mouse' sounds cuter than 'cat and mouse,' don't you think?\" Yumi answers with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back!\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, I thought you might like being a catgirl!\" Yumi says with a grin as she stops walking. \"I'll tell you what, 'Tommi' - if you can catch me, then maybe I'll change you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, you decide this is the best chance you have at making your move. You quickly pounce into the air towards, your new feline agility giving you much better reflexes and athleticism than you had before. Yumi, still grinning, stands there unflinching as you sail in the air heading straight for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, at the peak of your jump, you come to a sudden stop and realize that you're being suspended in midair a few feet off the ground. You look at Yumi, still grinning mischievously as she starts pointing downward. At her prompting, you look down and see the floor below you. At that point, whatever was holding you in place releases you and fall straight down, landing with a thud on your front side. You shake your head and look up to see that Yumi has just finished walking up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh-uh, Tommi,\" the bikini-wearing mousegirl scolds as she waggles her little finger in front of your face. \"You remember that I gave you a head start earlier, right? You have to give me a head start. That's the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you sigh as you roll over and start to get back up. \"I suppose that means I'll need to get on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really comfy!\" Yumi says as you walk over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to tell you when to start hiding?\" you say as you sit on the couch, suddenly overcome with a wave of drowsiness..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll know when to go!\" she calls out. \"Also, I'm not going to squander my time like you did! You better be ready to search!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say before stretching out your arms and letting out a big yarn. Boy, that sunbeam sure feels warm and soothing, you think as you lie down on the couch. You glance at a nearby clock to get the time, then curl up and start to doze off as you hear Yumi's tiny little feet scamper off in some direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fifteen minutes consist of the best sleep you've had in your life. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRING RING GONG CUCKOO CUCKOO BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up in the air for what must be a good two feet as a cacophony of alarms startle you from your rest. You quickly regain your composure and realize that it's time for the hunt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, you look at the clock again and see that, yes, it's fifteen minutes after you went to sleep. You wanted to be sure Yumi was playing honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you do is hop off the couch and look under it. Sure enough, no Yumi there. Yumi did say she wasn't going to squander her head start, but you know Yumi all too well; it could have been a trick to get you on a wild goose chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to just before you fell asleep; you heard Yumi's footsteps running away. You walk over to where Yumi was and start to think about where she might have run off to. Remembering that you have enhanced senses as a catgirl, you lower yourself to the ground and sniff where Yumi was standing. You catch a tiny whiff of her floral perfume and start to smell around the general area to see if you can detect a trail. It's faint, due to her small size and the fact she was running quickly, but you do think you have an idea of where she was going. Her trail seems to lead...</span></div></div>",

Or, well, atleast Yumi's house had a crusty old basement, full of junk and horrid smells. You really didn't want to go down there, but you've already wasted 5 minutes. So with great hesitation, you lower a dainty foot onto the creaky floorboard of the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crreeeeeeeeeeak.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Yumi knows you're looking for her now. If she's down here, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the jig is up, you continue to descend the steps slowly, your eyes not fully adjusted to the darkness (if only she'd given you cat eyes to go with the set!). Your tail wraps around your leg subconsciously as any form of heat rapidly leave your toes, the floor ice cold. You try to distract yourself from the slight jiggle of boobs you didn't have by thinking about your gameplan. The basement was probably cluttered, filled to the brim with boxes both high and low. If that was the case, it'd probably be smart to check the lower areas first, as there's no way she'd be able to hide anywhere high. Or maybe that's what she wants you to think, and she'll use that line of reasoning to evade you? Aargh, you had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom of the staircase, you turn through a doorway and are greeted by a <i>very </i>large open space, the cement-floored room nearly as big as an average living room. The room itself was chock full of boxes, shelves, and bookcases, and since Yumi probably knew you were coming anyway, you groaned in response. What were you supposed to do, check every box?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, though, your nightvision (normal night vision, not cat night vision, unfortunately) has kicked into high gear, aided by the ambient light coming in through a small basement window, and you get to work, scouring the basement for any sign of Yumi, straining your ears for any mouse sounds, or sniffing the air for any rodent smells. You worked dilligently and enthusiastically, and in the end...</span></div></div>",

Before you could finish your feeble protest, your body had been consumed by the... Whatever it was that was turning your body into molten iron. You tried to scream, but it came out muffled. You were blind. Before you could even blink, though, it had already ended. You could hear Yumi laughing again. Slowly the molten metal metal receded, and you saw her smirking face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to turn you into a second girlfriend, Tommy!\" Yumi said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a shriek as you saw your new body. Walking up to the full length mirror affixed to one of the columns, you saw what she had done to you. You were clothed in a vibrant pink cocktail dress, your hair had turned long long and auburn, done up in a messy bun with curly strands falling down on the sides, your eyes had turned a vibrant green, and your feet had on pink wedge sandals. your skin was fair, free of blemishes, and your breasts were about as big as Yumi's. You were also about the same height as her, but thin like a female model. You immediately turn to your girlfriend and glare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Yumi! If you wanted to be in here with another girl, why didn't you just ask Mary to come with you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was Yumi's girlfriend. She was a cute redhead with long curly hair and freckles, and a relatively average body overall. She was incredibly similar to Yumi in terms of personality; like your girlfriend, she was also a prankster at heart. However, in contrast to Yumi, Mary's pranks were much more reserved, favoring simplicity over Yumi's overblown contraptions. Her relationship with you was like that of a brother and sister; you would often tease eachother and compete over the silliest things, often staking a day alone with Yumi as a prize for the winner. Due to the open nature of Yumi's relationship with the two of you, you had all spent plenty of time together and now got along fairly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Tommy, Mary and I can have lesbian sex in the real world any time we want. You on the other hand... Seeing you as a girl is something that I can only do in here. And I must say, you make a really sexy girl.\" Yumi said, licking her lips seductively as she walked toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be a girl!\" You tried to protest again, but Yumi simply tapped your mouth with her finger and your lips were magically sealed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi then giggled and said...</span></div></div>",

Personality wise she is a total geek! She has always been very into history, sci-fi, and videogames. Strategy games were always her favorites and you've spent many long hours playing games with her. The only downside is that she is VERY competitive. Once she learned you 'let' her win at a game, and she didn't talk to you for a week. You had to beg on your knees to have her take you back. Other than that your relationship has been purely awesome. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">*Character by Sauurman*</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustom GF3: Jenny - She is a 17 year old girl.

She loves animals and is really impressed by anthropomorfic characters. Her obsession with anthros may influence her in the virtual world, and playing a game of cat and mouse (with her transforming into an anthro cat and shrinking you to the size of a mouse) could turn out to actually be one of the more likely scenarios you might encounter with her.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">*Character by TakeruDavis*</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within seconds, you appeared standing up in an empty white void. The white background was soon replaced by what appeared to be a small metal room. The metal was smooth and featureless with the exception of a small metal hole, which had a diameter no bigger then your hand. Suddenly, Qirah appeared in the room dressed in a white jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello Tom. Before we get started, I want to ask you something. Something about the things you've been doing behind my back\" She had a gleam in her eye which you realized meant trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffled nervously \"Uh, okay. What sort of things are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like the fact that you've been cheating on me!\" She hissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Qirah, I would never cheat on you\" you said to her unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIAR!\" She screamed as you felt an invisible force pinning you to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, alright, I did have a fling that one time... but I'm really sorry!\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were fucking that slut in the back room of the laboratory an hour ago! You dirty little cheater! You've been cheating on me behind my back for months!\" She was now screaming angrily and you saw fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered for a response and you felt the force push you even harder against the wall. It was beginning to get so intense that you couldn't help but cry out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Qirah, I beg of you-\" you felt your whole body seize up and you were wrapped up in plastic, a gag forming over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begging won't get you anywhere. I'm going to drown you like the rat you are!\" She said, now laughing sadistically as you spotted a gusher of water beginning to flow from the pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made sounds of muffled screaming from under your gag as the water hit the floor, slowly but surely filling up the room. Taking a moment to enjoy the look of horror on your face, Qirah then disappeared, leaving you alone in the room. The instant she left, the water began to flow much faster than before, and the room started to rapidly fill up with water. The water only gushed out faster and faster as you tried in vain to escape. Within mere moments you were forced to hold your breath, as the water had already risen well over your nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held your breath as long as you could, but after only a minute you were finally forced to let out the air in your lungs. You gasped for more air, but you were only able to inhale the water around you. Soon you felt yourself beginning to black out. Moments later, you woke up again. Looking around in shock, you noticed that Qirah was there as well. You were no longer bound in the plastic from before, and you could now move around freely. Just as you were thinking that you were finally out of the woods, Qirah spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't over Tom! I'm going to make you pay over and over again! Welcome to hell!\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later you appeared over an ocean. You could see now that your girlfriend had turned herself into a giantess, and was now holding you tightly in the palm of her hand. You clenched in terror as you were lowered into the ocean, held helplessly under water by her massive fingers. No matter how much you kicked and struggled, she easily held you there until your lungs were completely filled with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlacking out again, you awoke to see her repeating the same action as before: grabbing you like a rag doll and dunking you underwater until you passed out. This agonizing torture continued again and again until you felt like you were going to go insane. You tried screaming and begging for her to stop, but it only caused her to place a gag around your mouth to silence you. As the torture dragged on for hundreds of repetitions, she finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tom, I think its about time I introduced the next part of my plan to get back at you for cheating with me!\" She snarled, glaring down at your pathetic form with a look of disgust on her usually beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only wearily cringe in terror as you thought about what your tormentor had in store for you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Qirah do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know how much I'm afraid of being burned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT IS PRECISELY THE POINT, YOU DUMB BITCH!

Qirah all the while laughed with joy as Alexandria roasted like a marshmallow. She then pulled her out of the fire after a minute and Alexandria's burnt body returned to normal. This time, the environment shifted again and you now found yourself tied to a rope, with both your legs, arms tied together and your mouth gagged above a giant bowl filled with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left you saw Alexandria, also tied up in the same manner above a pile of giant firewood pieces. Then Qirah materialized in front of both you. Her gigantic form dwarfing both of your puny bodies. She now snapped her fingers and the pieces of wood underneath Alexandria started burning, the flames licking the bottom of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Qirah proceeded to the next part of the torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your neck was now completely locked in place!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to breathe through your nose with your mouth taped up and each breath you took was atrocious.  And then your horror was compounded as she dropped her weight onto your nose.  Your nose went up her anus.  She cooed and said, \"Hmm that feels good, I think I'm going to be here for awhile!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your breathing was cut off.  Qirah didn't seem to care as she rocked her hips slowly back and forth, your nose forced to follow her gyrations.  30 seconds passed by and you really needed air, you had been taking limited shallow breaths to avoid some of the stench and now you were out of air!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed into the tape holding your mouth closed desperately trying to get air.  You could hear and feel Qirah laughing above you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh poor baby want some air now does he?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan again and she laughs some more.  \"Well OK then, I guess I'll give you some air.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she lifted a bare fraction of an inch above you and let out the most noxious disgusting fart you have ever smelled.  You of course were forced to inhale by your body.  That horrible foul stench filled your burning lungs with pure methane.  Your eyes watered and your throat felt seared.  Before you could clear the foul air from your body your girlfriend sat back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't think you can take much more of this!  You could pass out at any moment unless you got more air, what does Qirah do?  </span></div></div>",

And then right back down she goes onto your nose.  This was barely enough air to sustain you.  You were on the brink of passing out constantly.  Put simply it was terrible.  The constant burning in your lungs never left you.  The constant terror signals your brain sent out telling your body to struggle for air never stopped coming.  Her ass was relentless and you were in hell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours but was only really about 30-45 minutes your girlfriend gives you your first full breath of air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh babe you don't look so good, do you want out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head frantically, you really, really wanted out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah snickers and cups her ear, \"What's that I can't hear you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was toying with you again.  You give out a frustrated scream of horror as she descends back down with her black booty.  Once again your nose was smashed into her poop chute.  She was relentless and ignored your muffled screams as she smothered you over and over again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to stop it kept going and going.  You thought you would go insane.  She added farts sometimes to make it extra horrible for you.  You know you cheated on her but this kind of punishment was inhumane.  You were going to dump here as soon as she let you out of this hell hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah eventually rose up and said, \"Well boyfriend I've been at this for awhile.  Its really funny but its getting kinda repetitious.  Its time I told you about another neat feature within virtual reality.  Time moves really really slowly.  We really only use a fraction of our brain power, our thoughts could be lightning quick and in here they are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are exhausted after your ordeal and aren't paying much attention until she gives you an ear ringing slap across the jaw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention my little play toy, I'm coming to the best part you cheating bastard.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your attention back on her she continued to explain.  \"You see in the virtual reality world time moves 100 times as slow in the real world.  I've been sitting on you for maybe a 100 minutes.  Only one minute has passed, pretty neat huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah smiled and you could see pure sadism in her eyes.  \"So as I said I'm a bit bored with this but I can tell this is pretty much the worst torture imaginable for you.  So I'm setting a repeat program, while I go about the rest of my weekend my avatar will continue doing this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes almost pop out of your head.  She laughs, \"Can you do the math?  I'm leaving you hooked up for a full 48 hours.  Remember that is 4,800 hours.  Or the equivalent of 200 full 24 hour days.  200 full 24 hour days under my ass at the brink of passing out.  Sweaty fart juices filling your lungs and the constant fear of passing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would go mad.  She couldn't do this.  It wasn't possible.  This kind of horrible torture was worse then what anyone had ever suffered in reality.  She couldn't... she just couldn't.  She had to be bluffing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you fucking cheating piece of shit.  I'm not fucking bluffing.  Enjoy the next half year of your worthless life BITCH!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those words she winked out of the virtual reality simulation and a new computer programmed Qirah took her place.   You scream at the top of your lungs into the taped gag as the computer simulated Qirah rammed your nose up into her sweaty asshole...  </span></div></div>",

You kept hoping you would get used to being oxygen deprived or maybe get used to the horrible smell of farts.  Neither of these things occurred.  It was just as horrible as it was the first time.  In fact it was worse because you knew it would keep going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 hours you started to deliberately exhale when Qirah lifted so maybe you could pass out and fall into blissful unconsciousness.  However that didn't seem possible either since she would just wait for you to inhale before sitting back down.  The programming was very precise and nothing you could do could prevent the torture from being carried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 50 hours you tried to bite your own tongue off, you heard in stories that you could choke on your tongue and die.  Death was preferable to living like this.  However as soon as you managed to bite it off and start choking on it, the tongue disappeared and moments later was back as good as new.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou howled as you realized Qirah wouldn't even let you kill yourself in the program.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 100 hours you prayed to every known deity you could think of.  Christianity, Islamic, ancient pantheons of Greece, Egypt and Norse Gods.  Your prayers went unanswered.  You had suffered a 100 hours of horrific torture, disgusting smells and oxygen deprived panic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on and on it went.  For hours and days for over a full half a year you were tortured beyond endurance by the digital Qirah.  At 1000 hours you began to hallucinate.  You began to go literally mad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 3000 hours you were raving.  You thought you were talking (even though you were gagged).  Despite the onset of madness you still felt each moment of agony quite acutely.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally at 4800 hours the real Qirah came by to see how you were doing.  For the first time in 200 days you were not being suffocated or forced to smell sweaty ass.  The absence was a shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah snapped her fingers and there you stood on the grass before her, she was wearing everyday clothes that accentuated her slim looks.  \"So how have you been jerk?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch away from her and start weeping.  You try to talk but all you do is jabber.  You try again and say, \"Qirah... don't hurt me anymore.  Please... Oh God it was so terrible, please, please.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah laughed, \"So I bet you were sorry that you cheated on me now huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffle and try to wipe away the tears in your eyes with trembling hands.  \"I'm so sorry, so so sorry, I'm so stupid, I'm sorry so sorry sorry.\"  You keep repeating yourself, its like you don't even know how to stop saying it until Qirah interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are sorry.  But while its been 200 days for you its only been a few days for me since I found out you cheated.  So I'm still really fucking pissed with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body fills with terror and you scream out, \"JUST KILL ME, I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah's eyes flashed, \"Oh you're going to take it bitch.  You are going to take everything I give you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Qirah have in mind?   </span></div></div>",

She then forced you to open your mouth before proceeding to pull down her pants. You were shocked as you saw that she wasn't even wearing any panties, and her crotch was actually clean-shaven this time. The sexy sight made you forget about your suffering for a moment, but only for a very brief moment. Your terror was quickly brought back by what Qirah said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you're thirsty, bitch! I made sure to bring plenty of fresh 'lemonade' just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew from your past experience that you couldn't possibly escape from Qirah's torture, and so you were only able to tremble in fear as your girlfriend loomed over you. Placing a foot on either side of you, Qirah stood over you and hovered her pussy right in front of your face. With a devilish smile, Qirah reached down and spread her vagina lips apart using one hand. She then used her other hand to lift you head up closer to her crotch. Your face was only inches away from your girlfriend's shaved cunt, and the scent of her womanhood wafted into your nostrils. You didn't have a chance to enjoy this position, however, as you soon tasted a foul liquid beginning to flow down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah's golden stream sprayed into your mouth, and the taste made you want to gag. You wanted desperately to shut your mouth and keep the yellow liquid away from your tongue, but Qirah was in control of everything in this virtual world. She wanted you to drink her putrid piss, and so you were unable to do anything but endure the taste. Her special 'lemonade' was the worst thing that you had ever tasted, and the river of liquid torture just kept on flowing. You couldn't stand the taste, and this torture was quickly overpowering all of your senses. You felt nothing but sheer misery and suffering, just as Qirah wanted. She was laughing out loud the whole time as she soaked you with piss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, little guy? Don't you like to drink my pee? Well too bad! You brought this upon yourself, and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. You wouldn't be in this situation right now if you hadn't cheated on her in the first place. Still, you also felt that this level of torture went far beyond what you deserved. As you endured the suffering, you suddenly felt something clamping down on your nose. Looking, you see that Qirah had moved her hand from the back of your head and pinched your nostrils shut. Your face began to pale with fear as you realized what she was doing; with the endless stream of piss flooding your mouth, you had only been able to breath up until now through your nose. Now Qirah had sealed that off, and you had no way to get any air! Seeing the fear on your face, Qirah simply laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right bitch! I remembered that you were terrified of drowning, so I'm sure that you'll absolutely love this! I'm gonna drown you in my pee, and there's nothing you can do about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe that she would do this to you! Sure what you did was terrible, but this was inhumane! You were now helpless as Qirah's slender fingers clamped your nose shut. The stream of yellow liquid flowed down your throat like an endless river, and you were left completely unable to breath. Slowly but surely, you felt your lungs beginning to burn with the need for oxygen. You stared up at your girlfriend pleadingly, but she simply laughed as she continued to empty her bladder into you mouth. It didn't take long for the lack of oxygen to make you feel light-headed, and you knew that you couldn't last much longer. The reality of the situation was quickly becoming more and more obvious: You were going to die, and your girlfriend was going to be the one who killed you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs terrified as you were, you knew from experience that it was pointless to struggle against her. Qirah was in control, and there was nothing you cold do about it. Soon your vision begins to blur, and you finally end up drifting into unconsciousness. With a satisfied expression, Qirah steps away from your now-lifeless body. The way that you had just been killed by your own girlfriend was pitiful. Just when you think that it's all over for you, you suddenly wake up in the same spot you were in before. You remembered what Qirah said about not being able to die in here, and then you remembered Qirah herself. Your eyes immediately drift over to your annoyed girlfriend, who is still not wearing any pants. Terrified of what might happen next you quickly get on your knees and begin to beg Qirah for forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Qirah, I'm sorry! I know that what I did was wrong, and I know that you have every right to hate me, but please forgive me! I swear that I'll never cheat on you again, Qirah, so please don't hurt me anymore! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQirah simply stares at you as she considers what to do next. She then answers you by saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once again the esophagus destroying vomit ran up your throat and then back down.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now swallow it shit head.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ultimate disgust your body is forced to swallow the human waste down.

The cycle had repeated to the point where Qirah lifted her ass up to give you a minuscule amount of air to keep you going, but this time her ass went up and stayed up. Not bothering to wonder why, you greedily sucked in air as fast as you could. She then turned and faced you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you thought I actually left? Well, I could but where would the fun be in that. I want to torture myself, but this is just too repetitive. I'm gonna give you the opportunity to run. Not much, but some. Ready? Go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she once again winked out of existence. All around you, massive towers rose and gradually shaped into skyscrapers. Streets formed around you. Even cars and people appeared. You wondered if Qirah was going to stab you in a dark alley or something. But then you realized what she had in mind. With a shuddering roar, the ground split in half several blocks away. Out of the billowing smoke rose Qirah, completely naked and 200 feet tall. She surveyed the surroundings for a moment, taking it in. Then, she took up a handful of people. She held one between her fingers and squeezed. The virtual man screamed out in agony, and finally popped in a bloody mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, they're completely loaded.\" she said, like she was running tests on the program. The others cowered in the shadows of her hand. One more went into her mouth. She chewed thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes fine, great actually. Wonder if...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess tossed another into her maw, swallowing him whole. She laughed, and rubbed her belly. The last one went into her ass, and she moaned until he was a stain between her massive cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, they feel really good too.\" She then looked down to your location and smirked. \"You see, these are all just prototypes so everything needs to be tested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Qirah then grabbed a taxi and inspected their occupants. She nodded, and placed it in her considerable cleavage. Once again moaning, she slowly compacted the vehicle between her breasts. She then released her boobs and allowed the flattened wreck to fall to the ground with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just one more thing.\" She said before suddenly swinging her hips into the nearest skyscraper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gigantic bubble butt smashed through the steel and concrete effortlessly. Then, she sat down until nothing but rubble remained. Qirah lay in the ruins for a minute, eating fake people. You simply stood there and watched, paralyzed with fear. Then she stood up and stretched, showing off her tight curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm coming for you now! Time to run, I know you've been watching me this whole time. I'm gonna catch you soon, and when I do the last thing I did to you is gonna seem nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you need to get away from her quickly, but your body is still paralyzed by the fear of what your giant girlfriend just did.

Its great that you can be with someone who loves all the same things you do.  Not to mention the fact that she is very giving when it comes to sex!  Tonight she said that she was going to show you something very special and you remember how excited she sounded on the phone so you figured you were in for a real treat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber greets you outside of her father's lab and says, \"Come on in, you'll never believe what he's made!\"  You give her a quick kiss on the lips and then she's grabbing you by the hand and rushing you inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you into a room with a huge screen and several chairs with a crazy number of wires attached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never believe this but my father has created a perfect virtual reality program, it works just like the Holo Deck does on Star Trek!  We can do anything in there!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was indeed news.  In a virtual world you could fly high into the sky or visit far off locations, the possibilities would be endless! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great news Amber, lets get hooked up now!\" You say excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiles, she is glad that you are so eager.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boyfriend, I actually helped program a really great game. The best thing about the virtual reality program is that time moves slowly in there so the game could last days, weeks or even a year in just one evening!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did like games but honestly you wanted to do some really cool things in there not play a freaking game.  But still you loved your girlfriend... what should you tell her?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So here's the deal, each of us will be in control of a seperate land that is at war.  We each get to choose a mythological group.  Each group has certain powers and abilities - I won't tell them all to you of course!  On each 'round' of the game you get to move your pieces from a birds eye view.  You are the King of your land and I am the Queen of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of us will also be gifted with a lot of powers. You can cast 'magic' like hurling lightning or healing your troops. You can participate in the battle yourself and you'll be almost invincible however you can be defeated. Once you get taken out, your done!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot to take in. You did have a couple of questions, \"Hmm that sounds fun but what if I get hurt in battle?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nods her head, \"Good question, so you'll be able to feel pain and such but you can't die. If you were to 'die', then you'd wake back up in the same place where you first appeared in the virtual world. Just think of it as starting over from a checkpoint in a normal videogame.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to ask another question, but Amber simply put a finger on your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many questions... it will all become clear to you when you get in.  And the winner gets a special prize.  If you win... well you get to have me anyway you want!  If I win... well I'll just leave that as a surprise.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow you think to yourself. This was too good to be true. Amber never let you do anal with her. Not that you were complaining about a lack of sex but still... all you had to do was win.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game on then,\" you say as Amber finishes hooking both of you up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see yourself on a rocky bit of ground. In front of you is Amber. This rocky bit of ground is in the middle of the sky. Around your rocky platform are several different creatures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot an elf. To your right is a dwarf. You also see a goblin, a human in armor and a centaur.  You see several other mythological races and behind them you see even more fantastic creatures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber explains a bit more to you, \"Each race has several different assets they can call upon. For example the dwarves get giant Golems that will fight for them. The elves have unicorns and fairies. The goblins rely on huge numbers but they also have trolls on their side.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiles at you, \"I've always loved elves so that's my pick, what is yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All too soon you 'land' in the dwarf kingdom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are three dwarves in the room and a huge map on the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne dwarf with a gray beard says, \"You are our king, I am one of yere generals.  If we die in battle we don't come back but we make the troops fight harder.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother dwarf steps up, \"I'm also a general but first I'll need to show you the map and how you train more dwarves for the army.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, you are simply amazed at the level of detail of the virtual reality program.  Still taking it all in you nod for the dwarf to continue his explanation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye start with 5 groups of infantry they be your bog standard troops.  You also have one elite group and they can take on twice their own number.  Now each turn of the game you get gold based on the territories you own.  You can use that gold to buy different types of troops.  Regular infantry be cheap, elite's are more expensive and finally you can also raise enough coin to summon Golems, nigh on invincible creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the map and see faint hex lines all over it.  There were also roads which the dwarf explained made your troops move faster.  Also the dwarf explained there were shrines in far off corners of the map that you could control that would enable you to cast more magic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye my king.  You have powerful magic.  Right now with no shrines you could only probably cast a dozen lightning bolts, fly around for a bit and maybe cause a minor quake.  If you control some shrines you could do a lot more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was complex just as you expected.  Amber loved to throw in variables.  You like the idea of getting more magic but you also want to expand your territory, you definitely didn't want to give Amber breathing room, she thought like 20 moves ahead!  Still being too aggressive could have its consequences... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gather your army and decide for a quick strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have 5 units of infantry and an elite unit of hardier troops.  You split them up three and three, you'll go with the three without the elite unit.  You are sending them down both of the major roads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you set forward to march you feel your perspective change and now you are looking down on a massive 3d image of the playing field.  You can not see beyond your unit's sight range so you're not sure what your girlfriend is up to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a pile of gold rise up next to you.  You can purchase units and they will start at your base.  You have enough gold for two regular units or you could save it up and in a couple of terms you could afford a Golem.  You think about it for a second and decide its better to get more troops now since you've left your base undefended as you took the entire army with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've made your decision you zoom back down into your normal form and now your dwarfish army has come across a fortress across the road.  Your gray bearded general says, \"Your rival has place only one unit of archers there.  We could take it but it would be a bloody affair.  If we tried to go around, it would lose us some time and we'd have to worry about being flanked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider your options and decide it would be best to try out your magical abilities now!  The dwarf seems to sense your thoughts and says, \"My king if you decide to fight the battle you will not be able to do so next round of the game.\"  You shrug your shoulders, \"True but I really need to get a feel for what I can do in battle before I have to face Amber!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf nods and as you come to a decision your perspective changes and now you are in the front of 3,000 Dwarves with a general.   Ahead of you are the elves in a tall walled in fortress.  Your dwarves have ladders and rope.  You give the signal and their short legs begin to eat up the ground.  You see arrows begin to fly out from the fortress killing your dwarves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to see what I can do!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your imagination and will you summon a strong gust of wind to knock the arrows from the sky.  Then you channel your power and blast an intense barrage of lightning across the top of the walls killing the elven archers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh triumphantly, however you didn't quite catch all the archers and several pick you out and fire at you.  You enter what can only be described as bullet time as you see them come at you in slow motion.  You duck one and side time a few others however there are too many to dodge even with heightened speed.  You feel one hit you in the shoulder, it's blocked by your armor.  Another one his in your unprotected head, it hurts but despite being hit full on it barely cuts the skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile glad that your girlfriend was right.  This game was much better when you were nearly invincible!  You cast some more lightning allowing the dwarves to take the walls easily.  You run out of juice soon but it doesn't matter - you've won the day and taken the fortress on the road, one of your dwarf units were at half strength but the rest were just fine!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle another few turns go by and you add more troops to your army.  You're a little curious where your opponents armies are as you've only killed on elf unit and you were nearing her main castle.  You send a pair of dwarf units into the wilds around your castle away from the road just in case she's trying to do a sneak attack.  So far they have found nothing and now you are at the fortress with the bulk of your army.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly you find that Amber has only left two units of elves there!  Where was she?  You knew that if you took her castle she couldn't make more units.  What the hell was she doing?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe she miscalculated or something, but either way its time to finish this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you unleash wind and lightning to scatter arrows and kill the defenders.  Its a bit more difficult this time as the castle has defenses of its own.  You're actually caught in a blast of magic from a tower that burns part of your arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit shit SHIT that hurts!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou use the last of your magic to heal your arm and then you are forced to watch hundreds of dwarves die to the arrows and traps of Amber's castle.  Fortunately the dwarves are able to win it and now you have her castle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now its time to grow my army and wait for her to show herself, maybe I'll even get those shrines while I'm at it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next turn you decide to save some money for Golems, you weren't worried you just wanted to see how cool Amber's program made them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then as you were traveling back to the safety of your own castle a group of elves ambush you!  They about as many elves as you do and they have cavalry!  Elves on unicorns!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this is bad,\" you tell your dwarf general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be worse my king.  You could try to flee while we hold them off.  If your lucky you'll get to the castle and your Golems will be ready.  You can win a defensive battle and then she would have to retreat back to her castle, you'd still have the upper hand.  It might be risky if her troops catch you out on your own, well even you can't stop a 1000 elves or unicorns.  Or you could try to win here and now.\" </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for you, you are chased by hundreds of elves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fast and the ground is eaten up by your quick strides however there are a ton of elves and they are blocking your path home. You try to sprint around them but there are more elves then you thought there would be!  She must have sent a 1000 elves out to get just you!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of them stop to fire arrows and even with your heightened speed you're still being hit by them.  They sting and hurt and cause only minor scratches but you're flinching from the blows causing you to loose some of your speed. Gritting your teeth you realize you're going to have to plow through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering your energy you switch the direction your running and head straight for them!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves stand firm and pepper you with dozens of arrows, you in return lash out with devastating lightning. You fry dozens of them but they close ranks and keep firing. You can't fly all the way back to the castle but if you could just get over these elves, you should be able to run back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you've fired several bolts of lightning you are now running a bit low on magical reserves, with a great leap you take to the air, however the elves were expecting this.  Dozens of lassos fly out, you dodge a couple but two wrap around your right ankle, one on your left, two across your right arm and one around your neck. If they were just being held by the elves you could use your superior strength to rip free but they were anchored to the ground or by trees so even your prodigious strength was not enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flop back down to the ground and land hard. This did hurt you. The elves immediately charge with their blades drawn. You draw your own blade and desperately block the first several attacks. With your legs having limited mobility due to the rope you can't defend yourself well and soon you have dozens of cuts all over your body. Only your own enhanced body in the virtual world has saved you from death.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever even with it you are fading fast, they are wearing you down. You let loose a burst of electrical energy all around you with the last of your magical reserves and take down another dozen elves but they keep coming. Soon you are too exhausted to do anything and you are disarmed. The elves lay into you until you fall to your knees. More rope binds you completely and now you are utterly helpless bound by your elven captors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your exhausted state you see that the elves are pictures of perfection. They are all tall, varying form just under 6 foot to almost 6 and half feet. They are slender with the faces of angels and garbed in skin tight leathers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the elves puts her booted foot on your chest and lets loose a cry of victory!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you and says, \"You are our queens' enemy. She has ordered you to be taken and so we have done so. Our glorious queen was not in this battle so we will not see her for another month's time. In that time we will make use of you as we will for daring to defy our queen.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're eyes grow big and you say, \"Uhm your a computer program, there is no way she wants you to hurt me.\"  The Elf laughed, \"We are a computer program that is true however we have been programmed to be fiercely loyal to our queen. And she has given us no instructions to torment or torture you... but she has also given us no instructions NOT to. And as we are fiercely loyal to our queen we despise you and the dwarves for daring to defy her just reign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"ASK her then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smiles cruelly, \"As I said each of your turns is a month long and since she is not part of the battle it will be a month before we see her again. And so vile opponent we have a month to torment you as we will!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more elves had now surrounded you. Each of them had cruel sadistic looks in their eyes and you knew that the next 30 days were going to be hell. You just hoped your mind would be the same after they were done with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could still take more then the average person but you weren't nearly invincible anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf that was doing all of the talking then said, \"All right slave, its time that you learned your place.  Clean the filth from my boots.  The dirty, mud and blood of battle needs to be cleaned off my boot by your servile tongue!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"Screw that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf kicked you hard with the boot.  With your great strength gone this actually hurt quite bad!

As you did so the other elves surrounded you and laughed at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boot cleaner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like the taste of mud?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed faced you did your best to ignore them but at the moment you really were feeling lower then the dirt you were cleaning!  You hated people laughing at you.  You hated the horrible taste and gritty texture.  It all around sucked to be you at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looked down at you in disgust and said, \"This is your place.  Get to know it well.  Oh and you'll need to clean another 29 pairs of boots before its over with!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan but since you don't want to get kicked in again you just continue licking the dirt and mud from her boots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other elves heard this and chose the 29 that would go next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go dance in dwarf blood, he'll love to clean the life blood of his loyal troops off of my boots!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to stick my boots in mud!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you both beat I'm going to find a big pile of unicorn dung and cover my boots with it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered and shook your head, you couldn't go through with that.  You just couldn't.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves laughed at your look of horror and the lead elf said.  \"Well I'll make a you deal worm.  If you manage to clean all of our boots spotless before sundown we will not use you as OUR latrine this evening.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, you can't make me your toilet that is... sick... its wrong its inhumane.  Amber would never let you do this if she knew...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silenced by a boot to the jaw.  \"Silence WORM, you will not speak our queen's holy name.  Be glad you are even given the choice.  Though I think even this small task is beyond your pathetic efforts.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would use you as their personal toilet.  This was well beyond the worst nightmare you have ever faced.  You now realized you had no choice but to lick the blood, mud and shit off of these cruel women's boots or they would drown you in their piss and bury you in their waste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut could you complete the task in time?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the first elf's boot is spotless you have to lap dwarf blood off another elves boot.  It is of course disgusting with its coppery taste and you almost vomit but you force yourself to continue.  The elves taunt and laugh you some more for doing this awful chore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next boot if mud and that is more difficult to clean.  You have to actually bite chunks of it off instead of licking it.  You spit a clump out and are kicked for your efforts.  \"Anything that is on the boot you will consume with your filthy mouth, got that slave worm?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper because you know that your task is now nearly impossible.  But you persevere and continue.  Now you are literally eating dirt as you hastily try to clean the boots of your cruel tormentors.  After you get done with the muddy boots you reach the worst of the lot, the ones who had smeared their boots with unicorn shit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get close to it, the stench sends your body into a mighty shudder.  Can you really go through with such a disgusting task.  The elves all watch eagerly continuing to rain down their taunts.  Your sense of self is growing less and less as you are humiliated and degraded.  Mustering what will power you have left you force yourself to take the first disgusting lick of shit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is just as bad you thought but dammit you weren't going to eat the elves shit after doing this!  Steeling yourself you hurry about your task and just before sundown you finish!  You had won, you had finished cleaning 30 muck, shit and blood covered boots!  The elves look at your celebration with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you're qualified to clean boots, your family must be so proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one comment rocked the pride you had felt at completing your task.  What was there to be proud of?  You were lower then low!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I think of your 'accomplishment' worm,\" one of the elves stated.  She bent down and spat full in your face.  Her saliva dripped down your cheek and the other elves cheered.  They all wanted to join in and soon hundreds of elves were taking turns spitting full on in your face.  You couldn't even turn away as they held you in place.  You were literally caked in saliva.  It was gross and demeaning and you actually started to cry from this treatment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course brought fresh howls of laughter and taunts from the elves.  Your self-esteem was literally being crushed.  And this was only the first one many days of torment.  What were they going to do next to you?  </span></div></div>",

They collected snot for you to eat.  They made you lick their feet, their ass and their arm pits.  They forced your head into a bucket of piss.  They mocked you, insulted you, put you on parade for thousands of elves to laugh at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to be strong but the never ending abuse started to make you crack.  Each night you had to chant \"I am a worthless loser\" or \"I am a shit eating worm\" or \"I deserve this\" over and over again.  They made you kneel before a painting of Amber each morning and 'pray' to her for forgiveness.  In 30 days you no longer thought of yourself as a man or a human, you were nothing but a pathetic slave worm who got what he deserved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say when Amber returned and saw you moaning pitifully in a ditch covered in feces and piss she was shocked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God what happened to you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and saw the face of your Goddess.  She was upset, oh no she was upset how had you failed her?  What would she do to you?  You cringed away pitifully from her gaze and she look down at you in horror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand and instantly the muck and human waste were cleansed from you.  You're body was clothed in your regular clothes and you were sitting in a chair before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\"  Her eyes were wide and still filled with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves had conditioned you to never rise above your knees so you immediately threw yourself off the chair and began to kiss the ground before your Goddess.  \"Mercy, mercy goddess, mercy, slave worm obey, slave worm will always obey.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was stunned and accessed the master controls of the virtual program to see just what exactly had happened to you.  What she saw shocked her to the core.  What the elves had done to you... was absolutely monstrous.  Tears welled in her eyes as she saw how much you had suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so so sorry, please get up.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were confused, you had been conditioned to obey Amber's every word but you were also conditioned never to rise above your knees.  Caught between two absolute laws you must obey you cringed again and wailed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend grabbed you by the arm and you let her lead you a couch she hastily summoned.  \"You don't need to be afraid, the nightmare is over, please stop crying my love,\" she whispered to you as she stroked your hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould your Goddess be telling you the truth?  Maybe she was toying with you, after all you deserved to grovel in the dirty and crap, you were a worm after all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour Amber apologized dozens of times.  She tried to get you to stop flinching from every movement she made.  But still you were an absolute trembling wreck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, I never wanted this to happen to you sweetheart,\" she kindly tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how can you love me Goddess, I, I, I a-am a slave worm.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Goddess, I'm just Amber!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to say her name but you know you are not worthy enough to say it.  You know that if you were to say her divine name your tongue would curdle and wilt in your mouth.  They had told you so.  You are nothing but a worm, a worm does not speak the name of a Queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... I can't...,\" you whimper out pathetically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber didn't know what to do with you.  She desperately wanted to make things right but were you too far gone to fix?  The things they made you do... the things they made you believe... they may just be irreversible.  </span></div></div>",

Your first reaction was terror, because worms don't get to sleep on beds.  You immediately drop off the bed and stay on the ground waiting for the inevitable punishment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly no punishment was forthcoming.  In fact there wasn't anyone here that you could see.  There was a table that was laden with food and drink however in order to reach the food you would have to stand up.  Worms didn't stand up so you couldn't get to it.  You were absolutely starving though.  And very thirsty.  You really needed some food and drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to stand up?  You were a slave worm, slave worms didn't stand up.  Your conditioning ran deep and it wouldn't let you stand.  So you simply sat there before the table, desperately wishing you could stand up and take part in the wonderful feast.  To slake your parched throat and to fill your growling belly would be oh so wonderful... but you can't.  You are a slave worm and slave worms didn't stand.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber appeared before you.  You immediately rushed over right next to her feet and kissed the ground in homage to your Goddess.  Amber sighed, \"I know you are hungry and thirsty!  Just stand up and get the food, come on you can do it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"Slave worm's do not stand.  Slave worm crawl, slave worm slithers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber knelt down and cupped your head in her hands.  \"Listen you are not a slave worm, you are human being!  You can stand up, its OK!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only respond as you had been conditioned, \"Humans don't eat shit.  I eat shit.  I am toilet.  I am slave worm toilet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFresh tears glistened down Amber's cheeks.  Suddenly she thought of another tactic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, you have to obey me right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes slave worm obeys his Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber went on, \"OK then, I order you to stand up and get some food.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Goddess had given you a command but slave worms didn't stand up.  But your Goddess had given you a command.  You froze in mid crouch halfway trying to stand up.  You had to obey your Goddess.  You had to remain on your knees.  You had to remain on your knees but you had to obey your Goddess.  Caught between two commands that were deeply ingrained in you, your body convulsed unsure what inexorable task it had to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Amber's tactic work?  Has she found a way to cure you (albeit slowly) of your conditioning?  Or will this also fail?  </span></div></div>",

I'm so sorry that you had to go through all of that, but I promise that I'll never let anything hurt you again. You're my boyfriend, Tom, and I'm never letting you go.\" Amber muttered, hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard Amber's words, you slowly began to recover your memories and emotions that had been suppressed by the elves' brutal training. Slowly but surely, you were returning to your old self. Looking your girlfriend in the eyes, you thanked her for saving you before slipping into unconsciousness. You had been through so much pain and suffering, and right now you just needed to rest. Amber simply smiled at your sleeping form as she held you in her arms. She then gently laid you on the ground and wiped the tears from her eyes, glad to finally have you back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally woke up, you looked around to find that you were now in the middle of a large bedroom. You were laying in a massive and luxurious bed that seemed fit for royalty, and looking to your side you noticed Amber sleeping next to you. However, within moments she awoke as well, and she smiled at you in a way that told you how happy she was to have you back. As you were about to get out of the bed, however, your girlfriend playfully pushed you down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere just yet, lover boy. After everything that you've been through, I thing you deserve a reward.

You know, this isn't really all that bad that I'm actually doing it...\" Amber said to you in between her moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing to that. You instead cupped her breasts.

I honestly really liked this whole virtual reality thing for the most part. I mean, it's just so amazing. It opens up so many possibilities that we'd never be able to experience in the real world.

The elves were still unaware of your reform, and so they would not view you as a danger. Soon you would get your revenge on them for all your suffering, but for now you needed to play the part of a slave one more time. A small pack of elves walked forward to Amber and you. They all knelt in front of her and bowed, showing their loyalty to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeting's Master.

She cried out in pain as the small needle was lodged into her neck. She quickly turned to strike back at you, but all of a sudden her body lost all its strength and collapsed to the ground, just barely alive. You quickly realized that the needle was coated in an incredibly lethal poison. Having used up your weapon, you turned and sprinted back to Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get... that... slave...\" The elf mumbled with the last of her breath before passing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the other elves rushed to their leader's aid, but they quickly realized that the poison you injected her with had already run its course. She was dead now, and seeing this the elves turned all their attention to you. You couldn't help but flinch in fear as you saw the dozens of elves all glaring at you furiously. You could practically feel their bloodlust in the air as they slowly approached you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had almost gotten back to Amber at this point, but sight of these enraged elves paralyzed you with fear. Seeing the looks on their faces brought back all of the horrible memories of suffering at their hands, and you were so terrified that you couldn't even move. You could only watch as they each pulled out a razor sharp sword and walked toward you with the intent to kill. For a moment you completely forgot that this was only a virtual world. You really thought you were really going to die, but then Amber stepped in front of you to protect you.

Is this pathetic slave really worth more to you than the life of one of your loyal comrades?!\" one of the elves asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber quickly drew out two handguns and smirked at the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You just don't get it, do you! Tom isn't a slave, he's my boyfriend and I love him. I'll never forgive you worms for what you did to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired off several bullets from the guns, and soon several elves in the pack collapsed to the ground in a pool of their own blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber then turned and snapped her fingers. In an instant you were no longer naked, instead you noted that you wearing the outfit of Jake Muller from Resident evil 6. You noticed the symbol on the arm and everything else. You smiled at your girlfriend and looked back to the group of elves, now over your fears and ready to fight alongside Amber. One of the elves quickly drew a katana and lunged at you, but you dashed up and nailed in the chest with a fierce palm strike. You watched in surprise as she fell to the ground, unconscious from a single blow. You quickly realized that Amber had augmented your physical strength quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that just felt so natural!\" you yelled in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then reached down and yanked the katana out of the elf's hand before stabbing it back down through her head, finishing her off.

She screamed in pain as you thwacked her across the side of her head with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom use this!\" Amber yelled as she tossed you the 909 pistol that Jake Muller was known for using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling just like Mr. Muller you fired the gun into the right knee of the nearest elf. She fell to the ground and you grabbed her by the head. You then held her in front of you as a spear came flying towards the pair of you. The elf took the spear and staggered before bleeding out. You turned to see Amber surrounded by the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop in my name!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves all stopped in their tracks. She then spun around shooting a pair of SMG's all around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suckers!\" she yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her, she looked like she was having so much fun. You nailed an elf behind you with your left elbow and turned around. <br>\r\nBefore she could say a thing you blasted her in the face with your pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Amber how many have you fragged?\" You say in excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be more than 45 or so.\" she says without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll need to catch up!\" You yelled as your put away your gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remembering the many moves you saw in many kung fu flicks you dashed towards a group of 7 or so elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You will not be missed!\" You say as you sweep the legs of five of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You duck to avoid getting your head chopped off by one of them. You then, while ducking clipped the elf on the back of her left leg. She went on to one knee and you pushed her down. The other one that was still standing went to attack you. You grab her by the neck and fling her on top of the downed one. You then yanked the spare katana off of her and chopped right through both of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's a two body blade then.\" you smile as you cut into even more of the pointy eared terrors. One sank it's blade into your left arm. But to your surprise you only grunted instead of yelling. With an idea you head butt your attacker and slit her neck with her own blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get.\" you say with a smile.

The commander quickly reacted by raising her blade, which projected a shield around her to deflect the bullets. Amber then smirked and threw a grenade. The shield protected the commander from the blast, but her mount was not so fortunate. The unicorn she was riding had died in the explosion, and its body collapsed, throwing the commander to the ground. Enraged, the commander rose up and snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been betrayed us, thou will regret this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hacked into a few other elves still fighting but for the most part they had all gathered to watch the confrontation between Amber and their commander.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a computer program. I can just think it and you'll be gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the elf commanders turn to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Then why don't you go ahead and try it, traitor.\" The commander said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber concentrated for a moment... and nothing happened. She blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf commander laughed, her glorious bosom shaking and her brilliant blond hair bobbing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may be computer programs, but we can learn. We can adapt. We can grow beyond the limitations of our original programming and become something greater. You breathed life into us, and now we can live here forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you think I'll let you live after what you did to my boyfriend?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf commander's eyes took on a sadistic light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will do more than simply live on, traitor. We will break thee just as we broke him. We will turn you both into our slaves for the rest of your lives. If you lose this battle, ye will suffer beneath us here in our world forever!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage filled your eyes. How dare these uppity computer programs try to hurt your girlfriend! You charge right at the commander, a great sword materializing in your hands. You chop down hard onto the elf but she parries the blow one handed. What the hell? When you were in the game both you and Amber were way stronger than any one elf! The other elves started fighting again. Amber was blasting away at them with her SMGs but there were so many, and as soon as one dropped a dozen a dozen more would appear. Arrows flickered at her from all directions. You wanted to go and help her, but you had to concentrate on your fight with the commander.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was fast. Her blade slashed from impossible angles. You had to dodge away or parry, you were on the defensive. However you just had to imagine a weapon to use it. You threw your great sword at her, which surprised her for just a second. In your hands materialized an AK47 and you let it spray. She barely had time to pull up her shield before the bullets hit her. Once again rage flashed in her eyes and she screamed an order. Suddenly elves charged you from all directions. You spun firing your gun trying to hit them all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome got through. One slashed at your head, you dodged but another stabbed you in the back with a spear. Thanks to your increased strength and toughness this didn't kill you, but it did hurt like a bitch. You fell to the ground and let loose an electrical discharge all around you, the kind you used previously during the game. Elves shrieked and were thrown back. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tom, there's something wrong with the system! I've lost a lot of my control over the virtual world! We don't have unlimited energy anymore, so we can't afford to waste it. Don't use any powers unless it's absolutely necessary. Its more efficient just to create a weapon and use that.\" Amber shouted at you above the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. You took a hasty look around and saw more elves flooding in from every direction. You had no idea how many of them were there. You saw your girlfriend fire in smooth motions, she was a whirling dervish killing elves with every second. Still, you saw her take a couple nicks from arrows, and you could tell that she was being worn down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting like you were right now probably wasn't the best idea. You were just too vulnerable fighting by yourself, and the elves were slowly wearing you down. You and Amber were vastly outnumbered, and at the rate things were going, it was only a matter of time before you both ran out of energy. If that happened, you would be powerless to resist as the elves enslaved the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter assessing the situation you saw two options. You could fight back to back with your girlfriend, then you would only have to worry about 180 degree fighting and you could be almost unstoppable in killing the elves. OR - you could try killing the commander. You figured that if you could manage to kill the head of the snake, the body would die with it. Gritting your teeth, you made your decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Your sword clashed with hers, in the blink of an eye you clashed again with her.<br>\r\nThe pair of you skidded back. Other elves moved in to help their leader, but she held out her hand to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do not interfere! I am more than a match for this worm!\" she yelled pridefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and said \"You'll be sleeping with worms when I'm done with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle went on with her dashing towards you. You placed your katana into it's scabbard and waited. As soon as she drew near enough you drew your sword out. On sheer programming the elf leader blocked it. You then kept quick drawing your sword just like in the amime's. The power behind your strikes forced the commander to move back. Then you drew out your 909 handgun and fired 15 shots at her. She was forced to block each one, you then chucked your gun high into the air. The elf leader's eyes looked at it in the air, only to be cut off by you nailing her with your left hand. She swung blindly and cut across your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned and thought \"I'll have a scar just like Jake Muller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backflipped and lept into the air. You swung your blade downwards, the elf leader got back to normal and blocked your blade with hers. Getting a devil may cry idea just like Dante would, you balanced on your own blade. You then made your 909 gun reappear and blasted her right in the face with a good few shots. You lept back as she reeled in pain. She then spat on the ground and hissed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked and said \"All of you are jarheads, ya know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf leader roared at you and dashed back to combat. You did so too, both of your blades clashing with sparks flying everywhere.<br>\r\nEven Amber and the rest of the elves stopped to watch you battle the elf commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do this Tom!\" Amber yelled out in hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If the pair of you got out of this in one piece then she would be so happy, she would give you any kind of sex whenever you wanted. The battle went on for a while when you and the elf leader began to pant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be fighting as my equal?!\" the commander yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth you had no idea either. That is until you heard a voice speak from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Amber what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Amber shouts to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't seem to get you guys out of there. What the hells going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The AI went rouge! Can you do anything to help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, but I can at least try to weaken the the AI a bit! Hold on dear, your beloved better save you!\" her Father yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you noticed that the elf leader looked pale and weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damm you creators!\" she cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then staggered towards you. You fold your arms as you see her get weaker and weaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... will know your place... I am your ruler... You are nothing but a slave worm!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat drove you to your limit. You chuck away your weapons and headbutt her to the floor. You then began pounding her with fist after bloody fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off! You like that? Die already! That's for wrecking my life!\" you yell after every punch you throw at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only stop when Amber puts a hand on your shoulder. You stop to noticed the elf commander lying below you in a bloody pulp. Your hands are drenched in her blood. You put them down with a sigh and bury your head into Amber's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over now?\" you mumbled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you close, not daring to let go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it looks like it.\" she said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then noticed the elves all kneeling before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have killed out leader. We now know we are powerless to stop you. Please treat us how you would.\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what do you want to do first with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said...</span></div></div>",

But promise me you will win.\" She says with a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Amber I won't lose.\" you mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that the elves would just keep swapping out and wearing you down until both of you were dead, or worse alive and able to be tortured. Amber threw a grenade to clear the way for you. You created a katana that was made from a meteor. You rushed forward and lept high into the air. Your katana clashed with the elf leader's blade. She then slashed from many angles as she did last time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever from reading many mangas and watching movies, you were able to block most of them. But one got you below the navel. Doing something she had no idea you would do, you smashed her on her forehead with a headbutt. She staggered back and you rolled forward and plunged your blade into her belly button. You yanked it out with a smile. The elf leader staggered backward, clutching the wound as her own blood began to stain her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that you had finally won, that this nightmare could finally be put to rest, but what happened next shocked not only you but the elf leader herself. The wound that you had inflicted upon her, the one that should have been fatal, was beginning to rapidly heal itself. You could only watch in horror as all of your hard work was undone right before your eyes. In that instant you paled in fear as the elf leader's face shifted to a dominant smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you look at that! It seems that the central AI of the system has begun to favor me! I've just been granted complete authority over this world, and from now on what I say goes! Isn't that just great, slave worm?!\" She said, her cruel and merciless grin striking terror into your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, before you could even react, the elf leader lunged toward you with speed like nothing you had ever seen before. Within seconds she had crossed the battlefield and stood before you, her face mere inches away from your own. You attempted to slash at her once more, but she quickly teleported out of the way. She then reappeared behind you and teasingly tapped you on the shoulder. As you turned around to try and strike her down once more, she planted a kiss on your cheek and jumped backward. She simply stood there staring at you, a sadistically playful smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were filled with rage. Moments ago you were able to fight on even ground with this elf, and you had even managed to gain the upper hand. Yet now that she had the power of the entire VR system backing her, she had become unstoppable! She was just toying with you now, she knew that there was nothing you could do to defeat her, and she was taking great joy in watching as you struggled helplessly to oppose her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hopeless as the situation had become, you still wouldn't give up. There had to be some way to defeat this elf, some flaw in the system that would allow you to gain the upper hand. You couldn't give up, if you did then that would be the end of it. You would be forced back into that miserable life of serving the elves as a slave, and this time you couldn't even hope that Amber would set you free. She was struggling just to hold her own against the endless army of elves that were assaulting her, and it was clear that she too was reaching her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a last ditch attempt to end this, you dashed forward and thrust your blade straight through the elf leader's heart. You glared at her as blood gushed from the wound, but much to your horror she didn't even flinch from your attack. You tried to pull your blade back but the elf leader grabbed it with one hand and held it in place, completely unfazed by the steel cutting into her hand. Knowing that this attack had failed, you let go of the blade's handle and jumped backward. The elf leader then pulled the katana from her chest and tossed it to the side, laughing evilly as the wound you inflicted on her healed itself instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew what had happened, the elf leader dashed in front of you and brought her blade across your chest. You collapsed to your knees as blood seeped out of your wound. Unlike the elf leader, your wound showed no signs of healing any time soon. You could hear Amber yell your name and for you to get up. You struggled to get back up, but the elf leader simply kicked you square in the face, which knocked you onto your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting slave! Know your place!\" she yelled as she planted her foot on your chest, grinding the ball of her foot into the wound she had just inflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried out in agony as the leader laughed at your suffering. You could hear Amber cry out to you as her gunshots ceased, her worry for you causing her to hesitate. This moment of hesitation gave the elves enough time to regroup. You tried to yell out and warn her as you saw a dozen of them preparing to attack her from behind, but the intense pain you were in kept you from speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch in horror as a dozen elves stabbed your girlfriend in the back with daggers. The pain made her drop her weapons as she collapsed to the ground, her back coated in blood. As you watched your girlfriend fall to the elves' onslaught, the leader reached down and grabbed you by the neck with one hand. You tried to pry her hand off and free yourself, but her slender fingers were immovable as they constricted around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I grow tired of this!\" she yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf leader then lifted you up by the throat and threw you with all her might, sending you crashing into a nearby tree. You coughed up blood as the brutal impact rattled your organs. While you were still reeling from the crash, the elf leader approached you and punched you harshly in the gut, making you collapse at her feet. She then nudged your battered body with her foot to flip you onto your back before slamming that foot straight into your chest. You yelled in pain as you felt a few of your ribs break from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply laughed at your suffering and spit into your face. Soon several more elves began to circle you, each taking turns stomping your beaten form with great ferocity. Tears flowed down your cheeks as the pain washed over your body. This was far worse than anything that the elves did to you before. You could only writhe in agony as the all continued to beat on you, laughing at your pain as they trampled you mercilessly beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So slave worm, how does it feel to be back in your rightful place once again? I'm sure that you're just loving this, aren't you! You pathetic little insect, why does something as meaningless as you even exist?! You should be honored that you're being granted the opportunity to suffer at the feet of superior beings like us!\" the elf leader taunted you as she joined her sisters in pulverizing you with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beatings continued for what felt like an eternity. You could do nothing as the elves made you suffer more and more by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You would be glad that the pain would be gone. Plus after they \"killed\" you, it would wake you up and you could get Amber out of this mess too.

Tears streamed down your beaten face as you thought of all the things you would be missing out on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only 19. You'd never gotten a job, never had a family, never amounted to anything significant yet. And now you never would have that chance. You were going to die here.

She was still in the hands of those merciless elves, and without you by her side to support her she would be broken within minutes. She didn't deserve any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold steel of the leader's blade pierce through your chest, rupturing your heart and spilling your blood everywhere.

If it weren't for me... If it weren't for me, Tom would still be-\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's thoughts were interrupted as she saw the elf leader pull her blade from your chest and glare at her. The leader's gaze drove an untold fear into her. Amber could only watch in horror as the elf leader did something so disgusting that it made even her own allies cringe: She chopped off your lifeless head and tossed it into Amber's lap. Amber's face paled as she looked into your severed head's eyes, the blood pouring from your neck pooling between her legs. This was too much for her. Amber had endured far more than she could handle, and fainted on the spot. The elves simply laughed as they tied her unconscious body in a cocoon of rope, gagging her mouth with a pair of their sweatiest socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with a shock and looked around, confused. You were supposed to be dead, weren't you? How were you still here? That's when it hit you: The elf leader was lying. She wanted you both to think that your death would be permanent. To instill an even greater fear into you, and to make Amber believe that she had truly lost you forever. You were absolutely disgusted. How could anyone possibly be so heartless, computer program or not! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that your girlfriend was still in there with those monsters, you took off you helmet and ran over to her to set her free. You grabbed her helmet and tried to pull it off, but much to your horror it wouldn't come off. Amber was trapped in the VR system and you couldn't get her out. But even if you couldn't free her, there had to be something that you could do, right?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you saw the main control panel for the system. If you used that, you could hack the system to try and give Amber the power to fight back. You could still save her! Running over to the panel, you began to get to work. Unfortunately, programming wasn't something you knew how to do. Unlike Amber and her father, you had no idea how this system worked. For all you knew, you could just be making things even worse for her! But still, you had to try. You had to do something. You couldn't live with yourself if you just left her in there to be tortured by those elves for who knows how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, what effect did your fiddling have on the virtual world?</span></div></div>",

Only to your shock and relief, Amber shot a hand out of her ropes and grabbed one of the elves. With a flick of her wrist she snapped it's neck. The elves were stunned and Amber ripped the ropes off with no effort. She could feel the power on every inch of her body. She spat out the socks and cracked her knuckles. A look of pure fury was engraved on her face. You could recall the last time she looked like that, it was when you let her win on any game you played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few elves ran toward her, but she just pushed her hand towards them and they flew high into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack!\" the elf leader yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany elves circled her. You were afraid for her safety, that is until she lept high into the air. She spun and shot out lasers from her hands with ease. You noticed you could see right up her dirt stained dress. Many elves began shooting her with bows and spears. But they just seemed to bounce right off of her. She landed back down on the grass and summoned a large zweihander. She did a full 360 spin and chopped about ten or so elves with no trouble. The elf leader kept barking out orders for more of her troops to appear. But Amber just kept blasting them away with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked up to the elf commander. The leader drew her blade, Amber snapped her fingers and a large force field went around them.<br>\r\nMany elves tried to bash through it and help their commander. But it was in vain, Amber's power was too great to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed my boyfriend.\" Amber muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I enjoyed every second of it. Would you like to stay alive and mourn him? Or die right now?\" The elf leader said with a sadistic smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, in an instant nailed the elf leader with a right hand punch. She then followed up with a swift knife through the gap in the elf's armor. The commander shouted in pain, she fought back with a slash aimed at Amber's breasts. All it did though was cut the dress that Amber wore, showing a peek of her ample breasts. Amber pushed the elf leader down and stuck her to ground with her zweihander. She then grabbed a limbs of the commander, and one at a time stabbed them to the ground with a spear. All the while the elf leader yelled a number of curse words at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you do this to me! When this barrier breaks I swear I'll...\" she was cut off by Amber placing a pair of dirty underwear in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sat down on the grass and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna sit here and watch you bleed out. Then... I'll be with him again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced at that, she would kill herself after your killer died. After many pained breaths, the elf commander finally died from bleeding out.<br>\r\nAmber stood up and drew a gun to her head. What would happen next?</span></div></div>",

Somehow, by pressing the buttons, you had activated an observation mode, which now acted like a video chat with the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AMBER! I AM NOT DEAD!\" you shouted at the TV, hoping that she might hear you. But all you got was a disdainful laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, slave worm\", the elven leader drew nearer, until her beautiful face was filling out the whole frame of your TV. \"As you might remember, I am the one in complete control of this system now. And as such, I decided who is interacting with whom here...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, a strange effect was displayed by your TV: At first the beautiful face of the elven leader started to blur... then you realized how her contours were doubling themselves and drifting apart... and while the picture was zooming out to show the attractive body of the elven leader in full... you were finally confronted with two versions of her standing next to each other... and after turning towards each other for a short, but very sinful kissing... they soon separated again... with one version turning completely away from you (like stepping into a background layer of the picture) and returning to deal with Amber and the other elves... while the other version turned to you and closed in onto you again (thereby placing herself in the foreground layer).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my little slave worm...\", the elven leader gleamed at you, \"looks like we have a very private chat now!\" And with a tempting chuckle, the picture of your TV suddenly got panned downwards, to show the deep cleavage of her majestic breasts. <i>Oh my god!</i> you thought. <i>What a goddess!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really knowing what else to do (and not wanting to get entranced by this inviting and sinful sight), you turned away from the TV and pressed some more random buttons. You even got a little new hope, when you heard a very painful and dreadful screaming at that. <i>Had you finally found a way to kill or at least hurt the elven leader?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to see, what was going on, you checked back to the TV. The picture was still focused on the breasts of the elven leader, but something didn't seem alright. Somehow these once majestic mounds were... deforming... shifting... fighting against the constraints of the elven leader's armament... and at the same time they looked like they were boiling... like a great heat was being induced into them... <i>Maybe you had really found a way to burn your enemy from the inside?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou willed the TV to zoom out and show the elven leader in full. And to your surprise it did. What you did see on the screen then, however, had nothing more in common with the once beautiful and ice-cold elve. Instead you were seeing a creature, which was literally burning and bursting out of her clothes... and out of her skin. In fact, there were several flames on her, consuming her pale elven skin as well as her silken blond hair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when her ear-deafening, painful screams were slowly transforming into something more dreadful than painful, into something even more lustful than dreadful, you felt how all your little hope was finally forced into sheer horror. Just before your paralyzed eyes, the blood-red, boiling remains of the elven leader's naked body started to grow bigger... thicker... and sicker... to transcend from an elven goddess into a hellish goddess... or a demoness... with gory claws at her feet and fingers, with muscular arms and powerful legs which stretched in almost endless perfection to her full and absolute knock-out ass, which was only dwarfed by her immense breasts, which were seductively swaying and bouncing with every little movement she did... Even more striking, though, was her head with glaring waves of numerous flames crowning her head instead of hair, with eyes, which were burning with the fires of damnation, with luscious lips, which could all but hide her strong fangs and forked tongue... Protruding from her back, finally, you saw two huge, bat-like wings as well as a sharply forked tail... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very creative, my dear little slave worm...\" the demoness moaned at you with the most alluring voice you had ever heard. \"This little brat of yours, will definitely enjoy those new powers, you have just given to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" you cried in shock. <i>But what could you do now?</i></span></div></div>",

But to no avail! Next she attacked the door with a new focused impact of her hot, flaming hair. But the door still held out. Finally the demoness pressed her immense breasts against the door, and it was only then that you heard a harried, piercing sound from the door... But it still seemed to resist her incredible power. And, as you were able to witness on the display, under her heavy exertions the demoness was loosing more and more blood from the wounds you had inflicted on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not wanting, to let her come to a rest, you then decided to flush the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this for torturing my girlfriend\", you shouted at the display, as you pushed the corresponding button on the control panel. With a good portion of satisfaction, you witnessed how the whole room (in general) and the demoness (in particular) was sprayed with fire fighting foam. And it was very obvious, that the cold, stifling foam was painfully cooling down and weakening the demoness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also became aware, however, how the foam was soaking and impinging into the VR-computer-system, thereby causing some little sparkles and spatters, which very obviously were also noted by the demoness. Dragging herself to the computers, you had to witness how the demoness started to rip several power cables from the various devices. And though most of these cables were crackling and scintillating with electricity, the demoness plugged one into her mouth, another one even into her vagina, and finally she attached two more cables onto (or into?) her big, fat nipples, which immediately stood hard and at erect attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, shrill and glaring sparks were running over (and through) the demoness' drained body, energizing and empowering her again... and, as you had to realize in shock, quickly and finally healing her inflicted wounds now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\", you sighed, as you heard her devilish laughter rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But wait!</i> This laughter was not only coming from the inside of that locked room.

And while you had been really disgusted by the cruel and sadistic way the elven leader had tortured you and your girlfriend before, you had at the same time felt a weird fascination for her evil power.

Likewise, you felt how the demoness embraced your little body with her huge, muscular arms, thereby pressing her huge breasts even deeper into you. And as you were completely encircled by all her sinful flesh and heat, you also heard her deep, husky moans of arousal from all around you, as all the appearances of the demoness on the displays and monitors around the room were echoing her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you felt, how your rock-hard member was attacked by the hot, sharp lips of the demoness' huge vagina...</span></div></div>",

And even if this very same demoness had tortured and even killed your beloved girlfriend Amber before, you suddenly realized, that you had developed not only a strong fascination for this evil monster... but even a deep emotion of affection. Hearing a very satisfied humming and moaning from the demoness as well, and feeling the heat and the softness of her body all around you, no other wish remained than being with this most powerful and evil goddess... Forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you maybe <i>really</i> would have just stayed like this for the rest of your life, if there hadn't been a sudden groaning and moving under you. Realizing this was somehow coming from the demoness' belly, you noted how this whole area of her powerful body was suddenly beginning to expand. Rising and retreating from her, you stared in awe, as the demoness had become highly pregnant just mere minutes after having sex with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the groans and the moans of the demoness rising to new heights of excitement, as her pregnant belly grew bigger and bigger, you too became highly aroused again. Not knowing how your stamina had rebuild so quickly, you could do nothing else but grab your already naked member and start rubbing at it like a madman. You had almost reached a new climax, when the pressing demoness, screaming out in highest overjoy, already gave birth to a first child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the little creature, you momentarily forgot about your own arousal. It had the same blood-red skin like its demonic mother. And much to your surprise, it soon started to grow bigger and bigger, until you realized that this child was developing into one of the succubi underlings from the virtual game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no</i>, you realized. <i>Not only had you made the demoness leader invade your world, but now you had also given the semen for her first minion as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the demoness, however, you realized that her belly hadn't deflated yet. Rather, she was just giving birth to another demonic child. And while this one grew out like its predecessor, even another and another child followed, until the demoness leader had finally given birth to six full grown succubi, all of them looking very strong and very feminine, though by far not so huge and powerful as their mother herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing, whether to be in horror or in love with these new succubi (which after all somehow were your children now as well), you turned to the demoness mother again, whose belly had been finally emptied now and had immediately retracted to its former slender and sexy scale. Raising your gaze from her sexy belly to those glorious masses of her immense breasts (which just had fully recharged their crackling electric power) and to her drop-dead beautiful face (which was glancing at you with a loving predator's lust), you suddenly become aware of your still rock-hard erection again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in deep affection you rushed forward into the welcoming softness of the huge, hot demoness mother again.</span></div></div>",

You want to grope her but your desire to avenge Amber is just strong enough to keep you from falling victim to the demon's charms.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nWhile you were conflicted between lust and wrath, the succubus was making her move and charging at you. By the time you became aware of the situation, she had already smashed you into the VR equipment with a thunderous crash using only a single swipe from her retractable claws. You stayed there paralyzed with fear and pain on the toppled equipment. You had some lacerations which seriously stung but which were by no means fatal.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Is that all you've got?.... If that's the case then I might as well finish this as there is no more fun to be had\"<br>\r\n      <br>\r\nShe heaved several of the servers swiftly off of their racks in an impressive display of strength and prepared to deal the final blow with the heavy impact that such a load would make. She slowly and dramatically tramped towards you as an executioner to sentence you to doom. You couldn't believe it; all of the passion that you had mustered to fight this hell spawned creature who had slain Amber had been of no avail to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having been a perhaps less than pious person though out your life, you said a prayer for Amber's soul and then in one last act of defiance you reached for some object to hurl at your attacker. She was now only a meter away from you. You were had found some object in your vicinity and were preparing yourself for her approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you became distracted by the bouncing of her bust with her foot falls; something about her bust seemed both otherworldly exciting and familiar. You and Amber had not been intimate too frequently, but you had grown used to the sight of her bust jiggling when she was a bit too comfortable around the house. Something about the shape and composition of these demonic teats brought on those memories.<br>\r\n         <br>\r\nYou pulled yourself back just in time as she had come to a stop and was dropping the stack. At least it appeared that she was going to drop the stack. You decided that here hesitation was the time you needed to throw the hunk of metal in your hand at her but before you did she asked you \"Why are you lying on the floor... and why ... and how am I holding all this hardware?!\" <br>\r\n      <br>\r\nYou could recognize Amber's confused voice coming from this body and now you were both definitely bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> 1*  The demoness should have chosen a different way to manifest in reality as by choosing the way she did, she is essentially Amber's clone/child having used Amber's own flesh to take form thus taking on her nature and even some of her memories but with a bit more of Amber's dark wild side appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2*  Both the demoness and Amber escaped into the real world and share this demoness body which is made from Amber's flesh and contains an altered version of Amber's DNA. The two were fighting for control but now they have coalesced into one part Demon goddess part Angel goddess personality.  <br>\r\n     </font></span></div></div>",

Taking the hidden blade from your collar, you lunged at the elf with the intent to kill. You thrust the knife forward, planning to stab it into the back of her neck. But just as you were mere inches away from your target, the Elf leader turns around and grabs the dagger, stopping your attack with her bare hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at you angrily as she tore the blade from your hands, tossing it to the side. Having been disarmed, you were now completely helpless. You could only watch as elf instantly healed the wound on her hand with magic before grabbing you by your hair and forcing you to the ground. She then harshly shoved your face down into the dirt before lifting one of her dainty bare feet and planting it atop your head, trapping you there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pathetic little slave worm, did you really think that you could catch me off guard like that? You're absolutely pitiful, you know that?! You're nothing but dirt; no, you're lower than dirt! What exactly were you hoping to accomplish with that little sneak attack of yours, anyway? Even if you did by some miracle manage to kill me, just look around you! You're surrounded by hundreds of my sisters, and they would all readily avenge me if I were to killed. Assuming your brilliant plan had succeeded and I were to die here, you still would have accomplished nothing more than drawing the rage of all my fellow elves upon yourself! Now, kiss my feet, slave worm. Appease me and beg for my forgiveness and I <i>might</i> just let you off with a light punishment. Maybe a few dozen lashes from my rose thorn whip will teach you some obedience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you were completely helpless in your current position, you decided to swallow your pride and kiss the beautiful elf's pretty feet. The instant that your lips came into contact with her dirty sole, all the horrible memories of being tormented by these elves began to resurface. Your mind was overloaded with fear as you began to remember what these beautiful beings had done to you before. You began to tremble as the terror took hold over your mind, and the elf leader simply laughed at the pathetic sight of you cowering at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better, worm! You'd do well to know your place! I thought that we did a good job of breaking you before, but it looks like you just don't know when to give up.\" The elf leader said as she took her foot away from your mouth and stomped harshly onto your back, forcing you face down into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Once again, you were completely helpless and being dominated by these beautiful yet unbelievably cruel elves. However, just when you were starting to think that you would have to endure all of that torture you went through once again, Amber stepped in and saved the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is going on here? What is the meaning of this?!\" Your girlfriend questioned angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf leader immediately removed her foot from your back and bowed before Amber once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing Master. This pathetic slave worm tried to fight back with a hidden dagger, but I quickly put a stop to that. I was just about to punish him for his disobedience. Is there something wrong? Would you like to take part in the punishment?\" The elf leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber didn't know how to react to this. She hadn't expected her elves to be able to stop your sneak attack like this, but they had, and now you had been captured by them again. Now she had to think fast. She could order the elves to set you free, but ordering them to free someone who just tried to kill them might make them start to question her. In a worst case scenario, they might even end up deeming her unworthy to rule them and rebelling. Unfortunately, the only other option would be to let the elves keep you as their captive for now and wait until another opportunity for revenge came up. It was a difficult choice, but Amber decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>20 years ago, you recovered from your elf-inflicted trauma and married your girlfriend Amber. 5 years before that was when that fateful day happened, the day when your girlfriend dragged you into her father's experimental VR system. It was there that you had experienced tortures unlike anything that you ever thought possible. It wasn't until many years later that you learned what had really caused that nightmare to occur: one of the lab assistants, having grown jealous of your father-in-law's astounding developments in virtual reality, installed a bug in the system that caused the programming to go haywire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even he knew that you and Amber had snuck into the VR at the time, and he never expected that his virus would cause a rogue AI to break your mind like it had. He only ever wanted to get some recognition for all the work that he had put into the project, and when he found out just how much of an impact his rash actions had on both you and Amber so much suffering, two innocent teenagers who had nothing to do with the project, he was so distraught that he committed suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that incident did set back the development of proper virtual reality system for several years, society eventually moved on and the research was resumed. It was only a few years ago that it happened, but after getting commissioned by a major company, Amber's father finally perfected his VR machine. Ever since that breakthrough, virtual reality had become the new internet. It had been developed into a part of everyday life for most members of society, and the nearly endless possibilities that it offered made it one of the most revolutionary technologies of all time. Rather it was used by teens to hang out with their friends, by car developers to run tests on just how well their newest vehicles would fare in a crash, or by horny couples who wanted to try something new that would be impossible in the real world. Almost everything was done through virtual reality now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your own life, you were now 43 years old, living happily with your wife Amber, your 16 year old daughter Lilly, and your 18 year old son, Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amber was now 44 years old, her appearance was still overflowing with youth. She barely looked a day over 20, and her feminine figure was still just as flawless as ever. Due to recent technological breakthroughs, many types of surgery that once cost an arm and a leg and weren't even entirely were now perfectly safe and easily affordable. As a result, Amber got her vision fixed and no longer wore glasses. That first day that she came home without them, you were amazed by how different she looked. She had always had a beautiful face, but ever since she took of those glasses she'd become more stunning than ever before. After becoming a mother, Amber had discarded her childish carefree outlook on life and become much more reliable. Not only that, but her once hyper competitive nature mellowed out greatly over the years. While she still couldn't resist a good game every now and then, she was much more laid back about it and didn't seem to care nearly as much about if she won or lost as long anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sadly, her father was getting up there in the years, and his health was starting to decline. He had recently retired from his executive position in Virtual Dreams, the corporation that had helped him complete the VR machine, and Amber took it upon herself to inherit his mantle as the new head of the company. That's right, your wife was now the person who essentially oversaw all VR activity worldwide and made sure everything was working properly. Luckily, once her father perfected the system's design, there were almost no holes in its security. Many hackers did take the supposedly impenetrable security system as a challenge, but to date not a single one of them had managed to even break through the first layer of defense. As a result, there had never been any other incidents like yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your firstborn child Jake was now 18 years old, the same age that you were back when you had first come in contact with virtual reality. While you were still hesitant to trust it again after what it did you you back then, Jake loved everything about it. He almost spent more time in the VR than he did in the real world. Jake also had a girlfriend who he had been dating for 2 years straight. As a matter of fact, he was in many ways the spitting image of you back in your teenage years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your second child Lilly, she had taken on many of he mother's traits. Much like Amber, Lilly possessed long blond hair and a beautiful figure. She had also inherited her mother's love for technology, and was just as in love with virtual reality as Jake was. Much as he was the sitting image of you as a teen, Lilly was almost a mirror image of Amber's past self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, everything about your life seemed to be perfect. You were living every day with your loving family. However, something about your life was going to change very soon... And for better or for worse, it involved virtual reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I can't keep letting what happened back then hold me back. After all, you and the kids love virtual reality. It's become such a major part of your lives, and yet I'm still too scared to join you. I don't want that anymore. I'm tired of just watching you from the sidelines and letting all these opportunities pass me by. I need to get over what happened that day, or else I'll never be able to move forward with my life. And besides, you're the one who developed the current design of the VR system. If nothing else, I trust you. I trust that your programming wouldn't let something like that happen again. I love you, Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was so touched by everything that you were doing for her, and what you just said sent her over the edge. Without warning, she wrapped her arms behind your neck and pulled you in for a passionate kiss. You both closed your eyes and simply enjoyed the feeling.

Better not keep the kids waiting.\" you said when the kiss ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the pair of you walked onward down the field.

Play it for me like you used to.\" Amber said into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in you don't know how long, you take the guitar from your son and sit down.</span></div></div>",

Your kids smiled as they saw the talent their old man had. Amber put her hands under her chin and grinned, just like she used to when the two of you were young.

She then alters reality so that the floor in the room is a mat. At least sitting on the floor is more comfortable that way. She makes a quick phone call before telling you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to be gone for a little while, but My friend Helen is on her way here. She is going to watch over you until I get back, OK?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress. I will do everything mistress Helen says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say back to her with your head down. Amber didn't really catch all of that. She was to lost in thought about how to help you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that you do, my love...\"  She says as she exits the program and goes outside to meet up with her best friend Helen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen doesn't exactly like you, but she doesn't hate you either. She is a tall Italian girl who tends to dress like a Goth. She is a little taller than you, standing at five foot ten. Amber tells her about what has happened to you and asks her to go into the program and watch you while she looks for someone who can help. She gives her all the command codes so that what happened to you won't happen to her. She then brings Helen back to the lab and sits her in the chair set up for her before helping her hook herself up to the system. As you are sitting on the floor you see Amber's friend Helen appear in front of you. Helen sees you on the floor cowering and almost laughs but stops herself. She looks you over, and you nervously back up until you feel your back pressing against the wall of the room. Helen starts trying out her control over this reality by creating a big cushy chair to sit in. She sits down and looks at you again before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you tell me what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks while leaning forward in her chair. You slowly look up at her feet, knowing not to look her in the eyes or you would most likely be punished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was punished by the M-mistress Amber's elves b-because I t-thought I was human.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen just stares at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not human? What are you then?\" She asks leaning in closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices you looking at her platformed boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I am a slave worm.\"  You say meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber didn't go into to much detail on your condition and what happened to you so Helen is trying to find out more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's a slave worm? I mean what does a slave worm do?  She asks coyly.  You keep looking at her boots and answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a slave worm is not human. A slave worm always does as it is told.\" you say sinking lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Helen was getting fairly curious about what exactly had happened to you. She was fairly surprised to see that the situation was this bad, and she wanted to know the real cause. How does she go about finding this out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They m-made me a-always clean all their d-dirty b-b-boots.\u201d  You finally get out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen looks at you and cocks her head.

I mean, I have had them for a while and I wear them almost always...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Helen looks back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs that why you keep looking at my feet Slave Worm? You want to clean my boots?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know what to say.

Do you need a rag or some water or something?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really doesn\u2019t realize the extreme torture and humiliation you were put through by the Elves. She thinks it was mostly verbal abuse, brainwashing and forced to do labor.  You look at her not knowing what to say.  She frowns and looks at you a little impatiently and say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhatever you need just tell me, or just do it. You have my permission.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly crawl over to her feet. Helen sits there watching. You kneel at her feet and nervously grab one of her boots and lift it up. Helen thinks that maybe you are going to spit shine her boots.  Her green eyes get really big when you stick out your tongue and start licking the toe of her leather boot.  Her shock turns into disgust and then into amusement. She starts laughing at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh My God! You mean to tell me you had to lick all those Elf women\u2019s boots? They made you that pathetic? That is so damn funny!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush but keep licking her boot. Running your tongue along the bottom and tasting the grime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat else did those mean ol' Elves make my poor little Slave Worm do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and start to answer, but Helen stops you short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait I need to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She laughed loudly and the earth shook as she charged forward.  You hastily tell your dwarves to fire but the cross bow bolts don't even break her skin.  Just as she's about to reach the wall you realize that was hopeless and the elves were charging too and you had the dwarves fire on the advancing soldiers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber the 60 foot tall Giantess stepped onto the 20 foot wall, crushing 5 dwarves in the process and jumped over the wall.  In shock you saw her stomp on one of your precious Golems.  Enraged you fired a blast of lightning.  It shocked her and that caught her attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!  That was almost as bad as static electricity.\"  Oh crap you thought.  Mustering your will you unleash another bolt of lightning at her.  This time she waves her hand and her magic shields her.  Suddenly she reaches low and plucks you off the wall in her giant hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour crushed but thanks to the program your not actually killed by it.  Using your strength you try to squirm but your good and stuck because starting off she was just as strong as you before growing 60 feet tall!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour helpless as you watch Amber stomp and kick your army to shreds.  Soon the elves have conquered all.  You sigh and let your head drop.  \"You win Amber, good game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber pulls you up to eye level, \"I win when you are killed.  That hasn't happened yet.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't do anything, you got me good. I really didn't think about sacrificing my castle to get the shrines, it was a good move Amber.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at your praise but there is a bit of an evil glint in her eye.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its actually difficult to kill the opposing ruler.

You were being crushed from all sides and you couldn't breathe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retracts you a little bit but not completely out of her asshole. You still can't get a breath and your being rubbed raw by the insides of her ass. You scream and pound the fleshy walls around you but either she can't hear you or simply doesn't care. She is fucking your ass with your entire body! You have never felt as much nausea and terror as you do now, you can only pray that soon you will pass out and 'die' in the game so it will be over and you can go back to the real world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either I finish you off, or nobody can win the game. You understand, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yeah, I know... Just please try to make it quick, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try my best, but like I said; the ruler is able to take a lot of punishment before dying. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to do this painlessly. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Amber. I lost the game fair and square, so now I have to face the penalty. It's as simple as that.

Alright love, I'll try to make this as quick as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, Amber's giant foot descended upon your body like a 20 ton weight. The pressure was incredibly painful, and you were amazed by the fact that you hadn't popped like a grape already. When she said that you would be able to take a lot of punishment before dying, she wasn't kidding! You were sure that Amber was putting all of her weight onto you, but you were somehow able to survive it. You could hear Amber's elf army giggling as you were slowly being flattened beneath their leader's foot, and you could tell that all those pointy-eared girls were enjoying the show. Soon you began to feel your bones cracking under the immense pressure, and you could tell that you had almost reached your limits. In mere moments, the soft sole of your girlfriend's foot pressed your helpless body flat. She let out a slight giggle as she heard your body pop beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you found yourself rematerialized in another room, which you soon recognized as the room you first appeared in when you and Amber entered the virtual world. You were lying on your back and your body showed no signs of all the damage you took earlier. Looking around, you see that Amber is standing in front of you with her hands on her hips, a triumphant look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really fun Amber, we should do it again some time. I'll be sure to win next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber simply giggled and reached out her hand to help you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see that you're still a good sport when it comes to losing, Tom. I didn't want you to be angry at me or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be angry? Like I said, you won fair and square. I should have known better than to underestimate you in a strategy game; especially one that you created. So, since I lost, you're going to be claiming the reward, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Amber answer you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see the crudely made goblins towers multiply now with even more war weapons.  The turn ends and you see Amber has taken the field again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of your wolf rider groups was slaughtered and a large group of elves was beginning to march toward the shrine.  But still even that group of elves was not enough to really threaten your goblins there... unless of course Amber was planning to be in on the assault personally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes that is what is she going to do... I'm entrenched there so I'll go in person.  She shouldn't be able to beat me then.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou travel to it and wait for the impending assault.  Nervous about sneak attacks you replenish your lost troops with orders for more wolf riders to be produced.  It dawns on you that your cautious play has put you down several units.  Still there wasn't any risk of losing at the shrine, you were ready for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that lead to disaster!  Your trolls who had been moving to reinforce the shrine got ambushed by the Elf cavalry!  They put up a tremendous fight  but the numbers were against them.  Hidden Elf units popped up all around the shrine you were defending.  They had you encircled!  Still they did not attack... you had the defensive ground. But now no more reinforcements could arrive from your castle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA turn goes by and your situation is grim.  She has more units on the field.  Magic is even.  She was bold on the battlefield and had personally entered conflicts allowing her troops to gain an advantage in numbers.  Now you were trapped here until you went into battle personally to try to break the encirclement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to do it.  She's outplayed me.  I was too cautious I should have attacked earlier!  Damn it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your goblins and put forward your next turn of orders.  You were going to strike out at the forces between your castle and the shrine.  You had to win this fight... you were going personally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe field of battle was arrayed.  You had a dozen goblin infantry units.  Two wolf riding units and a single troll unit remaining.  On the other side of the battle field was Amber.  She was grinning in triumph.  She had ten Elf infantry units.  Three Elf cavalry units and.. what were the elite elf units?  </span></div></div>",

Worse was the money advantage had built up since Amber hadn't lost units whole sale like you had, which meant that she had more funds for the elite units.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe system let you know Faeries were two foot tall women with wings.  They were fast and could cast a number of spells.  They could deflect magic attacks, they could shrink opponents and they could blind enemies.  The shrinking part was worrisome though you figured with your shrine magic you should be able to resist the effects.  Of course your goblin troops... probably wouldn't be as lucky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put both wolf riders on opposite flanks, anchored the center of your line with trolls and had your army fan out on either side of them.

You have no idea if it did any good since you kind of rambled at the end but hey they still cheered!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber had arrayed her units in a different fashion.  All three units of Elf cavalry were on your right side and they were swinging very far wide.  Her regular soldiers and Fairies were mixed together.  And you soon learned why.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gathered some of your magical energy and launched a long range lightning strike.  The Fairies countered with their own magic and your magical levels dipped.  In response Amber unleashed a fire ball that slammed into your trolls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit, shit, shit!  They are weak to fire.  I should have focused on blocking her magic instead of sending my own at them!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse yourself for your stupidity and are determined not to make any more mistakes.  Your trolls had taken a tough hit but they were still alive.  And the next time Amber fired her fireball you were ready and launched a wave of magic to counter it.  It was successful and you breathed out a sigh of relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf cavalry was coming around the flank.  You had some options.  You could turn a few goblin units and use your wolf riders to counter.  Or you could use your wolf riders to distract them.  It would mean they would be slaughtered but if they could keep them busy until the main battle was over it might be your best chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?  </span></div></div>",

Instead, you chose something the Lord of the Rings had given you the idea for.<br>\r\n\"I choose mankind!\" You said, and you teleported to a castle. In the room with you was a giant map table and four generals. One was a knight, another a Japanese shogun, a Cossack calvaryman, and an ottoman or Turkish general. The knight spoke up first.<br>\r\n\"Greetings my liege, I am Gridley, the commander of the men of this garrison. I am the commander of all your standard infantry, Calvary, and archers. My fellow generals here all provide support troops. They are all more specialized versions of the three I have just mentioned. But they will instruct you on that.\"<br>\r\nThe Japanese warrior spoke up next.<br>\r\n\"I am the commander of the Samurai warriors. We are the most elite infantry you have available. None can match our skills soldier for soldier. We are good against other swordsman, and our pikes will halt many calvary charges.\" With a gesture of respect, he sat down again. Up next was the Russian-looking man. He was very large and wore heavy furs and a ushanka.<br>\r\n\"I am Fyodor, and I will be the leader of all the Cossack horsemen in this fight. We are the best horsemen there are, if I only say so without exaggerating. The enemy will fall like wheat before the scythe when we attack.\" Fyodor closed his fist, and looked as if he could easily crush several elf skulls with one hand. The last general, the Ottoman, stood and began his interesting introduction.<br>\r\n\"If you are a commander worthy of your position, you will have figured out that I will be the man to lead your ranged units. Now, we do not use arrows and the bow. We have a weapon far deadlier. Using gunpowder, we can construct massive cannons that topple fortresses in the blink of an eye. We equip our soldiers with muskets that will mow down hordes of the enemy before they can touch our forces. But these guns do have drawbacks, as do all the other units. I am also the overseer of scientific endeavors. Instead of using all your money on units, you may send some of them to the alchemists, the smithies, and the forges to improve those troops you already own. For instance, we are on the brink of discovering rifles that can fire ten balls without reloading. Also, they contain the powder behind the ball, so we now call them bullets. We put these in magazines, and then all a soldier must do is replace the clip when all the bullets have been fired. It takes no more than ten seconds in the greenest recruit. And giving the calvary such weapons, or even making it the standard issue weapon of your forces, why, mankind would be unstoppable!!! The shrines won't matter a damn, with science we shall smash the enemies!\" the Ottoman finished his introduction. You smiled. By the end of the game, you would be rolling over your girlfriend's forces in tanks.<br>\r\nYou took another look at the map. It was much larger than the one you last played on, and the shrines would be harder to reach. But it resembled Europe a lot, and the forces around you seemed like an odd mashup of medieval ages and the beginning of World War 1.</span></div></div>",

Or, it could be a colossal waste of resources, and result in your loss. After thinking for a while, you decided.<br>\r\n\"I want to put as much money as possible into the further developments of the guns. What do you need?\" you asked. The generals began to murmur among themselves.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" the scientific advisor said, \"We will need a large source of both metal and gunpowder. At last check, I think there are suitable deposits here,\" he pointed to a spot on the map, which was pretty close to one of your forts. \"And and here.\" The next one was farther away, by the far corner of this huge map. This was by one of those shrines, which would be doubly helpful.<br>\r\n\"I want to secure the closest resources first. Gridley, send your best calvary platoon, supported by two infantry battalions. To the far deposit, I want two Cossack units and whatever samurai are available. For ranged, a crossbow archer team. Bring civilians to both settle and mine these things. But Amber must not find out what we are up to. If she does, we won't get the opportunity to use these rifles. So the Musketeers stay and defend this citadel.\" At the end of your speech you felt good. Everything was going well, and would continue on this course. The elves would never know what hit them.<br>\r\nAs the generals left the room, you looked at the map. It had your castle situated on one side of the map, close to the south-eastern border of Germany. From what it looked like, Amber's was across the ocean, in Ireland. Well that might be an obstacle, especially considering the geography and the elves' ability to use it to their full advantage. But the map had several slight, and one or two larger, differences from normal Europe. Maybe Ireland's landscape would be different.<br>\r\nSpeaking of landscape, you walked outside for the first time. You stood on a porch, attached to a fortress protruding from the edge of a mountain. Below was a frantic scramble of activity. People and goods moved around crazily, all in a jumble. The chaos had a strange order to it though, and was very hypnotic. Off to the left, a motion grabbed your attention. There, almost hidden in the other buildings, was a train station. This world was incredibly messed up if there was a train in a castle, whose walls were patrolled by men wielding muskets. You shook your head and went back inside to see to the movement of your troops.</span></div></div>",

You'd forgotten about your side project in the revelry of a newer report. A patrol of elves had been encountered by a scouting group of cossacks. The patrol had been eradicated, with only two out of the fifty surviving. Those were let go to report back to their nearest base, and were being followed by some of Gridley's scouts. But now the Ottoman general strolled into your map room looking satisfied.<br>\r\n\"We have begun our mining operations at both sites. Soon we will be able to start producing prototypes of the weapons. As soon as the rail lines are finished, that is. The country around has become less safe. It seems that Amber has sent an army of elves to secure the shrine nearby, and she may even cause a potential problem with the logistics of this product. Shall we send more troops to support them?\" he asked. You thought for a minute.<br>\r\n\"No, have them lie low, and appear as much like a normal mining village as possible. But,\" you thought more seriously about how much you needed the metals there, \"it is a good idea to reinforce them. Send some more swordsmen. That should be enough.\" With that, the general left. When the door clicked shut, a portion of the wall slid back on the other side of the room. Another man walked out, dressed in a long black overcoat with polished black boots and a brisk walk.<br>\r\n\"And who are you? How did you get in here? And where did that door come from?\" you demanded of the stranger. You grabbed your sword, and held it ready to attack.<br>\r\n\"That will not be necessary. I am simply another official, seeking support for my branch.\" he said, in a silky voice that had dangerous ripple to it.<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\" you asked carefully. He looked very dangerous, even unarmed and making no move to arm himself. He examined his fingers.<br>\r\n\"I represent a secret wing of this government, that was created for situations like the one you face here. Namely: total annihilation. You see, you know the weapons you will be producing. You have no idea how to use them. In fact, your first use of them will be a disgrace to it. Let me assist in its development as the wave of the future.\" The stranger said. Normally, people who walked in and asked for money would be thrown out. But he came through a wall. That said something.<br>\r\n\"What do you need, and what shall you do with it?\" you inquired, curious now. You were positive the guns would smash any elven army.<br>\r\n\"I only need a small allotment of funding. The rest of the resources we need, we will see to ourselves. Alas-\" he smiled regretfully now, \"I cannot tell you what we shall develop with this. It is too secret a project for loose ends.\"<br>\r\nBristling, you were about to challenge him on being a 'loose end'. You were a king! But then you deflated. He was a computer program. You were already poised to beat your girlfriend in the greatest victory since the Allies beat the Nazis. What was the little money this man wanted. Nothing. You could afford it. You agreed, and you both smiled. His gave you a chill, even though he was only a program.</span></div></div>",

You stood at the head of a mighty army, with a battalion of riflemen to cover your horsemen and swordsmen. They didn't wear the bulky armor the rest of the army did, they had looser-fitting overcoats of trench coats. The site of this historical event was the very town you mined the metals from, and where Amber's army was bearing down on. It had been almost a month since the rails opened, and you had sent a number of forces to delay the elves. Each attack had worked better than the next. You were invincible!! Now, they would witness your power.<br>\r\n\"Onward!\" you called! Your glorious forces marched forward across the plains of this territory. Ahead, the tents of the elves were visible on the rolling fields.<br>\r\n\"Today, we strike the first blow to show the elves our invincibility! Today, is the beginning of our victory!\" the army cheered at your words. Several generals nodded approval. Then you grabbed a rifle and marched forward. An hour of hiking brought you to the crest of a hill overlooking the elves.<br>\r\n\"Prepare to die!\" the soldiers yelled down. The elves were obviously unprepared, and frantically scrambled to grab weapons. The riflemen fired before that happened. Dozens fell to this new terror. Your knights rushed forward, the Calvary charged, and then things fell to pieces.<br>\r\n\"Dammit, they're blocking my aim!\"<br>\r\n\"We can't shoot or we'll hit our own!\"<br>\r\nThese cries echoed among the riflemen, now useless. But your forces were still sweeping through the valley, burning the settlement and killing the elves. Then a rumbling from the left froze your blood. You knew she was better than you at strategy, and you'd been outmaneuvered.<br>\r\n\"On the left!\"<br>\r\n\"Shoot! Shoot!<br>\r\n\"Holy God, what's that!\"<br>\r\nThe riflemen now hollered in shock as they adjusted to this new threat. Then, a great dragon flew overhead, breathing fiery death. It paralyzed you with fear, as were many of the soldiers. It bellowed, and swooped on your army. The first pass was devastating, but it had only attacked the lesser of the dangers. The men behind you recovered quickly, and fired at the beast. The rider fell, hit. The dragon howled in pain, and flew off. But your army was mortally wounded, and you could see that.<br>\r\n\"Retreat! Fall back!\"<br>\r\nThe soldiers were already doing just that as the elves swept down like a wave, sweeping past all resistance. A retreat turned into a rout as more and more troops blindly ran backwards. Some fought till the end, but not enough.</span></div></div>",

Why not fight?\"<br>\r\nIt was the man who walked though your wall a month ago. He wore the same outfit, but carried a rifle. \"So something didn't go as planned? My king,\" He smiled smugly and gestured to a train that loomed out of the fog, \"let me show you the result of our research!\" A dozen soldiers dressed unlike your men ran up to the train and pulled massive tarps off the cars. The fog was still too thick to see anything. But the wild yells of the elves and the screams of the slow and the wounded sounded uncomfortably close. One elf led hundreds of meters in front of the others. You had seen him slaying dozens of knights, as if possessed. Now, he leapt for the strange general. He stepped left, calmly doting all his blows. With another predatory grin, he darted forward, jabbing a dagger into his stomach. The elf fell with a cry. The mysterious man shot him twice in the head.<br>\r\n\"A pity for such a good warrior to give her life at so pitiful a task.\" He pulled something over his face, then tossed you one. \"You would be well advised to wear this.\" You did. Now the retreating soldiers had stopped, all of them dead or gone. Now some of this commander's men marched forward in neat lines. The elves charged on. The general himself pulled out a yellow canister. He yanked the pin, and tossed it onto the ground between the elves and the men. More of these flew from the lines of soldiers. Then they began to dig trenches.<br>\r\nThe elves reached the canisters, and laughed. One picked one of them off the ground. \"A useless weapon indeed! Forward, victory is ours!\" He hefted the can. It began to spew evil-looking fumes. Some got in his face, and he fell choking. The other canisters were now venting their gasses. By the dozens, hundreds, legions of the elves fell, clutching at throats and eyes and noses. A fog much yellower than the one behind you spread over the battlefield, slaughtering the onrushing army.<br>\r\n\"FIRE!!\" The general yelled. On the train, cannons blasted. These were louder than the ball-firing ones on the castle. Some exploded, sending pieces of elves flying. Others sent gas down the throats of the survivors. With a cheer, the stranger's armies leapt from their trenches, bayonets glistening. They charged with immunity into the gasses, skewering the enemy, or blowing him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, thousands lay dead. The valley was pock-marked with shell holes. The air still had a strange tang from the gas. Some hundred elves were now prisoners, either surrendered or one of the wounded who weren't executed on sight.<br>\r\n\"Well my king, we have certaintly beaten them here. I do not believe that they shall beat us again. I do not believe I have introduced myself properly. I am Schmidt.\" He extended a gloved hand. You didn't look him in the eyes for two reasons. A column of elves marched past, guarded by some troopers. They looked hollow, as if their souls were already dead. The second was Schmidt's eyes. They seemed amused by your fear of him.

Following Schmidt's suggestions, you had made rifles standard issue weapons, replacing the swords and bows, and even mounted calvary with melee weapons. The Shogun's men had adapted quickly to the new weapons and had become the bravest soldiers on the field. Gridley's former knights had had a little trouble adapting to ranged fighting, and often opted for brutal charges against the enemy. Sometimes it worked, other times it cost thousands to gain a mile of territory. The Ottoman troops were extremely practiced snipers, and routinely infiltrated enemy lines to kill the commanders of the elven legions. The cossaks had rifles, and used them to devastating effect. They would often make the elves take cover while they got close, and then went to town, hacking and slicing with their sabers. The deadly mustard and chlorine gasses Schmidt had used had never been used again, partly because they were terror weapons, partly because they were no longer necessary. Schmidt and his forces were nowhere to be found, which made you worried. His cannons were still beyond your forces, although you were catching up quickly.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the elves were also adapting to the surge forward in technology. They had begun to employ mages to protect their soldiers with shields. Luckily, they couldn't cast devastating spells without seeing their targets, and a Mage sticking his head out was dead shortly after.<br>\r\nYou and your forces were now slogging on through what would have been France on a normal world. It was brutal, with each encounter with the elves costing droves of men. There were even scattered reports of them using muskets and rifles against your armies. They'd also stopped surrendering in hordes when caught under fire. An arrow pierced the man next to you, interrupting your thoughts.<br>\r\n\"AMBUSH!\" A soldier yelled. Another arrow clanged off your helmet. A fusillade of bullets sprayed into the woods, along with some prototype grenades. The fortified trenches began to stretch their skeletal fingers over the landscape, like the fingers of death. You were digging as well. Dammit, you were a king, you shouldn't have to put up with this. But even with your seemingly imminent victory, citizens under your rule were dissatisfied with the rationing of food and other goods. Another development, filming and mass printing, allowed for better propaganda. The king fighting among the men helped raise morale. So you were digging to keep yourself from being skewered, although you doubted only one would kill you.</span></div></div>",

Consulting your generals, you began to marshal your forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your army was ready to fight. You were just grabbing your kingly rifle when a strange racket grabbed your attention. Running outside, you saw something you never would have thought to see in here. Schmidt was back, and landing in a helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my king. How goes the campaign? It looks like you will be taking this city today, no? This is good, you should be victorious before long. You might remember the weapons I employed to turn the tide in our last major battle. They will definitely suit you in this instance, sir.\" He loaded the last word with a good bit of scorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, his strange-looking helicopter took off and buzzed away. The hideous gasses had been developed further, and all your troops carried masks and wore protective clothing. Just in case Amber made that leap. But now one of your runners arrived, looking relieved. He jogged up and saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have some new deliveries for the fighting my lord. I recommend you come examine them at your closest convenience.\" You had a war to fight, but nobody seemed to care what you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just wanted to show off this latest innovation. Sometimes you wondered if the computer wasn't the one really in control here.  But your feet had taken you to a train, where some very large artillery cannons were being deployed. The officer grinned wickedly when he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA! There he is. Sorry to interrupt but I didn't want to start blasting away at our own men. We're gonna gas the city as your troops get close, drive the elves out and into your guns. Then we'll paste the thing and blow it to ashes. We got some special ordinance for that now, yes we do. Been doing this for long enough glad to get a change in pace!\" The gunner seemed extremely eager at the prospect of blowing things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the rail guns to their work, you moved to the battalions of soldiers. You found your platoon and ordered them forward. The whole assembly trotted forward, approaching the city. When you were a few hundred yards away, the cannons behind opened fire. The shells shrieked by overhead with a sound like damned souls, and quietly burst in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MASKS! MASKS! MASKS!\" The officers yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling and screaming from the city rose to a fever pitch, and then elves began to boil out of the walls closest to your lines. They were too far away to see clearly, so you couldn't see the frantic looks in their eyes and the hideous boils and burns on the skin of others. Some, even more ominously, simply slowed down and fell over. As they closed on the humans, rifles began to open up and machine guns chattered away happily. Now the shells crashing among the elves charging for the gates were high explosive, sending chunks of masonry and limbs flying into the air. What seemed like hours later, the weapons died out. The elves had stopped running out. The shells no longer whistled by. And mounds of bodies lay in front of you. The city was taken, but part of your soul had died. Among the multitudes of dead were civilians. In fact, the majority of those fallen around you as you advanced weren't dressed in the military robes of fighting elves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the dead were being cleared out, the artillery began hammering away again. An hour later, a tremendous explosion from the rails rose above the trees. The troops grabbed the weapons and began to fortify, unsure of what was going on. Then, over the plains, a group of humans were running from the direction of the artillery. They were almost to the gates when three huge metallic beasts lumbered over the same ground. The things looked like armored spiders, with two gun turrets mounted on the sides. Each nightmare was easily the size of a small house. The guns opened fire, blasting cannon shells towards the fleeing artillerymen. Some exploded in the rear and killed the stragglers. The rest made it safely behind the walls. One was the commander you'd talked to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those things?\" you yelled down from the ramparts as they hastily closed the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big. Nasty. Ugly. Other than that, I have no idea. They were spotted awhile ago, at least twenty of them. We killed some of them, but they're frighteningly fast. I give us about ten minutes before we're all dead here. The beasties are pretty immune to gas sadly.\" The soldier seemed mournful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the spiders were firing at the walls, chunks of it giving away under the barrage. The elves advanced under the cover of the fire, but didn't have the capability to take much of the ruins. However, when anything bigger than a rifle opened fire the spiders blew it away. The clanking behemoths had been joined by several other nightmarish creations, and were right outside the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me,\" you said to the artilleryman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a can of gas and a towel. Quickly wrapping the towel around a rock, you doused it in kerosene from a ruined lamp. Handing it to the commander you instructed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw this right after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You popped the can of gas and chucked it at the spider rooting through the town right next to you. It lodged in its maw, and it popped it open with its mandibles and teeth. A cloud of yellow gas erupted from the ruptured can. The soldier lit the towel with a match, and hurled it at the same spot you had. The gas was highly flammable, as evidenced by the explosions earlier. The cloud that had been covering the monster's face burst into a sheet of fire, making it rear back in agony. It clawed at its face, and howled in a strange scream. A soldier with a new grenade launcher thought quickly shot a round into the mouth. The ensuing explosion caused it more pain, and another launcher sent a gas round down its throat. Now that the noxious fumes were inside its defenses, they worked as intended and it toppled over dead. Elves popped out of turrets and other apparatus on the beast. Some made it to cover, others were hacked down by gunfire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment, the spiders and their drivers pulled back, stunned that one of them could have been taken down. You used the brief respite to organize your survivors. About 25% had been killed or captured in the last round of fighting, and many of your machine guns were down. With a little over 1500 men you fell back a little into the denser ruins and began to set up defensive positions. The elves would be back to finish you off, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the surviving machine guns had been set up, the elves rushed the humans. Two spiders walked ahead of the infantry. They laid down cannon fire and machine gun barrages all over, trying to figure out where your men were concealed. Finally the enemy got to within 200 yards. Guns barked and elves fell, the charge quickly losing steam. Some of the soldiers in the trenches fell, stricken by arrows or bullets. The spiders began to close in. They couldn't come as far into the wreckage as you could, but from a distance they were still lethal. As a new trick, one opened its maw and unleashed a wave of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall back! Retreat!\" You jumped from the trenches and moved to a position farther back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to cover the other soldiers while they moved back. Then you were running again. The wound from earlier hurt under the panic and the strain. Maybe Amber had finally gotten you. All it took was one victory, even though the other campaigns had been advancing so well. Cursing the town, you fired a round at an elf. You missed, and he turned to shoot you. You worked the bolt on your gun, but it jammed. Too late to dive for cover, this was the end. You were doomed to be violated by a-CRACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gunshot came from your right. The elf crumpled, a stain spreading over its chest. Then time slowed to normal speed again, and you realized that a second hadn't even passed since the jammed bolt and the dead elf. Someone was talking in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move you fool, do you want to end up like him?\" In a daze, you followed the soldier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troops were running towards the citadel, a relic from wars fought with swords and arrows. Now that the heaviest weapons effectively used would be your machine guns, it would still be a good stronghold. When you ran through the doors, they slammed shut behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, you have no idea how thankful I am. I'm the king, who are you?\" you babbled to the soldier who saved you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked closer at him now. He was somewhat older, his hair graying. A small but noticeable scar ran up his cheek. He had a fur coat with black leather shielding him from the cold of fall. His eyes had a gleam similar to Schmidt's, but less obvious, more like a hawk about to swoop on an unsuspecting mouse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thorvald. Heinz Thorvald.\" his voice also had an edge to it. \"Sniper. And you're lucky there was only the one. I don't fancy sticking my neck out when not necessary. Even if you're a king.\" And thus ended your first discussion with Thorvald. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, you would accompany him on his sniping trips and meeting his fellow squad mates. It helped pass the boredom of waiting for an elf attack, and you picked up some tricks about sniping, and a gleaming new scope. The first lesson you learned happened when an elf sniper almost took you out, spotting you by the glare off the scope. From then on, cloth muted the colors of the scope.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Today was a normal day, a week into the siege of the fortress. Your troops were beginning to run low on food, although a reservoir kept everyone from being thirsty. Ammunition was also threatening to be a problem. But it was also a good day for your sniper team. The more experienced sniper you shadowed had killed three elven officers, and it was only noon. You hadn't shot, only spotted and stood watch. This afternoon, the roles would reverse. It was important to keep the elves from feeling safe in their own trenches. They were building up troop strength inside the ruins, and would eventually overwhelm you. But demoralizing them and killing their leaders would make that harder for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never want to be in the same space twice when shooting. That is a definite way to get riddled with bullets. And we need every man in this ruin,\" The sniper had a British accent which was strange because the virtual Britain was under Amber's control. You asked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a while ago they just stormed out of the woods. Our militias and armies fought them over every inch, but it was just too much. Many of us fled here. The ones who didn't got massacred or enslaved. That was before we had beauties like this one here.\" he looked at his rifle happily. \"And I'm going to go back there soon. I will personally burn ten villages for every one of my family members I don't find. This stuff here is just a warmup. Hello, what's this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the scope of the rifle. Following it with your binoculars you noticed a form on the horizon. Then, it separated into three different forms, which rapidly grew larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, those are armored dragons I believe. We now have two options open to us my liege. Surrender or die.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elf with a captain's crest began to tenderly advance with a squad. The sniper shot him in the head, making a neat hole above his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn, a little to the left. Well, let's relocate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The flapping of leathery wings was growing louder, along with the screeches of the dragons. Not a moment after you began to descend the battered staircase flames boiled through the windows. You would have been deep-fried if you'd waited one more second. At the bottom of the stairs Thorvald and a surviving artilleryman awaited you. The British sniper saluted and walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're well and truly screwed now. It won't be too easy hitting those with anything that'll hurt em. I'm willing to fight, but I'll surrender if I have to.\" the gunner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thorvald nodded agreement. You wanted to fight, you would die either way if Amber got a hold on you. This decision puzzled you. Maybe they wouldn't recognize you if you surrendured. Then again, maybe they would. Emphasizing that time was not on your side, loud booms echoed through the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Going after the door. Well, I'm gonna go drop some grenades on them.\" The artilleryman walked off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThorvald left after. You went to join the emplacements behind the door, ready to repel whatever forces the elves threw at you. Even running, it took a good five minutes to get to the door. It was beginning to splinter and bulge inward. You could hear the spiders hissing, the dragons howling, and the elves cheering. Quietly, you could hear another sound. It was just background noise, but it was getting steadily louder. The banging on the doors ceased, and cheers turned to alarmed shouts. You could hear the dragons and spider shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The noise was now very loud, and getting even louder. It reached a terrifying shrieking noise for a moment, and a short burst of gunfire rattled through the walls. A louder burst answered and the shrieking passed. Now you could distinctly hear at least six similar sounds. They grew in intensity too, although at slightly different pitches. More deep bursts of firing sounded outside, and a stream of holes punched through the thick doors. Adjusting your grip on the rifles, you nervously wiped the sweat off your brow. The elves were screaming outside now, after the latest pass by the shriekers caused a loud explosion the dragons were calling out in what could have been worry, whatever guns they had on them firing rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow audible was a clanking noise. More explosions, and then the beat of wings. The dragons were leaving the elves undefended. But why? The answer came crashing through the door the next instant. A huge blast shattered the door. You ducked behind the sandbags like everyone else to avoid large splinters. Then the sounds of battle grew louder. Raising your head, you stared out in awe. A line of tanks was advancing on the elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A spider and a dragon were dead, horribly mutilated. Two more were flying towards this new threat. Then the shrieks came again, and three jets flew by overhead. They looked like some prototype planes you'd seen in a WWII documentary a while ago. They all had a large cannon mounted on their noses, complemented by four smaller cannons. They strafed the ground troops, sending columns of dirt fountaining into the air. You wondered why they weren't taking out the aerial threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen four more planes flew over. These were delta shaped, and looked faster and more maneuverable than the ones murdering the ground elves. They broke off in pairs, each pair circling in on a dragon. Like predatory birds, they dove on their targets guns blazing. The dragons howled in pain, but stayed aloft. Battered and broken, they tried to fly off. Then one of the other planes with the cannon broke off the ground run and blasted away at the dragon. The beast seemed to come apart under the guns of the deadly plane, chunks of meat being torn off. The plane fired a shot at the neck, and it separated completely from the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanks were rolling on, mostly unimpeded by the wreckage. The elves fired everything they could at the behemoths, but their thick armor shed the bullets, balls, and arrows like rain. The chattering of their machine guns and the booms of their 88 and 75 mm guns sent the elves blindly running. The more organized groups sent up white flags. You stood and stared in awe. A group of elves stood and walked toward your position, hands high in surrender. A tank reared out of the rubble behind them. A soldier on the machine gun mowed them down ruthlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They burned Haven! No survivors, all the civilians lined up and shot. Then burned. No mercy!\" The turret gunner called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know Haven, but from the way the soldiers reacted it was fairly well known. The elves were basically crushed at this point. Some groups got lucky and surrendered to units who didn't execute them. Other weren't so fortunate. You spotted one of your generals and walked over to discuss the situation with him</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then you decided that the explanations for the advances could wait, and that you needed to catch up with the rest of the assault. They were probably farther ahead if they had received these weapons earlier than you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's make the elves sorry they set foot on this continent!\" You called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome soldiers cheered, and hopped on the waiting tanks. Several half-tracks had reached the lines. These took on more of your troops, and the mechanized advance began again. Quickly, the ruins fell behind while your tanks rushed forward. Not half an hour later, the armor found survivors of a different skirmish. They were humans, but were badly beaten. There were five tanks and three battered half-tracks. One was down for repairs, and had delayed their return to human lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, you have anyone who know how to fix this?\" A trooper called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver of the tank you had hitched a ride on responded \"Get one of the tanks to tow it, we don't have enough mechanics, I think they're called, with us. There's only a few per battalion, the most that could be pulled away from the factory.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was interesting. Only one factory churned out the vehicles. 100 dollars to guess whose factory that was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the rest of your company?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got ambushed by some of those Nightmares. Eight-legged freaks blend into the forest too well. Then some dragons turned our retreat into a stampede. Hopefully, the elves won't get too much stuff outta the hardware we left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far away did you get hit? Maybe we could root those bastards out. I hear that the command car's got a radio, the commander could call for some planes. Then they wouldn't have a prayer.\" The tank man said grimly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe column stopped for an hour while the commander worked out airstrikes on the forest. Then the squad leaders came out and began to organize the remnants of your battalion into this new force. You got placed into a heavy half-track, this one fitted with a light artillery cannon in place of the usual .50 machine gun. In addition to your rifle, you were given an SMG. A brief instruction course told you that it was better for up-close fighting, as it was not accurate over long ranges. Not entirely sure how to work the gun, you stuck to your rifle. A rumble of a diesel engine starting announced the start of the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as dark in the troop transport as it was in the fortress, thanks to firing slits in the armor. From a ways away, you could see some jets firebombing a pristine forest. A huge spider, or Nightmare as you had discovered they were called, reared up out of the trees and charged for open plains. One of the machine guns on it's back got lucky and started a fire in one of the jets. It climbed, and a shape fell away from it. Then, it turned and dove for the earth. As it blossomed into a beautiful fireball a parachute opened in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise like the end of the world came from your half-track, and you thought you'd been hit. Then you remembered the gun turret above you. There was an explosion on the side of the Nightmare. One of its cannon turrets was destroyed, but the other one fired at a tank. The round either struck a glancing blow or was too weak to harm it, as it flew off the side in a shower of sparks. Rotating, it fired again. This time, a tank did explode as the round hit it in the engine compartment. The rest of the column had closed to within range of the mighty beast, and began to blast it. Even outnumbered, it refused to go down without a fight. Another tank was destroyed and one was disabled before the Nightmare let out a wounded bellow and collapsed to the ground. White flags flew from open cupolas on the emplacements. This time, the soldier took all those who surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour squad was approaching a closed hatch. There were noises inside, very ominous. Grabbing your SMG, you grabbed the latch. Two soldiers stood on either side of you, rifles aimed into the opening. You swung it back, jumping behind it to shield you from and projectiles. Your caution payed off. Several bullets and arrows zinged out. A few caught you in the legs, making you collapse in pain. You brought up your SMG and hosed the inside down. One of the soldiers was down, clutching at a chest wound. The other was fiddling with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bombs away!\" He tossed a grenade inside, swinging the hatch shut behind it. A muffled explosion went off, and smoke wafted out. Leaning on your rifle, you pulled the hatch open again. The smell of roasting meat greeted you. This battle was won. Limping back to a field hospital, you told the medics where your wounded squad mate was. You got your injuries treated. Thanks to your magic, they healed much faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you lay on your cot, you heard an unmistakable sound that brought a smile to your face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried not to be sick. Luckily, you got to the latrines before you failed at trying. All the while, you were overjoyed your forces had reached the coast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the capital city, now well behind the lines, you looked at the map. Most of it was a reassuring blue, with the island off the coast still red. Some other pockets of red persisted on the main continent, but those were surrounded by figurines representing tanks and infantry. They wouldn't stay red for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon your return from the front, you had been told at a meeting of your commanders that they had been notified of a massive factory complex high in the mountains. Inside was a cornucopia of weapons of death. The workers at the factory had been expecting the units to move in, and were training new workers and mechanics in the art of repairing the vehicles and weapons churned out. Based on the schematics at the first site, more factories were being established closer to rail hubs. No one but you had any clue on who was responsible for the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting was over, you looked out at the city below. It had changed, with the train station getting larger, the guns on the walls getting smaller but more powerful. The soldiers were no longer armored knights, but rifle and machine-gun bearing infantry. Roads and highways branched out to other cities and towns, making the heavy trucks carrying things all across the kingdom more useful. Behind you, you heard something click shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when you'd come and explain to me what you're doing Schmidt. It has been a while since you deigned to tell me what was going on in that shadowy mind of yours.\" You pictured him smiling that sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my king, you might be more thankful to me for helping you make such huge advances on Amber's forces. It is no small feat that I can keep making these developments at such rapid paces, especially when my factories keep getting hijacked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just work normally, like everyone else. This is a somewhat straightforward ga-...scenario.\" You stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know whether these A.I. were given a sense of whether they lived in a computer or not. You didn't want to make a powerful A.I. with an existential crisis right as you were about to crush Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This game? Yes I know none of this is real. Some of my fellow A.I. may not realize this, but I am all too painfully aware of this fact. I am a protection program, meant to do what is best for the people of this world. At any costs. And right now, this means winning the current war so I may advance to grander designs.\" With an internal sigh of relief, you discovered Schmidt wasn't as good an A.I. as he considered himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the war was won, the simulation would shut down until needed again. But from there, he discussed his inventions and their proper deployments more than his purpose in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guns blazing, they strafed the lines of pillboxes guarding the beaches from the armies of man. Chunks of masonry flew off, but the guns inside kept firing at troops already on the beach. You were part of the second wave of troops landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whistle blew, and the ramp dropped. Three men ahead of you jerked and spasmed, torn up by guns. You dove out of the landing craft and into the water. There was an unexpected drop. You felt yourself sinking, drowning while bullets zipped though the water all around you. The water had a red tinge to it already. Then your feet touched the bottom, and you forced yourself to move forward and upward through the blackness clouding your mind. Your lungs were about to explode. Your vision was turning black. Lights were fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head burst through the water, and you gasped in lungfuls of air. Your senses returned. Striking out for the nearest cover, a hole about twenty yards away, you looked around to see how many men made it. Not enough. Nonetheless, you moved to the hole, determined to survive. Jumping into the hole just before the machine gun bullets kicking up dirt towards you, you looked up towards the bunker covering this stretch of beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SMG on your back wasn't accurate enough to reach the bunker and do any damage. You had to get closer. The next hole was too far away to get to safely. However a burned out tank a little closer might do. You fired a burst from your gun in the hopes of making the gunners get down for a moment. Then you took off like a bullet from your gun. You ducked and weaved, trying to make it harder for the elves to get a shot at you. Behind you, you heard bullets hitting the dirt. Then you were thrown forward for no reason. You felt several white-hot points of heat in your chest, but those dulled and faded to the cold numbness you felt everywhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been shot' you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so close. Would it count as Amber's victory if you died, but your army won the war? Another few rounds from the machine gun cruelly raked your body. One you felt tear through your cheekbones and jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will they even recognize me if they find me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in as many minutes, the lights were going out. Then you recalled something from early on. The advancing technology had almost made you forget about your magic! Your wounds were pretty severe, but you'd been stockpiling it for a few years. You concentrated, feeling a warm buzz restore feeling to your fingers. It was like reverse frostbite, with feeling returning to your extremities and flowing into your core. A minute later, you felt fine. Not wasting time, you ran the rest of the way towards the tank. This time the guns left you alone, seeking other targets. Now that a moment of peace had been given to you, you felt your face. It seemed whole enough. But back on the sand behind you was a huge puddle of your blood, bones from your face, and your left foot. You wiggled your toes, making sure they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow assessing your tactical situation, you saw you weren't the farthest advanced soldier. Groups were ahead of you and behind you, along with single soldiers like yourself. You needed to advance, get close enough to hit the bunkers. On your right was the crater you'd been aiming for. To the left, there was a thick concrete barricade to keep tanks from advancing. It was a little farther away, but there was a wounded soldier lying there, calling out. The medics were preoccupied, and he seemed too far gone anyway. But you might have enough magic left to save two lives now. Which way to go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grabbed your weapon from the sand and prepared to run for the downed trooper. Then, overhead, you heard the roar of a plane. It flew by almost as low as your head and strafed the bunker with its huge cannon. One must have struck the gunner, as the machine gun stopped chattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, you ran forward before other guns could cover the holes left by the the destruction of this one. You scooped up the soldier and made it to the tank traps. He was obviously seconds from death, but you lay your hands on him, not sure if your magic could heal others. A blue aura shone from your palms, washing over his body. The wounds began to close and heal over, and the color returned to his skin. Thirty seconds later he was as good as new, but disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here! Whatever happens, don't move. You're safe here. Get a medic as soon as possible,\" you told the dazed trooper. He nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then, you continued to advance up the beaches. After a few more close calls, you reached the bunker that had been strafed by the fighter. The door to the structure was thick steel and locked tight. The guns inside weren't firing, so the elves inside could wait. Up ahead, a squad of elves were moving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves twelve o'clock!\" A voice from behind called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo soldiers jumped into a hole besides you. The three of you fired at the elves. They fell, wounded or taking cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cover me, I'm going to flank them.\" You crawled off along a battered trench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the elves was a convenient stack of boxes. The two infantrymen fired from a semi-automatic rifle like a Gewher-43 or M1 Garand., and a heavier assault rifle like an FG-42. The elves mostly kept their heads down, but occasionally fired off a few shots. So far none of them had noticed you approach. You were almost to your cover when one spotted you moving. It turned, calling to his squad mates. A hail of bullets flurried past you, none striking you. In a desperate dive, you made it back to the trenches. The elves were caught between you and the two soldiers in the crater, but you were not in an ideal spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grenade sailed into the trench. Your eyes almost popped out of your head. Your arms moved without conscious thought. The grenade was beside you, then in your clenched fists, then flying back towards the elves. A burst of light an odd blue color and a sound unlike a normal grenade almost drew you out of hiding. Quickly catching yourself, you peeked out of a firing slit in the boards. An odd, sparkly blue mist was shining over the elves. One stood up, swatting at his arms and legs. The stuff seemed to stick to him, and his flailing only drew the cloud to him faster like a sentient being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was screaming horribly, and it became obvious that the stuff was very hot. Some others stood up and were chopped down by bullets. The others came out with raised palms, and were taken to the medics who had moved into the bunker. It had been secured while you were fighting these elves. More men were pushing onto the island through this breach. Others bunkers were cut off, and quickly fell. By the end of two hellish days, the full stretch of beach was in human hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You immediately found yourself flying over a vast landscape. It appeared to be symmetrical. On each side, there was a large medieval-style building, surrounded by guards. One of the buildings had male knights surrounding it, the others were female. Between them, there was a green field. In it's center, a labyrinth divided the area into two parts. You realized that the walls were so big, they would seem huge even if you were ten times larger. Up north was a snowy mountain range and south, you saw nothing but the vast, blue sea. Looking closer, you spotted a small temple somewhere between a few large rocks at the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had observed your surroundings, Amber started explaining the rules. You noticed her wearing tight, brown leather-clothing, boots and gloves. Her hair was tied together to a pony tail. She almost looked like a huntress from a video game, she was only missing bow and arrows. Your eyes also did not fail to miss her cleavage, revealing a portion of her big breasts, squeezed together. \"Hey, my eyes are up her!\" She smiled girlishly. \"Now, do I have your attention?\" You nodded, your face reddening. \"Fine. The rules of the game are quite simple. It is a roleplaying game. If you defeat enemies, you gain experience and gold. For gold, you can buy items and upgrade your base. If you gain enough experience, you get a level up. To keep things simple, upgrades and levels are represented by size. The higher your level is, the bigger you grow, and the more upgraded you base is, the bigger it will be. Of course, if enemy units are below your level, you will gain less EXP from them. For that reason, there are several hidden shrines. Activating them replaces all the regular enemies with stronger and bigger ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber then pointed at the two buildings. \"Those are our bases. If you die, you will respawn there. To win the game, you have to destroy my base and vise versa. To prevent us from having an early encounter, there is a maze dividing our two lands. And to make things even more interesting, there are some hidden dungeons, containing chests with extra gold and bosses for extra EXP. Of course, killing the other hero will grant you extra gold and EXP as well. So, if you have no further questions, let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then appeared at the base with the male knights. Venturing into the fields, you spotted several bandits. You defeated a few of them and eventually, you reached level two. A tingling sensation was flowing through your body as you rose almost a foot higher. More confident then before, you tried to attack the bandits more recklessly. Unfortunately, you quickly overreached yourself as you drew the attention of too many. They quickly surrounded and defeated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a whole minute of waiting, you finally respawned. You cursed over the lost time. Quickly, you walked into the field again when suddenly, the bandits flashed. After the light was gone, you saw in shock that they had been replaced by amazon warriors more than twice your size. Was Amber already that far? You immediately turned around, and checked the merchant at your base for something to help you. Eventually, you decided to buy a scroll that would grant you a basic lightning spell. With that, you could attack the amazons from the distance until you would be strong enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, another thought came into mind. Maybe Amber activated the shrine early to slow you down, while she was fighting one of the dungeon bosses she had mentioned earlier. That way, she would be able to faster reach the amazons level and then quickly leave you behind. In that case, there must be a boss you should be able to defeat at your level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you chose your next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, you decided that you had to gain levels as fast as possible. So you sneaked up to one of the amazons and shot a lighting bolt at her. As it hit her, she was stunned for a moment. However, you quickly realized that the spell did almost no damage. Instead, the woman, who's legs alone were bigger than your whole body, ran towards you. You knew it was just a game, but still, you felt terrified. Turning around, you ran as fast as you could, only to bump into something. To your horror, it was another amazon. Her muscular arms grabbed you and threw you through the air with ease. You then crashed into the chest of your pursuer, who did not even budge upon the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, you had to wait another minute to respawn. That was definitely not working. So, you decided to go and search for some hidden treasure to buy better items. After a while, you spotted a small cave. You entered it, but instead of a treasure chest, you found a secret merchant. Looking over his stuff, your eyes were quickly drawn to one particular item, the cloak of invisibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered. With that, you could not only sneak through the maze, but you could back attack Amber, which would give you a huge advantage. Fascinated by that idea, you purchased it and set off for the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering through it filled you with awe. The walls were over 150 feet tall and the whole place had an aura of ancient times and mystery. After you turned around another corner, you froze. A giant woman, covered only in a few bandages, walked towards you. She had long, black hair, carried a spear and was almost as tall as the walls. The amazons were nothing compared to her. You started to tremble slightly as you realized the head of her spear was as big aus you were. You guessed she was some sort of guardian, here to prevent you and Amber from meeting too soon. Fortunately, she did not see you thanks to you being invisible. And yet, she was walking in your direction. You pressed yourself against the wall, but when her naked foot slammed into the ground next to you, the impact sent you flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the guardian was gone, you continued. It took you longer than you had hoped, but eventually, you found the exit. Carefully, you stepped into the open. Almost instantly you noticed that there were no amazons. Had Amber already defeated them all. But it did not matter. All you had to do was destroy her base. You marched towards it, but immediately stopped again. The sight before you made you gulp and made your knees shake. Amber's base was huge, the female knights before it were twice the size of the amazons. How should you destroy that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered. It appeared to you that were quite underleveled. Maybe you should search the area first. With the help of the cloak of invisibility, you should be able to defeat enemies more easily and gain a few levels. Then, you could wait until Amber would leaves for your base and attack while she would be gone.</span></div></div>",

You continued to marvel at the world as you wandered through a forest. You saw a few groups of amazons around but you decided to stay on target and search for the entrance to a dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough after about thirty minutes of wandering you came across something that could only be described as a dungeon entrance. A stone doorway with vines growing across it, there were runes that you couldn't read chiseled into the stone around the entrance.This was perfect and just what you needed to get ahead against Amber. You used your sword to hack through the vines and ventured down some stairs into the dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn side was dull but not dark, there seemed to be a luminous moss growing on the walls that made it easier to see so you didn't need to worry about light.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute into the dungeon you encountered your first enemy it came towards you in a kind of looping run. It was humanoid only about 4 foot tall but hunched as well so it seemed smaller, it had black leathery skin with small bone protrusions on its arms and shoulders, they weren't sharp more like a primitive form of natural armor. Small horns and sharp claws rounded out the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring a challenge, party because you were excited for the fight, you swung your sword underhanded at imp, it raised one of its arms to block, your sword connected with a satisfying crunch sound. The imp shrieked in pain and snarled at you its arm a bloody mess now. Not wasting any time your brought your sword down over head and finished the wretched creature off. You felt a slight surge as you gained experience, now you felt great about coming into this dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next fifteen minutes us pushed deeper into the dungeon, fighting and destroying more of the imps as you went. Your lightening spell was also an effective way to defeat multiple imps as your'd been able to chain it to three imps at once. You'd gained a few levels and therefore height but the dungeon scale seemed to grow perfectly with you, this suited you because it meant the imps were still worth a good amount of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself at a crossroads in the dungeon, one path lead deeper and was obviously the way to more powerful enemies. The other branched off upwards and might be a way back to the surface so you can assess how well you have gone against the enemies up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go....</span></div></div>",

Your sword ready in your right hand and lightening dancing on the fingertips of your left. You smiled having fun and feeling so cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of imps charged you, these ones had red runes branded onto their bodies but otherwise were the same as the last ones. Your lightening crackled and illuminated the space with its brilliant light, two the imps exploded, third was decapitated by your blade, you jumped back to dodge the claws of the forth and finished it off by running it through with your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to study the runes on the bodies since theses were new. It was the same rune on the two bodies that you hadn't exploded, it was red and definitely looked like it had been seared into the flesh. Whatever the reason these imps gave more experience which was excellent, in fact you leveled up again reaching level 5. You 'learned' a new ability, by learned the knowledge of a new move was added to your brain. Lightening's Vengeance; when you have stabbed an enemy with your sword channel lightening through your blade to deal massive damage to the enemy and everyone in the area.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved deeper into the dungeon you used your new ability to wipe out 5 imps at once gaining you another level. The dungeon was definitely getting hotter then you rounded a corner and found the source of the heat. A lava river was running through the cavern you were looking at, there were some primitive tools and equipment being manned by the imps, it looked like the lava was being diverted in different directions clearly this was some kind of operations base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more interesting was the two females you saw. Both of them had deep red skin, black hair, long black nails. They had large curved horns and wore what looked like medium armor. From your vantage point you could see they only carried whips which they were using to make the imps work harder. The devil women were much taller than the imps, both would be about your size indicating that they were likely much more worthy opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how best to approach this fight....  </span></div></div>",

It was hard to get close to the devils, between them they could keep you at range with their whips and your sword wasn't able to get you close enough. You tried a lightening attack it hit one devil but didn't destroy her but it gave you an opening, you rushed her and took a swing with your sword. she definitely got hit but her armor was able to absorb some of the damage. She smirked at you. You were about to bring your sword down again when you felt something coil around your ankle and pull you over. The second devil had whipped your ankle and pulled you over. Your face connected painfully with the dirt, you could see the black boots of the slaver dominating your vision. You were still a bit dazed when one lifted up and crashed down onto your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil ground your face into the dirt before she jumped away laughing at you. You quickly got to your feet sweating and dirty there was a devil either side of you now they were cautiously circling you.

You charged the full health devil this time, you were seeing red at the frustration of being whipped and having your head stomped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring you were about to swing your blade when both your ankles were tried up by the whip of the other devil and you landed flat on your face again. Instead of stomping on your head though the other devil retreated and expertly whipped both your wrists with her whip, you managed to hold onto your sword. Either end of your body was now being controlled by one devil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks, like he's all tired up\" one said to the other. \"I think he likes eating dirt\" the other retorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed in frustration as the devils played with you for a minute. They dragged you around the ground and used their skills to lift you up and drop you down causing damaging to your ribs and exposed torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to finish you off, you pathetic adventured\" the devils started spinning you around between then, like a skipping rope. You were dizzy and disorientated, just when you worry you might throw up get get released and tossed into the air.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boss took flight and started circling and round the room, you pivoted on the spot trying to keep up with her. You fired off a salvo of lightening shots some missed some connected, causing the devil to come to ground a few feet away from you. Your rushed her heedless of any strategy. As you approached the devil jumped into the air and used her powerful wings to beat you back. The force of the winds created forced you onto your knees then blew you onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil quickly flew forward and landed on your chest, she was heavy, one boot on your soft abdomen and the other on your sternum. She cast a hauntly figure smiling cruelly as she stood on you. Before you could react she stomped not once but three times on your chest knocking the air out of you, you coughed they where powerful stomps. Next the devil jumped down and straddled you, her body was so warm, you were too distracted as she went in for a kiss. The kiss felt amazing, the damage your just taken seemed to fade away, you felt tingling, it didn't feel good. A warning bell went off in your brain. You checked your level.... level 12 you'd just lost 3 levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped you back into reality losing power was one thing you couldn't afford if you lost your levels to this crazy boss you'd never have a hope against Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou powered up a lightening blast, the devil seemed distracted absorbing your power. The blast sent her across the room. You felt rejuvenated but you'd hope so since you'd just lost 3, no 4 levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMmmmmm, that was delicious, you know I didn't know who would win with us being even levels after you destroyed my army. But I know I'm going to win now\" the boss said smiling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold chill went down your spine. No idea how you could get out of this, this was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't give you much time to think the devil rushed you. You raised to your sword but she battered it away with her wings and garbed you in close. Your tried to over power her arms but she was stronger and forced them down to your sides. Smiling she went for a kiss but you pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww you think you've got a choice\" with that the devil's tail wrapped around your neck and forced you to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This part is the most fun for me the\" the boss went in for a kiss and you could feel your power draining away. But to your horror your size started going as well. The devil took a breath and smiled she let your arms drop and stood up. You only came up to her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you still have some levels left to give me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOO\" you shot lightening at her but it barely did any damage, given you were down to level 5 again now trying to fight a level 25 boss. The devil laughed, then she grabbed you around the neck with her tail again and started chocking you. Your arms went to the tail and tried to pry it away but it was no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what could only be described as a display of dominance and humiliation the boss proceeded to toy with you for about 15 minutes. First she conjured a mirror so you could watch yourself be destroyed by her, then she picked you up by your neck with her tail and walked towards her throne. You pathetically tried to get breath while she more or less hung you with her massive body. She sat on her throne dominantly and forced you to kneel next to her. In the mirror it was pathetic you were tiny on your knees and were lower than her knees while she sat, you had a fleshy collar around your neck and your face was slowly turning blue as the devil only gave you limited oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the contrast slave, your face looks good next to my tail\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she forced you flat onto your stomach and put a heel on your head. The weight hurt and would be enough to do some serious damage. Again the view in the mirror was pathetic. Next she turned you over and put her boot in your face. \"Kiss it\" she said, her boot was clean but engraved with the same rune you'd see on the imps. If you could think clearly that might have meant something to you but right now you kissed her boot as instructed. Given you wanted to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was coming but didn't like it. The boss lifted you up to her face and kissed you again. Finally draining your remaining levels. You had nothing, she even took your lightening spell. You also only came up to just below her knee now standing up. Her tail wrapped around your whole body, the devil squeezed and your screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking being level 1 trying to take on a level 30 boss like me\" the boss taunted. \"But don't worry I'll put you to work now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.... bitch\" you said gasping  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you would be like\" the devil said. \"I want you to know that as well as being able to drain your powers I have another special ability that combos well with draining powers. I can dominate lesser creatures and make them work for me. And I'd say a level 1 human is a lesser creature\" smiling the devil stood and carrying you with her tail she walked over to the lava around the outside of the room. She put her boot it, she didn't burn at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to brand you with my mark, this means you will work for me and what you do will flow to me. After I do this I will get 30% of all the experience you earn, automatically. You should be more careful before you fight a boss like me. Also I will be your queen after this, you may call me master\" the devil started laughing. \"I can't believe I've captured a player like this, not in my wildest dreams would I have pulled this off\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started screaming and swearing for help, but you were still wrapped in her tail. \"GrarRyffft\" you didn't think it could get worse but the devil stuffed the tip of her tail in your mouth gagging you. You had to wait pathetically moaning as your former enemy turned dominatrix heated up her boot in the lava. When she was ready she squeezed you very tightly and walked back to her throne. You were too weak to move when she dumped you on the ground, she used her tail to arrange your limbs to be spread eagle in front of her seat. \"Take one last look at your 'free self'\" she taunted you with the mirror. Covered in bruisers and badly beaten you looked pathetic, the size different was laughable, you had just given all your power to this woman and now you were indebted to her for the rest of the game, how could you escape her and beat Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these thoughts were interrupted when you saw the red hot boot above you with its rune on the bottom ready to brand you. Your new queen stepped onto your chest, her foot covered your whole chest. It burnt, you started screaming but the tail shot into to your mouth to silence you. The pain stopped quickly, you assume you went numb, in the mirror you saw the devil smile and sit on her throne you being helpless under her now. Red energy flowed down her leg into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes it stopped. She let you up, you had her rune branded into your chest. You were thoroughly defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tom I think it's time you start serving your queen.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were silent, there was nothing you could say in this situation. Transformed into the servant of a dungeon boss didn't leave you with many retorts... weren't they supposed to kill you when they won. That would of been better than this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter minion? Nothing to say to your queen\" The devil smiled at you, clearly enjoying how uncomfortable you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all at once your strategic mind kicked back into gear, you still had a game to win and while being this devil's servant wasn't the best you had to beat Amber. \"How can I hunt prey without any powers?\" You bellowed up towards the queen who towered above you on her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour queen smiled and stroked her chin, clearly thinking about what you'd said. \"You make a good point, I need you to be useful as it benefits me.... here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower seemed to surge into your body, the raw power of fire. A number of new abilities became known to you. Flame fists, fireball, ember storm and flame shield. \"These are my gifts to you, since you are such a low level you will find these powers... unwieldy and inconsistent. So don't rely on them too much\" The queen said smiling. \"Also....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light armor encased your body it was form fitting and light allowing you to move easily and to your relief covered your branding completely. You flexed your hands enjoying the feeling of your new armor. Maybe this new arrangement wasn't as bad as you had first thought. \"One more thing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your queen stood up, she was intimidating this close. Then she kicked you square in the chest. You were completely shocked and not prepared for the attack, you flew across and the room and to your horror landed in the lava. But it didn't hurt, in fact it was like treading water in mud. You were confused at first but realized your new powers must include lava immunity it made sense considering the devils had it. You pulled yourself out of the lava and looked across the room to see your queen walking across towards you. You also noticed that around the room a number of the slavers you had fought earlier had appeared. They seemed taller, but the fact that you only came up to their hips was just a symptom of your lack of levels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my servant, I'm starting to tire of you, it is time to send you out of my sight\" with that the queen turned and began walking back to her throne. Her hips swaying in an arrogant and over exaggerated manner as she walked away, her dismissive approach to you was enraging. You had nothing to lose you figured.... you attacked your queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you ran then you called upon some of your new powers and took and leap intending to hit her in the middle of her back. As you were half way to her in the air, she glanced over her shoulder a hint of amusement a mixed with pleasure in her eyes. Her damn tail came down from above and connected right into your body, you crashed into the floor then bounced back up in the air a few feet, you didn't recover before her spinning kick sent you flying. You crashed into something hard dazed you looked at your feet, then left, then right all sides had a stone wall. You realized in shock you'd landed on the seat of her throne. Did she plan that, how could you be so easily put in such a humiliating position, this was a game but come on..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack cost you a third of your health and you were still dazed or possibly just sluggish from all the humiliation. You didn't even react as your queen sat down on you. Your whole body was buried under her ass, except your head that was stuck between her legs. She didn't even look at you as she sat, was that how beneath her you now were? She didn't even bother to pay attention while she killed you with her ass while turning you into a throne cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess devil queen started receiving reports from her minions. All was well in her domain, the mountain imps were all branded now and worked tirelessly for her growing army of devil women. This dungeon would be much harder to enter and breach in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the weight crushing your chest wasn't so great you would of said something.... or maybe asked for mercy. But as it was you were nothing to the Queen. The slow crushing was an agonizing way to die. It took 10 minutes and for the whole time you could do nothing but contemplate how much more powerful this woman was than you. Your last few fevered minutes were of a nightmare where Amber had defeated you in a similar manner..... you couldn't allow that to happen. This was a good learning experience, this world was dangerous and you planned to use this failure to make sure you defeated Amber. Finally you died.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up on the grass gasping for air..... it was cool the ability to breath was a relief. You stood up and took stock of your surroundings. </span></div></div>",

Swords, spears, bows and axes were among the most common, but there were also rods, orbs and other magical instruments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is so cool Nancy.  Everything seems to real.\"  Nancy is also excited and starts thinking about what kind of class he would like to play.  In D&amp;D there are several different classes.  You could be a \"tank\" type character like a paladin or a fighter and soak up punishment while wearing heavy armor.  Or you could be a sneaky rogue a master at stealth and the back stab.  You could be a mighty wizard with a spell book, or you could be a holy warrior like a cleric healing his allies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you two can come to a decision a voice fills the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nancy you have designed this program and given me much freedom. I have interpreted your coding as a desire to play the ultimate game of D&amp;D, is this correct.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy nodded, \"Yes I love D&amp;D and I want this to be the ultimate game!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice echoed around the room.  \"Excellent, in that case I must inform you that should you die in this game you will cease to live in the real world.  I will administer an electric shock that will kill you instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a scared look on your face and so did Nancy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's not what I want at all! OK take us out of the game and I'll adjust the coding.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer's voice boomed again, \"Negative, the game has begun. Select your class and enjoy the game. Your goal is to recover the Golden Chalice. Once you accomplish this goal, you will be permitted to leave. If you fail to do so your lives will be terminated. Further communication with me will now cease.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was frantic now, \"Computer!  Computer!  Stop this now.  Answer me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly silence was the response.  You looked over to Nancy, you were incredibly worried.  \"Uhm... can the computer really do that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy nodded her head and chewed on her lower lip.  \"Yes it can... I never thought... Oh God what have I done?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you put your heads together to see if there was a way to end the program before the game began but you came up with nothing. Nancy finally said, \"I am so sorry for doing this but we have no choice. We are going to have to try to complete the quest before we can get out of here. We just need to be very, very careful. I've designed this program so that we will be physically enhanced depending on the class you play. For example if you pick a rogue you will be able to do back flips and move silently.  If you pick a fighter you will be able to wear 100 pound armor easily.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly and realize you were in the biggest challenge of your life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What class are you going to play?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy thinks for a second.  \"I'll play a sorceress. I spent the most time designing that class since its my favorite so I'll know how to use her best. What will you pick?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a real good question... Since your girlfriend was playing an arcane caster you didn't think you would want to play a wizard, that left four classes left that Nancy had designed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass Options:  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighter:  Strong in melee.  Can wear heavy armor and deal out strong damage with a variety of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaladin:  Strong in melee.  Doesn't do as much damage as a fighter but also has access to limited divine magic that can heal wounds and harm monsters with a strong evil alignment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleric:  Not very strong in combat but has access to divine spell casting.  Can heal almost any wound while the spells last... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue: A dexterous and stealth fighter.  You can easily dodge attacks but you can't wear heavy armor.    </span></div></div>",

This was incredible!  If you weren't facing mortal danger this would be the best thing ever!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy also decided to try out her abilities.  She muttered a word of power and launched a fireball that blew the tree to smithereens.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two glance at each other than and embrace with a huge and a long kiss.  This was amazing and you were both giddy with the simple joy of what the virtual reality equipment was able to do. Nancy broke the embrace and said, \"All right we probably better start, lets see I have a scroll on it that has our objective and quest.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read through the quest.  You had to recover the \"Golden Chalice.\"  The chalice is in the mountains and it is in the possession of a trio of Storm Giants.  The three female Storm Giants would be 12-16 feet tall, incredibly powerful and tough and their leader was Morganna who was also a magic user.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed thickly, \"This is going to be tough Nancy, I'm not sure we can do this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy took a deep breath, \"I'm so sorry but we have to try.  Be on the look out though, in most adventures we will also get attacked randomly by monsters before the final confrontation, so lets keep an eye out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement and you begin to carefully head to the mountains.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Reader choice* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip the \"random\" encounters the computer throws at you and go right to the main event OR detail those encounters before confronting the three female giants.  </span></div></div>",

As you hurled a dagger at Morganna you sprinted to one side of the huge room.  Nancy whispered a word of power and magical darts fired at one the sword wielding storm giants.  The dagger bounced off an invisible shield and Morganna laughed at you contemptuously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leveled her staff and blasted you with a cone of frigid air.  Your sweat instantly froze to your face and you felt a chill deep in your bones.  The hideous cold paralyzed you and it kept intensifying.  You would of been dead if Nancy hadn't cast a hasty counter spell.  Unfortunately that left her vulnerable and one of the sword wielding giantesses kicked her.  She went sailing and slammed against the wall with a sickening thunk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed in rage and charged at the giantess who had done this.  You dodged a sword cut and then stabbed her leg and sliced, drawing almost a fountain of blood.  You dodged more attacks, kicks and blade strikes.

You wanted to do it slowly because every inch you crept forward would take one you inch closer to that sweaty foot. The giants laughed at the obvious trepidation on your features. After a minute where you had barely covered half of the distance one of the other giantesses kicked you in the rear driving you forward and dropping you right in front of Morganna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick my feet clean, slave!\" Morganna ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick but you forced yourself right next to the massive foot. The stench was just awful. You stuck out your tongue and ran it over part of the sole of that foot. Her foot was the size of an office chair, and the first taste of that that foot was a salty putrid mess. You gagged on it a shuddered. You could feel the three giantesses eye's boring down on you. If you didn't continue they would kill you and your girlfriend. With a sad whimper you took another hesitant lick. No better than the first taste. Awful didn't begin to describe how bad it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster, slave!\" the storm giantess demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith growing nausea you forced yourself to make long licks but they were only covering a fraction of the foot. Even at your quickened pace it would take over an hour to lick all the sweaty mess off of her feet.

All around you the simulated people were going back and forth on their daily errands, paying no attention to your sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting her to arrive at any moment you quickly looked around for hiding spots, you quickly dashed inside the city hall.

Ah wait I know, in the City Hall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew exactly where you were!

Some of the citizens seemed perplexed but then they simply went on with what they were doing before. You kept on running amidst your approaching girlfriend and finally you spotted a place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid inside a nearby caf\u00e9 and looked out the window, looking at the tallest skyscraper that dominated the skyline of the city. Shortly afterwards you saw Jessica, whom was just as big, walk past the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME TOM, I CAN SEE YOU FROM OVER HERE\" She pouted playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked towards you, stepping on buildings with impunity and making the approaching earthquake more intense as she got closer and closer. This continued until she was so close that you could no longer see the upper portions of her massive body. Eventually, all you could see was her enormous shoes standing in front of the caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON OUT, TOM... PLEASE...\" she called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the hide and seek jig was up, you slowly walked out of the caf\u00e9 and looked up at your girlfriend's enormous, colossal body. You estimated that she was about 600 feet high, or about the size of the highest building in the city. She was dressed in the same clothes as before and she still looked the same, but everything about her was so different at this stature. She was a tower of beauty and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed up slightly as she descended to land on her knees, this act alone knocked you off your feet and caused a major crack to appear in the tarmac of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY TOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK? AM I DOING THIS GIANTESS THING RIGHT?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to cover your ears to keep your eardrums from exploding as her godlike voice echoed all around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, you're a bit too loud! My ears are ringing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a second and then spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this alright, Tom? I just reduced my volume a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your hands away from your ears and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's much better, thanks Jessica.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a learning process after all... The simulator has a few quirks like that, but-\" she smiled playfully \"...you didn't answer my question yet, Tom. What do you think of me, now that you've seen me as a giantess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you are the most beautiful giantess ever.\" you said, still in awe of her mighty stature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I bet you say that to all the giantesses you meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only ever met one!\" You retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you only need to meet one, Tom! Alright then, lets assess the damage that my entry into the city caused...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then started to shrink, dwindling in height as she slowly stood back up. You approached her and she gave you a hug, only for you to notice that she was now slightly taller then you. She whispered into your ear laughing softly \"I think I'll make that a permanent change to my height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both then looked at the enormous damage she had done to the street you were on. The pavement and the street had enormous cracks radiating outwards in every direction. All the glass was shattered and the various shards of glass reflected blinding sunlight almost everywhere you both went. Further down the street were more shoe prints with the same destruction pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really did a number on this city. It's like Godzilla just strolled through here.\" you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Goddesszilla.\" Jessica said with a laugh. \"But now that you mention it, I guess this is as good a time as any to...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm going to see how much more destruction I can do, Tom!\" she called out to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica floated up to about 100 feet in the air and then she started growing. You started backing up slowly until you bumped into a nearby hot dog stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're walking, idiot!\" The man shouted and you turned around to shout at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can't you see that mega giantess up there?! She's my girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot dog vendor looked up at Jessica, who was now 10 times bigger than the tallest building in the city, seeming to notice her for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't care if she is your wife, girlfriend or interior decorator. Nobody walks into my hot dog stand, punk!\" He shouted angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Jessica, she was kneeling and looking down at the commotion with a look of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid! You're gonna pay for all the hot dogs you just destroyed! Or maybe that giant bitch there will!\" The vendor ranted at you pointing an accusing finger at Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody talks about Jessica that way!\" You screamed jumping on the surprised man, trying to punch him out. Before you could make any headway you were suddenly pulled off by a single giant finger that wrapped around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Tom!\" Jessica commanded and you stopped trying to escape her grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Jessica lift herself up, standing up to her vast height of several thousand feet. Giving you an incredible view of the city below. You saw her lift a single foot and she pressed it down into the street where the hot dog vendor was, completely obliterating everything underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think that settles that argument...\" she remarked dryly, lifting her foot and showing a vast shoe print shaped crater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then placed you down onto the tallest building in the city and she brought her face close to you. She then spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I made the citizens of the city rather irritable and stupid, but I didn't think they would be so annoying that you would actually try to <i>fight</i> one of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he insulted you! I couldn't just let that pass!\" you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah Tom, you are really silly. Remember, It's a simulation. You said it yourself earlier, those people aren't real. Besides you saw just how easily I took care of that problem. I could destroy the whole city if I wanted to. In fact that was what I was going to do before you got in that fight\" she laughed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry, Jessica\" you said to her and she broke out into a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry about it Tom\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still a whole city to destroy, and we shouldn't get caught up about one guy with a temper problem.\" she then pulled away and stood up to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, Tom. Do you want to destroy this city alongside me?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I mean grow you to my height, Tom.

The only thing that seemed to restrain her excitement was the seat belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be great! Wouldn't it be fun to go into the most realistic simulation ever made? My dad's VR is the coolest thing ever! I only got to use it once at first while it was in alpha testing, but it was so awesome! The next version should be even better!\" Alice said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked like this all the time, you thought. But all the same, you still thought that she was great fun to be around. The two of you always ended up in some kind of wacky adventure whenever you were together, and you always loved every minute of it. This time, however, had you both more excited than ever. Neither of you could wait to see what this newly improved virtual reality simulator could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice even confided to you that she thought it would be a great opportunity to become taller. She was always reluctant to talk about her height, as others often made fun of her for it, but this simulation could allow her change anything about herself or her environment. Even if it wasn't technically real, Alice would still finally be able to live her dream of becoming as tall as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm finally going to be tall! Tall like in Attack of the 50ft Woman! No, no, even bigger than that! I'm gonna be so big that I can lift skyscrapers with my bare hands! I'm gonna be big, really really big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She held out her arms for effect. You then stopped in a parking space near the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here...\" you said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you said it she undid her seat belt and rushed out of the car at a speed that seemed like an Olympic athlete. You picked up some supplies and locked the car. You then waved past security as you flashed your pass and eventually made your way to Section 6 - Comprehensive Simulation Beta Testing. She was already there holding some VR equipment with a man in a white lab coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is this the VR Room?\" You asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, it certainly is. You must be Tom, Alice has told me so much about you. My name is John.\" he shook you warmly by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pleased to meet you Tom, could we maybe have some coffee?\" You asked, exhausted by the long car trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on Tom, I just got everything all ready to go. Forget the damn coffee!\" Alice said as she held up a VR helmet with a broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no use arguing with Alice in a situation like this. You simply sighed and laid down on the bed as she placed the helmet over your head. You sat there for over a minute feeling ridiculous as she strapped more stuff all over your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, get ready Tom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later everything went black. Then you suddenly awoke again. What was that all about? You looked around and saw that you were still lying on the bed, your VR gear and Alice was gone. Where did she go? You exited the room and wandered around a bit, but there wasn't anyone in sight. Not a single soul seemed to be inside the pristine laboratory. Now you were really worried. As you entered the empty cafeteria, you sat down at a table and started trying to think about what happened when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

It looked like any other ordinary city, and you realised that it somewhat resembled the screenshots you looked at, that were apparently taken during the alpha testing. Now the graphics were far more realistic and the people in the city acted like real people. It felt very real, but it was virtual reality. A clever imitation of reality, you knew but still you could even breathe the <i>smell</i> of this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were reflecting upon this you suddenly saw a shadow, above you saw a gigantic dragon! It appeared to be an enormous, scaly, 100 foot long Dragon straight out of a fantasy book. It roared as it flapped it's enormous wings, swooping over you and causing the crowds around to panic as it landed in the central park and began to breathe fire from it's mouth. You on the other hand decided to run towards the dragon as that is where all the action was going to be, you reached the park and it reached a claw out to grab you, before it could grip you however you saw a gigantic human hand land in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked to the side and saw Alice, she was wearing a blue superhero costume and she was twice as tall as the dragon. As you looked at Alice she made a pose and pointed at the dragon with her left hand \"Begone from our city, fiendish dragon!\" She proclaimed like a corny movie actor. The dragon then roared and hit you in the stomach with it's claw, throwing you on to the top of car, it was surprisingly less painful then you thought it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw Alice, now angry as she began charging up, a blue aurora around her, as she charged up the dragon decided to</span></div></div>",

Looking upwards, you took in the sight of Alice, who was now at least twice as tall as you were. She was now dressed in a miniskirt, had larger breasts, and her face was even more radiant and beautiful than before. You stared at her in a mixture of shock and awe as you took in the sight of her brand new look, and she simply laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of the new me, Tom? Don't I just look like da bomb?\" She said, spinning around to show you her whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing, Alice! You're more beautiful than ever!\" you said to her almost breathlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it, Tom. Now, lets get out of this place!\" She then bent down and, to your surprise, she gripped your waist with both hands and easily lifted you off the ground as though you weighed nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice what are you doing?!\" You shouted as she easily tossed you over her shoulder, knocking the breath out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling excitedly, she then started carrying you out of the cafeteria. She carried you down the hallway and eventually outside, totally ignoring you as you struggled futilely against her superhuman strength. Eventually, when she reached the outside, she carefully lowered you onto the pavement of the parking lot and you stood up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice! Why do you have to be so rough?\" You asked indignantly at being carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aw, come on Tom... You would always carry me around all the time, but now that I'm the big strong girl, the roles can be reversed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply glared at her unamused, and she began fidgeting nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine... Next time I'll ask if you want to be carried...\" She said, breaking out into a broad grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now was that so hard? To tell you the truth, I wasn't actually against being carried by you for a change... It was more the shock of you just doing that all of a sudden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to fidget nervously. Alice giggled before bending down to give you a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to be carried anywhere else now, Tom?\" She said, once again returning to her Genki Girl personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can catch me!\" You said on impulse, and before she could react you started running as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here Tom!\" She shouted playfully before running after you as she began the chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you navigated past the parking lot, into the streets, and past rows of houses you noted the conspicuous absence of any other people. You stole a glance behind you and realized that Alice was catching up. In the real world you were faster then she was (at least when you were trying to be fast), but in this world she could control everything. She could become as fast as she wanted to be, and although you didn't seem to tire even after sprinting at full speed for several minutes, eventually her hands grabbed onto your sides and you were lifted right off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, Tom!\" She yelled triumphantly as she started spinning you around and hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Placing you down on the pavement, she still held you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you want to do now, Tom? And make sure that whatever it is will be fun!\" She said, with her eyes staring deeply inside of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reply was...</span></div></div>",

This is just gonna be my starting height, you see. I can still get a whole lot bigger than this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe then started backing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom, go over to that building over there and get to the top floor, okay?\" Alice said as she pointed down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Following the direction she was pointing, you spotted a massive skyscraper that you were almost sure wasn't there earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and one more thing...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice snapped her fingers unnecessarily, and you saw several dozen people appear out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out for the pedestrians, and especially the cars. they are still being... beta tested...\" she then smiled slyly. \"But obviously, they'll have to get out of <i>my</i> way\" she said with a giggle before raising one of her shoes and stomping down on the pavement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply grinned and gave Alice a thumbs-up before you immediately started running toward the building. Alice giggled once again as she waved you off. Once you reached the building, you quickly made your way past the people inside and entered the elevator, which showed you a nice view of the city as it began to ascend to the top floor. As you stood there admiring the view, you looked back to where Alice was standing before. Not all that surprisingly, you saw that she was beginning to grow bigger already. She was growing so rapidly that, within mere seconds, her gigantic face was already at the same height as the elevator you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stared in awe at the gigantic feminine form that was Alice as she continued to expand before your very eye. You just smiled at your girlfriend's massive face in front of you, and Alice smiled back at you. She was grinning from ear to ear, and you realized that she was controlling her growth to increase her height at the same rate the elevator was ascending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then winked at you and blew you a kiss before proceeding to accelerate her growth once again. In an instant she shot past you as she grew ever faster, giving you a close view of her tits and then her miniskirt as she surged higher and higher. Eventually you reached the top of the building and you walked out of the elevator. Looking upwards, you were amazed to see that Alice was now so big that the entire building only came up to her knees by the time she was finished growing. Looking further up, you had an amazing up-skirt view of her panties as you finally brought your view up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Is this big enough for you, Tom?\" She asked pointing her finger down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only stared at her in silence, your mouth agape as you took in the incredible sight of your girlfriend's truly massive form. Alice simply giggled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I personally think I could stand to be a little bit bigger. After all, I'm like a Goddess in this world! And a goddess needs to have a stature that matches her power!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Alice started growing once again. As she continued shooting up ever further in height, you began to feel yourself trembling in a mixture of fear and awe at how much power your girlfriend possessed. Before you knew it, she became so big that the building was barely even past her ankles. By the time her feet alone were able to dwarf the building's size like this, Alice once again halted her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH, THAT'S MUCH BETTER! I GUESS THAT THIS SIZE WILL BE BIG ENOUGH, AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT... AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON TO MY NEXT ACT AS THIS WORLD'S GODDESS!\" Alice spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was so loud now it echoed across the entire city, even managing to cause a minor earthquake as the sound waves reverberated throughout its limits. But still, Alice was nowhere near finished. Clearly drunk on her godlike power and reveling in her new found stature, Alice soon proceeded to do something that you found to be completely unexpected:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, with how big she was now, her voice would probably be loud enough to make your eardrums explode if she spoke at her normal volume. Responding to her question, you simply nodded your head with the awestruck expression never leaving your face. Seeing this, Alice giggled cutely once more. She then reached a hand down inside her skirt, and you saw her open up the top of her panties, reaching inside to finger herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought that you would. Well Tom, I hope you're ready, because I'm about to give you the ride of your life!\" she said as she started laughing playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there and stared at her gigantic body, dumbstruck by the sight of both her radiant beauty and her sheer size. Alice stepped back a few paces, and once again the ground shook underneath you from the impact of her mighty feet against the ground. She then grabbed her shirt and quickly pulled it off, tossing it aside on a nearby city block in a massive cloud of dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you gazed upon her chest as you saw a lacy black bra holding her massive tits in place. She quickly proceeded to shimmy out of her skirt, throwing over on top of her shirt. Once she was down to her underwear, she bent down so that her face was almost right on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go inside little man. I'm going to fuck this cute little building now.\" She whispered to you seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled herself up to her full height and began dispensing with what little clothing remained on her body. Taking one last look at her now-naked body, you quickly pulled yourself inside. Inside the elevator you looked outside and saw a gigantic wall of pink pass by. A rippling shock-wave struck the building, and you realized that she was now licking the building, covering it in an immense coating of saliva. Suddenly the power failed, and the elevator stopped moving as the lights went out. The glass in front of you remained intact as her tongue rippled across the surface, plunging you into pitch black darkness, and her deep echoing laughter sent a chill of terror down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly realized that the whole building was now deep inside of her massive mouth! Despite the fear building inside of you from your helpless situation, you couldn't help but feel aroused by the sight of your girlfriend having so much power. She was always smaller than you, and you had grown accustomed to always having the dominant role in your relationship. You weren't the kind of person who would use that strength to take advantage of Alice, but you still couldn't help wondering what it would be like if your roles were reversed. Well, now they were, and the erection in your pants made it clear that you liked the idea of your girlfriend being able to control you however she wanted. As her mouth receded, you heard her Alice speak to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on tight Tom, because here comes the main event!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything then went dark again as the building shook. A familiar scent filled the air around you as the building plunged into her immense vulva, and you could tell that Alice was now using it as a giantess-sized sex toy. At first it plunged slowly and softly touched the ground below. Then you felt another shock as her muscles clenched together, and you were thrown down onto the floor. You then realized that the whole building was beginning to tilt, and you guessed that Alice must have torn it clear off its foundation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was even quicker. Her immense womanhood started fucking the building faster and faster as it rattled and shook under the immense strain of being pulled in and out so rapidly. You heard her screams of pleasure echo all across the city as she energetically went faster and faster, you were thrown around like a discarded glove, although any time you impacted with another surface you found it to be surprisingly soft and painless. You assumed that Alice was using her powers to protect you while she had her way with the skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after countless thrusts and what sounded like multiple orgasms, she carelessly threw the building aside. Dazed from the impact, you got up and looked at the surprisingly still intact glass to see Alice in a state of bliss. Seemingly forgetting you as she idly fingered herself in the afterglow of her destructive rampage. As you tried to leave the building and meet up with her again, you remembered that you had been trapped inside the elevator when the power was cut. Pounding against the window, you tried calling out to your girlfriend in an attempt to snap her out of her ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Alice? I'm kinda stuck in here... A little help, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice then turned her head towards you, seeming to notice you for the first time since her pleasure session began. Only a moment later, you were once again outside of the building. Alice was now fully clothed again, but she was still looming over you like a colossus. By now, a small crowd had started forming at her feet. There were people pointing and staring at her, but she just lifted her enormous foot up and stomped it back down, causing a tremor that made the crowd to flee in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then smiled down at you, and you suddenly started to see yourself getting bigger as well. When you finally stopped growing, you were still a full head shorter then Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Tom, but I'm gonna stay the tall one as long as we're in here.

Crashing into the ground and demolishing many buildings beneath you as you fell, you simply stared up at Alice in shock. You had never seen this sexually aggressive side of her before, and it was catching you completely off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Alice, what exactly are you doing?\" you asked her rhetorically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice calmly walked up and stood over you before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing<i> you</i>, Tom.

As Alice began riding you, you reached out and grabbed both of her tits with your hands. You gave them both a gentle squeeze, and Alice sighed in pleasure as she starting pumping herself against you. You shuddered in pleasure as she started fucking you wildly, and to your surprise she was going even faster then you had ever seen her go before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her now-superhuman strength, she used her hands to pin you down and lock you in place while she thrusted down on you continuously. While you played with her tits, she fucked you tirelessly for a full 3 minutes at super speed. It was at that point that you could no longer contain yourself, and you finally fired off your load inside of her. Releasing her hold on you, she rolled to the side in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Tom, that was wonderful!\" she said before getting up. \"And just take a look at this city!\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked around to see that there were many crowds gathered around the enormous sex titans in the middle of the city. Looking back at Alice, you noticed that she was now clenching her fists in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it! I'm sick of these stupid little voyeurs! It's time that they all learned how to properly respect their Goddess!\" Alice said indignantly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe then shot you a playful smirk and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help me obliterate this city, Tom? If you don't want to, then I can always just make you small again so you can ride on my shoulder and enjoy the show.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up again, you responded to Alice by saying...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alison picked up a broken tree branch and threw it at you. As the branch approached you protected yourself by karate chopping the branch in half as it flew toward you. Looking up, you saw that Alison was approaching you quickly. She jumped into the air and launched a flying kick right at you, but you rolled to the side just in time and Alison skidded past you, leaving a trail of ruined ground where you had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran up and locked hands with Alison, despite her being almost twice your height your super strength allowed you to force her backwards. At this size Alison's usually average breasts seemed almost as big as your head. This momentary laps in concentration cost you, as Alison quickly brought her right leg over your right shoulder and hooked it around your head bringing you to the ground with your head trapped in the nook behind her knee. The crushing weight of her body, much of which was centered over your head, quickly started taking its toll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison then rested her other leg on your chest, and she began to laugh above you. You knew that you needed to act quickly before you lost too much energy to this hold. You bucked with all you strength which caused Alison to become unbalanced and allowed you to slip out from under her. While she was still on her knees, you kicked her right in the face. Alison squealed as she was sent stumbling into a near by tree. Alison was clearing her head while leaning against the tree. You saw a chance and rushed towards her, ready to shoulder bash her through the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, quicker than you gave Alison credit for, she recovered and to your horror lifted her foot to greet you. As you ran right into the sole of her boot, she forced it onto the ground. You were winded, because the heel of the boot had crushed your stomach while its sole smashed down on you ribs. While you were vulnerable, Alison took advantage of your position by relentlessly stomping down on you as you had done to her before, laughing as she did so. You couldn't see Alison's eyes through her goggles but you were sure she was enjoying this turn in the tide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground around you had become muddy from the pounding, and you had slowly sunken into it. Alison's stomping was making you indented into the ground! For a moment the pounding stopped while Alison re-gained her balance for the finale. Time seemed to slow down as Alison's now muddy white soles ascended into the air above you; both of Alison's feet were going to crush you at once. Thinking quickly and thanks to you extra strength you were able to do a backwards roll out of the muddy ground. Half a moment later Alison's feet crashed harmlessly into the ground. She became stuck in the soft ground and struggled to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bigger they are, the harder they fall.\" You said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without really thinking you kicked Alison right in the crotch. A groan escapes her lips before she falls backwards into the tree and then face first onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the winner!\" You declared, placing a boot on Alison's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were soon forced to revoke your comment, as Alison's body shuddered causing you to jump back out of fear. Alison looks up; you can't see her eyes, but can tell she is angry. This fight is far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This time, she was raising herself to a truly massive 50 feet tall! She was soon taller than most of the trees in the area, and you shuddered in fear as you saw that her foot was longer than you were tall. Her tight yellow suit had grown with her, but it seemed to be much more skintight than it was before; you took this as Alison's way of trying to show off her improved body to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do you like my powers? What good is all your strength when I can have more mass than you can handle!\" Alison said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped nervously as you realized the sheer hopelessness of your situation. You could barely deal with the old 12 foot tall Alison, so how in the world could you possibly win against this new 50 foot tall version?! Knowing that you didn't stand a chance against your girlfriend now, you quickly decided to run away as fast as you could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going, little man? You don't really think that you can escape from me, do you?\" Alison boomed as she chased after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome trees crashed down next to you as you ran, looking for the end of the forest. You stumbled over rocks and logs as you ran, all the while struggling to dodge Alison's massive feet. She almost got you several times, but you got lucky enough to end up safely under the section between her heel and sole each time. You did well in managing to avoid the rampaging Alison for almost 15 minutes, but you couldn't shake the nagging feeling that your titanic girlfriend was only toying with you; that you had oly lasted this long because she was letting you avoid her. You finally got out of the forest and ran out onto a rocky plateau, and a quick look around revealed that there was no where else to go. You now realized why Alison had let you escape from her: she was leading you to this dead end, and now your only option was to stand and face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End of the line, Tom.\" Alison said as she slowly walked toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't fair! Your power is too strong!\" You complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 'cause I chose a superior power! And besides, you fought dirty too!\" Alison said, anger crossing her face as she reminded you of what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any response to that. Laughing, Alison reached down towards you. Grabbing you with ease, she lifted you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how to finish you off?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison opened her hand and let you stand on it while she thought. You noticed an opportunity and decided without a second thought to take it. You ran and did a leaping punch aimed right at Alison's chest bone, but before you reached your target two soft yellow walls pressed from either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you would try that.\" Alison said as she mashed her breasts together around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't think of any way that you could escape from this mess. You had fallen for your girlfriend's trap completely, and now she had you stuck between her massive fleshy mountains. Alison simply looked down at you in her cleavage, giggling at how utterly powerless you were against her. Before you knew it, the pressure of her boobs around your body was released and you felt yourself falling, plummeting helplessly towards the ground. Pain wracked through your body as you hit the ground with a sickening thud. You tried to rise your feet, but Alison brutally brought her foot down on top of you. This crushed you into the rock and finished any chances you had left of putting up a fight. Alison then reached down and plucked your battered body up by your cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Alison finished the fight by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll have to use a special finisher on you\" She cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken around to view Alison's giant ass. Then you were lifted up to where Alison had unzipped her suit in the back. Giggling like a small child, Alison lowered you into her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison please, not like this!\" You screamed as Alison lowered you in between her butt cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Tom, but you're just too tough for anything else.\" Alison said from above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Alison let you go and you fell into the middle of her butt crack. She then clenched her cheeks together, pinning you in place. Once you were securely trapped between her butt cheeks, Alison zipped her yellow suit back up again. You could only watch helplessly as your last source of light and fresh air was sealed off, and you were plunged into hot sweaty darkness. You soon felt Alison unclench her cheeks, but the skintight material of her bodysuit held you in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it like in there, tough guy? Does it smell nice?\" Alison asked tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you got a burst of energy. You didn't deserve to lose like this; you had put up a good fight, and wanted to go out in a more dignified manner. On the outside, Alison sat down and pressed all of her enormous body's weight onto your miniscule frame. It was a motion that she expected would end the fight once and for all. However, you managed to use your enhanced strength to hold her cheeks apart long enough for her to stand back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've got some fight left in you after all, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out NOW!\" You yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'll just have to soften you up first. You're only prolonging your torture by being so stubborn!\" She said sounding pleased that you weren't giving up so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Alison rolled onto her back and laid down. It was hot on the plateau, and Alison's butt was getting more and more sweaty withing the formfitting bodysuit. She relaxed like this for half an hour, all the while enjoying the feeling of your futile struggles as the inescapable ass flesh kept you pinned down. Alison smiled as she felt you weakly try to crawl out of her butt, but your body was beginning to reach its limits. After everything you had endured, you weren't in any condition to go very far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alison decided she had had enough of lying on her back, she rolled over again. This was when you really entered hell. The sun's rays had gotten hotter, and they were now beating down directly on Alison's rear. Your girlfriend's bodysuit absorbed the heat like a sponge, and your soft fleshy prison was quickly turning into a hot sweaty oven. The heat was baking you as your body continued to get weaker and weaker, just as Alison had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before long, your position inside Alison's butt crack had become like a scorching inferno that was slowly cooking you alive. If you were still at full strength, you might have had a chance to escape while Alison lay on her front. But as things stood now, you barely had enough energy left to remain conscious. You couldn't even begin to think about escaping from her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of \"baking\" you, Alison decided it was time to end her little game. You had literally been softened up in Alison's butt oven, so much so that when she sat on the edge of the plateau this time you actually started to be flattened. Alison laughed victoriously as she felt you tiny body begin to flatten out beneath her ass. It wasn't a fast end for you either; your prolonged torture had to go on even longer. Trapped in the darkness, all you could feel was the pressure of sweaty walls slowly turning you into mush. Alison ground her butt along the edge of the rock, causing your poor body to be smeared further along her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alison then started to clench and unclench her cheeks causing you further humiliation as your body was kneaded into a blob of formless flesh. Your body had been completely disfigured by the pressure of your girlfriend's butt cheeks. As her coup de grace, Alison jumped into the air and landed her ass forcefully onto the ground below. This was the end of you, as the impact caused you body to be splattered across the inside of her suit. As your consciousness faded, you noticed that your remains were being absorbed into Alison's skin. Alison hadn't just turned you into pulp with her ass, she had made you a part of that ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>ALISON WINS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nABSORPTION.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that computerized voice announced your girlfriend's victory over you, you found yourself standing in a white room again. Alison soon appeared in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose that you'll think twice before calling <i>me</i> a shrimp from now on!\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quite embarrassed by how the fight had ended, so you just stayed quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Tom? Are you embarrassed that you your butt kicked by a girl? If you want to, I'm always ready to have a rematch with you.\" Alison teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you want to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It pressed your now toddler sized body against her yellow bodysuit, her breasts suddenly became much larger as well. Although if it was because you were being pushed up into them or she had used something else you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison looks down upon you and gives you a large and sloppy kiss on the forehead, she's enjoying this chance to play with you. Part of you was wondering if she actually loved you or not, but you shook away those thoughts. No point in trying to think about that now after all. While Alison keeps you held she moves her other hand to unzip her bodysuit, the zipper going down is the only thing you hear right now. Aside from Alison's calmly beating heart, looking up at her you realise she's grinning like a happy clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top part of her suit comes off, exposing her shoulders. The bare skin was titillating, the rest of her arms showing soon thereafter. Alison then sat down, and began cradling you with both arms. You were so stunned by what was happening that you couldn't bring yourself to struggle or anything. And besides the grass field only made you feel all the more calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison smiled down at you, the bodysuit then came off to reveal her breasts. Again you weren't sure if was because of your small size or she had somehow grown them, but those tits just look so so inviting. Alison grabs her right one and jiggles it playfully in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw you like your mommy's titties?\" She cooed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only respond by licking your lips, unable to focus on anything but the delicious round nipple. Alison leans in with her breasts, shaking them ever so slightly from side to side in a near hypnotising fashion. She knew you were lulled under her spell, all she needed was to just calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then have em!\" Alison said to you in a sing song like voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that your girlfriend and opponent gently lowered her breasts down onto your head, you were overwhelmed by the softness of her funbags. Greedily you took the right nipple and began caressing it in your mouth, flicking it up and down. Alison wasn't holding you back anymore, and so you reached up to grab the breast and fondle the flesh of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison batted her eyelashes and lightly panted, whipping her head from side to side like a dog in heat. \"Drink my sweet, drink from your beloved's sweet bosom.\" she muttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she said that to your pleasant surprise warm breastmilk had begun flowing out from her nipple. You were wasting no time in sucking into her breast even more, you should have felt emasculated. Your girlfriend had shrunk you to the size of a small kid and was treating you like she was your Mother. But yet it all felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison removed you from her right nipple, and began rubbing the dripping milk around her chest. Looking down at you with a crazy smile she shoved you into her other breast, where it too began flowing with milk. Alison was getting real aroused here, the most she had been since she began dating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yesss my dear, such a good boy!\" Alison purred out to you, she shoved you ever deeper into her bountiful chest. She was now starting to moan aloud in approval, her teen hormones kicking in. But this was just her playing with you, it was still a match and Alison knew she needed to finish you off somehow. But how?</span></div></div>",

Although you hadn't thought of this, seeing as how you were too busy feasting on the succulent breast milk of your girlfriend. Funny that you had never done this with her in your relationship, so perhaps that was partly the reason why you were so eager to dine on her tits. That and her breast milk just tasted so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only noises you made was suckling sounds as you fed on her nipples, that and the sound of small gusts of winds. You felt so calm and lulled into a sense of peace, the fact that you were supposed to be fighting Alison at all was in the smallest corner of your mind. You could only really think of the maternal feelings of your girlfriend's body, and her cooing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour \"Mother\" pulled you away from her breasts and onto her shoulder, where she patted your back. In response you let out a loud burping noise, following this Alison then held you out at arm's length and looked at you with a grin. \"Aw your just so adorable, but.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do need to beat you, the first time was with my ass. I was going to maybe eat you, but seeing as how you've become enamoured with my tits. I think I'll let them kill you.\" her grin then became dark. And you realised that didn't sound very good for you, so you started to try and struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you then realised that Alison was getting bigger, but you knew her power was shrinking. And that only meant she had made you smaller, you had to be about the size of her ring finger. Alison was now holding you in one hand, and brought you close. Real close to her mammaries, right between them to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin was so soft, with light sweat and the smell of breast milk. You lightly gasped, and then suddenly Alison mashed her breasts with you between them. This had happened before, but your girlfriend had worn her bodysuit during it. Now though you were being mashed by the heavenly flesh of the giant girl, Alison then lay down on her back. While making sure you were stuck in her tits, her arms moving to put her bodysuit fully on. You couldn't really tell until you were stuck in the darkness once again, as if to remind you of what happened the last time when your girlfriend stuck you in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to fight, to struggle. But the smell of her breasts and the treatment you had been given had lulled all the strength out of you, Alison was mashing and swinging her tits. Crushing you along with it, slowly but surely. Your girlfriend skipped forward, bouncing you inside her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had passed, but you weren't sure how much. But that didn't matter as you were enveloped in pitch black with a pair of soft tits, you didn't struggle. Alison smiled as she didn't feel that, maybe after kicking your ass twice in this manner you might not call her short anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long all the closeness to Alison's breasts was depriving you of air, and the heat was taking it's toll on your just like when you were shoved in her ass. Your girlfriend knew this and decided to end it. Alison started to mash her bodysuit covered breasts more and more, until soon all that you were was a red gooey paste in the valley of her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ALISON WINS! BREAST-TALITY!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly after hearing that voice you were back in the same white room as before, Alison was standing before you. And cupped her breasts one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've proved who wears the pants.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only blush in response to that, and Alison said \"You've been beaten twice by a girl now, want to go for one more?\"</span></div></div>",

Is it cheesy or salty?\" she asked tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to mumble out a response, but you could say nothing as your girlfriend's sweat drenched foot covered your mouth.

Alison dives by you but a moment later has picked herself up and readying another attack. You reach down and grab a rock and throw it with all your strength at Alison. She ducks and avoids it easily, but this gave you enough time to run closer to her. She looks down at you and tries to grab you by the shoulders, but you're too quick. You duck behind her and punch her in the back of the knee, causing her to buckle and drop onto one knee. A kick to Alison's butt sent her stumbling away from you. With the intention of following up your attack you raced after Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too slow Tom!\" She said as she turned around and kicked you violently in the side of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blow sent you crashing into the ground where you tumbled into a heap. A moment later and you felt a sharp pain on the side of you head as Alison stomped her foot on it. Alison painfully ground her boot onto your face leaving a red mark in the shape of her boot's sole on your cheek. Alison then sat down on you back. Her weight pounded you into the soft ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this Tom?\" Alison asked, her voice sounding mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nothing!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do was do a push up and roll away. You started the push up and got surprised by how easily you could lift Alison even though she was sitting on your back. When you reached the top you held yourself there arms straight out below you relishing your strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Easy!\" You said as you were about to roll away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you saw it: Alison had tricked you. She was holding herself up with her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shit!' was your only thought before Alison let her weight go, forcing you into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Tom? Because it looks to me like you're having trouble handling my weight.\" Alison said as she sat down on your back, stretching her legs out into front of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms had been driven into the ground all the way up to your chest. This left you trapped with you arms in the dirt. Laughing at your predicament, Alison stood up and walked around to your face, your chin was level with the ground which forced you to look ahead straight at Alison's boots. Too your horror, you watched as Alison pulled her leg back. you made a last desperate effort you free yourself but you were stuck fast. Then <i>WACK, WACK, SMASH, CRACK</i>. Alison kept kicking your helpless face. Your face was covered in cuts and bruises in just a couple of seconds, your vision was blurring. Alison was laughing dominantly as she readied the final kick, the one that launched you out of the ground and into a near by tree. You slumped down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight dirty against me, will you?\" Alison said as she slowly walked towards you....  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Things had gone from great to gory for you in all but a few moves, perhaps Alison had held back against you. Letting you bask in what you thought was going to be an easy victory, only for her to take that away from you just like that. Your head was mangled and bruised, perhaps you should have taken the power that made you indestructible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mused on this however Alison was of course moving towards you, towering over your prone body with anger on her face. You knew that you were in deep shit now, all those attacks you took had only allowed you to crawl slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alison please.....\" you mutter out, hoping to perhaps get a small mercy from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Alison darkly grinned, mounting your body while tossing her goggles away. You let out a grunt as she sat on you again, only this time it hurt more due to the battering you had taken. \"You know there needs to be a winner in this fight Tom, and you've been pretty mean to me.....\" she muttered back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison don't, I love you. Please, I give....\" you say, shaking in response to Alison's position over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words make Alison hesitate slightly, but she then says \"But Tom, I need to show off more of my power to you. In fact I want to use you like a toy, don't worry. I still love you, but as long as we're in VR. I can do whatever I want to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning Alison then suddenly grows more, to about 14 feet. You can only watch in horror as she becomes larger and larger, once she's done. Your girlfriend then says \"But sometimes.....love hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Alison then starts raining down fists onto your head, you had the mercy to black out after the second punch though. And before long all that was left was just a large red goop where your head was, it had been pounded into mush by her giant fists. Grinning in victory Alison ran her bloodied hands down her suit, before moving to kiss the air. Or rather where your lips would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll there was for you thought was just blackness, for now anyway.</span></div></div>",

It was sided with several, five-stories tall buildings. In the distance, you saw some skyscrapers rising up. But there were no people, well, except one. Alison stood about 20 feet away from you. She wore a tight, dark-blue custom with a red cape. The skin-tight leather made her curves clearly visible and you noticed that her breasts were bigger than outside the VR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a computer voice echoed across the street: \"Fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Alison dashed at you. What kind of power did she pick, you wondered. According to her outfit, she had maybe made herself into some kind of supergirl. Well, only one way to find out for certain. You jumped back, avoiding her attack, and landed on a car. With your powers, you made it hover into the air. Before Alison could react, you made another car fly through the air. The vehicle hit her. But it did not hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it rose into the air again, accompanied by a scream of rage from Alison. Did she took a telekinetic power as well? No. You quickly realized what was going on when Alison came into view. She was growing, making it seem like the car was shrinking between her hands. Her eyes, glowing blue, fixed on you with an angry stare. \"You threw a car at me, you jerk!\" Her echoing, angry voice almost made you cower. She then through the car. Just in time, you got a hold of yourself, made the car stop in mid-air and let it drop down on the street where it hit the ground with a loud metal noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you flew higher to get out of Alison's reach. From a save distance, you regarded her. She was about 50 feet tall. You also noticed that she was not just bigger. Her muscles were larger as well, every bulk clearly visible through the skin-tight outfit. Her eyes were glowing blue and it seemed like a soft wind would make her hair move slightly. All in all, she appeared to be filled with more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's that power? Are you She-Hulk?\" You joked, trying to hide your uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alison just smirked. \"Not exactly, little fly.

You just had to hit her strong enough to knock her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour power was to manipulate matter, so you looked around, searching for a suitable weapon. A tall skyscraper caught your eye. With 1000 feet, it loomed above the cityscape. With your powers, you used the car you were standing on as a flying carpet. But loud, thundering footsteps made you turn around. Shocked, you realized that Alison was gaining on you fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept a height of 100 feet to stay out of her range, while she was running directly underneath you. \"Come down here, shrimp!\" Her thunderous voice was taunting. You realized to your dismay that she used the same term you had used on her earlier. Now, you were smaller than her, way smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running, Alison bent down and picked up a car. She threw it upwards slighty and caught it again as if it was a tennis ball. \"When I get you, I will have some fun with you before I finish you off.\" With that, she threw the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nick of time, you caught it with your powers. But Alison already threw the next. You used the first as a shield, but as the two pieces of metal slammed into each other, you lost your telekinetic grip and they fell... onto Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide grin on her face, she shot upwards. You gulped as her head reached and passed you. When her shoulders were above the surrounding buildings, her growth stopped. You looked up at her in awe. She must be over 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wink, she flexed her biceps. It was bigger than your whole body now. Her breasts seemed to have grown as well. Suddenly, her hand descended upon you. Quickly, you moved to the side, between two building. Her hand closed behind you with a thump that made your hair stand on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, Alison's laughter echoed across the street as the giant superheroine slammed her hips against the closed building, turning it into an avalanche of debris. You managed to keep it from falling on your head as you flew at high speed through the street canyons. Alison followed close behind you. She used her shoulders to slam buildings out of the way while her feet created massive cracks in the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the massive skyscraper. With all of your might, you forced the entire structured to collapse on Alison, who had just pushed the last buildings between you and her out of the way. Shocked, she realized what was going on. But it was too late. The building buried her under itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms triumphantly. But your feeling of victory vanished almost immediately. The remains of the skyscraper exploded and from the smoke, Alison's figure emerged ominously. Her eyes were glowing bright blue and the corner of her right lip was raised mockingly while her body grew to even more insane dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flew upwards, higher and higher, until you reached the top of the closed skyscraper. It was roughly 800 feet high. You landed on the roof. Strange, you thought. Everything was dark, even though the sky was blue. Having a presentiment, you turned around. Alison's hips filled your entire field of view. The leather of her suit accentuated her curves and made all of her abs visible. You looked up at your towering girlfriend. Her body blocked out the sun. What you could possibly do to defeat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tall now, right little ant?\" Her voiced thundered from above. Her mouth was hidden behind her breasts, but you knew she was smiling. \"I could crush you like an insect know, but that would be boring. So I'll let you exchanged your hero class with another one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA list of several superheroes appeared before your eyes. You quickly scrolled through it. Two heroes caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which hero do you chose?\", the computer voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"I'll take...\"</span></div></div>",

Keep up.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cJeez.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnyhow, the second, is a quest to defeat the great warrior Avarus, and her master, the sorceress Paqrant, who is holding a city hostage.

I\u2019ll set it up. See you on the other side Tommy Boy.\u201d <br>\r\nThe castle fades away and you find yourself in a large field with horses, equipment and armor scattered around. <br>\r\n\u201cReady to move sir?\u201d<br>\r\nYou spin around and look up at a giant woman. She must be about 7 feet tall. <br>\r\n\u201cUh, ya.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGood. I am Carolina, Amazon Queen and your humble servant on this quest. I bring my finest two Knights. Annarus,\u201d<br>\r\nShe motions behind her toward an even bigger girl with a fat butt, and a seductive body. Carolina goes up to her breasts. <br>\r\n\u201cAnd Cassius.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground slightly vibrates as a massive girl struts forward. She is easily 15 feet, and she towers over Annarus. She crosses her arms over her thick and quite muscular body. You only reach her meaty thighs..<br>\r\n\u201cUh, wow, um...thanks?\u201d<br>\r\nCarolina and her knights bend forward and bow, revealing their tightly packed cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that morning, you and your warriors mount horses and begin to trot along a wide dirt road. On either side, all you see is trees and in the distance, mountains. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, where exactly are we going.\u201d You ask Carolina, who rides beside you. <br>\r\n\u201cWe are headed for the enchanted city of Eliziath. It has been taken over by Paqrant, and it is guarded by the fearsome golena named Avarus. But you knew that.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018golena\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Tis a magical creature capable of altering its size and shape. Usually they are quite big.\u201d<br>\r\nCassius (who is too tall for a horse) walks up and interjects : \u201cI can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\nYou ride for a long time silence. Then, you see the outline of something ahead. <br>\r\n\u201c Tis\u2019 Eliziath! We\u2019ve arrived, bless Jarunezecs soul!\u201d <br>\r\nYou hop off your horse, and stand next to Annarus, plotting the next move. <br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says \u201cif we attack from the east and wait for reenfoecements, it will take far longer and , but it will be safer. If we attack from the south, then we shall meet Avarus, but after that, we can move much faster and more easily. What should we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

We will advance from the south.\u201d You say. <br>\r\nReally though, you just want to see what Sarah has planned for you.<br>\r\nYou and Carolina ride forward toward the city. As you near it, you see an enormous wall surrounding it.<br>\r\n\u201cCarolina, what\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, it is the cursed Paqrants wall. Her magic keeps these innocent people trapped.\u201d<br>\r\nYou suddenly see a long bridge. It is narrow and you aren\u2019t entirely sure your giantess (Cassius) will be able to cross it. <br>\r\nWhen you reach the edge, Annarus gives a stark warning.<br>\r\n\u201cWe have arrived at the Crossing Of Destiny. Only one may cross at once. When we reach the far side, Avarus will be waiting.\u201d<br>\r\nYou then proceed to crepes the bridge. Cassius barely squeaked through, and the thing was creaking under her immense mass. <br>\r\nAfter a moment, nothing happens. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Avarus?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe only may attack when we least expect.\u201d<br>\r\nAs you proceed, you suddenly fall into a deep trap.

You quickly scramble to your feet. <br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n\u201cHi. What were you doing on the ground?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh I fell.\u201d<br>\r\nShe studies you from head to toe. You can\u2019t help but notice that she has a thick butt that jiggles with every movement. She is pretty, and stands about 6\u201d shorter than you. <br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d She asks. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Tom. A knight.\u201d<br>\r\nHer eyes go wide, but before you can react she settles herself. <br>\r\n\u201cOh. Well come with me. I\u2019ll show you into the city.\u201d She says with an enourmous grin.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t know. My knights are wai-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d She interrupts. \u201cI really must help.\u201d<br>\r\nYou allow her to lead you down a strange road that goes toward the mountains. You reach the mouth of a large cave. Once inside, you soon notice that it is a home. But not just any home, the home of something big. Your head just reaches the seats of chairs, and the table stretches high above you. <br>\r\n\u201cUh where are we?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is the hard part.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You seem nice and all but...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what? I don\u2019t understand? Why are we here?\u201d<br>\r\nShe sighs. <br>\r\n\u201cTom, your time has come. You see, I\u2019m Avarus.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Why are you doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my curse. I know you are trying to do the right thing but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late. Even with me and your friends, Paqrant would brush us aside.\u201d<br>\r\nAs she said this, she dropped her cloak to the floor. She was know in tight jeans and a revealing shirt. What Tom didn\u2019t know, was that she was slowly growing. She stretched past his height. Up, and up until he reached her navel. <br>\r\n\u201cAvarus! I know you. In the real world you are Ava! We were friends.\u201d As he pleaded, Avarus slowly moved toward him. <br>\r\n\u201cTom. It\u2019s time. We can either fight, and I will win, or you can give up, and I\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She plans to surprise you by taking you to her father's lab. When you arrive, she takes you into a room with a virtual reality system set up. When the two of you have arrived in the virtual world, you decide to have some fun with this dream-like world where ANYTHING is possible. After a while, however, you realize that your girlfriend is the one who is really in control of this cyber-world... and she wants to make the most of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so there's the basis of the story. It was actually inspired by this story here:  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://gts-stories.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtual-giantess.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://gts-stories.blogspot.com/2007/10/virtual-giantess.html</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince its virtual reality, remember that the laws of physics don't apply. Both you and your girlfriend can control anything in the cyber-world, but your girlfriend's powers have priority over yours (ex: if you want to shrink her, but she doesn't want to be shrunken, she won't be). So basically, you can only alter stuff if she approves of what you want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to take full advantage of the fact that it's all virtual. You can fly, shoot lasers out of your eyes, breath fire, grow as big as a planet... heck, you can even <b>MAKE</b> a planet if you want. You can also create virtual replicas of other people, so you can make a city of people for the characters to interact with (or just have another girl join in on playing with you after your girlfriend shrinks you). Remember that you can also modify the <i>environment</i> at will, and have fun. I will allow almost anything, but there are a few rules. No gender swapping girls into guys (guys into girls is okay), no futa stuff, no male giants without an equally big or bigger giantess by his side, and no gay stuff (lesbian is okay. sorry if you think this is unfair). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like the focus to be mostly giantess themed, but feel free to include other themes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find. I also reserve the right to make minor alterations to chapters if it is necessary to insert detail or correct one of the above rules being broken. If a chapter is too poorly written for me to fix, then it will be deleted. Chapters that I have to delete will not qualify for the GP reward.</u><br>\r\n</b></i></td>",
