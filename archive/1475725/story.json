What Class are you?\"  You are confused by this for a moment before remembering that there are specific social Classes in this world.  This is something the man showing you the area and explaining the basics of everyday life here talked about.

Too late to change your mind now.  And speaking of your mind, while you were thinking, you overlooked a tree root directly in your path.  You trip, falling to the ground.  Knowing that this is a matter of life or death, you jump to your feet.  However, the beast had jumped over you while you were horizontal and was now blocking the path.  It was a wide path, but there were thick bushes on either side.  Escape was impossible.  The beast was regarding you with slight interest.  It didn't seem to be quite as threatening as one would think, but why take a chance?  Glancing around frantically, you notice a sword on the ground behind you.  It was old and somewhat rusty, but it was your only defence.  You reach down and grab it, then whirl around to face the beast again.  <br>\r\nIt didn't seem the slightest bit alarmed by the weapon.

Will you accept my challenge?\"  You think for a moment, and then say, <br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"  <br>\r\nThe voice laughed coldly.  \"You'll never figure it out.  Here it is: <br>\r\n'I float through the skies, a passenger inside a changing shape.  I swim in the oceans, one part of a whole.  I sit on the land, waiting for the sun.

The voice is silent for a long moment.  Finally it speaks.  \"Argh!  You... you got it!  Fine!  Take the dumb map!  Get out of here!\"  Several of the beasts stepped aside.  You were silent as you passed through the Forest, heading for the outside world.  Finally, you broke through the trees, and out into the sun.  The young woman was still there, picking flowers.  She looked up as you approach.  She smiled slightly.  \"Did you get what you were looking for?\"  You nodded, thrilled.  \"Well, then, best not to keep your lord waiting, right?  Off you go!\"  You turned and began heading down the dusty road, smiling broadly.  Lord Byon would reward you well for your trouble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached your village, the answer to the voice's question began to show itself in the open world.  You smiled even more broadly.  Your corn crops would do well this season.  And you would always be protected, thanks to the map.  </span></div></div>",

A Chupacabra?  She shakes her head at each type of creature you mention.  You keep listing monsters, but finally you give up and say, \"Well, what is it then?\"<br>\r\nShe clears her throat.  Then she motions for you to come closer.  You do so, and she says in a very soft voice<br>\r\n\"No one knows what it is exactly.  Old man Kris claims he saw it, but it turns out it was just an overgrown Coy-dog.  They live around here, but they generally avoid us.  A young boy claims he saw it at the edge of the forest, but no one believed him.  His last claim was that his cousin--he doesn't like her--was a witch.  She's practically a saint here, so no one believes a word he says now.<br>\r\n\"Foolish people travelling alone at night have disappeared, their bodies never found.  Some claim it's an ancient creature, disturbed by the recent human activity.  And some say--\"<br>\r\nShe stops talking as you yawn.  \"Nice sword, by the way.  It'll probably be completely useless.  If you're going after it, head right into the Forest.  Once you find any unusual tracks or something, keep following them.  You'll find it eventually.  Or maybe it will find you first.  Good luck.

Where to?</span></div></div>",

It seems to belong to a sword.<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\"  The female voice is cold, and you decide it would be a wise idea to obey.  \"Are you gonna leave?\"  You shake your head, carefully avoiding the swordblade near your neck.  After all, there could be something here to help you on your journey.  The woman in the darkness sighs.  \"Will you leave if I give you what I think you're looking for?\"  You nod slowly.  Another sigh, then a rustling noise.  \"Here.  Take it.\"  The woman holds out a delicate hand.  Cupped in her palm is an Amulet of Discord.  \"It's not real,\" she says, noticing your dismay.  \"It's a replica.  But it's still useful.  Take it and leave.\"  The swordblade had vanished from the area around your throat, and you took the Amulet carefully, as though it would suddenly become alive.  You turn and walk out the door into the bright sunlight.  The door creaks shut behind you.  You shrug and walk back to your original spot.  You tie the Amulet around your neck.  For the slightest instant, you're sure you can feel it twitch, but nothing else happens.  You turn around halfway and survey your options.

He looked at you with tired grey eyes.  \"Hello there,\"  he said quietly.  You say hello in response, then ask him who he is.  \"My name is Leo.  I'm a prince who became lost in the Forest here.  A terrible monster captured me.  Now I cannot return home until the monster is defeated.  Please help me!\"  You glance at the huge slumbering creature.  Then your curious nature got the better of you.  Completely disregarding the skeletons everywhere, you march right up to the beast and tap it lightly.  Its fur was very soft, but it woke up the instant you touched it, and jumped to its feet, snarling.  You pull out your sword.  This may be difficult.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of avoiding the swipes the beast made at you with its claws, you saw an opening in its defence strategy that would kill it.

The beast is sitting in front of you, staring with two dark blue eyes.  You turn your head and see Leo approaching you.  He was smiling.  \"Congratulations!  You defeated the beast without killing it.\"  You asked him if that happened often.  He just laughed lightly.  \"You deserve a reward.  Emli?\"  You whirl around.  The beast had apparently wandered off because standing there now was Emli.  She was smiling, too.  <br>\r\n\"One 'Respect Special', coming right up!\"  She turned and whistled.  A rustle in the bushes gave way to a very small, more dog-like version of the beast you had just fought.  It ran up to you, a pink tongue hanging out of its mouth.  It sat down at your feet, looking up at you with its head tilted.  \"This little guy is now yours.  He's a good traveling companion, you know.  Oh, and before I forget....\"  Leo reached into a pocket and pulled out an Amulet of Discord.  He sprinkled something on it, and then handed it to you.  Without thinking, you put it on.  It seems to twitch slightly, but other than that, nothing happened.  \"You can visit anytime you like.  It's getting into the afternoon in the outside world, so you should probably go if you want to make it to the village before dark.\"  You nod, still too surprised to really say anything.  You began walking away, picking up your sword as you did so.  You put it back in its sheath, and continued on the path you came in from.  You walked the rest of the way almost as if in a trance, and was soon in the sunlight.  Emli was out there, picking flowers.  You approached her.  She looked up and smiled.  <br>\r\n\"Hello again!  Did you find what you were looking for?\"  You nodded.  Emli showed no signs of having been in the Forest recently.  The main reason for the theory was the fact that her flower basket was almost full, flowers were everywhere, and Emli seemed to have very high standards; only the prettiest flowers were in her basket.  You said your goodbyes, and began heading down the road to the village.  Was it just a dream?  A hallucination brought on by the heat?  A small yip made you look down.  Trotting beside you was the beast-puppy.  <br>\r\nSo it wasn't a dream, then.  That meant the quest had barely started.  You had much to look forward to.</span></div></div>",
