You are kind of small and young looking for your age, so can sometimes pass for a teenager, but that has only made things harder in your new life in the business world. You try to stay optimistic, but things can often get you down, so you come to the park sometimes to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there, you notice the playground, which is full of small children playing, while being watched by their mothers on benches like yours. You sit there for a while, watching the kids, and relaxing to the thought of being that worry free to just have a mother take care of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, the kids are taken away by their mothers one by one. You notice that, despite all the kids being gone, there is still one woman remaining. She looks very young, maybe early twenties, and has a caring look to her. She also seems to have a stroller with her. Just then, she sees you looking at her, and stands up and walks toward you, pushing the stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does, you can see that the stroller is empty. Hello, she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, um, hello. What's the stroller for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, well, just in case I need it I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Did you want a ride?</span></div></div>",

Well, that's fine. Hop on in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted the straps and you sat down, and were surprised that despite it being very snug, you were able to fit. She then strapped you in, and began pushing the stroller.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is insane. You're a young adult in your early twenties and being pushed in a stroller by some stranger. For one, it's weird that she's pushing around an empty stroller and you're even weirder for filling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps...you're just tired of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, this is just a way to get out of the norm of a busy routine that has simply exhausted you after just a few years of working. Even though this might ruin your life if anyone catches you being pushed in a stroller, you don't seem to care. Given no breaks, no real benefits, and more importantly, no love, it seems that life has pushed you to the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite acknowledging this, you yawn. The wind brushes gently against your face and you hear the young woman hum beautifully behind you. She doesn't seem at all perturbed but then again, she's probably not in the right mind. It's a shame because she seems to be quite the beautiful girl. Given your youthful complexion, she probably doesn't even know you're likely as old as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hardly worry about all of that. Feeling the most relaxed in months, which is sad, you easily fall asleep and drift away. A small smile grows on your face as you forget about the hardships of being a working adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

In this small apartment that you've been renting for about a year since you moved into the city, there's little comfort except for the fact that you can sometimes go to rest and vent your frustrations alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and a small tear runs through your eyes. Of course, such a strange encounter would be a dream. No, it might be for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking these sad thoughts, you hear a high pitch whistling in the kitchen. It takes you a moment before you spring out of the bed and curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, did I leave the kettle on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly throw your blanket and step out. Sure enough, you see a pot that you don't remember placing but that doesn't matter. With a hurried breath, you quickly turn off the stove. It looks like there's still water so maybe it wasn't long since you possibly left it. More importantly, why did you go to take a nap and leave the kettle running?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, your eyes wander to the rest of the room and adjacent to the small kitchen where you stand, you freeze to you see someone on your couch staring at you with slight surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OsvLX0b1koU/Xn4Pb_hWDAI/AAAAAAACrEY/HOOVsgYOY0owF7KYaOv0QxXm0sexPQ9eACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tw0_0013.JPG\">Preview</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OsvLX0b1koU/Xn4Pb_hWDAI/AAAAAAACrEY/HOOVsgYOY0owF7KYaOv0QxXm0sexPQ9eACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tw0_0013.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...I was going to get that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's that woman in your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink and feel your throat drying then look to the front entrance where you see the stroller that you had fitted yourself in. Now with a clearer mind, you sweat and return to look at her with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hesitates before nodding and smiles reassuringly. \"I found your keys and address. You were quite exhausted and so I decided it's best to take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile wryly, then look down. Feeling ashamed, you chuckle bitterly and shake your head. \"...Sorry, I...don't know what came over me. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she cuts in gently causing you to look up at her. She gives the most beautiful, hopeful smile, \"...it's okay. I didn't realize it but when I saw your ID, it seems you're only a few years younger than me. It surprised me but that must be a good thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort. \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople have taken advantage of you thanks to your complexion so you think it's a blessing and a curse. If your life kept up like this, you're certain you'd look older thanks to stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next question makes you hesitate but there's no reason to lie even if it causes you feel pathetic so you nod and don't say anything more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's face softens and she hums, \"That can't be good. Living alone and also looking so exhausted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, taking it as just a cruel fate of your life so far. Staring at the door, you decide it's time to end this meaningless chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well miss,\" you begin, clearing your throat, \"...thank you for taking care of me, but I think I'm good. You don't have to worry about me anymore. I'm sure you have better things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman blinks and then to your surprise, she stifles a laugh. You stare at her confused but her eyes twinkle at you with amusement. She explains herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but saying that in such a sad tone isn't convincing, especially by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize that your voice sounded so off and blush with embarrassment. She doesn't seem to care though and smiles brightly as your image reflects in her soft blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Angel. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntroducing herself, you feel a little ashamed that you hadn't asked for her name beforehand. With a weird, but kind stranger, you didn't expect your encounter with her to go this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you tell her your name as a courtesy, but think that it won't really matter in the end. At least, that's what you think until she moves makes a sudden offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we live together? I can help you with your exhaustion and your troubles. All you need to do is relax and allow me to take care of you. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what to think but then remember that she's the one that allowed you to be pushed in a stroller. What's your thought process?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't remember a time when you had slept better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs, you're waking up, you start to stretch out your arms, and have to stop when they bump into something. Your bed in your apartment isn't facing a wall, so you're confused for a moment. As your eyes open completely, you see what your arm made contact with. It was a wooden pole, one of many. You are completely surrounded by these poles, and after taking another moment, you realize what this is, a crib. You are inside a crib large enough for a grown man, complete with all the accessories. Beneath you is clearly a baby mattress, though you've never seen one this large before, and there are various stuffed animals around you. There is also a mobile hanging above you playing music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst has yet to come though as you begin to examine yourself. You are wearing white feety pajamas. Even worse, your examination reveals another item on your person. You tried to deny it at first, but sure enough you are wearing a large adult sized diaper under your feety pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill surprised by what you're seeing, you take a bit more time to examine the room. The lights are turned off, but you can still see, especially with a nightlight that is plugged in near you. You see that the walls are...</span></div></div>",

There was also a swing and a bouncer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the wall, you could see various disney princess motifs, and along the edge of the ceiling, there was a border decorated with female baby disney characters, and one wall had letters on it, spelling out P-R-I-N-C-E-S-S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was, without a doubt, the weirdest experience of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you do next?</span></div></div>",
