You vision blur and soon you collapse. You look around, things felt...different. You didn't recognize the area you were in until you saw something that shock you, a pencil. The pencil was ordinary for the most part except for one itty bitty thing, its as long as a sckyscrapper. You look around and see what used to be ordinary object the size of either montains or buildings, you shrunk. You try to figure out what happened, this has to be a dream.

You need to get help, but you can see just how far it is to get to the school as its what looks like miles and miles away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were normal size, you would only need to walk about twenty feet from the gate to the school door. At ant size, you feel like you will be spending weeks just to get to the otherside, and that's only because of the endless forest of grass that stands before you. No matter what, you need to get someone's attention, and fast as already you can feel the ground shake from who knows what. Gathering your courage, you run straight into the grass forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later and already you are regretting your discion. You thought that maybe you could use the school's massive structure as a guide, but the blades of grass were so much and cover the sky that now you are lost. You can see loght here and there, but you can'st make head or tail of where you are going. You thought of stopping when you felt the ground shaking. You panic as you have no idea what is causing the shaking. Was it a human, a pokemon, who cares as yoy ran as fast as you can to any direction.

You were about a foot away, for a normal size person, from the locker when you hear the bell ran. As you feared, people start to pour out of the classroom and began to walk around the hallway as you thought. Already dozens of massive footwear stomps behind you and you had to jump to avoid being step on. You were close to be under the locker, you just need to move a other inch. However, you see a shadow forming around you and you look up to see that someone's foot is right above you. With one last ounce of your strength, you jump forward jusy in time to avoid the foot from crushing you. You look around see that you are under the locker, so you're safe for the time being. As you try to catch your breath, you notice that the foot that almost crush you isn't moving, which means this must be thr owner of the locker above you.

Luckily for you, the strap of her bag  hangs low enough for you to climb up to her chair, then you can use her long hair to make it to her desk. As you begin to climb, you start to think about how lucky you were to find Lillie before she left the school for the day, after all, she usually has to stay over later than most as her mother can't get to the school in time to pick her up when school ends. Fortunately Lusamine has a lot a sway with the school, what with her having donated a lot of money towards it, so Lillie is allowed to stay in classrooms and continue studying after school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach her seat, you look up at her face, her green eyes are reading whatever book she has up there intensely, now that her and her mother are on good terms she can focus more on her true passion, Pokemon. she made it her life's goal to study and understand every Pokemon in the world, so the majority of her time is spent studying to be a Pokemon researcher. Honestly, you couldn't have picked a better person to get help from, she's kind, smart, and most importantly.....</span></div></div>",

As for the giantess, all females from the pokemon universe is allowed, games, manga, shows, if they're female, they are allowed to be in the story. Just make sure that they fit roles based on their appearance/ age. Example: Characters like the hex manaics, Bianca, and May look like students and should stick to that role innsomenways. While characters like Cynthia or Diana are adults so they should be  teachers or principal. Every character can either appear in their regular outfit, or they can appear in school uniform, just make sure to establish which. Pokemons can be allowed in, but they are strictly in their regular pokemon forms, no exception. Also, since NPCs don't really have one single name, just pick a name for a npc and stick with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you are stuck as ant size, you can't grow any bigger unless you want to end the interactive. You can shrink more, but make sure to find what shrunk you in the first place. It can be anything, from a science experiment to even someone having magic.Also, keep the things in 2nd pov, meaing that you say \"You did...\" or \"You ran...\" no 3rd or first part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing disgusting like scat or pee are allowed, no worship of any kind are allowed. And please make sure you focus on something else instead of one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the giantess are to stay unaware of you for the most part until you actually catch their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing, please be descriptive in the chapters with clear grammer.
