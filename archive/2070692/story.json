Today was Thursday, and but one day now separated Danny from the glorious weekend.  Tony was supposed to come over this weekend.  Susan said she would whip up chicken wings and pizza for the boys, and Rosa was going to drive the boys to the mall to see a movie or something.  Tony was a bit younger than Danny, so it turned out he didn't have a driver's license either.  Tony liked being around Rosa.  She was a nice person, and she was undeniably sexy, like many of the women Connor Wilkins had hired to do various things for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny also had a psychology project he would have to work on at some point, but that could wait, as today was just too nice a day to busy oneself with such things.  Danny enjoyed a smooth and pleasant ride as he absent-mindedly drifted over the smooth black pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Danny jumped as a noise shattered his mental paradise.  He turned around to see the source of the noise--a big black Lincoln had revved its engine loudly on the quiet suburban street.  The sound of the monster V8 tore through the neighborhood, and Danny's eyes widened in fear as he realized how close to him the car was.  It was only feet away, and it was going way too fast for a residential street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing to assault Danny's senses was terrible pain.  He could hear the crunch of metal as the car crushed his bike under its weight, and Danny himself flew upward on to the hood of the car.  Pain radiated throughout his body as his back struck the medal of the hood and his head slammed backward on to the windshield.  Danny then began to roll backward and flew into the air as his body, wracked by pain, tumbled about as the black Lincoln sped on as though nothing had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny flipped over in the air a couple times, his swirling body an uncoordinated mass of pain and shattered limbs.  He landed hard on the pavement, smashing his head into the ground hard.  Danny could feel the blood run down his head as he looked up as much as the searing pain in his neck and head would permit.  He saw the back of the black Lincoln disappear around a corner as his vision blurred from the intensity of the pain assaulting his body.  Blackness then took him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's eyes fluttered open with an undetermined amount of time having passed.  Barely defined shapes hovered about above him in a sea of light.  Danny could feel himself moving somehow, gliding over something.  There seemed to be lights on above him--big, bright ones.  Dany's vision came into focus a bit more.  There were three people on one side of him and another three on the other side of him, and they seemed to be talking to each other.  The figures all wore white coats of blue scrubs.  Was this a hospital?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him in there!\" one of the figures said.  \"We have to get the specialist in here now!\" came another frantic voice, \"Put him under!\"  A couple more seconds passed, Danny's little body still filled with pain.  \"Give him the stuff quick!\" said another blurry figure.  One of the doctors seemed to inject something into a tube, and Danny soon blacked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome undetermined period of time later, Danny's eyes fluttered open again.  He looked about in a room, trying to focus.  As nearly as he could tell, he was still in the same room as before.  the placed looked like a hospital.  Danny couldn't move much, but he could see various instruments and tubes strewn about him, and a rhythmic beeping persisted as if to indicate a heartbeat.  The pain in Danny's body seemed lessened, though not gone.  Aches persisted in general, but they were not as intense as they had once been.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny looked around, he saw a figure sitting on the other side of the room.  It was his mother!  Lisa Wilkins sat across the room in a cushioned chair.  Her red hair cascaded down her head in curls.  At 45 years old, time had begun to take a small toll on Lisa's body.  A couple lines appeared around her eyes, and her body was a bit more, well, pudgy than it had been five or ten years ago.  She had a cute little pouch in her belly, and her boobs--wonderful as they were--tended to droop just a wee bit.  She had a set of big, meaty thighs, a set of wide child-bearing hips, and a full, round ass.  The woman jiggled in all the right places.  Danny got constant comments on how hot his mother was.  His friends had dubbed her an official MILF, and he suspected that she was one of the many reasons his friend Tony enjoyed coming over so much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the hospital today with a somber affect.  She sat glumly in the chair looking down at the floor.  Some makeup was smeared about her face as though she had been crying.  She drew a tissue from her purse and blew her nose, fighting back still more tears as she contemplated her son's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" Danny called out, \"Mom I'll be all right.\"  Lisa did not look up.  It was as though she had not heard her son at all.  \"Mom, it's me--Danny.  I'm--I'm all right.  It hurts a bit, but I'll be fine,\" he tried again.  Still nothing.  Something was wrong.  \"MOM!\" Danny called out, and then he realized something.  He had tried to speak, but to not avail.  Danny had heard the words he uttered, but somehow not heard them.  \"I . . . oh my God,\" he began as he realized the problem.  See, Danny was not hearing his words with his ears, or at least not really.  Instead, he heard his words inside his own head.  It was as though he were talking only inside his own mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny tried to move, to do something to get his mother's attention, but he could do nothing.  He could not even move a pinky.  Danny was a prisoner inside his own body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the light in the room flipped on, and in came a nurse with a pleasant smile.  \"Lady!  Nurse!  I'm Danny Wilkins, and I don't know what the hell is going on!  Something is wrong with me!  You gotta help!  Please please please help!  What's happened to me!?  Please tell my mom I'm all right . . . . am I really all right?  Oh my God please help!\" came a sudden flurry of frantic requests from Danny.  His entreaties met with the same silence that his words to his mother had.  Try as he might, Danny was audible only to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Wilkins?\" the nurse asked, and Lisa looked up.  \"Yes,\" she said, wiping away tears, \"how's my boy?  Is there news about my Danny?\" she asked.  The nurse smiled.  \"Mrs. Wilkins, we're doing all we can.  We've got him sedated, so he's in no pain, but his body needs time to repair itself.  I'm here to monitor him, and there is a nurse assigned to him 24/7.  When I leave, somebody else will come in, all right?\" the woman said.  Lisa looked crestfallen because there wasn't better news.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mindy,\" the woman said as she stuck out her hand and shook Lisa's, \"I'm here to check his pulse and make sure he's stable,\" Mindy declared as she walked up to the comatose body of Danny.  Danny looked his new companion over from the fleshy prison that was his body.  Mindy was a woman of about 25 years.  She had a pleasant smile and blonde hair streaming down from her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Danny, I'm Mindy,\" she began, \"and I know you're in a coma, but I'm here to take your blood pressure so we can get you better,\" she announced quietly.  At least she had a good bedside manner, even as to sleeping patients.  Mindy, though, was not especially fit.  In fact, she was quite the opposite.  Mindy was quite overweight.  She had a noticeable double chin with flabby arms and pudgy fingers.  Her boobs were huge and jiggled mightily as she walked, but the scope of her bust was great only because, well, the rest of her was pretty big too.  Farther down, her sloppy, flabby belly protruded out from her body and strained against her set of tight-fitting blue scrubs.  Her thighs and belly jiggled as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to Danny and wrapped a device for measuring blood pressure around his arm.  She then set her hand upon his shoulder as she watched the gage in the device produce a measurement.  \"Looks good,\" she commented as she turned to a set of beeping and humming instruments to the side and typed a couple things.  She noted some things on a small pad of paper she carried in her left hand.  \"Now, you keep getting better, Danny,\" she said with a smile as she reached up and pated him on the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Danny could think is \"Get me the hell out of here!\"  Then, as Mindy touched Danny, something strange happened.  Danny's vision blurred, and he became dizzy.  Danny looked around, suddenly very aware that he felt different.  There was a substance to his form, a permanence that wasn't there before.  Danny blinked a couple times and held his hand to his head and tried to get his bearings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hel--\" Danny began, then he suddenly stopped.  His voice seemed very strange--higher pitched.  Danny blinked a couple times and looked down at himself.  What confronted him blew his mind.  He was huge!  A huge set of boobs jutted out from his body.  Danny reached down and grabbed one of them, sending a tiny and sudden wave of pleasure through his body.  His hand traveled farther down to his bloated belly and jiggly legs and hips.  He was now clad in the blue scrubs Mindy had been wearing.  He suddenly turned toward a mirror on the wall, thrown off by the sudden shift of weight--a lot of weight--and the new center of gravity.  What he beheld in the mirror was Mindy, her face bearing the same gaping, shocked expression that characterized Danny's own mindset.  \"Oh my god,\" he said quietly.  He had jumped into his own nurse's body.               </span></div></div>",

As soon as he thought about leaving the nurses body, Danny felt himself being pulled out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Danny was standing next to the nurse, who help her head with a frown on her face. Danny looked down at himself. His body was transparent, but looked just like he once had. Though he was completely naked, he didn't feel cold at all. In fact, he felt like he was giving off a strange warmth. Danny burned to look at his mother who had gotten up and headed towards the nurse, going straight through Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Mindy?\" Lisa asked, placing a comforting hand on the nurses shoulder. Danny thought it was interesting that his mom had passed right through him without getting taken over like the nurse. Maybe he could only jump into someone's body if he consciously wanted to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy nodded, removing her hand from her head and smiling reassuringly at Lisa. \"Yes, I'm fine. I with I knew what came over me. I usually don't swear\" she said. That was also interesting to Danny. Did she remember what Danny had done in her body, but believe that she was the one who did it? Danny would have to research his abilities more to know for sure, but he didn't want to do that here. He had to go somewhere else and get to the bottom of all of this. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overcome by the sheer tonnage of strange things assaulting his senses, Danny began to clumsily make his way to the door.  He stumbled toward it as his mother stood with Mindy in the hospital room and tried to calm the plump nurse, who struggled to understand why she had done things so out of her character.  Danny walked out into the hall and looked around at women in blue scrubs and men and women in white coats as they scurried about, summoned by the various beeps and buzzes of the instruments that filled the rooms of their patients.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. McWilliams,\" called out a male voice from behind Danny, \"did you read those scans?\"  Startled, Danny spun around to see a man quickly approaching him and yet addressing someone else.  The man seemed to look right past Danny as he walked toward the seemingly invisible boy.  Danny tensed up and braced for impact as the man neared him.  He just didn't have time to move.  \"No don't ru--\" was as far as Danny got before the man collided with him--except he didn't.  Danny was assaulted by a vast array of strange, other-worldly sensations as the man's body simply ran straight through his transparent presence.  Danny phased through the blue molecules of the man's button-down dress shirt and white doctor's coat, and then through the pudgy, gelatinous molecules of the man's fat-filled belly.  The feeling was a level of strangeness beyond explanation.  But as soon as it began, it stopped.  Danny phased through the man's body in a second or two.  He stood in amazement at what had just happened as he looked at the empty spot where the man had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Danny spun around to see what had happened to the man who had just gone through him.  Oddly, enough he had stopped too.  The man was taller than Danny, and he was also much fatter.  He seemed to be in his mid-60s, with a grey beard and white hair.  He had phased right through Danny without breaking a sweat, but then he stopped and spun around, looking in Danny's direction.  The man had a strange look on his face, as though he had some sense that somebody was there.  He looked around for the presence he had felt, finding nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill,\" called out a voice from down the hall.  The man spun back around.  \"Bill, what's wrong?\" The man turned back around as if to make one last attempt to see the source of his strange sensation.  \"Bill?  What's wrong?\" came the voice again.  Again, he spun back around.  \"Nothing,\" he said, uncertain of himself, \"just . . . . just something weird is all,\" the man said as he continued his journey down the hall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stood and watched as this unfolded.  Had the older man felt his presence as he passed through Danny's form?  He must have.  Danny stood for a moment.  He swallowed hard as he tried to mentally get his hands around all that had happened in the last few minutes.  He again stumbled toward a door at the end of the hall, trying the whole time to avoid having people step into--or rather through--his body, if body was even the right word for what he had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what's happening to me?\" Danny said as he stumbled on, walking on egg shells the whole time because he feared that bumping into the next human body might bring more strange (and perhaps scary) experiences.  Danny finally made it to the door at the end of the hall and simply phased through it.  As strange as it was, Danny figured it was better than phasing through a human body.  Danny hurriedly looked around inside the room.  The place had tile floors and tile walls and 2 mirrors and 2 sinks straight across from where Danny was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he said, his voice echoing a little bit.  People were probably as unable to hear Danny as they were to see him, but it was a matter of instinct to call out to someone.  Danny stepped farther into the room and saw several stalls lined up on the wall to his left.  This place was a bathroom.  There was probably a sign to that effect on Danny's way in, but, in all the commotion, he had missed it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walked slowly toward the mirror and looked into it.  He saw nothing--just the plain reflection of the floor and wall behind him.  \"Woah--\" Danny said as he looked down at his naked body.  He was still there, but not in a way that the mirror picked up.  It was a strange thing to behold a mirror with nothing in it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door that Danny had some through opened.  Danny quickly looked toward the door, startled by the sudden noise.  A woman strolled into the bathroom.  Danny suddenly looked down at his naked body--his dick dangling freely between his legs--and tried to cover himself instinctively.  He then quickly realized that he could not be seen.  \"This is too weird,\" he said as the woman entered the restroom.  Danny stepped back without a word as the woman neared him so she would not end up stepping through him.  The woman stepped up to the mirror and turned the water on, splashing some of it into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was a bit struck by this woman.  She was really quite beautiful.  She seemed to be about 40 years old, and long curly dark hair cascaded down from her head.  She had large breasts dangling from her chest and barely contained by a bright red blouse with a low-cut collar.  Her skin was somewhat dark.  At 40 years old, her features were not as tight and perfect as those of a 25-year-old, but this woman was still beautiful.  She had a couple small lines around her eyes, but still a beautiful smile.  The globes pushing out from her chest and straining against her shirt were perhaps her most notable feature.  Farther down was a belly that was in decent shape but, given the woman's age, had a bit of extra flab around it.  Truth be told, it was quite cute.  The woman bore a set of wide, child-bearing hips and a curvy, luscious ass that stuck out beautifully.  Her meaty thighs were contained by tight-fitting black pants that accentuated her curves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny snuck up close to the woman as she splashed some water over her face.  \"Been a long day,\" the woman mused to herself in the mirror as she refreshed herself.  Danny inched up to the woman with a sort of pensiveness and uncertainty common of a kid who was trying not to awaken a sleeping parent with an anger problem.  He tiptoed up to the woman and peered at her as she washed her face.  He looked at her, his eyes wide with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was very pretty.  Danny beheld the globes protruding from her chest and bouncing about as she moved. A devious smile spread across his face.  He was seeing something he quite certainly was not supposed to see, but the fact remained that this beautiful, curvy woman had no idea he was there.  Danny was not very tall, so he looked up at this voluptuous middle-aged woman from just about her boob level--not a bad place to be, really.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stepped back as the woman continued to fiddle with her face in the mirror.  She reached down into her purse and pulled out her phone, seeming to type something on the touch-sensitive screen.  Danny walked around slowly behind the woman.  \"Okay lady . . .don't have a lot of options here,\" Danny said as he slowly reached out his hand and placed it on the woman's shoulder.  His hand began to phase right through her tight-fitting red blouse and into her body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the woman jerked a bit, as though something had suddenly startled her.  She spun around, a couple stands of her dark hair falling over her face.  She held her phone in one hand and brushed her hair aside with the other as she gazed around the bathroom in search of the unnamed presence that had disturbed her.  Her eyes darted about but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny tensed up, holding his breath until the woman turned back around.  He exhaled mightily, a minor sense of calm restored.  The woman continued to toy with her phone.  A plan began to form in Danny's mind.  \"Seems like I won't be able to do much of anything unless I kick this up a notch,\" Danny said to himself as he began to reach out again toward the oblivious woman.  \"At least you're hotter than the nurse was lady,\" Danny said as he began to gingerly place his arms inside the woman's body.  He could see her tense up a little bit, but only for a split second.  Deciding it was best just to get it over with, Danny closed his eyes as he quickly made his way forward, forcing his naked form into the body of the unsuspecting woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's curvy, voluptuous form jerked and jiggled for a couple seconds as she tried to fight off the invading presence.  Her boobs jiggled as her bra and blouse struggled to contain them.  Danny's vision blurred a bit as he felt woozy and reached down to steady himself on the sink.  He looked down at a hand that was dainty and feminine--older too.  Danny looked down at his hand.  \"Oh my go--\" he began before he quickly placed the hand over his mouth.  His voice was foreign to him--higher.  His hand had a couple golden rings on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked farther down, his body confronted with an odd distribution of weight.  He could feel extra weight in his chest and hips.  He looked down and saw two grand lumps protruding from his chest.  He reached up and cupped the lumps, moaning with pleasure as he did.  He took his hands farther down and massaged a full, luscious ass.  He reached up and moved a few strands of black hair out of his eyes.  A smile crossed the face he saw now for the first time in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are new,\" Danny said as he looked down at the lumps on his chest with a smile.  \"Shannon?  Shannon, are you there?\" said a female voice from the woman's phone, which she had dropped into the sink as Danny took over.  Danny smiled as he reached down for the phone.  He held it up to his host body's ear and smiled.  \"Shannon's busy, honey,\" he said as he hit the red phone icon on the screen, ending the call.  He placed the phone back in Shannon's pocket and began to walk, hips swaying and tits bouncing, out of the bathroom.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny walked out of the bathroom and looked around the hospital with his newly acquired eyes. As he walked, he noticed the little things that made Shannon's body so different from his old body. He felt her wide hips swaying with every step that he took, and also felt the two large mounds protruding from his chest bouncing up and down. The absence between his legs was also a new feeling that Danny knew he would have to get used to, but suspected that he would never fully be able to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny walked through the hospital, he stopped just outside of the room where his own body and mother were in. Danny looked at both of them. It was so hard for him to comprehend that Danny had once been a 16 year old boy, but now inhabited the body of a woman that was closer in age to his mother. Danny continued walking, not wanting to arouse any suspicion. As he did, he realized that he knew next to nothing about the woman whose body he had stolen other than the fact that she was gorgeous and her first name was Shannon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, thinking her name triggered a whole bunch of foreign memories to flood into Danny's mind. Danny had to put one of Shannon's manicured hands on his head to try to quiet the headache that came with all of this knowledge. It was suddenly as if Danny was experiencing life as if he were Shannon. He remembered her graduation from high school, getting her job, making money. He also remembered that Shannon was single, choosing not to waste time settling down when she could be spending her time making money and only having short flings with guys when she wanted to. Because of that mentality, Shannon was fairly wealthy and living in a very nice upper scale neighborhood. Danny remembered that Shannon had been in the hospital because one of her coworkers had gotten sick and she had to keep him updated on the goings on in their company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny steadied himself out as the influx of memories slowed down. He took a deep breath in and out, feeling is large chest rising and falling as he did. Now that he had opened that floodgate into Shannon's memories, everywhere he looked was something triggering a thought in her head. That doctor looks like one of Shannons old boyfriends, that chair looks like the one in her living room, and so on. It was getting hard to keep track what memories belonged to Shannon and what memories were Dannys especially since the 43 year old Shannon had so many more memories than the 16 year old Danny did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny closed his eyes and concentrated on getting everything straight in his head. Once things were all in order, he continued walking, this time with a more confident strut in his step now that he had Shannon's experiences backing him. He exited the hospital and quickly found Shannon's car, a pink sports car that looked like it was worth more money than what the average person made in a year. Danny grinned stupidly as he got behind the wheel of the car and put the keys in the ignition. This was the nicest, and probably fastest, car that Danny had ever been in and now he was behind the wheel, while being int he body of a beautiful cougar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs excited as Danny was, being in this new body, he knew that he would need help in understanding what was happening to him. He tried to think of people that might be able to help him understand things and learn about his new abilities. Shannon's memories proved to be useless, but Danny remembered two teachers from his high school that may be promising. Danny's science teacher, Ms. Noble, had always been super nice to him. She was young, probably a good 20 years younger than Shannon's body, and in great physical shape but she was also a genius when it comes to science. If anyone could help Danny understand why this was happening to him, it was Ms. Noble. Alternatively, Danny's psychology teacher Mrs. Michaelson may be able to help as well. After all, Danny was currently in a very unfamiliar body, with plenty of unfamiliar memories running through his head. He would need a good psychologist to help him sort things out and keep him sane. Danny thought about all of this as he drove Shannon's car to his high school. About ten minutes later, Shannon's car was parked and the beautiful woman walked out of her car and into the high school, which had just let out for the day. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Danny made his way towards the school, students left the building to go home for the day. Danny looked around, seeing many familiar faces. But one in particular caught his eye. She was walking with friends on both sides and had a carefree smile on her face. Her long brown hair flowed down her back and her toned ships swayed with every step that she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy...\" Danny muttered in his stolen voice as he watched the girl walk by. Amy Weathers was the most beautiful girl that Danny knew, and Danny had had a crush on her for as long as he had known who she was. Amy was not only incredibly attractive, but she was also very smart, maintaining high grades in every class she took despite also having commitments of being an athlete in the spring and cheerleader in the fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his regret, Danny had never been able to work up the courage to talk to Amy for extended periods of time. As a result of that, Amy had barely known him. The few conversations that they had involved Danny muttering a few words under his breath and Amy giving him a friendly smile. She probably didn't even know his name. Suddenly. an idea formed in Danny's head. He could leave Shannon's body and take over Amy once she was away from her friends. If he did that, Danny would not only have easy access to his school (and the teachers within it that he wanted to get contact with), but he would also have the perks of being in Amy's body. Plus, since Amy was his own age, and thus had the same amount of memories as him, there would likely be less disorientation than he currently had with managing Shannon's memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy waved goodbye to her friends and headed to her car, Danny realized that he did not have much time. either he could leave Shannon's body and take over Amy, or he could continue into the school and seek out help from one of his former teachers. Possessing Amy would likely cause him to have to wait until after school tomorrow to start getting answers, but her body would likely be more pleasant for him than Shannon's. What to do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a quick thought, Danny quickly expelled himself from Shannon's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Shannon mumbled, looking quite disoriented as she found herself at the front of a school, and not in the hospital bathroom. She shook her head, started the engine and quickly drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny got himself together, and bolted after Amy. He felt like he had to take this chance. Everyone liked Amy, and he would probably have no problems asking weird questions. Plus, if he ever did get back to normal, he could use this chance to get to know her a bit better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon found himself in the air, effortlesly floating several feet off the ground, speeding in the direction he had seen Amy go. Danny soon spotted her stepping into her car - a small, red Toyota. He had to act fast, or she would drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny dropped himself into her car - through the roof, because why not - he saw Amy still fiddling around with something in her purse. She truly was quite beautiful. Long brown hair, slightly taller than him, very fit with a perfectly proportioned figure. Even in her school uniform - a grey collared shirt, black plaid skirt and black flats - Danny couldn't help but smile as he stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Amy's car springing to life brought Danny out of his stupor. He floated off the surface of the seat, swam his way over to her, and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Amy... I'm gonna borrow you for a little while...\" Danny whispered, and dropped his ethereal form right down into Amy's unsuspecting body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmf!\" Danny grunted as he opened his eyes. That had been quite a jolt. He was still in Amy's car, but couldn't see anyone else. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of his reflection in a small mirror above his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... it worked!\" Danny gasped. Reflected in the tiny mirror were the gorgeous brown eyes of Amy Weathers. And her nose, and her lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny lifted his hands - Amy's hands - and stared. This was surreal. He <i>was</i> his crush. This was so much different than being Shannon. Amy just felt... so much better. He peeked down at his new body, seeing Amy's perky breasts hiding under her school shirt. Quickly looking around to see if anyone was around, Danny gave them a light squeeze. Much firmer than Shannon's had been. His hands steadily, as if on their own, made their way down his new, distinctly feminine torso ans thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped himself. This wasn't right. This was Amy's body. How would she react if she found out? Shaking his head, Danny pondered his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, his plan here had been to ask around at school the next day. That involved spending the night... as Amy. As a girl... Danny blushed at the thought of having to shower in Amy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could try to visit his mother. She would be worried, and maybe he could comfort her a little. She was most likely still at the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny set the car in drive, and made his way to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny knew that he couldn't go visit his mother. Seeing her in the state that she was in would only make him upset, and even if he told her what his situation was, it wouldn't lead to anything good. Even if he could convince her in her hysterical state that he was really okay, not having a permanent body to return to would just keep hurting her. It was best to let her cope with having a son in a coma than having a son detached from his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he would have to return to Amy's house, Danny closed his borrowed eyes and began to concentrate. Just like when he was in Shannon's body, Danny did not have immediate access to Amy's memories. However, he'd much prefer getting himself acclimated now than have memories flashing through his head as he drove to her house. Suddenly, just like when he was in Shannon, Danny found his mind full of new information. He held his head as he experienced Amy's memories as if he had lived through them. After a few seconds he removed his hand and opened his eyes, breathing deeply as the confusion left him. Since Amy was considerably younger than Shannon, the process was quicker and a lot less disorienting since there were less memories to gain access to. Danny now knew everything there was to know about Amy and would be able to convincingly play her role as long as he remained in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this meant that Danny now knew everything that Amy knew about him, which was...not all that much. Amy knew Danny by face and was friendly enough with him to talk with him if the opportunity presented itself, but the two were in completely different social scenes and never got a chance to really get to know each other. Amy liked Danny enough to not dislike him or think he was creepy, but she didn't particularly have positive feelings for him either. Danny was just a boy that she knew, unlike that hottie Ryan Davis. Ryan was captain of the basketball team and boy was he good looking...wait, why was Danny thinking about that now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny pushed these thoughts out of his mind and started to drive, using Amy's memories to lead him home. Within ten minutes, Danny had successfully pulled into Amy's drive way and left the car. \"Wow...\" he said in Amy's voice under his breath as he saw the house in front of him. Amy's father was a very successful real estate agent and her mother was a prominent lawyer. Thanks to that, they had a very large estate in the nicest part of town which Danny had never even been to. Amy's memories told Danny that the house would be empty now besides the family maid, Francine. Amy's older sister, Kayla was in med school and her younger brother, Mason, was hanging out with friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny used Amy's key to open the door and walked into the house looking around awestruck as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. \"I can't believe I'm this loaded\" he said, hardly able to contain a smile on Amy's beautiful face. Danny could definitely get used to a house like this until he figured out how to get back into his body. Danny quickly made his way upstairs to Amy's room, locking the door behind him as he turned to face Amy's full-body mirror. A mischievous smirk grew on his face. \"Now, what should I do first?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny had some ideas about what he could do to help his out-of-body situation... but there were more important things he wanted to take care of first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance, he found himself staring into a mirror at the reflection of his gorgeous crush, Amy. And he was in control of her body. This was not an opportunity anyone had - like, ever. He began to slowly undo the buttons on his - well, Amy's school top, savoring the moment as his delicate, borrowed hands undid the small buttons, revealing bare skin and a black lace bra. The shirt was quickly thrown to the side as Danny began to drool over the sight waiting for him in the mirror - Amy, in a bra and school skirt, staring hungrily at him... well, herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt disappeared in seconds, leaving only undergarments and sheer black stockings on Amy's lovely body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think those have to go...\" Danny whispered in Amy's voice, as seductively as he could. He fumbled around behind his back for a few seconds, dropping the bra to the ground and freeing Amy's perky C-cup tits. He raised his slim hands to his newly discovered toys and let out a small squeal of delight as a pleasurable tickling sensation coursed through his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fondling Amy's chest with her own hands, Danny slipped off her tights and panties, leaving her completely naked in all her glory. After eyeing his reflection in the mirror some more, his eyes darted to the shower. He did have plans to go talk to people, after all. It wouldn't do at all for Amy to not be freshly washed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he walked his sexy naked form over to the shower and turned it on. He stepped inside and slid the shower door shut - it was translucent glass, so only a vague silhouette would be seen from the outside. The warm water flowed over his head and body, a feeling much more pleasant than when he usually showered. Little droplets of hot water tickled his now much more sensitive nipples, and Danny found his hands groping his lovely body yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, he felt that he might as well actually wash himself, and let Amy's subconscious dictate how that happened. As if by muscle memory, he plucked out the shampoo from a shelf, massaged his hair and washed it all out. He grabbed and soaped up Amy's loofah - a bright pink thing, figures, and rubbed all over her torso, arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time came to wash her nether region, however, Danny hesitated. He was still trying to be at least a <i>little</i> respectful - this was his crush, after all, and he was a decent human being. His decency was soon very much overcome by his hormones, with his male mind inside an already slightly aroused, very attractive female body leaving him at the mercy of his carnal desires. His right hand made its way down to Amy's hips and snaked its way down between her legs. He massaged the area around his... Amy's clit, even then reading into her subconscious to figure out how to make it feel better. He found the sweet spot, and began to feel a rising heat coming from his crotch as his thumb and forefinger moved in predictable motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sensual moan as the pleasure reached a peak, he plunged two fingers deep into his body's waiting pussy, unable to hold back any longer. He thrust his fingers back and forth while his body shook from the pleasure. He let out a scream the like of which he had never heard from anyone in real life, as an overpowering orgasm blasted his core and left his fingers all sticky. Danny felt content in the afterglow of his first female orgasm - and it was from Amy's body. He couldn't possibly me more thrilled at that. And a little ashamed, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly washing off his hands and drying himself, he re-dressed himself in something more casual. What was next?</span></div></div>",

The last thing she remembered was washing her face in the bathroom at the hospital and now she was inside her car in front of a high school. Shannon quickly started the engine and quickly drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was still staring at her; hoping that she wasn't too confused of the situation that occurred. Waving at her even though she couldn't see her, Danny turned around and hurried going into the direction Amy went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the school parking lot Danny saw with regret Amy sitting inside a small red car. Just as Danny wanted to take a step towards her, Amy started her car and drove off the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out his arm Danny knew it was impossible for him to catch up with Amy. Even though he was a in a ghost like state, he wasn't able to fly or do stuff like that. Amy was out of his reach for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant he needed to find someone else to be his host. Danny wasn't sure if there was a time limit for him how long he could stay outside his body and he didn't want to risk disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to see if he could find someone Danny saw out of the corner of his eyes Barry Drew. Barry was a burly, huge guy and not surprising a jock. He was a member of the swim team and while he wasn't the fastest swimmer he could still keep up with the rest. Would borrowing Barry's body be okay?</span></div></div>",

But he looked up when he heard some men's voices from the direction he had come from. Managing to walk in that direction, he saw three men dressed in dark suits outside his ward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere certainly weren't doctors or any other hospital staff, this was obvious. <i>Who the hell are they?</i> Danny thought. He couldn't hear what they were saying, so he decided to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to act as nonchalant as possible, Danny put every effort into walking like the woman he appeared to be. The high heels perched on 'his' feet however made this difficult. Still... he persevered, feeling his host's ample tits bouncing and her full ass swaying with each step he took he soon got to withing 'eavesdropping distance'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will he be in the coma?\" One of the men asked his colleagues..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's assuming he's in one. You know of the possibility that he's a 'walker'.\" One of the other men replied, his face expressionless as he removed his dark glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third man looked into the ward where Danny's injured body was located. \"We have to know if he is one. We should talk to the mother perhaps?\" He suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Danny had stopped at a water dispenser and was filling up a plastic cup. His eyes happened to stare at the mountainous cleavage he now possessed again, and the water in the cup overflowed, pouring on the floor. \"Oh... shit!\" He exclaimed in Shannon's voice, stepping back and looking at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three men turned briefly to look at 'Shannon', then returned to their little chat. Danny grabbed a few tissues from a box on a nearby table and crouched down to wipe up the water. As he did so, the tight black slacks he was now wearing pulled tight on his womanly ass and thighs. And with each swipe of the wad of tissues in his hands, his new DD-cup boobs jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Danny looked back up, brushing Shannon's hair from his face, the three men were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, who were those creeps?\" Danny muttered, as he stood up and threw the tissues in a waste paper bin. Drying his manicured hands on his feminine slacks, he set off to re-locate the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, he suspected they had been talking about him. He had to know why they were here, and what a 'walker' was? Tucked up inside his stolen body, he at least felt marginally safe for now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny walked through the sterile halls of the hospital as beeps and buzzes creeped quietly out of the patients' rooms as he passed them.  Shannon's well-endowed chest jiggled as her long dark hair bobbed, her curves drawing the yes of passing old men with their clumsy oxygen tanks.  \"Get an eye-full fellas,\" Danny chuckled quietly to himself, \"I'd be oogling this body myself if I weren't so worried about how to get out of it.\"  A minute or so of walking and jiggling about brought Danny to the end of the hall, where he turned sharply.  He ran his manicured hand through his hair as stress creeped into his mind.  He saw only orderlies and doctors and the occasional nurse, all scurrying about.  No creepy guys in black suits.  \"Fuck,\" Danny said to himself as he turned and headed for a darkened room down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny could feel his host's heightened emotions swirling about inside his borrowed body.  He couldn't tell how much of this was him and how much was the body--how much was Shannon.  He walked into a room with no lights on.  The place was quiet.  Because no patients were in the room, even the predictable and steady hum of the medical instruments was absent.  Danny walked right past the two beds and a couple nice sets of flowers (seemingly for absent patients) toward the window of the room, one looking out on to the expansive medical campus of the hospital.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny closed his eyes tight as he tried to control himself.  He could feel the tears welling up within him.  Two slowly made their way down from his eyes, smearing the make-up Shannon had labored to apply so beautifully.  Danny looked down at himself.  Jewelry adorned his aging hands, his fingers glittering with deep red nail polish.  \"Go figure,\" Danny mused as he beheld his stolen body, \"wake up a teenage guy and end up in the body of a 40-something woman with big boobs and an ass that would make any man druel,\" Johnny said.  \"I have to hand it to you Shannon,\" he said to the possessed woman, \"I could have picked a worse body,\" Danny said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine Shannon would like those big boobs of hers back, along with the rest of her body,\" came a voice from behind Danny.  He spun around quickly, his curvy body and jiggle-prone boobs throwing him off-balance briefly as a brief shriek of surprise escaped his lips.  Danny looked before him and saw, there in the darkness in the quiet of the (he thought) empty room, three men in dark suits.  Shannon's heart sped up as Danny's eyes darted among the three men in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first man appeared to be about 45 years old with dark, slicked-back hair and, despite the darkness of the room, sunglasses.  He seemed about six foot four and 180 pounds--a tall, thin man with a gaunt face and a plain expression.  His somewhat boney hands were folded neatly in front of him like those of an insurance salesman about to make a practiced sales pitch.  The second man was a little bit older--probably 50 or so, with salt-and-pepper hair and a bit of a beer belly peeking over the top of his well-maintained suit pants.  A pleasant smile adorned his face, though his eyes appeared dead.  It was though he either stared right through you, or he could somehow stare right at you and not even see you, or perhaps not care.  The third man was the one who had spoken.  He was the shortest of the three, and he was quite rotund.  A large flabby middle jiggled with each step as the man stepped forward as a white dress shirt and dark suit (common to all three men) strained against the man's sloppy girth.  He probably weighed about 300 pounds despite being only about five foot nine.  He was also the oldest of the three, probably being in his mid sixties.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marveling at the body you've just stolen is a give-away that it doesn't belong to you,\" the short, fat man explained, \"which means you must be Danny.\"  Danny gulped audibly.  His pampered, middle-aged vessel certainly was in no condition to take on three men at once, and Danny struggled to see how Shannon's body could fare well in a fight like this, to say nothing of what would happen to the body's occupant.  \"What do you want?\" he said weakly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To teach you,\" the fat man said, \"and to help you understand your powers.\"  Danny was able to slow his breathing a little bit.  \"For that, we'd like you step out of that body first,\" the man continued.  Danny cocked Shannon's head.  \"Why?\" he asked.  \"Because possession comes a bit later, and you'll find that prolonged time in a body that isn't yours, for you . . . well . . . has certain side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell did that mean?  Danny wasn't sure.  \"Concentrate,\" came the voice of the tall thin man as he stepped farther into the darkness, locked the hospital room door, and then returned.  \"Don't be afraid . . . we aren't here to hurt you,\" he said.  \"How do I know that?\"  Danny asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man with the beer gut spoke for the first time.  \"The way you see it right now, you're already half dead; what's the worst we could do?\"  Danny pondered for a moment.  Of course there were answers to that question, but the man had a point.  \"Say I believe you . . . \" Danny began, \"how do I get out of her body?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Concentrate,\" commanded the little fat man, \"feel her heart as it beats within you, then feel your own soul, you own being, as it separates from hers.  Just will it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny closed his eyes and tried to do as he was told.  It took a few seconds of trying, but after a bit, he began to a feel a certain lightness returning to his form, as if something had left him, or perhaps he had left it.  As Danny stepped back slightly and opened his eyes, he saw Shannon's curvy body begin to fall away from him.  He watched as her vaguely conscious form fell to its knees before him, her chest jiggling from the impact before she fell limply and roughly to the ground below, unconscious.  \"We should probably have gotten her a pillow first,\" the fat man said as he motioned the two other, younger men to pick Shannon up.  They did so and put her in a bed.  Her deep breaths indicated a rather deep sleep.  Apparently being possessed had been quite a shock to her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Arthur Blubman,\" the fat man said, introducing himself, \"and this is Charles Chrichton,\" Blubman explained as he motioned to the tall, thin man.  He nodded pleasantly.  \"I'm Arnold Futz,\" the stocky man said matter-of-factly.  Danny tried to take it all in.  \"Ok,\" he began, \"but where did all of you come from and, since I'm sort of a ghost, how the hell can all of you see me when I don't have a body?\"  Danny asked.  Blubman smiled pleasantly.  \"You basically do, though not as you knew it.  The body you used to  think of as yours is still in a coma a few rooms over.  Right now, you have have an astral body.  You exist, just on a different plane of existence, and you'll find that you body is made of a certain ecto-plasm common of other-worldly beings.  It's a bit more elastic than the skin and bones you're accustomed to,\" he explained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, and that's all real nice Artie, but how can you see me,\" Danny asked, bestowing a nickname, wanted or not, upon his companion.  \"We'll get to that later,\" Blubman declared.  \"Right now, I want to focus a bit on what you can do,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we already know you've got possession figured out.  Let's attempt something new.  Did you ever want to be someone else?\"  Blubman asked.  Danny thought about it.  He seemed nervous.  \"It's okay, Danny,\" he said, \"we know what you're, well, into.  We know you get excited by the idea of turning into other people--controlling them.\"  After a few seconds of apparent resistance, Danny nodded.  Glubman smiled.  \"Let's try it.\"  Danny nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, the sexy figure of Lisa Wilkins strutted sexily in a revealing dress of lacy frills toward the three men as she massaged her own breasts, cupping them so that the onlookers could see them rise and fall, jiggling wonderfully as they did.  \"Like what you see, boys?\" she asked as she delicately ran her hands over the bodies of the three waiting men, grabbing them and pulling them close to her, letting them feel her.  She felt them too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing quickened as she pulled Futz in for a passionate kiss.  He handn't felt this good in years.  Glubman waited with baited breath.  The last light was tuned out in the hospital room as the men waited would soon come to them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit later, the three men stood sweating in the darkened room of the hospital, the door locked as the tired but somehow energetic visage of Lisa Wilkins stood before them and oozed sex into every corner of the room.  Her youthful and exuberant body glistened with sweat as a devious smile crossed her face.  An ornate, regal dress of lace and frills hung from her body.  Her breasts jiggled and her ass shook wonderfully with her every step as she, panting, approached the plump figure of Arnold Futz, whose member stood fully at attention.  \"You look excited there, big fella,\" Lisa said as she took her hand and grasped his throbbing dick.  She guided her other hand up his pudgy belly and pulled him into a passionate kiss.  She leapt upon the middle-aged man and wrapped her beautiful legs around his waist as she forced his member into her body.  She thrusted again and again until he erupted into her and staggered back with a mere whimper as Crichton came next and was rocked by similar waves of pleasure.  Glubman was down for the count before the others; he lay in a heap of sweat and sexual joy over in the corner barely able to move.           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutz tried to keep it together as he struggled back to awareness.  The tired but beautiful body of Lisa Wilkins lay asleep on the hospital bed.  \"You picked the right body, Danny,\" Futz said.  Lisa's body just smiled and drifted off to sleep.  </span></div></div>",

She'd slept, her body tired out, straight through the evening and night and into the morning.  Thank God the door to the hospital room had been locked.  The three men sat slumped uncomfortably in chairs, tangled masses of sweat and lust.  Lisa slowly jarred herself awake, yawning quietly in the darkness as thin rays of sunlight began to peek through the clouds.  She stretched, her boobs jiggling as she forced her chest out and arched her back as it cracked a couple times, stiff from a night of rest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood and walked gingerly toward the room's lone window and gazed out it.  \"Beautiful . . . \" she mused as she looked upon the world waking below her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lisa felt a set of arms around her middle.  She jumped, a tiny shriek escaping her lips as strong arms enveloped her from behind and snaked around and interlocked on her belly.  \"Don't worry,\" came a male voice from behind--Futz's voice.  The pudgy man leaned in close to Lisa's ear as he reached his hands up and cupped the generous orbs hanging from her chest.  \"Last night was amazing,\" he declared quietly.  \"Well thank you,\" Lisa began, \"a girl's happy yo please,\" she declared as she turned around and caressed his bulging belly and pulled him in for a kiss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, the other two men began to stir.  Glubman coughed and shook sleep from his eyes as he struggled to pull his rotund, jiggly body out of the chair.  Crichton stood gracefully and stretched his tall, thin body a bit as he stood, towering over the other two men.  \"Good to see you both awake boys, though it was a pleasure to tire you out too,\" Lisa said, her hand reaching down and fingering herself briefly as a small wave of pleasure washed over her.  \"Great way to start the morning,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gazed at the three men as they stood before her, her mind wandering with the possible uses for her new powers.  \"You know what, boys?\" she began, \"I notice that my body draw some lusty gazes around here.  Yours, well, not so much,\" she declared.    \"Let's change 'em up, shall we?\" </span></div></div>",

Crichton himself ran his hands along his body, checking to see if he had been shot. Upon inspection he found himself to be fine, in fact much more than fine. As he attempted to call back out to Lisa he halted himself mid sentence, only managing to break half a chuckle in a rather oddly fitting high pitch voice he now possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCritchon looked back at the other men, seeing their amazed gaze bare down upon him as lise snuggly smiled from afar. Critchon reached his hands out into view, noticing their now more narrow and feminine appearance. He lowers his hands down to his hips, feeling the far more toned thighs he now adorned along side his slightly shorter height, his hands rand back up curving out as they met the soft fleshy mounds that now lay upon his chest. Crichton clutched his throat as his face now changed into that of a young beautiful blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laughed as the others watched in awe. \"Haha! Now the finishing touches and...\" Lisa declared as she pointed and pulled once more, causing critchon's clothes to alter into a dress with a scarf along the top, that of a so far jacket dress, a sense of fashion that would easily blend in during the 1920's. \"Oh I did always want a secretary...\" Lisa laughed, however she was soon interrupted by the men deciding to gauge crichtons new 'assets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged by their lack of focus Lisa now aimed her finger gun and pulled the trigger on glubman, with one shot he jolted two leaving the new feminine crichton and the third man to watch as a oddly excited gunman clutched his chest, ready and excited for what was yet to come. His mind began to race with what he would look like, his height changed, his hips swung out and his hands began to be filled by his new breasts as they filled out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunman opened his eyes at the slight draft, noticing himself now in a much more revealing outfit. A summer styled bikini, with a skirt on the bottom and a sun hat on top. Gunman juggled his new busty chest with a giggle as the new Hawley on his wrist mingled and mangled with his vibrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaned forward, watching as Crichton came over to gunman the two now feeling each other's forms as Lisa merly watched across the room.

His male hand, devoid of any injury or damage that one would expect to come from getting thrown over the hood of a car.  \"Oh... so that... was all a dream?\"  He thought, dropping his arm back down onto his lap.  \"Wait, what?\"  He asked, confusion speeding up his awakening.  He saw that his body was covered by light green and white sheets, unlike anything he had in his own home.  At the foot of his bed, he saw a small metal medical clipboard attached to its plastic frame.  He was in the hospital.  \"Wait, WHAT?!\"  He said, looking past the foot of the bed and seeing the three naked men passed out in a tangled mess of limbs in three of the four chairs around his bed.  Either he'd been drugged and raped by these older men, or... Danny concentrated, and after a few moments of struggling, managed to free his astral form from his physical body, his comatose form dropping out from beneath him while his spirit sat up in bed.  \"What... the fuck...\"  He said to himself, realizing that none of it was a dream.  Danny really had been hit by a car, really had been injected with crazy drugs, really could project his soul from his body, really could transform his body, and really had fucked those three guys after shapeshifting himself to look like his mother.  He had a lot of things to process right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was discharged the next week, not a single doctor in the entire hospital the least bit surprised about how he'd miraculously healed all of his broken bones and punctured organs in what had to be record time.  He wasn't sure if Artie, Arnie, or Charlie had anything to do with that, if the hospital had covered it up, or if both were in league with one another.  The hospital was the one who injected him with whatever it was that gave him his spirit powers after all, and had probably done so to other people judging by the nonchalance of the staff and the number of visitors that Danny had seen that didn't quite seem comfortable in their own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother, naturally, had plenty of questions about Danny's miraculous recovery, but was quickly silenced by enough medical jargon to fill several textbooks and seven syllable Latin-ish sounding words which the doctor seemed to invent as she went.  Lisa quickly accepted the confusing tangle of non-explanations that she was handed, just happy to have her son back alive and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, mostly well.  Danny still had to go to \"Private Physical Therapy\" twice a week until the hospital decided that he was fully healed and in no danger of damaging any of the pins, stitches, or metal plates that he literally didn't have but that his mother had been told that he did have.  In truth, these \"Private Physical Therapy\" sessions were just 3 hours of training his powers with, you guessed it, Arnie, Artie, and Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have gotten the hang of transforming into people you know.\"  Arthur said, sipping on a tall glass of lemonade as he watched you rapidly cycle your body between a collection of your friends and family.  \"Now let's try something new.  Let's try morphing into someone you don't know, or in fact, someone who doesn't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morph into someone that doesn't exist?\"  You ask, your form settling back on your original body dressed in baggy gym shorts and a tank top.  \"Like, a video game character or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Charles said, his cohort preoccupied with finishing off his drink.  \"No, that's still something that exists, it's just not real.  No, what we want you to try is to morph yourself into a being of your own creation, something that does not exist and is not known to anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds easy enough.\"  You say, concentrating on your body.  After a few minutes, however, you discover that it is not, in fact, easy at all.  Try as you might, your mind kept wandering as you shifted your form, your new body taking 'inspiration' from some person or character piece by piece until in the end you had just morphed into an exact replica of that person or character, not something of your own design.  You tried to clear your mind and visualize a new person, but every time you added a feature it reminded you of someone you knew who had that feature and the rest of the pieces just automatically fell into place.  \"Damn, that's really hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"  Arnold said, rising from his lounge chair into a sitting position.  \"It takes a lot of practice, which is why you're here.\"  He waits patiently as you try to come up with someone new, but try as you might you just kept ending up with copies of existing people, and even when you tried to play it off and pretend that whatever character you had just morphed into was an original character (do not steal!), the three men seemed to have a damn near encyclopedic knowledge of all things television, film, and even videogame, and called you out on your bluffs several times.  Either that, or they had a power that allowed them to detect what you had become.  After about your two-dozenth failed attempt, Arnold said \"You know what, maye we could try something a little easier first, to ease you into the concept.  Why not try... making a female version of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A female version of me?\"  Danny asked, rubbing some sweat from his morphed body, which had currently assumed the form of his Spanish teacher, Ms. Esposita, dressed in a pair of long sweatpants and a ridiculously thin shirt soaked see through with sweat.  \"Like a... Danielle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"  Arnold said.  \"Just think of yourself, and then try to imagine what you would look like if you were female.  Then, make the appropriate changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... okay.\"  Danny said, concentrating.  Danny pictured himself, short and thin, with short cut curly brown hair, big brown eyes, a somewhat athletic but not particularly muscular body, he wasn't exactly the most masculine specimen to begin with, and picturing himself as a girl came surprisingly easily.  His hair was lengthed a little around the sides, angular checks and thin lips were plumped up and puffed out a little bit, his already short stature was dropped two inches, his weight remained almost the same but with mass redistributed to fatten up his chest, thighs, and butt to cute and perky but not overly generous proportions, and before Danny even realized what he was doing he had become Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\"  Danny said, his voice several octaves higher both from excitement and from transforming into a girl less than half the age of the woman he had briefly transformed into.  \"Shit.\"  Danny said, realizing that in his excitement he'd forgotten to change his outfit to match his new body.  The sweatpants and panties designed to hold a plump, plus sized woman of forty slid down his narrow thighs and landed in a heap at hishis dainty ankles, exposing his pert butt and nearly exposing his new womanhood to his assembled audience if it weren't for the now massively oversized shirt dropping down just low enough to technically protect his frontal modesty, though the sweat soaked garment still left very little to the imagination.  Averting his gaze from the three chuckling men, Danny caught sight of the hospital's therapy pool, where their Private Physical Therapy Sessions had always taken place besides, and morphed his outfit into an adorable two piece swimsuit, complimented by short sandals and large red ruby studded earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, the three men...</span></div></div>",

Look at the way you stand.\"  He said, pointing to Danny's legs.  Danny looked down, but saw nothing wrong.  He was standing the way he always stood, but in a female body.  He was just female Danny, after all.  \"If you'd been a female from birth, you wouldn't stand like that.  It's an unnatural posture for someone with your body's proportions, and while it wouldn't be a dead giveaway at a glance, it would subtly put off people who observed you for a long time.  Uncanny valley and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So?  It's not like I'm a spy or something.\"  Danny replied, awkwardly adjusting his stance to be more 'girly' and completely overcompensating, forcing his body into uncomfortable and unbalanced poses that left him stumbling around the poolside in his feminine footwear, the three men smirking as he did so.  \"Wait... are you guys trying to make me a spy or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we've got much...\"  Charles started, then stopped when he realized that he probably shouldn't play the group's hand quite yet.  \"No, we're just trying to help you reach your full potential.  You've made quick progress with your powers so far, learning to possess people on your first day was un...\" he stopped himself again, his excitement nearly getting the better of him.  \"It surprised us.  But you've still got a lot to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how to change your bearings.\"  Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or your thoughts.\"  Arthur said, knocking back another glass of lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bearings?  Thoughts?  What the hell are you guys talking about?\"  Danny asked, his attempts to find an acceptable stance halted as he stamped his smaller, lighter foot into the ground, grinding his sandal against the tiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What are you wearing?\"  Arthur asked, his tone rhetorical and a little condescending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  Danny asked, looking down and expecting to see that he'd accidentally transformed his outfit in his frustration.  Seeing that his perky chest and wider hips were still covered by the purple swimwear he'd fashioned for himself out of Ms. ------'s gym getup, Danny answered with visible confusion painted across his cute, rounded face \"A bikini?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"  Arthur said, nodding.  \"But what IS it?  What design is it?  What color?  What are the pieces called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"  Danny scratched his short curly hair.  \"I dunno, two piece bikini?  It's a... purple two piece bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, Sherlock!  Next you're going t tell me that those things in your ears are earrings!\"  Charlie said, nudging Arnie and chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are!\"  Danny said, his confusion turning to indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  And a FIAT 124 and a C4 Corvette are both cars, but I think we can all agree that they aren't the same thing.\"  Charlie said, Arthur nodding in agreement while Arnold stared blankly at the remark.  \"If you want to really hone your powers, own whatever body you're in, you have to be able to change the way your mind works on the fly, to stop thinking like Danny and start thinking like whoever you're trying to be.  In this case, you've got to morph Danny's brain into Danielle's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morph my brain?\"  Danny asked, skeptical and nervous.  \"That sounds... dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly.\"  Arthur said, speaking as though he had experience.  \"So long as you remember not to forget who you were.  Projecting your spirit out of a body will automatically reset it, so as long as you can remember how to do that you needn't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...K...\"  Danny said, not sure he had completely deciphered the crazy old man's remark.  Sighing, Danny took a deep breath, and focused his powers on changing his mind to match the body that housed it.  He focused, channeling all of her energies on making... wait, her!  Dannyl focused harder, hes body wobbling and her thoughts going fuzzyforamomentas they rearranged all themselves.  She fell to their knees, clutching Danielle's head as the conflicting sets of thoughts threatened to melt their mind, but after a few minutes the last of her ideas were sorted.  Danielle rose, her pose confident and joyful.  \"Hello, gentlemen.\"  Danielle said, her voice the same as Danny's had been in her body but her tone distinctly more... her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Danielle, how are you.\"  Charlie asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing pretty well, I think.\"  she said, strolling over to them with a sway in her hips and a stride in her steps that Danny completely lacked.  She watched their eyes, saw how their expressions changed, their analytical stares and cheeky smirks tainted with lust as they saw the nubile teen strut her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that.\"  Arnold said.  \"So, care to tell us about that outfit of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle looked down, pinching the fabric of her top and pulling it out slightly.  \"Oh this old thing?  It's a deep lilac halter and scoop bottom combo, might be a bit thick for a girl my size but I think they just go so well with my ruby drops, don't you?\"  She said, tilting her cheek to the men and flaunting the ridiculously thick blood red gemstones dangling from her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you... Danny certainly chose well for you.\"  Arnold said, chuckling nervously.</span></div></div>",

But he felt the need and desire to find out more despite the danger those men could pose for him and his family, \"Where did those creeps go?\" He mumbled and looked around the hall teeming with activity as patients and nurses casually stroll about the madness that is the floor of a hospital as the air fills with the mixed moods and chatter between patience, families, and staff under the barrage of beeping and telephone ringing. It's no wonder the men in black, no matter how big and bulky they were could slip out from Danny's line of sight, especially with his mind being distracted by the bounce and wobble of his boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny, still unaccustomed to the full motion of walking in heels made it very certain that he wouldn't trip or or worse bump into someone and loose the mount of skin he is wearing for more than just transportation, but protection from those men roaming the same halls he...she is while soaking in the heavy weight that is his heavy ass cheeks jiggling along with her chunky fat laden thighs with every awkward heavy clack of her heels against the floor while keeping her his manicured hands place directly against his swaying hips to avoid grazing anyone, even if he felt like he had some kind of control over his ability to stay in a host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could they be...They couldn't have moved to far in the span of my spilling my boobie w-spilling my water and chatting outside of my room?\" He mumbles to himself with his eyes scanning what rooms are left open and even the small waiting rooms leading to a specific doctors office and yet, there isn't a single trace of the men...growling in frustration which soon washes away from the odd pleasuring sensation of his globes of fat smacking against his chin wafting up some of Shannons vanilla like scent sticking to the light dark skin of her body. \"Wait, shit I should've went to check on my body first...they could be in there investigating mom right now!\" she tries to shout beneath her breath while looking over her own shoulder, shaking her head hard sending the soft straighten hair of her head flying about, \"No no, you already checked there Danny, they can't be too far off from he-\" He halts all his motion upon entering the main lobby of the hospital with it's rows of worn out waiting seats and patients or visitors waiting patiently to be called up for either a visit or for their prescriptions for the windows on the far side of the lobby displaying ticket numbers and names on a digital display while ceiling mounted televisions attempt to provide some entertainment for the bored guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what catches Danny's attention, besides the wall of noise and gusts of air slipped past the electronic doors of the hospital sliding open for more guest to enter was the sight of the mysterious men in black, or at least two of them sitting calmly with their backs turned to her within the crowd of ill and impatient, their third member, \"Fuck me, there they are!\" Danny shouts, clapping her hand over her plump lips as the attention of a few ill men look up from their stupors to the voluptuous cussing woman tat is Shannon, twisting within her belly as she watches one of men in black flinch, thinking quickly she quick stepped forward and plopped her heavy ass into the uncomfortable waiting chair with her breast bouncing and jiggling against her chest nearly slipping out from her cherry red blouse as Danny snagged a magazine off the sleeping man next to her, flipping it open and crossing her warm legs over one another to look natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" one of the men hummed, peering over his shoulder slightly to the sudden rush of noise before shrugging it off as white noise from the crowd around them, clearing out his throat once again to speak, \"Still, what makes you so certain this boy could potentially be a 'walker'...as far as we can go off from the Doctor, the boy is in a near brain dead state?\" He asks, slowly running his hand over the big bald spot that is his forehead as the other man sinks within his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats the issue, it's the conflicting report of the doctors under our payroll, some say they picked up signatures of thought with our device while others dismiss it as a slight nervous tick from his brain. It doesn't help that our premature arrival has caused the staff some discomfort and disruption to the examination process...in short I'm going off a hunch.\" He says, his voice near monotone but with what could be picked up through the bustlign crowd of people with Danny's ears he sounds a bit worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man reaches within the breast of his suit and yanks out a velvet handkerchief to tab the grease of his forehead, \"You do know we're not paid to operate of hunches, in fact doing so could have us marked.\" He says, looking over the empty seat next to him, \"We're already risking using an enlisted Walker to watch over the boy and his family, that's not cheap you know?\" He asks, Danny feeling a bit more relaxed in his skin upon hearing their chatter and their ignorance of her spying, something about how they spoke despite being cold and sterile made them feel a bit more human regardless of their appearance, possibly due to their concerns and manner of speech. \"Spy on me, thats not good...at all but what the hell is a walker? what am I?\" He mumbles while looking past his valley of tan fat cleavage obscuring much of his magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know the risk, and Im going to try to take the brunt of it, however as stated we've made ourselves too known to the staff potentially ruining what info we can get, so using the rookie is our best mode of action for the time being, besides I've informed him of who he is to wear and what matter to operate.\" He says, sitting up straight within his seat before tilting his head up. \"I'd much rather leave no stone upturned, especially if we can nullify his abilities early or if he is able to recover from his comatose state, then make and offer....Besides I do believe the time of talk is over her comes our boy.\" He says, readjusting his tie, Danny's ears perking up as he slowly raises his eyes up from the magazine, heart thumping heavily and his belly turning and twisting painfully to whomever could be coming to greet them, what did they mean by the third man being a walker, could he to do the same thing as him!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lisa squints at the pair before glancing over to Danny's direction, her eyes piercing directly through him as the two's eyes meet.

Lisa's own generous boobs, the stuff a lot of boys dreamed of, jiggled in their lace prison as she walked. \"Excuse me Nurse, is something wrong?\" Lisa asked. She could see how the overweight hospital employee was grabbing at herself, as though her own podgy body was alien to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turned around, his jaw still agape. \"Mom!? What's happening??\" he asked, noticing how feminine his voice now was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what?\" Lisa frowned intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me mom, it's Danny!\" Danny said to his tearful mother. I don't know what the hell is happening to me, or... why I'm inside this body. How did it happen?\" Danny was full of questions that he didn't stop to think of his mother's reaction to a nurse suddenly calling her 'mom'. He stopped spewing forth the questions when he saw the worried expression that had begun to form on his mother's pretty, mature face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a joke?\" Lisa mumbled, starting to sound a little angry as well as distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, mom... it's me, I'm Danny, it's just... I've entered this woman's body and I don't know how. You have to believe me!\" Danny insisted, as he began to feel incredibly uncomfortable in such an overweight body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling a doctor. I'm in no mood for sick jokes after what's happened to my son.\" Lisa growled, motioning for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny reached forward with one of his flabby arms and grabbed his mother's wrist, holding on tight. \"I'm telling the truth mom, seriously!\" he stated. He then went on to give his mother's middle name, Louise, which hardly anybody knew, and he told her what they had for dinner last night. Several other recent and distant memories that Danny could think of flooded out of the possessed nurse's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa halted her efforts to wrestle free of the nurse's grip, and she stared long and hard into \"Mindy's\" eyes. \"Danny...?!\" she uttered in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom, god it's me. I was shouting to you all the time I was lying in the bed, but you couldn't hear me, god I was so scared...\" Danny released all his emotions at once. Tears began to trickle down Mindy's face as Danny lost control of his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweetheart I... I don't know what's happening, or why you're in that body. But things will be all right, I promise.\" Lisa said, still having a hard time believing the large woman in front of her was housing her son's 'spirit'. When she was younger, Lisa had dabbled in the Ocult a little, even a little witchcraft, but following the deaths of several close friends and her inability to contact them, she gave up her interest in the spirit world. Her encounter with her son inside another person's body reawakened that interest in one swift movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay in this body, I just... can't.\" Danny shook his head, feeling Mindy's long blonde hair shifting around his neck and shoulders. The scrubs he had on did very little to hide the shape of Mindy's large body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hesitated for a moment, then sighed. \"H-how did you get in there?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shrugged Mindy's shoulders. \"I'm not sure, I just thought.. I wanted to get the hell out of here, then suddenly... blam... I jump into this body.\" he answered his mother's question with some uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you focus enough, maybe you can leave her.\" Lisa suggested to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny gave his mother an uncertain stare. \"And go where? Back into my crippled body? I can't move or speak in there, I may as well be dead.\" he said, starting to panic again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to have her son back with her, at whatever cost, Lisa gave the situation some careful thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should..,\" Lisa said to the possessed nurse, her tear-streaked face hardening with resolve, \"Danny, you should possess me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already strange enough controlling Mindy, Danny thought, but being his own mother? That's too much... it'd be so weird! Still, his mother had a point.. who else could he be right now, where it wouldn't seem odd to want updates every second about his condition? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned he wouldn't be able to talk to his mother and ask for guidance after taking her over, Danny asks her what to do, again with Mindy's voice, \"O..okay. I will for now. But who else can I take over later? How can I talk to you if I am you?\"<br>\r\nLooking into the eyes of the nurse that Danny accidentally possessed, Lisa, obviously just as nervous about the thought of being possessed as Danny is about possessing her, tells her son, \"You can use the phone. Write text messages to me. The pass code is 5937. Just... just take me to a bathroom, or somewhere private, and we can talk using the phone. Check in with me as often as you need. We'll figure the rest out as we go. Okay? Let's do it right now. I want you to be safe.\"<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we see if you remember anything before I do? Or Mindy?\" Danny asks, \"What if she remembers this conversation?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's test it right now. Try to concentrate on leaving Mindy's body. I'll go to the bathroom outside and clean up my makeup. Watch Mindy after you dispossess her and see what she remembers.\" With that, Lisa starts to walk out of the room, pausing for a moment to turn around, smiling sadly at her son before telling him, \"Danny, I'm glad you're okay. We'll get through this. Together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit... holy shit, I'm going to take over my mom's body. This will be the weirdest thing I've ever done..\" Danny thinks to himself. Alone with his comatose body and nothing to do but leave Mindy's overweight form, Danny does just that. Mindy blinks, and looks around, confused.<br>\r\n\"Where did.. where did Mrs. Wilkins go? What happened?\"<br>\r\nAssured that Mindy remembers nothing, Danny heads off to the bathroom, telling himself \"Better get back to the room before Mindy starts worrying about where mom went..,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating over to the bathroom, Danny sees the door is closed and says \"OCCUPIED.\" Seeing as he is a ghost, and not sure how to get in, he decides to just walk through the door. To his surprise, it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of the bathroom stands Danny's mother Lisa. She's looking at herself in the mirror, fixing her makeup with shaky hands, clearly nervous. Danny decides to stand behind her and watch while she finishes. \"She has no idea I'm here...,\" Danny thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her makeup, Lisa waits a few more moments, and then talks to the \"empty\" room. Her voice is quaking as she speaks. \"Danny.. are you in here? It's okay to do this. We need to get back to the nurse, and find out more about what happened to you. I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan Danny do it? Can he possess his mother's body, and pretend to the world that he's a 45-year-old woman named Lisa Wilkins?</span></div></div>",

Feeling that there really was no other option right now, before him stood the woman he needed to possess. His own mother, Lisa Wilkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I possessed Mindy just by walking into her. I guess it's probably the same for mom...\", Danny thought to himself, terrified about what he was about to do. Steeling himself, Danny slowly stepped forward, and into his mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny saw the world go white and heard a high-pitched ringing. He felt muscles twitching, and then his vision returned, and the ringing faded. Looking into the mirror, Danny locked eyes with his mother Lisa, and quickly realized that he was peering into his own reflection. He had done it. He had possessed his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my g...,\" Lisa started, pausing in surprise as though she had never heard her voice, \"This is really happening. Mom, are you in there? Can you see this?\" Danny-as-Lisa asks, even though he knew from his experience with Mindy that his mom was totally someplace else, and he was the only consciousness piloting her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMystifying as the experience was, Danny decided that he really needed to get back to the nurse. \"I can get used to this once I'm back in the hospital room..,\" the possessed Lisa muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny started to walk out of the bathroom, he felt an immediate and completely new sensation. His possessed mother was wearing high heels, meaning that he was now wearing high heels. Turning back to the mirror and noticing for the first time what his mother was wearing, Danny couldn't help but laugh. Hearing his mother laugh instead only added to the weirdness he was already feeling.<br>\r\n\"Of all the days to meet your friends for lunch, mom...\" Lisa said, still sounding like she'd never heard her voice before a few moments ago.<br>\r\nDanny knew that every now and then, his mom liked to meet her friends for lunch. Being a relatively wealthy woman, inevitably this meant she would dress up for the restaurant they went to. Today, the day of the accident, just happened to be the same day that this lunch happened.<br>\r\n\"Now I have to spend all day wearing this.\" complained Lisa, \"I can't even walk in these shoes.\"<br>\r\nTaking a good long look in the mirror for the first time, Danny realized just how strange this day was going to be. Before him stood his mother, Lisa Wilkins, wearing a frilly floral top, a pure white pencil skirt, very sheer nude hosiery, and black patent pumps. \"Jeez mom, I wouldn't even be able to tell you were wearing the tights if I wasn't the one wearing them myself right now...\" Lisa said, running her hands down her pantyhosed legs like she was double-checking what she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I even try?\" Danny thought to himself, \"I could just possess random people as they walk by and check on myself. I don't even know how I'm going to walk in these things, let alone sit down in these clothes all day and pretend to be mom...\"</span></div></div>",

Danny turned, very much aware of all the new things he was carrying around on himself, and watched as a tall man walked in, followed by a young woman. The man looked to be in his mid forties, and was wearing a white labcoat over a grey sweater and navy blue slacks. His hair was black, with some traces of grey. The woman was likely an intern, in her early-mid twenties, also wearing a white lab coat over what looked to be a plain dress. She was reasonably attractive, not overweight but not exactly slim either, with large but proportionate breasts. She was holding a clipboard and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Wilkins?\" The man asked. Danny saw as his mother nodded. \"I'm Dr. Elrich, and this is my assistant Allison. We're sorry about what happened to your son, but you can be sure we're doing everything we can for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's mother nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy, how's he looking?\" Dr. Elrich asked. Danny stood, still staring at the mirror, blank expression on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er. Ahem.\" The doctor coughed. \"Mindy, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny, realizing that it was him the doctor was talking to, responded. \"Oh. Sorry, I'm not feeling so well. Danny here is fine though, everything looks good. I've entered it in the system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. Thanks Mindy. If you're feeling off, you should go rest. You were nearly done for the day anyway, right?\" The doctor said. He seemed like a nice guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah. I think.\" Danny stammered and headed towards the door. \"I'll be going then. Bye mo... Mrs. Wilkins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Wilkins, I have a question for you.\" Danny heard the doctor ask as he was leaving. \"Usually we have to ask the patient, but in this case. Do you mind if Allison observes as I examine your son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, Danny noticed his mother nod. He closed the door behind him and wandered aimlessly through the pristine white halls of the hospital. He occasionally saw a nurse or an intern running down the halls, but for the most part it was rather quiet. He managed to find what looked like a break room - at least, it had coffee and a microwave - and plopped down on a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on...\" Danny sighed, thoroughly confused with the events of the day so far. After sitting at the table for what felt like ages, he got up - it was harder than usual, as Mindy was a bit overweight. Danny stumbled to the door, realizing he had no way to get home. He had no idea what car Mindy drove - if she drove at all. His only chance of going anywhere was to talk to his mother. So, he tried to remember where his body was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking through the halls, he finally spotted a familiar sign. It was just a silly motivational poster with a cat hanging off a tree branch, but he needed any motivation he could get. Plus, he remembered it being right there when he had left the room the first time. Danny made his way up to the sign, and noticed that the door to his room was slightly open. He edged towards it, and pushed it open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, another hand reached from the other side of the door to open it. The other hand slightly touched his, and he felt a wave of dizziness go through his body as his vision swam. He closed his eyes and reached a hand to the wall to steady himself. The dizziness abruptly faded, leaving him leaning on the <i>inside</i> of the room he was trying to get to. He also felt... significantly lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shook his head and turned around. In the mirror on the wall, he saw that he had accidentally jumped into someone else's body.

You were going to pick him up this time, because his mom got called into work last minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny?\" His mother whispered. \"Oh my God... but how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran up to try to hug him, but Danny stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait.\" He said. \"Something weird is going on with me... whenever I touch someone, I end up in their body. First Mindy the nurse, now Allison the intern... and I'd rather be able to talk to someone I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother hesitated. \"Oh, alright. Well, let's get you home. Well, to Allison's home. Can't just go back to your old life in that body, can you? People would ask questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny agreed, but wasn't thrilled to be stuck as Allison. But, he thought, it was better than a coma. He dug around in his pockets and found a key. He figured it was from a locker, probably one of the ones he had seen in the break room earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec, let me find Allison's stuff.\" Danny walked over t the break room, and stared at a wall of lockers. Which was te right one? He looked at the key, and noticed some numbers engraved in it. 127. He opened the matching locker, took out a small black handbag, and said to no one in particular, \"Well, that wasn't too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his mother, who was waiting outside his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where am I taking you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny rifled through the bag and found a purse with a driver's license in it. \"Allison Jacobs, 2578 Eastwind Drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't too far. Let's go, then\" his mother said, and the two walked over to her car. Danny sat and put the seat belt on... over his breasts. He had never had to do that before, and it was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a small townhouse in a quiet area, and Danny dug another key out of Allison's bag and opened the door. It was pretty cozy, and the two of them entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking... are you going to be alright on your own for a little while?\" Danny's mother asked him. \"I can stay here with you for a bit if you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. This is all still a huge shock\" Danny replied. He would definitely appreciate his mother's company... but, he thought to himself while sneaking a glance down at the covered mounds on his chest, there were some things he wanted to do... alone. \"I should be ok, but I would appreciate your company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother seemed to notice where his eyes had gone, and smiled. \"Now Danny, don't go disrespecting that girl's body now, remember it isn't yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's an idea, though. If you're not comfortable here... you could maybe join our staff while we figure this out?\" Danny's mother suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in, you want me to try to jump into one of our maids?\" Danny asked? \"I never wanted this... I don't know how I feel about jumping into someone on purpose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would mean you could go home and no one would ask any weird questions. Of course, I wouldn't make you actually do any work...\" his mother continued. \"Think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" Danny thought.</span></div></div>",

At least he was going to be closer to home. But... all the family staff were women. His father had made sure of that, for his own reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Danny thought to himself, \"I have been a woman for a bit of today and it's been fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Danny realized something. He was in the body of a cute girl, although almost 10 years older than him, and he had just under an hour until his mother got back. He immediately rushed to the bathroom. Eventually he found it. and stood in front of the vanity mirror, smiling. Allison was rather attractive. Mid-length, brown hair that was tied back in a ponytail, brown eyes and dimples when she smiled. Danny looked at his reflection, at the things guys were generally more interested in. Behind the buttons of Allison's plain grey dress were a large, but proportionate set of breasts. Danny gave them a good squeeze, letting out a sharp breath of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of this dress...\" he muttered, and began the process of unbuttoning the front of Allison's dress. Underneath the dress he caught sight of a black bra - nothing special - and Allison's bare stomach. He slipped the shoulders of the dress off, and watched as it fell to the floor, revealing more of Allison's underthings - in this case, matching black panties. Danny took a step back and began to pose. She was definitely cute, he thought. He could have some fun being in a body like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands began to caress Allison's bare body, and he watched his reflection out of the corner of his eye. With a mischievous look in his eyes, he bit his lip - Allison looked quite hot like that - and moved to unclip the bra he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny fumbled for a few minutes, getting the hang of the hooks, and then dropped the bra. He stared at his reflection, seeing his first real life pair of breasts. And they were <i>his</i>. Not the way any guy expects to see them, but Danny wasn't going to let that stop him. He stroked them, relishing the tickling feeling he got from his nipples. He reached down to his hips to remove Allison's panties... and caught sight of a digital clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" he exclaimed. His mother was supposed to be back any minute, and she wouldn't be happy with what he had been doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the bra, struggling to put it back on - eventually he got it - and pulled the dress back up. Frantically buttoning it up again, he made his way to the door, breathing a sigh of relief that he had put all of his clothes back on just seconds before he heard a car pull up. He looked out the window and saw someone getting out of the car. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Struggling to get himself together in time for his mother to walk up to the door, Danny fidgeted with the buttons on his borrowed dress. He didn't want his mother to even suspect that he had taken it off, let alone anything else. Seemingly successful, he waited anxiously by the door as she walked up, followed by Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa Corres was one of the maids working for his household. Short, tan, with an immense rack (they had to be DD's at least), her uniform usually consisted of a low-cut black-and-white shirt that did not hold in her chest anywhere near sufficiently, as well as a wide white skirt and black stockings. Today, though, she was not in uniform and was wearing a yellow sweater and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew.\" whispered Danny. If he was to 'jump into' Rosa, he didn't want to deal with her massive tits as well. As fun as they were to look at, and probably play with, he did not want to worry about accidentally having them escape the tight confines of her top while he was in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was a knock at the door. Danny opened it, and saw his mother standing there with Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa, this is Allison. She's looking after Danny at the hospital.\" Danny's mother said. Then, with a slight smile, she added. \"Allison, this is Rosa. She's one of my maids and a close friend of Danny's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for taking care of Danny, Miss Allison.\" Rosa said in her light Mexican accent, and reached out her hand. \"It's great to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, Rosa.\" Danny said, feeling a little weird. Then, he reached out and clasped Rosa's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar dizziness gripped him again as he felt himself <i>transfer</i> from Allison's body into Rosa's. He withdrew his new hand and stepped back behind his mother, very conscious of the additional weight he now had on his chest. Rosa was significantly more endowed in the chest region than Allison, and was a good several inches shorter as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... \" Allison said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Allison?\" Danny's mother asked. \"You're looking a little faint. You should get some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Wilkins? Huh?\" Allison said, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the last person to leave Danny's room before me, and mentioned you were feeling dizzy. I drove you home.\" Danny's mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... um, thankyou.\" Allson replied. \"But my car is at the hospital still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, get some rest. Here's my card, give me a call when you need a ride and I'll have it arranged. Any time at all.\" Danny's mother handed Allison a card with her number on it. \"Thanks again for looking after my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sure.\" Allison, still a bit confused, answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we must be off. Was good to meet you today, Allison.\" With that, Danny and his mother left Allison's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny sat in the passenger seat of his mother's car, a black 4-seat BMW, and wondered about what was happening to him. He had definitely felt the transfer, that time. Maybe he could learn to control it? Only jump into someone if he wanted to? Or, even better, not need to touch someone to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,\" he asked, noting that he was speaking with Rosa's accent. \"Why Rosa? Why not someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honey,\" his mother began. \"You know Rosa pretty well, she's the youngest of our staff, and she lives on-site. It just felt really convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But did you tell her I was going to possess her?\" Danny asked, but he figured he already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't. Do you think she would have volunteered her body to a teenage boy?\" his mother smirked. \"You two may be close, but she does notice you staring at her chest, you know. Besides, don't tell me you didn't try to check out your nurse intern while I was gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny remained silent. So she knew. Then again, she was his mother, and he was a teenage boy. Teenage boys tended to have one thing predominantly on their minds, and he was no different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you didn't do anything <i>too</i> weird, though.\" his mother said. \"Anyway, it's late. You should be going to your quarters. Well, Rosa's quarters. I'll drop you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny nodded, and left the car when his mother dropped him off. Rosa's place was only a small one, at least compared to his parents' estate. Only a one bedroom apartment, but conveniently on the grounds of the estate. He had been here before, and wandered into Rosa's bedroom. He sighed. This had been a very strange day. First the accident, then his time in other people's bodies... Why couldn't he have just had a normal day, hanging out with his friend Tony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was an idea. What if he jumped into Tony? He could share this with his best friend, definitely. He was sure his mother could convince Tony's to let him come over for a few days. He could learn how to use his powers... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr there was the more simple, more immediate option. His mother was right about him checking out Rosa. And now he <i>was</i> Rosa. He could check her out <i>any way he wanted</i>...</span></div></div>",

In some weird cosmic twist of fate, Danny had somehow left his old, currently dormant body, for the body of this unfamiliar, overweight nurse. Danny looked back at the mirror, still struggling to accept his new reflection. Gone was his curly hair and thin figure, now replaced by Mindy's long black strands and practically obese body. Not in a million year could Danny believe what he was seeing in the mirror was actually him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This...\" Danny mumbled, placing Mindy's hand on her face \"This has got to be a dream,\"But Danny could tell this was real. He could feel his hand upon his face, he could feel Mindy's scrubs straining to contain his body, and most importantly, he could feel how freaked out he was. Danny understood this was actually happening and that now he was trapped inside a fat nurse's body. <i>Well, maybe not trapped</i> Danny thought as he tried calmed down, <i>If I got into this body, maybe there's some way to get out it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Mindy?\" The concerned voice of his mother broke Danny's train of thought, \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uhhh...\" Danny stuttered, the craziness of what had happened to him caused him to completely forget his mother was still in the room. Improvising, Danny did his best to say something that a nurse might say, \"Oh, I'm sorry mo, I mean, Mrs. Wilkins. I'm just a little tired, you know, long shifts and all that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, alright,\" Lisa said, convinced by Danny's made up story, \"So how is my son doing? The doctor didn't tell me anything other than that he's stable, and that's really not much to go on. I'm just asking, from your professional opinion, is my son going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mrs. Wilkins, I...\" Danny as going to make something else up to satisfy his mother, but the look of desperation her face made him do otherwise, \"Well, from my own personal opinion, I think he's going to be alright. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually he'll pull through. I don't think there's anything you got to worry about, Mrs. Wilkins,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god, that so good to hear!\"Lisa practically yelled, as she grabbed Danny's hand, \"Thank you so much Mindy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, don't mention it\" Danny suddenly felt dizzy and his vision became blurry, similar to what happened to him when Mindy touched his comatose body. When Danny's vision became clear again, he was confused to see Mindy, standing in front of him. She looked equally confused, looking around the room and appearing to be retracing her steps. <i>Looks like she's back to normal, but why am I not in bed then?</i> Danny slowly began to figure out his new situation, <i>Holy crap, I'm mom now!?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Danny looked over to the mirror once more only to reaffirm his suspicions. Staring back at him was the same beautiful face he saw every morning when he woke up. The person who taught him how to ride a bike. The person who used to sing lullabies every night. Danny now inhabited the body of the woman who raised him and it was by far the strangest thing that had ever happened to him before. Being inside Mindy's body was one thing, a complete stranger in Danny's eyes, but being his mother was different. The whole thing just screamed wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, Mrs. Wilkins?\" Mindy spoke, taking Danny more than a second to understand she was talking to him, \"Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm, I mean, I'm alright,\" Danny responded,finding his new voice particularly bizarre, \"Just a little worn out from this whole....thing,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I bet,\" Mindy said, \"I can't imagine what you're going through right now. But I think you're doing really well considering. Why don't you sit back down, and I go get you a cup of water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That sounds good,\" Danny told the nurse, as he was ushered back to the chair his mother was sitting in. Giving Mindy a nod, she was off to presumably get water. Plopping himself onto the chair, Danny was hit with waves of unfamiliar sensations. First off,  it felt like he was in a booster seat, like he was something was elevating him higher than the chair was supposed to be. Danny figured that it was actually just his mother much larger behind, naturally cushioning himself on the chair. His mother's butt being the polar opposite of his usually scrawny one, and for that matter, her whole body was much larger than his old one. Definitely not the size of Mindy, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for sure, but his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chubby frame and increased height were nowhere near what Danny was used to. <i>This is crazy, I can't even sit still and be comfortable like this</i> Danny fidgeted within the hospital chair, <i>Seriously, what am I supposed to do now?</i></span></div></div>",

I've become a vegetable.\" He says, resting his hand against his forehead, his breathes shallow to the heavy weight weighting down on her chest, \"Ugh, and moms body is mine....hers, someones?\" Danny says, feeling the mental cramp strikes his mothers dome before letting out a loud huff. \"I need to get out of here, need some air!\" He says, slapping his hands against the arm rests of the chair and lifts herself up, her ass cooling off to the cold A/C brushing against her jeans as her chest bounces and smacks the corner of her chin.* \"Gack, w-what the heck? Er, I'll see you in a bit Danny.\" He says to himself, rocking from side to side a bit to her odd center of gravity, while familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head tossing her hair about, Danny pivoted and took a deep breath, marching her way out of his bodies dwelling for the time being leaving it to the care of Mindy and her colleagues even if it made Danny's borrowed belly that wobbled with every step he took sting with anxiety, but given the circumstances what more could Danny do but try to get accustomed to his moms body, even as her hips swayed the massive fat filled junk in his trunk around with her thighs rippling beneath her old jeans while her breast bulged and barely sat within her older blouse exposing a tad bit of her white cotton bra holding up her legendary breasts that, much to his own annoyance, had been the talk of the locker rooms, along with talk about other MILFs and some teachers.  \"Jeez mom, how do you move about without knocking someone over?\" he mumbles, watching his hips move as well as the two tubs of tit fat jiggle off his chest, obscuring much of his view of her feet as he looks up to examine the hospital halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls themselves being lightly populated with doctors moving around from door to door for quick check ups, something he's heard his dad complain about in the past when a doctors lunch break comes around they try to check everyone off before neglecting them while some patients sit lulled within a seat supplied for them, \"Sheesh, this place feels more like an asylum than a hospital.\" He mumbles again, watching an older doctor with a big old pot belly wave his hand over the head of another patient who appeared to have a gnarly head injury going off the gash around his head. Shrugging it off he tries to walk a little faster making his mothers body gyrate and wobble like and oversized tub of jello some more before making a sharp sharp turn upon seeing the public restroom, slamming the door open and rushing inside with the door slamming shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and shivering from the rush of moving about in his mothers body Danny stares at the clean sterile white wall of the bathroom before her with it's two empty stalls to the right and the big sink and mirror to the left, \"Fuck and me that was a lot more stressful than staying inside the room with my body!\" He shouts, ears ringing to his mothers soft voice cussing and even raising her voice, exacerbated by the reverb of her voice thanks to the bathrooms acoustics, \"Also, need to stop causing with mom's voice....I need to just get out of mom's body in general.  This is f'ed up!\"  Turning to face the mirror, Danny was greeted by a foreign site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stared himself, or his mother stared herself down in the mirror with a complete disconnect or suspension of belief, even though he had already moved into Mindy's body and his mother....he the fact that he is in her and IS her fucked with his mind worse than his first pre-calc class in high-school as he did a few things to make sure this is all real such as reaching up and pressing her smooth finger against her runny eye liner with a rough drag down smearing away the tar like product and exposing her  natural creamy skin and the light wrinkles around her eyes, huffing between her plump lips that at one point were full enough to always smother Danny's face in kisses. the second thing he does is rests his hand against her heavy tit, pressing down against it as his heart fluttered to his tiny manicured hands sinking within her left tits flooding her chest with a tingling warmth forcing the nipples of her tits to poke out and chaff against her soft bra, \"Haa~? S-so heavy....mom how do you even move with these things around too?\" he mumbles, letting go of her tit before lightly tapping it to watch her exposed creamy flesh carrying a few visible veins to jiggles and slip a bit out from her worn white blouse running her other hand across her little pooch of a belly as a small smile grows on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess, it isn't so bad, I mean mom is like a big jiggle house?\" he asks himself, looking over to the door then back to the mirror to see his own mother wearing such a goofy grin while poking her tit, the other hand running over her smooth crotch, \"Y-yep, that's gone as well....heh, for some reason I don't feel so anxious touching mom like this, does that make me fucked up?\" he mumbles, her smile growing even bigger with a little shuffle of her feet to face her side showing off the large bump that s her ass jutting out against her jeans, jumping up and down on her toes resulting with the plastic soles corners of her sneakers getting am amazed giggle and coo from his mothers mouth to her ass bouncing and clapping beneath er clothes while her breast and belly wobbly roughly to the poit of her tits slip out from her blouse still covered by her bra, Danny stopping his little bounce to cup her breasts and gasp.  \"A-ah shit!...okay m-maybe this is pretty fucked up and kinda going too far, but at least I sorta feel better, now what?\" He asks, watching his mothers mouth mimic his words.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny continues to stare into the mirror. With his hands still on his mother's breasts, his curiousity got the best of him. He grabbed the edge of the bra and slowly pulled it down to reveal her nipples. Danny covered it up quickly as he realize that he is checking out his mom's body. \"No, I can't do this. This is my mother's body, not mine.\" Danny looked back at the mirror, the guilt he felt quickly faded away as he stared at her curvaceous form. \"But, maybe it wouldn't hurt to look a bit, it's not like Mom would ever find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny headed inside one of the stalls to make sure no one sees what he's about to do. He closed the door and locked it before leaning his back against the wall. Danny felt his mother's chest rising as he breathes and started unbuttoning her blouse. Each button came off slowly until the blouse was completely open, showing off his mother's torso. Danny took off the blouse and stared at her volumptuous breasts resting inside the bra. He cupped each one with his hands and squeezed them a few times. \"Mmm, dang, these breasts feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny reached behind his back to take off the bra. It wasn't easy for him to take off mother's bra, especially if he's doing it from inside her body. After several attempts, Danny finally unclipped the bra and took it off. He looked down and saw his mother's beautiful breasts sagging a bit from his chest. He moved his hands slowly toward her boobs to cup them. His fingers brushed against her nipples, sending electricty throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh!\" Danny moaned, rubbing his hands over his mother's breasts. He felt pleasure all over her body, causing her panties to get wet. \"This feels...so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mom, it feels so wrong, but...it feels so...amazing!\" he moaned as he continue to pleasure his mother's body. His mother's body is now his body. Danny continued to pleasure her body. One hand was on her meaty boobs as he squeezed them while the other hand reached down inside her pants moving his finger fast inside her pussy. Danny felt something building up inside him, so he quickened the pace to exploit that feeling. He took his mother's left tit and put it in his mouth while he squeezes and pinches the other tit and pumps his left fingers inside her vagina. He can feel it, Danny is getting closer to his first female orgasm. Danny kept going and going until he finally came inside his mom's body. Danny basks in the afterglow of his orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny's orgasm has stopped, he remembered about his old body. He got up from the toilet seat to clean himself. Danny quickly picked up his mother's clothes and put them back on, although he had difficult dealing with her bra and breasts. Once he finished his business, Danny exit the bathroom and walked to find his room. Danny was a little lost when he was looking for his room until he asked one of the employess at the desk where it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny made his way back to his room, save for his unconscious body. Mindy had came back with the water. She told the woman in front of her that the doctor would do some tests to check on her son and the current state he was in. Mindy also recommended her to go and rest at home while they work. Danny agrees and grabbed his mom's purse before turning back around. His eyes staring at his body. Every passing second he could not bear seeing his body like that. Danny drank his water and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny exits the hospital, he spot his mom's car and got in immediately. He felt the seat cushion his mother's large ass comfortably. He took a minute to adjust the driver's seat until he felt comfortable driving. Danny hadn't drove in awhile, but he should at least have some experience when his dad would take him driving so he could get his license. Danny turned on the car and drove back home. Danny took the shortest and less busy streets to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny finally made it back home, safe and sound. He got out of the car and walked to the house with her hips swaying from side-to-side. Danny went inside and head straight to his room. Danny entered his room and fell on top his bed, taking in the softness of his warm blankets. He almost felt like he was truly home, except for the fact that he was still in his mom's body instead of his own. Boy does he wish this was a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny remembers that he needs to shower after spending some \"alone time\" in her body. Danny slowly got up and went to his parents' room. He checked for some clean clothes that would fit better on his current form. He felt embarrassed that he would have to put on some of his mom's clothes, even if he is inside her body. Danny picked out some simple clothes; a red bra, red panties, black shorts, and a red shirt. He went inside his parents' bathroom and closed the door behind him. He placed the clothes on the counter and began removing his clothes. Danny turned on the shower and got in. Drops of hot water hit his skin as they fall down his body. Danny scrubbed his mom's body everywhere, from her breasts to her belly, even to her lower region. It wasn't long until he started playing with her body again before finishing his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny took a towel and started drying off his mom's body, rubbing it against her sensitive parts. Afterwards, he took her clothes and put them on. He brought the panties up her legs. He can feel the cloth squeezing her fat ass. Next, Danny put on the red bra on his chest, still struggling to put it on. After putting on the bra, he dried her hair and finally put on the rest of her clothes. Danny walked out of the bathroom and fell on the bed. Before he could fall asleep, Danny saw a small box on top of his mother's dressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny got up and walked by to take a look at the box. It took him aback in shock of what it is. It was a pregnancy stick. He checked the receipt next to it and figured out that his mother just recently bought it. Danny made up his mind and went inside the bathroom to take the pregnancy test. Danny finally came out of the bathroom with an expression on his mother's face that showed beyond shock, he was terrified. Not only is he trap in his mom's body, she is pregnant. He doesn't know what he could do about it. At his mom's current age, pregnancy would be rather complicated. He doesn't know if he should stay in his mother's body or find a way out. Danny layed on his parents' bed, thinking about his situation until sleep took over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny, in his mother's body, looked at his own comatose body. It was a very odd experience, seeing himself, looking asleep right in front of him. Danny put his mother's hand on his own and concentrated on trying to leave his mother's body but nothing happened. Just as he removed his mother's hand, Mindy returned to the room, holding a cup of water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Mrs. Wilkins\" Mindy said, handing Danny the cup. Danny made sure that his mother's fingers came into contact with Mindy's as the cup was passed. Suddenly, that same dizziness struck Danny and when things came back, he found himself looking at his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for the water Mindy. You're really such a kind woman\" Danny's mother said with a warm smile on her face, apparently remembering that Mindy had went to get her water even though that happened while Danny had been in control of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... no problem at all Mrs. Wilkins\" Danny said from Mindy's body as she turned to leave the room and walk into the greater part of the hospital. As Danny walked aimlessly in Mindy's body, he tried to think about what had happened to him. Apparently, Danny was now some kind of spirit and he could jump into other people's bodies and take them over. Once he was int he body, he was able to switch immediately to another body by coming into physical contact with one, even as minor contact as just running his finger on them. Danny wanted to experiment with this. As a doctor was walking past him, he put his hand on the man's shoulder. As he did, he explicitly thought about staying in Mindy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright, nurse?\" the confused doctor asked, turning around as the still possessed Mindy removed her hand from his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes doctor. I'm very sorry\" she said as the doctor looked at her strangely. He then shrugged and continued walking in the direction he was going in. Danny smiled a little. So, he could transfer into bodies by touch but could consciously stop himself from moving bodies if he wanted to. That was definitely good to know. He also wondered if he could have any access to the body's memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he thought the word memories, a flood of foreign ones filled his mind. He remembered events from Mindy's life as if he was the one living them. He remembered that Mindy was the oldest of five girls and that she was divorced. He remembered getting married and having children. Danny concentrated on quieting down the flood of information and it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\" he muttered to himself. He looked at one of the other nurses and concentrated. Suddenly, everything that Mindy knew about that nurse, whose name was apparently Jordana, came into his mind. Danny grinned. He was starting to understand more of his apparent powers, which was a very good thing. \"I think I've spent enough time here\" he said and then thought about exiting Mindy's body. He felt himself losing feelings from Mindy's body and then stepped outside of the nurses body. He took a few more 'steps' forward and then looked at himself, seeing that we was completely nude and translucent. \"This is so weird\" Danny said, looking around and noticing that no one paid him any attention. He assumed that was because he was now completely invisible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walked around the hospital for a few minutes, careful not to accidentally jump into someone's body. He walked through walls and technology and thought about what he should do. He already knew that he was blocked from his real body for some reason, which meant that Danny could possess anyone but himself. Danny wanted to go back to his mother's body and maybe try to get her to realize that he was still around or comfort her. At the same time, Danny wanted to figure out what was happening to him, and he thought he knew someone who may be able to help with that in school. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny stared at the two girls talking to each other, his gaze fixated on how Amy's hips moved when she walked. How the slight evening wind moved her beautiful brown hair rhythmically. Then suddenly, as if on primal instinct, his ghostly form bolted towards Amy. Before Danny could realize what was happening, he was sucked into Amy's petite form through her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Danny's ethereal form crashed into Amy, she stopped and let out a weak gasp. Her body straightened out, muscles stiff as rock and eyes widened to an almost impossible size before everything returned back to normal, but her face was blank. Gaze unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's slight convulsion stopped Yuna as well. She grabbed Amy's shoulders and gently tried to shake her out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Amy?\" Yuna looked into Amy's eyes, which were still unfocused \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the other teens also noticed the commotion and stopped to wait for the two girls. After a moment one of the girls ran up to the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you guys stop?\" Kathy wondered and when Amy failed to acknowledge her in any way she frowned and waved a hand in front of Amy's face. Disappointed at the lack of reaction from her friend, she turned to Yuna. \"Hey Yuna, what's up with Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna shrugged and glanced at Amy, before turning back to Kathy \"I don't know,\" she replied with her slight accent \"We were just talking about Alexa's new shoes when she just stopped and started shaking and stuff\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy frowned and turned back to her friend. She raised her hand before Amy's face and snapped her fingers a few times. \"Hey, Earth to Amy! Stop ignoring us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked and Amy shook her head a few times before muttering a quiet \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just kinda spaced out on us\" Kathy replied, her brows furrowed \"Are you okay? Do you need to see a doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. I think I'm, uhh... fine now. Umm... Kathy.\" Amy replied dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna and Kathy turned to look at each other. They both knew something was wrong with their friend, but neither one was willing to pursue the issue further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy let out a sigh and shrugged \"If you say so, Amy\" she turned to look at the other kids staring at them. \"We better catch up with them\" she pointed out and started walking back to the group. Yuna glanced at Amy for the final time, before following Kathy to the group, leaving Amy to her own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was ecstatic. Never in his wildest dreams could he imagine being this close to his crush. Heck, he <i>was</i> his crush right now. Danny gave Amy's breasts a light squeeze before giggling with her angelic voice. He could learn much about her in his current predicament. He might even be able to use this information to hook up with her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turned behind him to look at the school. Now that he has a body, he could learn more about this mess. Maybe find a cure or at least find something about his powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a peek at the group slowly making their way over to their cars. <i>These powers are amazing</i> Danny thought. <i>Who cares how it works or why it happened?</i> Danny raised Amy's hand to her chest and gave her breasts a squeeze again. Amy had a very large grin on her face. <i>I might as well make the most of it, see what Amy's life is like.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Danny sat to sort out his situation, he heard the hospital room door open. Glancing up, Danny saw another familiar face, his father. Well, \u201cfamiliar\u201d might not be the exact word here, because Danny rarely saw his father back home. His father tended to work extended hours as the CEO of a defense contracting business. Danny briefly remembered the fun times he has spent with his dad back when he was in elementary school, before his dad started the business corporation. He would always pick Danny up after school to play ball in a neighborhood park. On weekends, his dad would take him biking on various biking trails around town. Sure, his mom was the first to teach him how to ride, but his dad had spent the most time biking with him. Danny eventually grew fond of biking from these trips and has continued riding on biking trails through high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these moments of his childhood did not last, as his dad was forced to find a new job due to the economic recession 8 years ago. Luckily, this new job was prosperous, and Danny\u2019s family was spared from economic risk. In fact, his dad\u2019s job as the CEO earned more salary than his previous job, making him wealthy. Of course, the drawback is the dwindling time spent at home. As the corporation received more and more contracts, mainly from the government military, Danny\u2019s father spent less and less time with his family. Before Danny knew it, the previous ritual of spending time with his dad had become a rare occasion. He would still show up to major events such as birthdays and school honor ceremonies, but those would become the remaining moments Danny would truly see his father. Danny never resented his father for what he did, as it can\u2019t be helped. But he would occasionally feel nostalgic about the times back in elementary school\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, are you alright?\u201d Danny\u2019s dad waved in front of his face, snapping Danny from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi da-, I mean, honey. Sorry, I was just lost in thought. Today has just been one jumbled mess,\u201d Danny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad gave a somber yet reassuring look. \u201cI\u2019m sure things will work out in the end. We just have to believe in Danny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked into his father\u2019s eyes for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt pains me so much to see Danny like this. Even though I\u2019m rarely home, I still miss the fun times with Danny before I started my business. When I heard that Danny was in an accident and in critical condition, I told Angela to quickly cancel my appointments for the day and rushed here to the hospital,\u201d Danny\u2019s dad gave a nod toward the dark honey blonde woman standing the door. The woman was Angela Mulbury, his dad\u2019s current personal assistant. Danny met her once or twice, usually tailing his father when he attended some of Danny\u2019s parties or ceremonies. It gives him a subtle reminder that his dad would have to return to work. Danny would almost consistently see her on her phone, managing his dad\u2019s tight work schedule. Danny could only fathom that Angela is on her phone now to cancel all those plans for today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Mindy returned with a cup of water. After handing the cup to Danny, she looked toward his dad. \u201cYou must be Mr. Wilkins. I\u2019m sorry for what has happened to your son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for your concern. So what is Danny\u2019s current condition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny is still in a comatose state. His vital signs look fine, but he seems to have suffered decent head trauma. We have sedated him to keep him from feeling any pain. I\u2019m currently responsible for monitoring him, and there will always be a nurse to watch over him. I can\u2019t give you a prognosis right now; that will have to wait until doctors come to examine him in an hour or so. But we will do our very best to help him recover as quickly as possible,\u201d Mindy replied in a solemn tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much, nurse. I hope to hear good news from the doctors as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mindy was speaking with his dad, Danny was sitting behind, listening in while drinking the water given by Mindy. Despite Mindy\u2019s best efforts to ease concerns, Danny was still worried about his condition. <i>\u201cHer response was pretty much the same as before. I hope they are not hiding something more serious. Where are the doctors anyway? Is the response this slow for a patient in critical condition? Or actually, do they even know how to treat a patient whose spirit is outside of their body?\u201d</i> Danny thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny\u2019s father must have noticed Danny\u2019s worried expression hanging on his mother\u2019s face. He approached Danny and was about to pat on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Danny still didn\u2019t know the intricacies, he knew that he first switched into Mindy\u2019s body through a pat on the shoulder. Instinctively, Danny waved his dad away, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Almost instantaneously, Danny regret those words, as he saw his dad with a shocked and worried expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, I know that today has been very stressful for you. Here, why don\u2019t you take a breather outside the room for a bit? We can\u2019t do anything now but to wait for the doctors to arrive, right? I\u2019ll let you know when they do,\u201d Danny\u2019s father said in his most comforting tone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "created":1451943960,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Danny Wilkins is a sixteen year old boy looking forward to the summer following his Sophomore year of high school.  He is a nice young man with an unassuming manner.  He has curly brown hair and is only about five feet five inches tall and is fairly thin.  He is well-liked at school with many friends and good relationships with his teachers.  Danny is the child of wealthy parents, but he stays admirably grounded and humble, preferring to make the best of his life on his own merit if possible.  He refuses even to take his driver's test, preferring to ride his bike to and from school because, if he had a license, his dad would buy him a car made for show-offs that would separate him from his friends of more modest means.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny is riding his bike home one day during Spring as he looked forward to some time at home.  He is then struck by a car, which speeds off and leaves Danny horribly injured in the street.  Danny is rushed to the hospital and injected with many drugs, one of which has the effect of enabling Danny to leave his own body in a sort of astral form.  Danny's body remains in a coma at the hospital while he passes from body to body, able to interact with the world only by jumping into the bodies of other people.  He struggles to understand his new powers as he copes with his changed circumstances, while also contending with the possibility that what was done to him was not an accident at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Wilkins:  Danny is sixteen years old with curly brown hair.  He is only about five feet five inches tall and is fairly thin.  He is a genuine and nice kid who values his friends and family.  Despite the wealth from which he comes, he remains grounded and humble, preferring to ride his bike to school so as not to set himself apart from his friends by driving one of the many luxury cars that populate his garage.  He is well-liked by his teachers and friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony Markum:  Tony Markum is Danny's best friend and is in many of his classes.  He is physically bigger than Tony at about six feet tall and is quite heavy, with a big belly jutting out from his body, one acquired through many years of sugary candy and pop.  Tony loves Danny's house because it's so big and has so many trappings of wealth that set it apart from his own middle-class home.  Tony has short dark hair and pudgy face (one fitting the rest of his body).  He is big enough that he could do some damage if need be, but he is good-natured enough that it's just not his character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Weathers:  Amy Weathers is a beautiful young woman in Danny's class.  She knows him and is friendly with him, but they aren't especially close.  Danny is rather sad about that, as Amy is quite beautiful.  She is about five feet eight inches tall with a toned, beautiful body and a set of breasts that are neither tiny nor overwhelming.  They fit her frame very well.  She has a beautiful smile and an affable nature with long brown hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria Hill:  Ms. Hill is a history teacher at Danny's high school.  She is 32 years old with blonde hair and a toned figure, though her breasts are big and bouncy enough the gather the attention of most red-blooded males in Danny's class.  Her ass is also rather prominent, and walking behind her in the hall is a pleasure unto itself.  She enjoys Danny's contributions to class and finds him a fine person to talk to.  She is known for drinking coffee in the morning.  As nice as she is, she is likely to be less so if she hasn't had her coffee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven Abbott:  Mr. Abbott teaches language arts.  He is 53 years old and stands about six feet five inches tall.  He is usually the teacher in charge of breaking up fights in the lunch room or the hall when they happen.  Abbott is bald with only a few wisps of grey hair sticking out of the top of his head.  He wears a suit to work every day, and the material of the suit is strained a bit by his mighty belly that shakes as he walks and even more when he laughs.  At approximately three hundred fifty pounds, Abbott is a big man--a force to be reckoned with.  He quite likes Danny and speaks highly of his writing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer Esposita:  Ms. Esposita is 43 years old and Danny's Spanish teacher.  She has black hair and a pleasant smile, along with a body that fits beautifully into that stereotype that seems reserved for Latina women--she is abundantly curvy and jiggles in all the gith places.  At 43, there are a couple small lines around her eyes.  Her breasts seem constantly about to plop out of her shirt, and there is a bit of extra pudge around her belly--cute, but not enough to make her fat.  Her backside is the stuff of dreams for many men, and her wide, child-bearing hips sway from side to side as she walks.  She has four children but is now divorced, and having had and raised four children has probably contributed to a body that is not quite as toned as it once was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren Noble:  Lauren is Danny's science teacher.  She is only 23 years old and works out fairly often.  Thus, she has a toned and fit body of which she's quite proud.  She has curly black hair and a pleasant face.  Danny struggles a bit in science class and so has to ask for help from her, which she happily gives.  She is about five feet six inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora Michaelson:  Nora Michaelson teaches psychology, a class Danny takes.  Ms. Michaelson is married with two small children and is herself 40 years old.  She is about five feet eight inches tall with jet black hair that runs straight down her back.  Her figure is quite full--curvy, really.  Her breasts stick out, and she has a wonderful bubble but that her tight-fitting skirts struggle to contain.  Sitting on her desk is a small jar of jelly beans that she munches at her convenience, which probably explains some of the jiggle in her body as she walks.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor Wilkins:  Connor Wilkins is Danny's father.  Like Danny, he has a full head of brown hair, but Connor is a large man--about six two and two hundred fifty pounds.  He is 55 years old and runs a defense contracting business that keeps him very wealthy and keeps his family in the dark about much of what he does.  He is in frequent conversation with military officials and elected officeholders at various levels and is often away from home for extended periods.  He cares for his son, but his work is very demanding.  The people Mr. Wilkins keeps around him tend to be beautiful women with great bodies and the willingness to show them off.  He figures that, if you have to go to work, you should so surrounded by people who make you happy to be there.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa Wilkins:  Lisa is Danny's mother.  She stands at five feet eight inches tall and is thus about three inches taller than Danny.  She has fiery red hair that dangles down her back in beautiful curls.  Lisa is not as young as she used to be, but she is still beautiful.  The years have added a couple small but visible lines around her eyes, and she has packed on a few pounds as the years have rolled by.  She is not fat by any means; rather, she jiggles in all the right places.  Her boobs sit proudly upon her chest and bounce and jiggle about as she walks, the only concession to time being that they droop just a little bit more than they did five or ten years ago.  Her body is full and voluptuous, with a tiny pouch in her belly.  She tries to get it to go away, but it won't.  She has a set of wide, child-bearing hips and a beautiful ass.  Her thighs are beautiful and meaty, and she is quite proud of the fact that she does not have a thigh gap.  Mrs. Wilkins is 45 years old and was a lawyer climbing the professional ladder before her husband (eleven years her senior) swept her off her feet twenty years ago.  She gave up that life for him and is sad about the fact that she does not get to see her husband more.  She feels a bit neglected about that and clings to Danny as a source of companionship in their big house with relatively little company.  She resents the presence of many of the women her husband has hired to tend to Danny and to the house.  She feels she has to compete with them for the attention of both her son and her husband, and of course no wife is pleased to have a bunch of beautiful women with to-die-for bodies surrounding her husband all the time and willing to do whatever he asks of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie Milford:  Julie is a friend of Lisa and thus knows Danny fairly well.  She is the woman Lisa calls if she has problems or worries, and she lives right next door.  Her husband is an investment banker, and her very hot daughter Clare just began her first year at college.  Julie is fairly hot herself.  Even at 45, she exercises often, doing yoga and swimming in her pool daily.  She's got a wonderful set of boobs, and she does not hesitate to show off her body.  It makes her quite happy to know that all the younger men still look at her lustfully, and all the more happy that her husband is often not at home because he travels out of the country.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa Corres:  Rosa is one of many maids and various others who staff Danny's house.  She is 24 years old with long dark hair and big boobs that threaten to spill from her small and tight-fitting maid's uniform.  She acts as something of a big sister to Danny, who is technically an only child.  She also cooks, cleans, and does whatever else would be expected of the maid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Nettles:  Susan is a cook for Danny's family.  She is 33 with long blonde hair and a wonderful body.  Her boobs are her most prominent feature.  Her smile is beautiful was well.  She likes Danny and is quite protective of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela Mulbury:  Angela is Connor's personal assistant.  She is fluent in three languages and comes to work wearing low-cut tops that show off her cleavage.  Those who want to talk to Danny's father often have to go through her first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </td>",
