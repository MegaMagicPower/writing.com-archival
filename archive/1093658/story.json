With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.\"<br>\r\n Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. This title was written on her forehead: <br>\r\n      MYSTERY <br>\r\n      BABYLON THE GREAT<br>\r\n      THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES<br>\r\n      AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. Then the angel said to me: \"Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while. The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings\u2014and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then the angel said to me, \"The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled. The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.\"</span></div></div>",

For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God\u2019s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God\u2019s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God\u2019s servants, who give their full time to governing.

Formless and Void means that something does not have shape. (No physical form.) If something has no physical form, it doesn't exist. So essentially, in the very first two lines of the Bible, God tried to create Nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOWEVER, by trying to create nothing, he ACCIDENTALLY created something. If the earth was formless and void, then how did a body of water, with a definitive face and surface appear?<br>\r\nA body of water is NOT formless and void; it DOES have form. Water is not nothing, as the writers of the bible tried to depict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sorry but, this is the FIRST Two lines of a supposedly Infallible Sacred Text, and we've already got one of the hundreds of contradictions that supposedly \"don't exist.\"</span></div></div>",

Did he murder us JUST through his hatred alone?

(Don't believe me, Join me for my NEXT favorite verse - Revelations 21:8)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if there's no Eternal Life Abiding in Murderers...then why does the Bible depict God still being alive? - considering by sheer body-count alone, he's the greatest mass murderer who ever \"existed\".</span></div></div>",

In fact, if you don't hate your family, you can't follow in his path. However, if you DO hate your family, you're a Murderer, and you're going to go to Hell, regardless of what Jesus said earlier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I'm starting to think this game is rigged.<br>\r\nBut don't worry; if this seems like one of HUNDREDS of nonsensical contradictions found throughout the Bible, both Old and New Testament. Just remember what your Preacher told you -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Bible doesn't contradict itself. So this is not a Contradiction; this is..................NOT a contradiction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to those who might say, \"You're misunderstanding this because you're taking it out of context.\"<br>\r\nIs it REALLY out of context? Or could it be from the fact that a majority of the books in the Bible were written by different people, several decades apart, with practically no communication or cooperation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving beyond that obvious tripe, let's look at who else is burning...Particularly Sorcerers. I hope that everyone who reads this can understand the very simple fact that Magic and Sorcery do NOT exist...In fact, a majority of Christians I know in real life, will adamantly protest that Magic does NOT exist...And yet, they still feel threatened by Harry Potter. Because apparently Magic and Witchcraft are two different things...But despite their disbelief in Magic, they also adamantly defen that everything that God does...is NOT magic. Because conjuring something into existence through a speaking-spell and turning water to wine is REAL...and Magic is NOT...<br>\r\n...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find it kind of funny that \"All Liars\" is mentioned...I hope Ray Comfort has read this part...even though I know he hasn't.</span></div></div>",
