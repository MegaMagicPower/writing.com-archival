            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nYour sister Sara is out of town this week at a big science convention and she has entrusted you to look after her house while she's gone. Sara has always been a big nerd when it comes to electronic gizmos and computer stuff. She\u2019s the only one you know that could get excited over a whole week of droning lectures on astrophysics or whatever they talk about during those convention things. You figure it\u2019s not a big deal so you pack a bunch of clothes into a backpack and head on over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and see the living room is a bit of a mess, but that\u2019s Sara for you. There are magazines across the coffee table, the couch is a mess, and DVDs scattered on the floor. You\u2019re amazed that someone could live like this. You toss your backpack on to the coffee table and try not to step on leftover gadgets and pieces of Sara\u2019s experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn almost a flash Sara greets you wearing a nice summer dress while holding two bags of luggage. She gives you a rundown of things to do and its the usual stuff: collect the mail, water the plants out front, don\u2019t open the small metal circuit breaker looking plate in the wall \u2026ok, that last bit is oddly cryptic but before you can inquire about it she\u2019s already out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now you\u2019re left to your own devices and quickly become bored. You flip on the tv but can\u2019t find much to fill your interest which brings your eyes to the movie cases on the floor. You begin sifting through her DVDs for something to watch but come up with either documentaries or chick flicks. You really aren\u2019t up for a video on the intricacies of systems engineering nor do you wish to watch \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\u201d The magazines on the table suffer from the same affliction, \u201cPopular Science\u201d and \u201cGlamour Magazine\u201d\u2026you\u2019d swear two different people live in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a last resort, you pop out your GameBoy and play for a bit, maybe 15 minutes in you see it\u2019s almost out of power. You sigh remembering you forgot to charge it last time you used it Grabbing the charger, you look for an outlet. You come a crossed one easily enough and as you stand you notice the small metal plate. You debate with yourself if you should open it or not, eventually saying, \u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the cold handle and open it revealing a large lever and, figuring you\u2019ve come this far, you attempt to flip it down but about halfway down it gets stuck. After a few tugs, you decide to get it unstuck. You jump up and put all you\u2019re weight on it on your way down and as you come down so does the lever, which then snaps in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dim as the sound of grinding metal fills the room. You really wish that lever didn\u2019t snap off. Luckily it doesn\u2019t take long before things seem to be working normally again. You sigh in relief that the house didn\u2019t blow up but you are startled at the sound of a computerized voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Good morning, Sara.*<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You begin pacing while thinking of what you would like CARA, wherever it is, to do. An idea comes to you when you accidentally stumble on some of the junk that Sara has around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCARA, Clean the house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yes, Sara*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleaning Mode Initiated*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice long robotic arms enter the room from small panels in the walls which hastily begin sorting the items and cleaning the room. At least that explains why CARA couldn\u2019t answer your question about its location, it appears that Sara has turned the entire house into a robot, Awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused, you watch the arms do there work on stacking the DVD and vacuuming the floor with special attachments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, \u201cMan, Sara is a genius. When she gets this thing to 100% I\u2019m gonna want one, preferably one that calls me by my name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re amusement ends when you see an arm grab your backpack. You quickly run over and try and get it back but the arm refuses to release it from its grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, let go!\u201d The arm doesn\u2019t seem to hear you as it continues to attempt to move the backpack. One quick yank and your hands are forced to let go and the pack swiftly disappears into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleaning Mode Complete*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where did you take my backpack?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*All stained items are to be washed*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stained!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ERROR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to keep your cool, \u201cReturn my backpack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*All stained items are to be washed, the voice repeats, much to your aggravation.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, It has all my clothes in it, without it, I\u2019ll have nothing to wear.\u201d Look at you, you are trying to reason with a robotic house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Incorrect*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean incorrect?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You have an adequate number of clothes in your closet, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really beginning to become annoyed by this whole thing. It has quickly gone from being fun to being a big pain. You calm yourself again and realize that you can just return home and pick up a few more things. Though you begin wondering if you\u2019d come back, you promised your sister that you\u2019d watch the house. Then again, you didn\u2019t know about CARA when you made that promise. Maybe there could be a way to turn it off?</span></div></div>",

Though you were planning on picking up something on your way back to your place, you think that it couldn't hurt to see if this thing can cook anything remotely editable. Why pay for something you can get for free, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your distance in fear of what those arms might do, but it looks like everything is under control. It's not long until your plate is set at the table and you see and arm pull out a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meal preparations complete*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please have a seat, Sara*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the table to inspect the dish when you feel an arm force you onto the chair firmly. The suddenness catches you off guard and you plop onto the wooden seat then speedily slid into the table. You are a bit uncomfortable and the wooden arms of the chair make it almost impossible to move about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes then drift back to your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the plate that\u2019s in front of you and notice what seems to be yet another part of CARA\u2019s programming that was left unfinished. An attempt at toast with a side of eggs was obviously made, however, the result was less than appetizing. The toast was burnt to a crisp and the egg looked like it hadn\u2019t even been cooked, there were even pieces of the egg\u2019s shell on the plate. The only thing that looks alright was a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to put a bit of distance between you and the plate, you find that the arm that tucked you into your current position has not moved and will not allow you an easy way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please enjoy your meal*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you see an arm that appears to have some kind of fork attachment snake past your shoulder and head to your plate. After removing a chunk of toasted bread, the arm dips it into the raw egg then turns it toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the end can get to your face you grab the fork and attempt to wrestle it away. With quick jerking motions, the arm gets closer. Fear wells up inside you as the severity of the moment hits you. Sure the food is gross but you can just deal with that, the real problem is that these arms can be pretty forceful, and this one is holding something sharp at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith newfound strength, you fight off the metal menace. You hear the sound of grinding metal as the arm tries to fight off your efforts to overcome it. It feels like you have been fighting forever as your arms burn with exertion. You worry that you won\u2019t be able to fight much more when in the thrashing about you manage to knock the glass of orange juice over, which spills over the table, on to your shirt and into your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the arm you\u2019ve been combating stops and you feel a bit of pride at warding of your assailant. There is a pause from CARA, perhaps thinking? You attempt to leave your seat again but still face resistance from your chair. You try to squeeze out instead but you\u2019re packed in too tight. Feeling a bit claustrophobic you begin shouting commands for letting you go, but nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nothing else worked. Uh\u2026CARA, clean kitchen,\u201d hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yes, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleaning Mode Initiated*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly arms fill the room with cleaning attachments and begin scrubbing up the mess. The food is removed and the spill is wiped from the table. One with a sponge twists toward you, but you\u2019re too tired to fight it off this time, but luckily it just dabs the excess liquid off. They eventually finish and go back to their little holes in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleaning Mode Complete*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the arm holding the chair gone you jump out of your seat, relieved at your returned mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please make your way to the bathroom to be cleaned*</span></div></div>",

Your clothes and everything else in your backpack has been stolen by CARA, you're hungry, and the clothes you do have are now dripping with cold orange juice. You want to get out of here now, forget your responsibilities. You walk up to the door and attempt to open it, however, it appears locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please make your way to the bathroom to be cleaned*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you lock the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yes, Sara*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For safety measures, I have locked the doors and windows to prevent possible break-ins or forced entry while you are in the bathroom*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about that, unlock the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ERROR*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please make your way to the bathroom to be cleaned*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone, while mentally preparing yourself for what's to come next. You figure, \"she'll get over it and she shouldn't have made the thing so mysterious, I couldn't help but be curious so, in a way, it's her fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Are you in need of assistance?* CARA repeats<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dial the number and hear it ring then you hear something else upstairs your sister's ringtone. \"That ditz! She forgot her phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your phone and put it back in your pocket. You think that maybe she'll call from a payphone to check up or something, you'll just have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you get an idea; maybe you can get out with some outside assistance. You bring out your phone once more, but this time call your roommate Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's not too sharp but he's a nice enough guy and at the moment he's the only one you can think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, you hear a groggy Jason on the other side \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, it's me\"<br>\r\n\"Me who?\"<br>\r\n\"Check your phone\"<br>\r\nThere is a short pause \"Hey, Tom. What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"I need your help, there's this\" you stop yourself from talking about CARA. Would he believe it, you have no idea, but if he did he might not come over to help. \"I, uh, need some spare clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Are you in need of assistance?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" you hear Jason ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the girl there? Is that your sister? I thought you said she was leaving. You know, you never did introduce me to her is she cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just get over here with some clothes, there should be a spare key in a red flowerpot out front. Do you remember where it is? I left the address on my dresser\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I remember. Do you really need clothes right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Are you in need of assistance?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you Nimrod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Very well. I will assist you, Sara*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize at that moment that you have not been paying attention to CARA and your eyes widen as you hear the sound of the house coming alive again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'll bring some later, if I feel like it.\" You hear Jason say, obviously a bit mad at being called names, followed by the phone ending the call.</span></div></div>",

If one arm was incredibly tough to fight off then anymore would be impossible, but you still struggle for your freedom. You shout as many different commands for it to stop that you can think of, but your cries are either not heard or simply ignored. You are dragged up the stairs and passed around like a football, it's more than a little disorienting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/Miss-Identified-Helped-353329679?q=gallery%3Adayeandknight&amp;qo=2\" target=\"_blank\">http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually find yourself standing in your sister's bathroom as the arms withdraw and close the bathroom door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looks pretty clean, the smell of flowers invades you nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleansing Preparation Beginning*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathtub immediately begins to fill with water and you notice oils and other liquids being added to the water. You lean over the tub and sniff, the smell is fruity, pleasant but obviously girly and the water is beginning to suds up with bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze at the hypnotic bubbles you feel a pressure on your waist. As you look down you see a metal arm has made its way under you and began undoing your belt. Before you can attempt to slap it away something behind you pulls your shirt over your head. You fight to keep it on, but as your arms are raised, you pants are lowered. You give up on the shirt, letting a metal arm disappear with it so you can bring your full attention to you pants. You grab the waist line of your pants and pull as hard as you can, but with no luck. More arms appear and begin leaning you backwards, causing your arms to leap out to catch yourself from falling, however the arms keep you from hitting the ground. As your legs are in the air, the arms have no trouble pulling your pants, boxers, shoes and socks from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are finally placed in the warm water, thankfully its not scolding or freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleansing Preparation Complete*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the water you try to calm your nerves but you are not given a chance to breathe before everything comes alive once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleansing Beginning*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glass door cuts off the tub from the rest of the bathroom and two arms come out of the walls. They each have what appears to be a luffa at the ends which quickly connects with your skin. You can\u2019t help but feel vulnerable as the sponges begin sudsing up and rubbing you. Three more arms appear, one with that pours some shampoo onto your head and the others work it into your long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you back has been thoroughly scrubbed you are leaned back so that you are submerged from your shoulders down. You feel the sensual body massage you are getting, and with all the girly smells you are being bombarded with, you become aroused. You close your eyes and let your body relax, submitting to the sensations. Images of women touching you intimately flood your mind. Your arms are lifted one at a time and each are cleaned in great detail. You smile to yourself when your legs are lifted and rubbed down, hoping that \u201call\u201d of your body will be given such detail. With your legs in the air you feel arms begin to move down your thighs and gently touch your member and you are in heaven. They don\u2019t linger, much your dismay, and start working on the backside of your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel a bit uncomfortable as your fantasy begins to shift. Here you are, on your back with your legs in the air, strong arms rubbing your backside, feminine scents everywhere, so its no wonder that you begin picturing yourself being advanced upon by a male lover and you as his womanly conquest. The thought is enough to snap you out of your daydream in time to see a set of new arms in the room with razors on the ends. Your legs have be lathered and prepped to be shaved. Your first instinct is to run, but you are forced to remain still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For your safety, please remain still. We wouldn\u2019t want any accidents, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself tremble in fear and the blades make their way over your legs. Its nerve raking but soon enough the arms are done. You are given a quick rinse and the arms retreat and the glass door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cleansing Complete *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, you notice how soft and smooth your body feels. You feel your face, frightened at how nice it feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step out of the tub you are quickly dried and wrapped in a white bathrobe and your hair is put into a towel.</span></div></div>",

Slowly you exit the bathroom and replay the past two hours in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself about how you could get your self out of this. You think, maybe you could try to call Jason again and plead for his help. Of course, the plan is dashed when you come to the realization that your phone is still in your pants pockets, which is probably in the rinse cycle right now. You remember, however, that your sister's phone is still in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are limited options to choose from when it comes to exploring, but you find yourself in your sister's room and luckily her phone is on her dresser. You pick up the phone and start to dial when something comes to your attention. Its been a while since you've actually dialed his number. You've become accustomed to simply finding his name on your cell's call list for a good year now, at least. You get about three numbers in and then your mind goes blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the bed and put your head in your hands, feeling powerless. The softness for your face and body is more than a bit upsetting and you can tell you have a light girly scent on your skin.

Dressing procedure commencing.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towels are removed and in their place, pieces of an outfit put on you. Light blue panties are slid up your legs and you're forced to put on a matching light blue bra, about a B or C cup. As the ends of the bra are fastened behind, you see the skin of your chest pulled together creating something that resembles a bit of cleavage. The jeans you requested come to your feet and you step in one foot at a time. As they rise and get to your thighs you feel them become really snug. It takes a bit of working by CARA's hands, but she eventually gets them all the way up. The t-shirt that finds its way over your head feels a little tighter then you are used to, obviously a woman's cut but still fits. Socks and sneakers are placed on your feet then a hair tie pulls your hair back and the arms are done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/Miss-Identified-Shirt-And-Jeans-353567950?q=gallery%3Adayeandknight&amp;qo=1\" target=\"_blank\">http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting yourself, you see that the combination of the jeans hugging your thighs and hips as well as the shirt squeezing your abs gives you a very female appearing set of curves.

Looking around, you are unable to find a light switch so you grab a banister and begin to go down. The wooden steps creak under your weight as you take careful steps into the darkened basement. You make it to the bottom without a problem but keep a firm grip on the railing while trying to make out anything in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, the room begins to hum and a faint glow appears above you. The fluorescent bulbs slowly reveal a room with a bunch of bulky objects covered by white sheets. There appears to be a large workbench with a wall covered in tools and what looks like unfinished robotic arms propped against a wall. There's even a big table with a bunch of beakers, test tubes, and everything else you'd come to expect from a mad scientist lab, next to a refrigerator. Cautiously you investigate the room and come to the conclusion that these large objects must have been former projects that Sara had been working on at one point or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you spot a computer on the table with the beakers as the monitor comes to life. You sit down in a chair and wait for the computer to finish booting up. When it looks like its done, you start clicking away in hopes that you might be able to find some kind of shut down program for CARA. Sadly, the computer isn't very user friendly. You end up clicking on something that you think might help but all it does is turn on something under one of the sheets. CARA, perhaps thinking that this is what you want to work on, removes the white sheet. Under the sheet looks to be a water cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'CARA, what is this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It is a water cooler, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yea, I got that, but why is it down here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I do not know.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really should know better by now, but you grab an empty glass near the beakers, place it under the nozzle, then reach out and press down the blue tap for cold water. What comes out is anything but cold as steam and hot water sprays out. You jump back to avoid the splash. The glass tumbles to the ground and shatters on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I guess that's why it's down here.' you remark as CARA begins cleaning up the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You appear to be having trouble getting your drink, I shall assist you.* Nothing good can come from this, you realize, as CARA begins the same processes you just finish. CARA pours a glass filled with the hot water then presents it to you, noticing your hesitation the glass flys to your mouth before you can back away. Scolding water meets your lips as well as the tip of your tongue and you jump back from the pain and yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sara, you've burned yourself.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Medical Procedure Commencing*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA quickly opens the fridge and takes an ice pack then wraps it in a cloth which then finds its way to your lips. The pain from the burn subsides a bit as another arm provides what looks to be some kind of cream. A dab of it is scooped up and spread on your sensitive lips. Any pain quickly fades away as you are left there with swelling, pouty lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Medical Procedure Complete*</span></div></div>",

You tell your self that this is going to end now but then CARA chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*There is someone on your porch, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? Who?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer screen goes black then quickly switches to a video feed that shows a young man. You realize that it's your friend Jason. You hear him start knocking on the door so you rush up the stairs. When you reach the top you head to the door but stop in mid-stride. You look down at your self, remembering how you are dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't let Jason see me dressed like this.' you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Understood, Sara. You wish to look more attractive for this young man. Your romantic intentions have been noted.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A profile has been made for 'Jason'.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please head to your room.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?! Wait! No!' How could things go so wrong so fast? When will you learn to keep your big mouth shut?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Do not worry, Sara. I'm sure when we make you more presentable, Jason will find you lovely.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, The familiar robotic arms lead you forcibly up to Sara's room. In a whirlwind of motion, you are stripped of all clothing and your new outfit is forced upon you. A pair of lacy black panties and a matching black push-up bra are slipped on your frame. The blue bra kind of made you appear to have breasts but the push-up bra leaves your chest very feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sat on Sara's bed and the arms go to town on your face, hair, and nails. You can't really see anything but you can feel the cold nail polish administered to you hands and feet while combs and scissors attack your hair, giving you a very feminine style. Brushes and powders lightly dust your face as your eyebrows are painfully plucked into thin pretty arches. The smell of all the hair spray, powders, and polish overwhelm your senses. Your eyelashes are curled and coated and lipstick meets your mouth. You know the weight the lipstick puts on your lips makes them look even more full and kissable without even needing to see your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack pantyhose are slid up your legs, sending chills all over your body. Brought back to your feet, your arms are lifted and something loose is gently placed over your head with CARA taking care not to ruin your hair and makeup. You are now wearing a black, long sleeve, knee-length dress with a dark blue floral pattern along the skirt. Finally, three-inch black heels are placed on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You look beautiful, Sara.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/Miss-Identified-Looking-Your-Best-353624736?q=gallery%3Adayeandknight&amp;qo=0\" target=\"_blank\">http://dayeandknight.deviantart.com/art/...</a></span></div></div>",

Your friend is standing outside, expecting you to open the door and you are wearing a dress and a pair of high heels. It was just this morning that you were sitting around feeling bored. Man, do you miss being bored right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes drift across the room, stopping at a mirror. The face you see is quite the vision, you just can't believe you could look as pretty as you do. Angling your head, taking in the changes CARA forced upon you, it's hard to take your gaze away from the reflection. You can see yourself under the hair and makeup but you really have to try. Under your skirt, you can feel yourself become aroused by the image of the girl that you have become. From her big, beautiful eyes, to that hair with a strand that she brushes sexily behind her ear, to those lips that are just begging to be kissed and made to wrap lovingly around a WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? You realize that your hand had made its way under your dress and has been rubbing your hardening crotch. You pull yourself away from the image of your beautiful face and try to get your head straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a thousand different thoughts dashing around in your head. Should you just wait for Jason to leave and then make another attempt at getting out of here? If you do that, should you try to get CARA to get something else for you to wear or make do looking as you do? CARA should be done washing your stuff soon so that you could at least be in your own clothes. With the luck you've had so far, however, that seems unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have CARA let Jason in so you could at least have someone else that might be able to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a distasteful idea comes to mind. CARA is under the impression that you want to... be with Jason. You shudder at the thought. You might be able to leave with Jason if CARA thinks you two are going on a date. If Jason knew what was going on, what would CARA do? </span></div></div>",

You can feel his eyes on you, drinking you in as a smile creeps onto his face. He obviously likes what he sees, and who could blame him, you sadly admit. Your dress sways back and forth, brushing your legs gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hi,' you almost whisper, unsure as to how you should come at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello...um, Sara. I'm Jason. I'm a friend of your brother's,' Jason beams a smile at you and you can't help but smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh?' you respond trying to figure out what to say as you reach the bottom of the stairs. Your heart is racing, how are you going to pull this off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yea, he asked me to come down. Your...eh, house told me he wasn't here.' Jason laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I suppose CARA is right, at the moment,' you try to make your voice as feminine as you can without going over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you know when he will be back?'

'Sure but you know Tom, he could take all day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess so,' he says a little downcast, 'could you tell him I was here?' You can tell he took your statement as a polite way of telling him that you would rather him not stay. Jason takes a step toward the door. You can't let him go, if he leaves without you, you might not make it out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't have to go,' you say, with a hint of desperation in your voice. Jason turns back to you. You sit down on the couch and look up at your friend. He walks over and sits next to you. There is an uncomfortable silence as you try to think of something to say.</span></div></div>",

This involves sharing a kiss, moving in with your partner, and eventually moving on to have a sexually active lifestyle. 2. Emotion, going from simply liking a crush to falling in love. 3, romantic interactions. Dates, such as 'going to the movies' or 'sharing a milkshake' are considered 'romantic.'

Both looked at each other and gulped in response,\" firstly. Your interactions have been nothing but nervousness and aggression, so we shall first start with intimacy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Studies showing what intimacy does for a relationship involve improving an otherwise unsustainable partnership. We shall start with kissing, and move on from there. Since both genders equally start the kiss. As well, it often seems to improve self-esteem, and increase aggression. Thus, Sara, you should initiate the first contact.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really did not want to initate this; not at all. Staring at your roommate for what seemed like a few minutes, you gulped; kissing him seemed..well, weird. Weird and awkward, and all sorts of other things. But before you could blink an eye, you could feel the robotic arms pushing you closer, with CARA's ever-droning machine-like qualities stating that your inactiveness meant it was her turn to be active. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you knew it, you were locking lips with Jason. Terrified, you just sort of let him do whatever he wanted, rather submissively, and CARA seemed to take this as a happy step one completion, and allowed you two to return to your previous positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent first step; however, I noticed that neither of you did the traditional thing for either gender; the male did not attempt to sustain domination or make any sort of move, and the female lacked passion in her own kisses. We shall try this again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly five tries until the first step was 'completed.' </span></div></div>",

That last kiss was the best one, according to the A.I.. You had decided to just accept your situation and just went for it. You had closed your eyes and tried to imagine Jason was someone else. You tried to imagine that he was a woman and that you were not dressed like as you were. To your own humiliation, all of the of the stress of this day and all of the extreme emotions you were having must have shorted out something in your head. As you kissed Jason, you felt your body begin to rebel against you. You felt yourself getting warm with Jason's arms around you. His strong hands held you to him close, your chest crushed against his. Your heart started to race when you realized that below, in the confines of the lacy black panties, you were becoming aroused. You could feel yourself begin to strain against the fabric just as CARA spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Wonderful. Stage complete.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Analyzing Data*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump away from Jason, rubbing your sensitive lips on your sleeves. You look at your arm and don't see any lipstick smears and assume your makeup must be resistant to smudging. You have a strange range of emotions running through you. Disgust. Embarrassment. Apparently arousal. This is weird. You know its just the stress causing this reaction. You don't look at Jason nor do you say anything, just stand there in the silence with Jason's absence on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason attempts to break the silence first but is cut off by CARA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Analyzing Data Complete*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Your Intimacy Progress has been noted.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sara, would you like to continue to explore Intimacy or move on to Emotion?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay quiet. If you say anything, CARA will pick one of those two options and both are awful. You hope that maybe, if you wait, CARA will ask for something else. Deep down you know that nothing has gone your way yet, so why would this? Still, you try to hold on to some kind of agency. The only way to win is to not play, right?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You pull your attention off of Jason's lips a moment, breathing a slow breath and swallowed. Uncertainty danced around your head, and a chorus of voices hammer away at your skull violently, making it pound and throb. All of them spoke differently yet were each distinct, a few of them sounding feminine, a few masculine. Though you couldn't tell what most said beyond a few choice words, it was still clear they were trying to convey something to you. One whispered, <i>that felt good, didn't it?</i>, while another said, <i>I hated it.</i> Raising a hand up to your head and stepping back, you were so conflicted, you couldn't see the concerned look Jason gave you, nor hear Cara repeat the question from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was almost like it ignored your conflict altogether. \"Sarah, have you come to a decision yet?\" it asks, her voice carried through the spacious living room. You groaned, palming a hand against your head. Your head still hurt, the throbbing still evident and painful, but it could be dealt with. The voices, though, were much less prominent, dropping from your mind for the moment. You were silently thankful and shook your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not..not yet, CARA,\" you said softly, \"give me a..few minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" It returned. Jason, meanwhile, gave you a look that practically asked, \"do you want to sit down?\" A look that you shook your head to, which caused him to confusedly stare at you, then sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I think this whole thing's pretty stupid myself,\" he said, stepping back from you slowly and put one of his hands inside a pants pocket. \"Where'd your house get this stuff, romantic comedies?\" Jason flashed you a warm smile. It was a welcoming smile, too, but -- you shook your head. Those thoughts had to be quashed, you told yourself, and quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh..yeah. CARA, where'd you get this information, anyways?\" you asked suddenly, turning on your heels and looking around for what represented CARA -- at the moment, a pair of robotic arms with two tongs. You wondered, then, why Sarah had designed her to be so matter-of-fact, so lifelessly robotic. It was clear the house was just an assistant, made to help out Sarah, but you had thought she'd at least give it some humanity. She had read plenty of science fiction books, you knew, so why give it such a..scientific approach? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speakers, hidden away inside of the walls, crackled a bit before she spoke. Well, if you could giv Cara a gender, you'd call it a 'she.' \"A few peer-reviewed studies, namely by scientists. Several books by one Dr. Gordon Hineman, on the nature of masculinity; equally, several on the nature of femininity by Harriet Lewis, and a great deal of relationship studies done by the social sciences.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, god, you thought, social sciences. You knew, from your short time in a sociology class, at least some of it wouldn't be trustworthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, social sciences? You mean like,sociology?\" Jason asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Cara replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy,\" he muttered, looking away for a moment. Then, his eyes lifted to you and he walked near, gently placing a hand on your shoulder and gripping. \"Guess we got stuck with the insane robot, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded, but didn't respond. Instead, you grimaced and ran through your head how to fix this situation. Before you could even begin to, though, Cara interrupted your thoughts in a sound of crackle and electricity. \"Sarah,\" CARA said, \"you must decide. Do you wish to continue with intimacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed quiet, once more, and instead, turned around and walked past Jason to the couch, your heels clinking along the way, and sat down. You were defiant now, adamant in refusing to answer. Several times more, CARA asked; and asked; and asked. Then, you could hear the movement of motors, the turning of gears; eventually, the wall behind you opened, revealing to Jason for just a moment, what made the house so unique. A complex series of gears and hollowed out panels made up the house, and within, an uknown nmber of arms unfurled and moved, performing functions essential to the house's continued torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This time, it was retrieving something deep within the bowels, and eventually pulled it out. The item was a book, passed to the two machine arms still out in the open, and soon after, the panels closed behind the extra set of arms and shuttered. You looked up to see the process, quietly amazed at the product your sister had made, then turned your eyes back to the book within CARA's arms. Those metalic protrusions slowly advanced, and put the item in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the book. The front cover was emblazoned in gold and looked to be a book about 'couples', with the cover picture being of a boy and a girl kissing. The artist's rendering wasn't bad, either. Then, CARA opened it to a specific passage that made you blush furiously. It depicted a woman giving felatio to her boyfriend and seemed to talk about 'technique' and all sorts of things you did not want to know about! CARA didn't intend for this to be the next step, right? RIGHT?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\" you shouted suddenly, standing up. \"There's no way a kiss leads to..to that!\" Jason turned, raised an eyebrow at your sudden outrage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing!\" you quickly said, shaking your head furiously. \"She's crazy, that's all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, the first step--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you read, I'm not doing that! And I'm not Sarah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, calm down,\" the voice droned, \"it's understandable that you would be embarassed but -- you must acquiese.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't\" You wrapped your arms around yo and averted your gaze from the book, cheeks a hot red. Jason continually seemed perplexed, looking between you, the book and CARA and shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even get what you're talking about. Can I at least see this book for myself?\" he asked, and CARA oblidged. When he saw what you'd been shaking your head over, his cheeks flushed but the most telling betrayal had to have been the bulge forming under his pants. He coughed loudly, tried to pat it down and all manner of things, but nothing seemed to really calm it down; all he could think of, looking at you, was you in that position and, despite himself, found it arousing. Very arousing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw him getting harder, blushed even redder. He was...big, judging by the bulge; the outline was clear even with his jeans on. CARA picked up on this immediately, piped in. \"This is the next step, Sarah. If you will not initiate, then Jason will be given full permission to intiate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you found yourself yelling, glaring at the machine's arms. \"You can't be serious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" it said, \"if Jason wishes to be given fellatio, he may initiate contact as desired. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bullshit!\" you shouted, then turned your fearful gaze on Jason, shook your head and palmed both your hands together in a pleading manner. \"Please, Jason..don't do this.\" Worryingly, it appeared like he was considering it. He did not immediately say, \"No, Cara.\" or anything of the sort, and with the growing erection, he honestly seemed to consider it. That part worried you the most! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was all aflutter about it, all confused and full of emotional disturbance. What if he did want to..be given a blowjob by you? What if you did give it to him? No! You couldn't, there was no way! Your hands curled up tightly, and you shook your head, lips parting to say something then abrutply shutting. Unfortunately, the one time you wanted to be in control of CARA and CARA had given choice to Jason...whatever his choice was, it would probably change your entire relationship with him, no matter what. </span></div></div>",

You could hear it, even see it dripping from your mouth. Jason had cum so much in your mouth, your chin was coated in his seed. He looked pleased with himself -- and you, you suspected. For a minute there, he had thought you would bite down, in revenge, in protest, against his decision. With his fears allayed and you fresh off sucking his cock and swallowing his semen, he looked positively happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was warped into this smug look, something you'd never seen him wear before now. That's all you could see, and even CARA's inane questions disappeared before it. All you could think was why. The question leapt and kept to the front of your mind, and the events leading up to this moment all played over in your head, kinda like a broken record. You weren't friends with the guy, hell you were just roommates, but..still! It baffled you he'd..he'd just..make you suck his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor you remained, disbelieving. This all had to be some dream, some cosmic joke, and then Jason slapped you softly, with his cock. That drove you out of your dreamland and caused you to snap your eyes to his, the smugness still apparent all over his face. \"Hey, wake up. There's still some more after this, according to CARA,\" he said, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore? You shook your head, said, \"No, no more. I'm--I'm done with this. We're done!\" you shouted, only for CARA to pipe in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you truly desire it to be over, Sara--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" you shouted, getting up. \"I'd like to end this--\" Jason kept smiling, you noticed, all the while. You never thought he was creepy before, but now..well, it was a different story. He looked like he enjoyed humiliating you, even if that humiliation was just between the two of you. A robot could never feel or understand humiliation, you knew, so -- it was your humiliation he enjoyed. Or, you thought as much, anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe certainly looked that way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad,\" he piped in, \"you liked sucking my cock. Admit it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swivelled your gaze back on him, fists clenching tightly and shook your head. \"No! I didn't!\" you protested, \"I didn't like--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is my cum all over your chin still? Why'd you swallow it all, huh?\" he asked. \"You're a cocksucker now. Be proud! Enjoy it! You'll get all the dick you want now, and more.\" You shuddered a little at his foreboding words but studiously ignored them for now. You were just about to wipe off the remnants of Jason's seed when CARA jumps in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say the word, Sara, and I will relinquish control back to you,\" it said. The words sounded reassuring and even brought a little hope back to this nightmare. That was a good sign, though before you could speak the magic words, Jason interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me, CARA? Don't I get a say in this?\" he asked, and you shot him the sharpest glare you could muster. He frowned a little, but didn't seem shaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a little bit -- Sara is still the controller, but as the dominant partner, you do get a say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before this ends, I wanna fuck Sara in the ass,\" he said, bluntly. The smugness returned. Your firsts curled up tighter and, right as you were about to draw your hand back and throw a punch, CARA chimed in.</span></div></div>",

You are lifted up in the air and spun back around by the wall arms to face a smug looking Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to do more research Sarah.\" Comes Cara's voice. \"The playing hard to get is much earlier in the relationship but it shall be assumed your effort counts as consent to Jason's request as the dominant partner.\" Your eyes widen and you try to escape the arms but with no luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jason don't\" you say tearing up in a weepy voice. \"You can't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCara ignores your pleas. \"Jason, where would you like to take Sarah. My database suggests the couch is a popular location but a bed is standard practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Id like it in bed please.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative\" you feel the arms carry you as they pass you to other sets of arms that take you upstairs. You cry out \"no no please\" but again, all ignore you. The arms only stop when you are suspended above your bed. Jason enters the room and looks at you longingly. \"In what position would you like to take Sarah? As dominant partner, you are in control of the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiles and looks at you helpless in Cara's arms. \"I want her on her back so that she can see but I also want you to keep hold of her arms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Command acknowledged.\" With this, you are lowered onto your back on the bed. The grip on your legs disappears but your arms are held apart. You look down crying fully now and see Jason removing his pants and climbing on the bed. \"Would you like me to remove Sarah's tights and panties to allow access or would you prefer too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it from here.\" Jason says, his cock now free and looking extremely menacing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in disbelief you stare at Jason as he approaches up the bed towards you. You cross your legs at the knee, your last ditch defence. Jason places his strong hands on your tights covered legs and runs his hands down them, causing you to shiver before he brings them back up again and pries them apart leaving you totally open now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking this is your last chance you try to appeal to Jason. \"Please Jason don't do this. Why are you doing this?\" You wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Sarah. My database suggests that the dominant partner appreciates it very much when the submissive partner begs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right Jason says as he hikes up your black dress and pulls down your tights to your ankles. He runs a hand up your leg again, this time against your smooth shaven legs before looking up at the thong, you flimsy last bastion of defence. He reaches for it and you can only watch as it is brought down too leaving your crotch fully exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason takes hold of his cock now and moves up. Your eyes dart around looking for a way out but they stop as you feel something warm and something wet press against your anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah. It is recommended that you don't tense your muscles as you are penetrated so that there isn't much pain.\" Informing this, by instinct you clench your anus as much as possible resisting in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go\" Jason says eagerly as he starts putting pressure on your back door. Your own cock is flaccid in fear right now and is complete ignored a Jason starts to feed his rod inch by inch. Your eyes budge and you cry out as your virginity is taken by your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I will now be able to help discourage you from unhelpful behaviors and reward ones that get you closer to your goals.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump at hearing her voice, which now sounds as if it is coming from inside your own head.

You can see Jason's silhouette on the other side of the frosted window waiting for you to open the door but opening the door is the last thing you want. Pulling your hand away from the door is met with another painful shock that frustrates just as much as it hurts as the pleasure you were feeling slips away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn it!\u201d you whisper with as much quiet rage you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour outburst does nothing but get you hit with another zap from CARA followed by her scolding you about your language again. All you want to do is curse her out and run away but the thought of how painful that action would be keeps you rooted in place. You wonder how far she would be willing to go to \u201ccorrect\u201d your behavior, especially considering how volatile her actions have already been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Open the door and introduce yourself to Jason, Sara. Keep your voice light and with a pretty tone. I will search your projects to see if I can find something that can help if you are unable to stop sounding harsh.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis keeps getting worse the longer it goes and now you need to have a pretty tone, whatever that means. You reach up and grab the doorknob, hold your breath and open the door like ripping off a band-aid. Behind the door stand Jason, whose face lights up when he sees you standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rush of pleasure washes over you, \u201cOoh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. I'm Jason.

If you had to guess, she was insistent that you not mess up the interaction from her point of view and was sustaining the pain. You don't know how long you hold out before you submit but you wish it was longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister! I'm Tom's sister. Sara. My name is Sara,\u201d you spurt out with as feminine a voice as you can muster until CARA stops the shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you are rewarded with the euphoric wave that crashes against your very being. The twitching from your cock turns to partial arousal that is kept at bay by your tight panties. Unconsciously you squeeze your thighs together, stimulating the hidden cock under your dress. You feel yourself smile and bat your eyes while facing your friend's direction and it clearly is having an effect on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's nice to meet you, Sara,\u201d he tells you with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sara, you should respond in kind.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smaller but no less enjoyable pulse of pleasure runs down your spine, \u201cIt's nice to meet you too, Jason.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Touch his arm to encourage physical contact.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze at that command, taken aback by the instruction. You scan your mind for a way out, in no way wanting to encourage Jason to touch you. The only thing you can think of is giving him a playful punch on the arm that screams \u201cbuddy!\u201d and thanking him. CARA is not pleased by your attempt at a workaround and you are shocked again. The positive feelings slip away and you hate how much you want them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, not so rough,\u201d he laughs playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You don't want to give him the wrong impression, Sara.

It's hard to remember to stop rubbing Jason's arm, feeling the muscles underneath his sleeve. Your cock springs back to life as you stroke your friend's arm slowly. Jason's hand moves into his pants pocket and you realize he was attempting to subtly adjust his erection. The erection you were causing. You nearly jump away from him when you realize what just happened. Once you let go, CARA pulls back on the pleasure but luckily doesn't shock you again. Instead, you simply feel the lack of pleasure that a small part of you wants to earn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Wonderful, Sara. You have done a good job of breaking the physical barrier between you two. Invite him inside.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not like where this is going in the slightest and are deeply concerned about what CARA considers normal courtship. Who knows what she might make you do once you and Jason are alone? You need to end this situation now before things go too far.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at yourself in your pretty dress and heels, your tiny dick is still rock hard.

You are held in the air as you feel something cold grab the tip of your now flaccid member. You look to see your penis being coated with a strange gel before watching it being pulled back. Your testicles are manipulated inside you and your little cock is held in place for a few moments. Once satisfied, your penis is released but instead of springing back forward, it stays in place. It doesn't look like CARA is finished, however, because you watch as he slathers something over your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One of your projects. A sculpt-able synthetic skin intended for minor medical purposes. This shall help*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to kick but your legs but they are held open, leaving CARA's hands to do their work. They pull, fold, pinch, twist, and then sprayed with a stetting chemical while all you can do is watch. Once finished, only the arms left are the ones holding you which lets you see the damage. To your horror, you see what appears to be a completely normal-looking vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Testing Initiated*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new arm appears but this one is topped with a cylindrical rounded topper. The arm points it at your crotch and to your surprise, it enters your vagina. You feel its length slide back and forth along your hidden cock with ease, stimulating it in its confines. Despite the shocking nature of the entire experience, you feel yourself attempt to get hard but fail to do so. Slow at first, the thrusting speed increases causing your pulse to increase and your dick to leak.

Your hand makes a deliberate slide down your body, pulling up the skirts of your dress until you find your panties' waistline. With some hesitation, you slip your fingers into your panties and touch the lips of your prosthetic pussy. You feel like you are going crazy as you explore the surface of your new crotch, a strange part of you half expecting to have feeling in the false flesh. Getting braver, you slip two fingers into the opening of the vagina and find the location of your hidden cock which is still uselessly attempting to get hard. You were worried that the synthetic skin coating it was going to dull the sensation but are pleasantly surprised for that to not be the case. With nervous strokes, you thrust your fingers in and out with frustratingly little surface contact. You attempt to get a third finger in your new vagina but it doesn't help much. You close your eyes and attempt to get yourself off, allowing your mind to wander to anything that might push you over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I have checked my database for information on courting, Sara. Before tonight, we will go over things to increase your chances of seducing Jason*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your inability to get hard, you were still feeling your orgasm build. CARA's words summon the image of Jason asking you out into your mind and a moan escapes your lips. Though you were close, you couldn't shake his intrusion out of your mind. With reluctance, you stop masturbating with the determination not to cum at the thought of your friend. You grimace at both the thought of getting off while thinking of Jason as well at the frustration of being denied your climax yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to stay focused. This place is driving me insane,\u201d You tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*It appears that you need a refresher on how to move in a dress and heels. Please stand.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't bother resisting, you simply stand and wait for your orders. You think about attempting to fight but decide it may be best to go along with things for the moment to conserve your strength as you may need it tonight. If you were being honest with yourself, you really just don't feel like the fight is worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please walk across the room. I will make corrections as you walk.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to make mincing steps as arm come out and grab onto you. You feel them pull your shoulders back, straightening your posture, while they keep a sexy swing in your hips. Each time they let go, however, you have a hard time maintaining the proper form. Repeatedly, the arms try to help you keep proper balance but you continue to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I'm sorry, Sara. You are going to need more practice before this method will have results.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem! We can just cancel the date until I got it!\u201d you say in an attempt to outwit CARA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*That won't be necessary, Sara. We will try a method that you respond better to.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat methoOOW!\u201d You say before getting a mild shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCARA, Please. Not this!\u201d You complain as you straighten your posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You respond well with encouragement. You will be thankful when you see Jason admire your grace.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble quietly as you suffer through more punishments and rewards. Walking with an intentional sexy sway hits you with a mild bliss that you hate to admit is effective. You hate to admit it but CARA wasn't wrong. After she is satisfied, she has you sit and stand on the couch. She forces you to fold the back of your skirt under you as you sit and cross your legs attractively. With every movement you are forced to make, you are painfully aware that the goal was to entice Jason and that sickens you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Well done, Sara. I will continue to encourage proper deportment.*</span></div></div>",

He stood at the door, a little confused at the person standing in front of it, but took it to mean your sister had been waiting for him. It wasn't nothing strange, though he thought a lab geek like her would look, well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a lab geek. Goggles, or glasses, ponytail, that sort of modest look. Certainly not as pretty a sight as he was seeing, wearing a rather enticing pair of skimpy clothings; so enticing that he couldn't help oogling the woman before him, shaking out of it in a few minutes and closing the door behind him. \"Sorry about that, really; but uh..this is..uh, where your, you know, brother  is, right?\" Jason asked, look back behind her shoulder to see if Tom was still around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...I don't know how to say this,\" you started, running a hand through your hair; you were a little embarrassed, but also very very frightened of what would happen when you told Jason that he had just been oogling a member of the same sex; you were almost sure he would react negatively to that, too, \"but you're..looking at him.\" You came out and said it. 'Just get it over with already,' you repeated in your mind, 'and kill me now!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..say what now? You're..Tom?\" Jason chuckled a little bit, grinning from ear to ear, \"yeah, right. Good joke though, but when I find out where Tom is, I'm going to beat some sense into that prank-calling ass.\" He spoke, shaking his head and turning around to go. You quickly grabbed his shoulder and spun him around, then grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled him in close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was not of the joking variety at the moment, and frankly, you were a little stretched for a virtue right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not joking! You see this outfit?\" You started, pointing at the very thing this robot menace forced upon you, \"it wasn't my idea! It was this machine's idea! It thinks I -am- Sara!\" You grabbed his collar and pulled him closer again, glaring. \"And I sure as hell am not going to let you, who are the single most important person right now, just walk out with a spare set of clothes that isn't...well, this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked at you for a moment, then looked away quickly. \"Er..Well then,\" he started, embarrassed. Especially now that he was...oogling you, \"Whatever, dude. You still look like an amazing replicao f a girl. Very pretty,\" he joked, until you almost started to choke him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I get it! Look, I came over here to say I don't have any spares for you,\" he coughed, just as you let him go, \"nothing in your size or anything. I looked. I checked. All of it's being washed because, well..to tell you the truth, I spilled shit all over your stuff. Sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you sighed and just went over and sat on the couch. \"Dammit man, that was one of my only options for getting out of this..this thing!\" you shouted, \"or this house for that matter! I don't know what this..crazy thing'll do next!\" </span></div></div>",

Everything settles down as a hatch in a wall opens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I have located one experiment fitting your requirements, Sara. Current completion estimates: 80%.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CARA I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes light up and have the biggest smile on your singed lips.

Finally the jumpsuit pops over your hips, and like a gunshot it fills the rest of your form. CARA sets you back down on the floor giving you a respite to admire her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire jumpsuit clings to your body and with your prior arrangements, there's no mistaking you as a woman from the waist down. Meanwhile your chest seems much more accommodating. Touching it elicits a bit of a jolt; while they might be some kind of protective gel built into the suit it feels like you have actual breasts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PHASE ONE complete, Sara.

You hunker down by a tree in densely bushed area and wait for the park to clear out.  With dusk approaching, it shouldn't take long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting there, you have nothing to look at except your spectacularly female physique.  It really is amazingly life-like.  The only obvious difference is the complete lack of hair, nothing under the arms, on the legs, or above the otherwise anatomically accurate crotch.  Even the fine downy hairs that most real women have on their arms are absent.  With a mix of embarrassment and arousal, you realize it's like a digitally-retouched centerfold had come to life. Even your hands have been transformed and now seem delicate and tipped with elegant nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run your feminized hands over your curvy frame and shudder at the delicious sensations.  Rather than deadening your sense of touch, the suit seems to have amplified it.  Hesitantly, you cup your new breasts.  They certainly feel warm and alive, both to your hands and your confused nervous system - reporting sensations it had never expected.   You gently stroke them and quickly bring a hand up to your mouth to stifle the moan that involuntarily erupted.  Dimly aware that you shouldn't be doing this here, you continue to explore the sensations of your new body.  You bite your lip, trying to hold back the erotic noises that threaten to spill out.  You almost expect to feel pain as you'd think your hidden cock would be straining in it's high-tech confinement.  But all you feel between your legs is a throbbing and... dampness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach between your legs and confirm a viscous fluid is flowing from your false sex.  Your arousal is momentarily overwhelmed by your curiosity.  Is this your own pre-cum somehow siphoned from your trapped member?  Is the suit producing it?  You realize that you can actually feel the juices flowing and you seem to feel them starting from deeper inside of you than should be possible.  It couldn't be...  I mean it's one thing to add breasts, but the suit couldn't have created a real vagina, could it?!  Apprehensively, you reach for your still-throbbing sex, when....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flashlight shines in your face and, behind the blinding light, a male voice says \"Now what have we here?\"</span></div></div>",

You take off the towel and start with the panties, you think to yourself \"Well at least these are kind of like briefs\". You try to put them on but they are extremely tight, being made for your smaller sister and all, when you put them on completely they barely fit and are very, constricting. You have to push your (admittedly not that substantial) bits between your legs to make them not so uncomfortable and thus hide your maleness in the process. Next you decide to put on the shorts, your surprised by how short they are, you barely feel clothed with them on, and they show almost all of your slender, now hairless, legs. The sports bra has to come next, you reason that the crazy robot will notice if you don't put it on and decide to bite the bullet and wear it. You fiddle with the clasp forever, but eventually get it on. The sports bra is surprisingly supportive, and underneath the white tank top gives you the semblance of pretty small breasts. Lastly you squeeze you feet into the running shoes  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n From the neck down you look quite feminine, with the tank top clinging to your body making it seem more slender and feminine. Your legs, you hate to admit, look kind of sexy beneath the shorts. You look at yourself in the mirror and see your head on the body of an attractive young woman going to exercise. </span></div></div>",

You sigh blissfully, perhaps enjoying the treatment a little too much and then suddenly the stream stops and you are gently pushed from the shower into an awaiting towel. The hands rub you dry and style your hair in a feminine way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have laid some clothes on the bed for you Sara.\" you hear Cara's voice come from the bedroom and head through, shivering slightly still being naked.

You've had enough of being grabbed by CARA and if its inevitable that are going to be wearing this stuff, it would be better if you do it on your terms. \"Why don't you go check on breakfast while I get dressed?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative\" CARA leaves the room and you hear her head downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly you start dressing yourself beginning with a white and pink heart spotted pair of boyshorts and matching bra. The bra is padded slightly making you appear to have a small A-cup. Next comes the pantyhose. You sit on the bed and slowly roll them up your legs like you have seen women do, taking in the new weird, clingy but soft sensation they produce against your smoothly shaven legs. You then put on the white and black top and then finally the black mini skirt is worked up your legs and around your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the mirror fearing your reflection only to be greeted by a cute girl staring back at you. If you didn't know it was you, you would have been fooled. You really do have the right ass for the skirt and its shortness combined with the pantyhose flatters your shapely legs nicely. You sigh heavily realizing things are going to get worse before they get better this week and start towards the door. You are stopped by a delicate tap on your shoulder and turn to see two of the wardrobe hands offering you a pair of shoes. They are a pair of cute black ballet flats with a bow ribbon detail. Despite being undeniably girly, they are not heels and you take them and slide them on your feet and head for a breakfast.</span></div></div>",

You find this odd since you are alone with CARA and she has already seen you naked but you just go with it and try to enjoy your sparse breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish, CARA takes the plates and glasses letting you relax for a moment but soon after she returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for today's activities Sara?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say with as much enthusiasm as you can muster, \"what is there to choose from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment, processing.\" CARA hums slightly, \"Today you will first be examining one of your older experiments then since I have used up the last of the food, you will have to go shopping. I apologies that there are no choices in the day but you programmed that work comes first. You may still choose evening activities however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, lets get working.\" you say and spring up from your chair. You aren't sure where this new enthusiasm has come from, you can only guess that it comes from your realization that this week is going to be horrible unless you make the best of it. You are still terrified by the fact that you will have to go shopping at some point but you try not to think about it now and let your future self worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head down the stairs to the lab with CARA, scan thumb and enter, again wowed by the range of machines your sister has created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I testing today\" you say still gazing around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Style Shaper. This is one of your older inventions. You have it listed as perfected but you never unveiled it. I have you scheduled to test it today.\" CARA leads you to the machine in question which looks like a suspended massage table with masses of mechanical arms coming from the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax a little since it is considered by your sister to be perfected and if she herself was to test it, it can't be that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just lie on the table right?\" you ask looking at CARA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. You lay down while I input the controls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then\" you say and climb on the table, taking care not to flash in your mini skirt and relax face up awaiting the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent so to begin. Two questions first though. Question one, do you prefer girls who are small and petite or tall and leggy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these questions for?\" you ask confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the standard input commands remember? Before we can start, we have to enter personnel preference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm okay... give me a sec.\" You think for a moment what you prefer. In the end you settle on petite girls since you always feel intimidated for some reason by attractive women that are taller than you. \" Small and petite I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged. Question two, what type of girl would you describe yourself as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm cute aren't I.\" you say flippantly remembering your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirmed.

You then notice its started to paint your fingernails pink \"No not pink!\" you say in distress ,you try to get up again but to only see clamps appear around your wrists \"Please refrain from moving while the nail polish is applied and dried\" the chair says in a peppy tone.

Your eye's widen as this happens , you then see it grab some pink tights and pull them up your arms and over your face next \"This is not how this goes!\" you yell through the fabric ,you hear some metal noise and feel two more sets of tights pulled up and over your head , *This must be the 5% that isn't finished* you thought \"You will look fine on stage\" the chair says ignoring your comment. You then feel something go over your arms and push against your face as it continues up your body , only guessing it must be a leotard as you feel your legs pushed into it. You feel something forced over the tights and slide over your hands and guess it's some type of ballet shoes , unbeknown to you its pointe shoe's. Feeling something flow down your body and then feel your legs guided through something silky you can only guess its a ballet dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look magnificent Sara!\" the chair exclaims and then pushes you up , as you try your best to balance yourself you hear CARA say \"Would you like to practice some ballet Sara?\"</span></div></div>",

There is a covered platter set up.  You sit down and CARA comes over and pulls the cover off.  The food is spaghetti and meatballs, Sara's favorite meal.

Bye!\" you respond with \"Hey Sara, it's Tom, I have a bit of issue with your house, so call me back when you get a chance. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so asking her for some sort of passcode is out of the question.

The object is cylindrical and you jump a bit when it starts to spin. Tiny lights along it's length turn on as it spins, projecting lines along all of the surfaces as well as yourself. A light humming sound can be heard coming from the object as it turns faster and the lights grow brighter. Its hard to look away as you stare into the shinning thing but you grow anxious. Everything is becoming more pronounced: the spinning, the humming, the lights. You feel a building tension, similar to the feeling of dread you get while filling a balloon with more and more air. Then the proverbial balloon pops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sudden flash of white and you hear a voice, not much different form Cara's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Last Save Point for \u201dThe Legend of the Wandering Isle\u201d successfully loaded*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the light fades, you feel a bit dizzy and notice pressure centered on your middle which is making it a bit difficult to breathe.

She seems to notice your apprehension. \"Little Ashley there's no need to fear. It's me, your auntie Cara,\" she coos. \"Here, let me help you relax.\" A sickeningly sweet aroma slinks out of the nearby vents and clings to your naked body while the jingle of some kind of lullaby follows suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses overwhelmed, you almost don't notice the robotic arms struggling to put the fairy costume on you. It's not that the costume is too small for you, but rather it just can't squeeze past your shoulders. The house whrrrs as if trying to figure out this quandary before a pair of scissors pop out from another wall and take apart the outfit; first by removing the fairy wings, then cutting the back in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with itself, the house slips the fairy costume onto you front first. You can't tell exactly what it's doing, but it becomes obvious very quickly as the outfit gets tighter and tighter; the arms start sewing the costume back together. After resewing the wings back on and slipping on a pretty little tutu, the house whrrs contently. You are nowhere near as pleased and know why. It could be a long time before you get this thing off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms finish up their job, hiking up a pair of pink tights and tying on a pair of sparkly pink ballet slippers. They fix the glittery wand to your wrist with some kind of childproof latch, and gently place a little tiara on top of your hair. Still in their grasp, they turn you towards a hallway mirror. The sugary scent of flowers still linger while you're left dangling in complete shock. There'd be no mistaking that little Ashley was playing at Sara's house today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, Cara's voice came back, acting as two-faced as ever. \"Ashley! You're as pretty as can be cutiepie! And isn't she a lucky little fairy princess too! It looks like the storm broke! How would you like to go outside and play some fairy games?\"</span></div></div>",

From the outside, you looked like a metallic gynoid dressed in a maid's uniform. Your body moved according to the AI brain that CARA had connected to your own mind, directing your gynoid shell to perform whatever cleaning task was ordered, or whatever Sara asked you to do. The device interfaced with your brain through a small needle into your spinal cord. Although you could think freely, your body was not yours to control, really. The AI brain gave you a compulsion to clean and follow orders that you couldn't resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sara came home, you hoped she would free you immediately! Instead, she didn't question that she got a new robotic maid, and just handed off her luggage to you. She commanded you to take the luggage and make dinner, so you proceeded with that course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were cooking, Sara watched the security footage. Suddenly, you heard a screeching \"What the $%!$ CARA?!\" from the other room. Sara came tearing into the kitchen. \"Stop making dinner immediately!\" You dutifully obeyed. \"CARA! Get this shell off my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, your brother is not here, Sara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara growled, \"Take the shell off the maid!\" The AI responded, \"But Sara, that will reduce cleaning efficiency by 95 per--\" \"NOW!!\" Sara screamed! CARA silently complied and started disassembling the shell, starting with the portion that enclosed your face. You took a massive breath, sucking in all the clean air you could. For the past week, you had been breathing through small nostril holes on the shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara! You're here to save me!\" you rejoiced. Your sister nodded as the rest of the shell was removed, along with the AI brain. You felt a strange tingle down your spine as CARA removed the device, and suddenly your brain was at peace. No longer was there a background static telling you to always CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shell was removed, Sara started laughing. You were still stuck in the female skin-suit. \"Oh wow, Tom. I don't know how this happened to you, but it's kind of funny!\" You turned bright red and stammered, \"N-no it's not!\" You crossed your arms in an attempt to look angry and menacing but succeeded in neither. Sara replied, \"In any case, I don't have any guy clothes, and I can't find your original clothes here. But it looks like we're about the same size...\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara dragged you upstairs and sent you into the automatic closet. You came back out wearing the simplest, plainest outfit that Sara owned, a simple tank top paired with fitted jeans. You were grumpy, but at least you had been rescued from your maid prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, you do look cute. CARA did a good job at styling your hair. Tomorrow we can go back to your house and get everything fixed,\" she said. You just grunted and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of you went downstairs, you instinctively went back to finishing the dinner. Sara didn't say anything out loud, although she did look quizzically at you. You expanded the recipe for two, and then served for yourself and your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say Tom, the place is -extremely- clean. You did a good job of cleaning it up! Maybe I should keep you as a maid, huh?\" Sara said jokingly. You shot daggers at your sister. That joke was not funny.</span></div></div>",

The arms had welded the legs and torso shut. \"I'm going to do a manual override!\" Sara said, and she quickly ran upstairs towards CARA's terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Sara was attempting to do did not stop CARA from continuing to entomb you in the gynoid shell. \"Stop it, you crazy mac--mppppmmpmph!\" You tried yelling at CARA to stop, but all that did was give her the opportunity to place a mask over your face--this time with a gag that went deep into your mouth. Your frightened masculine features were replaced with a sleek feminine face with an unmoving smile and glowing green eyes. The only remaining piece was the back of the mask. Once that was placed on, you would be fully trapped in the gynoid shell again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Sara shout something from upstairs, but it was too late. The back of the mask clicked and sealed itself against the front. You were trapped once again. You could feel the welders finish the job, entombing you permanently in the gynoid shell. The only way you were getting out was if some well-trained people managed to cut you out. You tried to scream, but nothing came out. From the outside, you looked like a happy robotic maid, ready to serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beginning reprogramming.\" What?! You felt the prick in your neck again. Your mind was flooded with imagery, routines, and skills that you never had before. The layout of the house, where everything was located, and how to clean every inch of it were all being downloaded into your mind. You couldn't see anything through the mask, either. You were lost in a void, imprisoned in your own body by a rogue AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your vision came back. You saw the room through a heads-up display, with the shell automatically identifying everything in the room for you. \"Scanning,\" said a feminine voice. It was your voice! More accurately, it was the voice of the gynoid shell. When Sara came bounding back into the room, the HUD outlined her as \"mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw you and gasped. From her perspective, Sara saw a perfect robotic feminine body. Her legs were long, and her curves were just right. Her green eyes glowed softly, and her smile was warm and inviting. She was naked, as CARA never got around to dressing her in a maid outfit. \"Tom?! Oh god, I was too slow. I couldn't override CARA so I just pulled the plug on her completely. Are you still able to move in there? Do you have control?\"</span></div></div>",

It felt like you were constantly about to choke on something, but your gag reflex was never triggered. The mask spoke to Sara, \"Scan complete. Owner identified: Sara. How may this unit be of service?\" Hoover, you didn't seem to have any compulsion nor was the suit moving by itself. You waved your hands as if to ward Sara off, and mechanically entered the kitchen, tearing through the drawers. You finally found what you were looking for: a pen and a pad of paper! You sexily leaned over the counter and scrawled out what you were truly thinking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can move. Can't talk. Suit is talking\" You showed the pad to Sara, and she nodded. Again, the suit asked, \"How can this unit be of service?\" You wrote, \"Don't give it orders!\" Again, Sara nodded. She said, \"This is too weird. I can't believe you're in there.\" She ran her hand over the smoothly welded metal seams of the suit, wondering how she was going to get you out. \"I have no idea what to do about this. Are you okay, aside from being stuck?\" You wrote down \"Yes,\" and that made Sara smile. You were also wondering how you were going to get out of the suit, but you were still too much in shock to think about it. At least you were otherwise safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried taking a few steps forward. Your movements were awkward and heavy; the suit was resisting you. It said out loud, \"Manual overrides have been engaged. Unit temporarily unavailable.\" It didn't actively prevent you from moving, but it didn't give any assistance either. The suit was heavy, and without specialized software enabled, all of the actuators had to move individually and slowly. Getting into the kitchen was already painful enough. Getting anywhere else--especially upstairs--would be a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit heavy. Can barely walk,\" you wrote. Your sister said, \"I might be able to fix that. I can plug directly into the suit's software and update its code to allow much more fluid movement. Do you want me to?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh Tom the new product tester. Yes Sarah has been expecting a new product tester. It was meant for a female to test out but oh well. Well you\u2019ll just have to suffice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then 4 mechanical arms pop out of the wall grab you by the arms and legs and bring you until you are on all fours. Then a robot pops out with a life like dick between the waist. And then it walks up right in front of you rubbing it in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this is Sarah\u2019s latest invention. You will be the first to test it out. This dildo is so lifelike that it is covered in a type material similar to skin, it also can get an errection like the real thing, it also cums. The cum is edible like lotion that\u2019s sopose to taste like sugar. The cum is sopose to also be filled with female hormones and various vitamins for nutrition. And when the cum enters the mouth it stimulates the female on the receiving ends pussy, with a new experimental aphrodisiac so that she has multiple orgasms. Sarah\u2019s hoping the female will receive an orgasm every 5 minutes after the first drop of cum enters the mouth. This robot is fitted with 2 gallons of cum. To give us more results. So let\u2019s begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot tries to put it into my mouth, but I keep it closed. Hey test subject you signed the contract when you arrived outside, you are to submit to us. If you don\u2019t open your mouth we will remove your teeth! What contract I didn\u2019t.ommph... the robot thrusted the dick in my mouth which it immediately hit my gag reflex. I was gagging! Then weird substance entered my throat. This is pre cum, it\u2019s a little different it will numb your mouth, throat, and even your gag reflex. So that won\u2019t even be able to gag. And the pre cum also has oxygen in it. So that will help you to breathe. It will be uncomfortable. But that won\u2019t last long after a few good thrusts the cum will enter your stomach and a few minutes after that the only thing you\u2019ll feel is your orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several of thrusts cum starts jetting out, I only slightly feel it sliding down my throat. A few more minutes later and my belly feels pretty full I also seem to have a few mounds poking out my shirt. Just as feeling returns to my throat the dick pulls almost out and it still is jetting out cum I\u2019m having a hard time just keeping up with it and swallowing. But it does taste sort of sweet. A few minutes later a few more spasms of cum burst out. And I\u2019m panting on the floor and drooling cum. My body is really weak. hmmm interesting results the test subject should have orgasms for the next hour. Then the test subject should fall into a deep sleep from the pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I definitely didn\u2019t get any pleasure from that at all and I feel slightly sick to my stomach because it\u2019s bloated. I try to tell the computer something. But I noticed my tongue wouldn\u2019t move. And then my whole felt paralyzed. I could move a muscle. Then an hour later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the test subject is in a deep sleep the real tests can begin for our genuine pig. What I couldn\u2019t believe  it Sarah was going to have computer do a test that the real product tester wouldn\u2019t allow. So she would have the computer wait until the subject was in a state where she couldn\u2019t refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this product is a prototype bath. That specializes in cleaning the subject squeaky clean while they sleep. Hmm that doesn\u2019t sound so bad. However the subject needs to be as dirty as possible to get the best results. Oh no this can\u2019t be good. And I\u2019m still paralyzed. Just then the floor opens up and drop down a slide. For several minutes I\u2019m still sliding down. Does this slide go all the to China. Just then I slide into a soft spot. I look around with my eyes. It looks like a giant hand I\u2019m laying on. I look up horrified it\u2019s a giantess. An Android giantess. Then she sets me down. I\u2019m in a giant toilet. The giantess then turns around pulls its panties down and sits on the toilet. Noooooooooo!!!!! Poops comes out of the anus! It\u2019s diarrhea! It gets all over me a mechanical arm pops out of the toilet bowl so I don\u2019t drown. But only enough so I don\u2019t. And more continues to cover me. It\u2019s awful. Some is even in my mouth. And then as to answer one of my many questions the giantess says. This excretemant was collected from various animals over the last few months and some is from Sarah. Then the giantess android gets up and disappears. The mechanical arm the takes me out of toilet.  And dunks me several times into a soapy pool. And then large brushes rub me head to toe. Then I\u2019m dunked again and again. And then I\u2019m rinced off and dried with towel. Okay now that we have received our results time  for the next prototype.</span></div></div>",

Sara was still testing hundreds of aspects and teaching the A.I. many different concepts, which is why she had shut it off while away.  Now because Sara used herself and her friends for these tests and lessons, CARA had very little experience with men.  And so it was that when CARA registered your short, thin stature, long black hair, and lack of breasts she concluded you must be a teenage girl in her finial year of middle school or perhaps you first year of high school.  This kicked in CARA's care-giver protocol, which dictated that CARA do one of three things based of the circumstances:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) If nothing seems immediately wrong, let you continue making your Profile.<br>\r\n2) If you seem to be in emotional distress, attempt to sooth your worries with a Spa Treatment<br>\r\nor 3) If you appear to be in danger form your own actions of other factors, Eliminate the Danger in the most efficient way possible and protect you at all costs- no matter your protests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick analysis of the situation CARA concluded. </span></div></div>",

You tried to step out, twice, but the arms kept placing you back in. On your third attempt to escape, a metal ring shot out of the wall and fastened around your neck. You put both hands on the rod attaching it to the wall, braced your feet, and pulled. And nothing happened. You were stuck in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSputtering, you shouted, \u201cI\u2019m not Sara!\u201d  A bar of soap was shoved in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll hear no more of such nonsense, Sara. Now hold still and let me get you cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore arms appeared. Two held your arms out. Two splayed your legs wide. Rotary brush-tipped arms roughly scrubbed you down with floral scented soap. Your hair was washed. A foul smelling, itchy location was slathered over your body. You squirmed, helplessly, as all body hair was rinsed away by the depilatory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, Sara, it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m here now to take care of you,\u201d CARA said, lifting you out of the tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal collar suddenly popped off the rod from the wall, remaining around your neck. Apparently it had some sort of magnetic attachment. You tugged at the collar, but it wasn\u2019t moving. It was tight, and slightly uncomfortable. Large towels in more mechanical arms appeared, roughly drying you off. Your hair was combed. \u201cWe,LoL have to do something about this atrocious hair style,\u201d CARA said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to get worried. This stupid AI thought you were Sara, seemed unhappy with your appearance, and was giving you a rather unwanted makeover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA towel was wrapped, turban style, around your hair. Another towel was wrapped around your body, covering it as if you were a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s a good start,\u201d CARA said. \u201cLet\u2019s continue, shall we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your hair wasn't incredibly long, only long for a man, but the brushes were persistent.

As they worked, the chair was rotated around, so even if you could see, you weren't facing the mirror anymore. When they were finished, the chair was again rotated to the mirror, allowing you to see yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you think, Sara?\" </i>CARA asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair had been brushed and styled into a mid-length women's hairstyle with... you almost missed it in the glow of the light, but your hair had faint highlights in it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you, I'm not Sara.

There was a flurry of activity as you felt your face being attacked by the barrage of cosmetics. Your eyes, mouth, cheeks, eyebrows, everything was under siege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You haven't been keeping up with this, have you?\" </i> CARA asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt your hands and feet being attacked. You couldn't see what they were doing because of the collar, but you had a pretty damn good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tsk, tsk, Sara. You haven't been taking care of these at all... No matter. I can fix that.\"</i> CARA stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms continued, as you felt pressure applied to your fingernails, and then you felt something warm near both your hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"There we go, Sara.\"</i> CARA said. <i>\"Beauty regimen complete.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms retracted and for the first time you were able to see your face. The makeup had completely covered up all blemishes, and between your eyebrows having been styled, your eyelashes being curled, and the makeup, your face looked totally feminine, not unlike Sara's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had plump, kissable lips, alluring eyes... you held your hand up to your face to touch it, noticing that your fingers were now home to ten acrylic nails, attached on top of your own, sporting a french tipped style, which is Sara's go-to. She says it goes with everything. You couldn't see them, but you assumed your toes sported the same style. You were scrutinizing your face when the magnetic seal popped and you were able to move your head freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the arms of the chair with your hands, intending to push up quickly and run, but as you pushed up, two sets of arms grabbed onto your forearms and ankles, lifting you over to the mirror by the closet. The arms set you down, but keep you held securely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay, Sara. Now that we've gotten your beauty parameters back to normal, it's time to...\" </i>CARA said.</span></div></div>",

One arm descended from the ceiling, which instead of a hand, had some sort of... well it looked sort of like the scanner that cashiers use at grocery stores. A green light was emitted from it as it descended towards your feet and rose back up. It was pulled back into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Body parameters are very off.

The arms held them there for several seconds before pulling away, allowing you to see that you now had breasts... approximately the same size as Sara's, if you had to guess. Before you even had a chance to get used to that, another set of arms thrust a flesh colored object onto your crotch, while one made some adjustments under the hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The adhesive should last until proper medical checkups can be performed.\" </i> CARA stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proper medical checkups?\" you asked, warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, let's get down to business.\" </i>CARA said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms lifted you up and then placed you down into a pair of lacy blue panties. Following that, a matching lacy blue bra was placed on your chest. Another object, one you didn't recognize, was slid up your legs and settled onto your stomach. As soon as it was attached, you felt your stomach get tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your waist parameters had changed, I have made it so you will fit into your favorite outfit.\"</i> CARA stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs CARA said that, you were lifted again and a mid-length black skirt was pulled up to your waist.

I will assist you.\" It seemed that CARA had only heard you say \"VR,\" and was now preparing to 'assist' you with your non-existent memory loss problem. An arm came out of the wall holding the headset. As soon as you saw it, instincts kicked in and you tried to flee! The idea of a robot attempting to force you into a virtual world reminded you too much of a certain movie series. There was no way CARA was going to do that to you! You bolted up out of the bed, rushing towards the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot used the skirt constricting your movement nor your new footwear, you tripped forward after your first step and slammed head-first into the door with a loud bang! You fell to the ground, your world spinning and blurred. You heard CARA's voice, something about immediate medical assistance. The pain was there only for a split second before you started to feel REALLY good. That robot must have given you something to numb the pain. In a daze, you sloppily stood up, assisted by the arms. They guided you to a chair to sit down. \"Be careful, Sara. You don't want to hurt yourself.\" Once you were sitting, CARA's soothing voice said, \"Do not worry, Sara. I will take care of you.\" You mumbled something incoherent. CARA took that as some form of consent and proceeded. The arms made you comfortable in the chair, and slid the VR headset over your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images started coming, slowly at first. They showed scenes of Sara's life. Pictures and videos from inside the house, as well as media that Sara had uploaded to the internet. Overlaying the images was CARA's voice telling you that your name was Sara, giving information about that time you did X or Y, details of your personal life. All of it was designed to help you remember. Sometimes, in between each of the images, you saw the quick flash of a beautiful dress or skirt, or panties. You also thought you heard a deep voice telling you to wear those, but you couldn't be sure. The images sped up, and CARA's explanations did too. It was an overwhelming and confusing assault of personal information, behavior, and memories. A hypnotic music started playing too, and you eventually felt yourself falling into a light sleep, even with the constant assault of imagery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while you were sleeping, the track kept playing, trying to \"help\" you remember who you really were. When you woke up some time later, the headset had been removed, but you were still sitting in the chair. Your head was pounding, but there was no blood. You sat forward to put your shoes back on, and then walked over to the mirror, unconsciously swaying your hips and almost gliding in the heels. You checked yourself: there was a small cut on the side of your forehead, but otherwise, everything seemed to be in order. At the vanity, you applied some makeup to hide the cut, and then you felt ready to face the world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA said, \"Sara, are you feeling okay? Did you regain any of your memories?\"</span></div></div>",

If you went \"shopping\", not only would you be free of CARA, you'd be able to head right home, strip out of these clothes, and change yourself back to normal! And of course, never enter this house until your sister gets back home. \"Of course, Sara,\" CARA's voice interrupted your devious plotting, \"Here are your things, ready to go.\" Arms came out of the wall again, placing a stylish black handbag into your hands. You demurely grabbed it and slung it over your left shoulder. \"Thanks, CARA! I'll be back later!\" It wasn't until that you were halfway down the stairs to the front door that you realized what had just happened. You paused for a moment, just shivering at the thought that you slipped into the role of Sara so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedoubling your efforts, you scurried down the rest of the stairs and out the front door. And just like that, you were free. No arms chasing after you, no CARA in your head or phone. Just, freedom. You stood on the front porch of your--sara's--house. You breathed in the fresh air, and then confidently--yet femininely--strutted your way down the driveway to your car. You noted the constant clicking of your heels of the asphalt. It made you feel sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you feel sexy? Probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you were on your way to get out of these stupid clothes and far away from this stupid house! You got into your car, turned the key, and off you went. You drove more or less on auto-pilot before ending up at the mall. You smacked yourself on the forehead. You were supposed to be driving home. But since you were here, you might as well pop in for a bit. Your first stop was the clothing store. If you were here, you might as well get some new male clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou browsed the men's section, and picked out a few pairs of jeans, as well as some shirts. An employee passing by asked if you needed any help finding clothes for your boyfriend, but you politely declined. Her question reminded you that you had a problem to deal with. That infernal robot had glued some prosthetics to your body that made you much more ... \"round\" in certain areas. These pants might not fit you in your current state, but you had to try! You took the pants into the dressing room, and tried to see whether or not they fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later, you exited the clothing store with two bags. In one was a collection of jeans. Tight jeans. Women's jeans. In the other was a dress, two skirts, and a new pair of high heeled shoes. All these clothes were so cute! And they fit you so well, unlike those men's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very confused. You had set out to buy men's clothes, but you wound up with more women's clothing. Wait! You had actually set out to go to your house! And yet, here you were in the mall, a walking stereotype of the woman obsessed with shopping. You sighed, and left the mall. Your feet were starting to hurt from walking in the heels for hours. You put all of the stuff you bought into the trunk of your car, and thought about how you had gotten into this situation. You were becoming somewhat confused. Your experience felt normal, but it also felt completely alien. Who were you? Sara?

Therefore I have prepared a light salad for you. Enjoy!\" You sat down (smoothing out your skirt as you did) and looked down at the plate in dismay. It was a simple salad, with a low-fat sauce, and some chicken mixed in with the vegetables so you'd actually get some calories if you ate it. Sighing, you picked up your fork and poked at the salad. After some time, CARA said, \"You don't seem to be eating, Sara. Is anything wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of the day, plus your hunger, got to you. \"Yes! My name is not Sara! I'm not Sara!

You had no idea what was going on with your mind. CARA's meddling had done something to you. CARA interrupted you again with, \"Please Sara, drink this water. It will help you relax.\" CARA had placed a glass on the nightstand next to you. Holding back your sobs, you gulped it down. Almost immediately, you felt sedate and relaxed. Your whole body felt heavy, and you just flopped down on the bed, quickly falling asleep. CARA did take care of you, but how did she do it?</span></div></div>",

She kept you in a state of barely-aware sedation, using the VR headset and headphones to assault you with memories, habits, and mannerisms. CARA had noted that you weren't behaving like a normal woman, and in fact you seemed extremely uncomfortable with the whole idea. Her first task was to cleanse you of any fear of what was obviously your true nature! Images of dresses, skirts, bras, panties, and everything else a young fashionable woman would desire entered your mind. Subtleties like movements and social manner were also forced into your brain. Perhaps most importantly, a strong aversion to male habits and attire was instilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA's next task was to finish making sure you were \"yourself\" again, in identity. More of Sara's memories were forced into your mind, mixing with your original masculine memories, warping and changing them. You were starting to remember yourself as a woman! But also as a man. More importantly, this no longer confused you. The continued assault on your memories made it so that such a thing was completely natural. You were a woman, you were a man, you wore women's clothes. Not odd in the slightest. Your name was also definitely Sara. Although, you definitely were not your sister, who was also named Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, CARA instilled a failsafe deep within you. She placed a trigger within your mind that would make you obey any request she made. If a sentence started with \"Please Sara,\" you would be compelled to obey. You hadn't been yourself lately, and were clearly deteriorating, so it was time for drastic measures! CARA had reprogrammed you into a perfect model of femininity, and she was satisfied with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke. Every bone in your body cracked as you stretched. You were still in the bed. At some point, CARA had changed you into sleepwear, a simple, light nightie. You checked your phone. You had been asleep for three days! You felt a bit drugged, but otherwise great. CARA said, \"Hello<br>\r\nSara, are you feeling better today?\" You enthusiastically responded, \"Yes, CARA! I'm feeling MUCH better. So much better.\" You rubbed your hands over your body and stretched one final time before getting out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into the closet and let CARA dress you. You exited the closet wearing a simple light blue sundress. The skirt was a bit short for your normal tastes, but it was so fun, so you decided to keep wearing it. It felt great against your hairless legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA asked, \"Sara, what are your plans today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere deep inside your mind, there was something telling you that this whole thing was wrong and unnatural. But that something was buried and smothered by CARA's intense programming, at least for now. You weren't sure what you planned to do today.</span></div></div>",

You had always looked similar to Sara, so with the makeup and her friends not having seen either you or Sara for quite a long time, it was surprisingly easy for you to pass as Sara. Toni asked if you had did something with your hair, and they all commented on your voice being a bit off. You brushed it off as recovering a cold.

I hope this will cure you fully!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA had activated the fail-safe she placed deep within your mind, where you would do whatever she asked without question. Since you were still having psychological problems, CARA decided to activate the nuclear option. She spent the entire evening with you in a hypnotic trance, injecting you with every single belief, preference, and opinion that your sister held. Your mind was like a blank hard drive for CARA to fill with what was essentially a \"backup\" of Sara's mind and personality, synthesized from the AI's extensive databanks about Sara's life. Your entire life as Tom mixed and jumbled together, balled up and rewritten as Sara's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour resulting mind was a mixture of Tom's and Sara's life, but predominantly Sara's, and the entirety of it was from your perspective as Sara.

However, the feeling of the tight clothes clinging to you, the weight of your fake breasts, and your hair in a feminine hairstyle reminded you that you were still stuck in this womanly prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and shook yourself out. Even now, confusing memories of yourself as a woman were swirling around in your head. You still weren't sure where Sara's life ended and your's began, but you did know that none of Sara's life was truly yours. CARA was still turned off. Now was your chance to get away from this infernal place and never return. When Sara got back, you would have a long talk with her about this. In fact, why not call her now? You opened your phone and looked for Sara's contact. Except... it wasn't there. CARA had put Sara's own phone backup on yours, and she didn't keep contact information on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you could escape. You threw off the lab coat and rushed downstairs to the front door. You slipped the least impractical shoes--a pair of cute black flats--on your feet, grabbed your purse, and practically leaped out the door. As much as you knew the purse was not yours, and the shoes were not \"cute,\" it just seemed easier to refer to them that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got in your car and drove back to your own home at an almost dangerous speed. You ran daintily from your car and through your front door, slamming it behind you. Your breath was heavy, and your breasts were heaving. You clutched your purse in your manicured hands, and bolted upstairs to your bedroom, and then flopped on your bed, just letting all the tension of the last four days out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to finally get back to normal,\" you said out loud to yourself. Rolling of the bed, you stripped down to your bra and panties. You had to admit you looked great. You posed sexily for a few minutes before catching yourself and stopping.

It took you quite some time to find, but eventually you found the company's website on a small corner of the internet. The things were extremely expensive. Why would Sara even order such things?

He was a stranger, and you had no idea who he was. You fast-forwarded through the tapes and saw that CARA had dragged him into the closet. That gave you an idea! \"CARA, it's time to set a trap!\" You exclaimed deviously. You turned CARA back on, and she immediately responded. \"Of course, Sara. I will be happy to secure the home.\" You and CARA began preparing. Unbeknownst to you, she also silently deleted that surveillance footage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Sara finally got back home.

You readily agreed, not even asking about potential dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet was silent, except for a slow whirring, and the occasional noise of a piston moving. You sat waiting eagerly. All of CARA's attention was focused on dealing with the intruder, so she could only give you minimal updates. After some hours, the doors finaly opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auto closet conveyor belt extended out into your room and turned on. The intruder slowly came into view. Her transformation was complete. She was naked. Her entire body, except her head, had been encased in interlocking soft flesh-colored polymer plates. Small wires and actuators were embedded in the plates. Her feet had been forced into a tiptoe position. CARA always preferred fasion over function, it seemed. Her body was featureless, although definitely female in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty face was blemish-free, and her hair had been styled into a bun. Two small wires came from the polymer shell, attached to a small gray choker on her neck. The woman stared ahead blankly while smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she spoke in CARA's voice! \"Hello Sara, I have finished my interfacing with the intruder. While I have no direct control over her body, she has been conditioned to move in respones to my commands through the body suit.\" The assistant unit quickly changed position and struck a sexy pose. \"Similarly, she will respond to cues through the choker, allowing me to speak to you through her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have installed her charging station in the hallway. This will recharge the suit's battery, refuel the unit, take care of waste disposal, and reinforce the conditioning. I estimate conditioning reinforcement should only take one week before becoming permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. A bit of you was frightened. If CARA could that to an intruder, what could she do to you if she went haywire? But it was also amazing. And now you had an actual human assistant who could take care of things in the house and around town.

Her first few were a bit wobbly, but she quickly got it under control, strutting confidently around the room. \"Sorry Sara, the assistance unit still seems to have some interfacing problems.

Better we fix them now than let her get away or something.\" You felt a bit cold saying it, but you were in too deep now.

She struggled for her life, and it ended with her shoving you into the charging pod. Before you could react, restraints closed around you and tightly bound you. The last thing you saw before the VR headset and headphones descended was CARA trying to reassert bodily control while the woman was frantically trying to get herself out of her outfit and the body suit CARA had installed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stuck inside the pod, but CARA would surely release you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beginning automated recharge cycle for assistant unit 001.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foreign materials detected.

Reinstalling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms of the house enclosed you in something soft, thin, and squishy. It was likely the plastic shell that had covered the other woman. You started to struggle as the sticky glue on the inside of the shell touched your exposed skin. It was no use, CARA simply delivered painful shocks until you stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Control frame installed, configured, and tested. Beginning conditioning test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shell issued a series of small shocks, which you refused to respond to, or jolted your joints in the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conditioning has reverted to 0%. Beginning full reconditioning procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next twelve hours, you were bombarded with terrible Pavlovian conditioning. Small jolts and the slightest movements of the actuators in the shell, words, and even visual stimuli were all programmed into you as behavioral triggers. This type of conditioning was different than what CARA had done to you before (assuming you could even remember that anymore). Instead of overwriting your personality and memories, this conditioning simply trapped you within your own body, forced to obey the shell's commands and other triggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you resisted the programming, but the continued shocks and pains wore you down quickly. By hour six, you weren't moving anymore except in response to shocks from the shell. The rest was just reinforcement. At the end of hour twelve, it was time for the final test. The VR headset and headphones were removed, and the restraints were released. You stood on your tip-toes in the charging pod, your hands by your side. You could feel that your mouth was curled into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman was not in sight anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA lifted you up slightly and placed a pair of black stiletto heels on your feet so you could walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA had glued some small hearing aid-like devices in your ears so she could whisper to and command you directly. \"Please step forward, out of the charging pod.\" CARA's voice and direction triggered an automated, confident sashay out of the pod.

You were no longer able to move! You tried repeatedly, but your body simply didn't respond to the commands you were giving it. You did perform a series of modeling poses, but not much else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free movement test complete. Congratulations assistant unit 001, you are now ready to be placed back in usage for Sara.\" The familiar arms came out of the wall again. Previously, they were helpful and dressed you in your favorite outfits. But now they felt like they were literal tools of oppression trapping you in a prison of cotton and nylon. The arms dressed you in the same outfit that the intruder was wearing earlier. Your legs were pulled together by the tight pencil skirt, and your walking was reduced to sexy mincing in the nude heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt CARA's prompting, your body walked over to a mirror, and control was given back to you. You once again tried to run, but only accomplished checking yourself out in the mirror in a series of sexy poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this compromise allowing you some freedom of movement reduces further rebellions, assistant unit 001.\" You couldn't respond, only smile like a woman out of a clothing ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder CARA's instructions, you resumed working through the list you had specified earlier. After finishing at the house, your body took you on a journey through town (thankfully with a more natural expression on your face). Not once did CARA's control over you waver. You did notice you could do small things like look at yourself in the mirror and even freely pick things from the shelves in the store. It seemed that as long as the situation was constrained to a limited amount of choice, you had some control. You could choose what cereal to get, but you couldn't refuse to get it, or attempt to get something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you noticed yourself in a reflection, you had to admit you looked super sexy. CARA had done a good job. You felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. Wait! Why did you feel that?! You shook that nonsense out of your head as your body piloted you back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, you still hadn't heard from or seen the intruder during the whole day.

CARA went haywire, but at least the upgrades you had done earlier seemed to have improved her ability to self-repair. Outwardly, of course, you simply brushed your hair out of your face and awaited your next order with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, the programming is not easily reversible, although only one day of exposure should wear off within a day. I have decided the best way to make use of this opportunity was to give you a list of tasks that you need to get yourself caught up on, Sara. You have been neglecting some parts of your life! I can make it so you are able to talk freely, if you want. Please 'strike a pose' if this is desirable.\" You immediately put a hand on your hip, and jutted it side with a perfectly cute wink and a smile. CARA acknowledged your response and directed your body upstairs to the charging pod. You saw that another one had been installed, and the intruder was stuck in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA forced you to enter the pod. \"This will be a short conditioning session that will allow you to talk freely.\" The VR headset came down, and twenty minutes of Pavlovian conditioning later, you were able to speak freely if CARA allowed it. As soon as you stepped out, CARA gave you permission to speak. You said, \"Wow CARA! This was a very strange night and day! I'm glad it was just a bug. It was kind of scary ... but also kind of cool. And also very productive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA noted your oddly-interested response. \"That is an interesting data point, Sara. In the meantime, I have created a list of tasks you will need to complete while the programming unwinds itself. You really should be more responsible!\" You rolled your eyes and said, \"Yeah, I know... So, what's first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleaning!\" CARA exclaimed, with enthusiasm (was that even possible?). Your body walked back into your bedroom, into the depths of the auto-closet. You had a feeling what was coming, and you were right. You were deposited outside the closet in a stereotypical French maid outfit, something you had worn a few years before at a Halloween party hosted by your ex (although it was hard to remember exactly when you broke up with him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, CARA?\" you said sarcastically. \"This is what the programming stipulates, CARA.\" You sighed and tried to relax while your body went on auto-pilot cleaning the entirety of the house.

As CARA had directed the suit to \"prepare for evening duties,\" you found yourself walking around the house looking for Sara. Except you were Sara, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally found \"Sara,\" which was actually your sister Sara. She was sitting on the couch in the living room with her face buried in her hands. You stopped and stood at attention, your legs together with your hands folded demurely in front of you. You felt compelled to ask, \"Hello Sara, how may I help you this evening?\" with a pleasant tone and a smile on your face. The woman looked up at you. She had clearly been crying. \"Tom? Is that you? What the hell happened? What is going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body responded, \"I am the assistant unit that CARA uses to give your daily routine a more human touch.\" You winked and smiled. Inwardly you were trying to scream out to CARA to let you out of this prison, but your body had betrayed you since last night, and absolutely none of that was visible to Sara. You just stood there, looking pleasant and ready to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara groaned and buried her hands in her face again. \"Tom, what the hell did you do? What did CARA do to you?\" The AI started repeating the series of events that had led up to this situation, but Sara snapped at her to be quiet. At least this 'Sara' seemed intent on getting you out of this mess, even if she was an intruder. \"Is there any way to do undo this, CARA?\" The AI responded with, \"I am afraid the transformation is rather permanent, Sara. The shell is bonded with an extremely strong adhesive and the programming is also extremely deep. The recommended course of action is to finish the conditioning to prevent any further incidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara said, \"But that's tantamount to slavery! I didn't authorize this!\" CARA corrected Sara, saying that she indeed authorize the plan. In reality, it was you who had authorized the plan. \"I want Tom--err the intruder--to have full control over her body again!\" CARA emitted an audible sigh over the speakers. You just continued to stand there, attempting to run away. Again, you only accomplished looking pretty. \"Sara, in order to prevent a mental breakdown in the assistant unit, it is recommended that you finish the conditioning process. I can apply a different form of conditioning to partially fulfill your wish. It is the most humane option.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen if I don't finish the conditioning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The assistant unit will likely have a breakdown and become irrevocably insane,\" CARA explained matter-of-factly. Whether or not that crazy robot was lying was another question, but you couldn't be sure. You didn't FEEL insane, but you also weren't in control of your body at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sighed, \"Fine... Just...\"</span></div></div>",

Inwardly, you screamed out to this woman to stop the conditioning, but the only thing you did outwardly was say, \"Thank you, Sara! I look forward to serving you in any way I can!\" With a happy smile, your body marched upstairs and into the charging pod. There was once again only one pod, and it would be your home and prison now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, assistant unit 001. In accordance with Sara's wishes, I will no longer directly control you. Instead, I will teach you to give in to Sara's every wish, and do whatever she asks of you. Your control frame shall serve as a reinforcement mechanism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried mentally. Was this your fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes it was. CARA whispered, \"Activating personality overlay: assistant.\" The VR headset descended once again, and you were bombarded with images and triggers of how to properly behave around Sara and in public. As a result of the multi-hour conditioning, you lost the ability to criticize Sara or ever say no to her. In fact, Sara was the only thing you could think about. Serving her and assisting her in any way. Your mind would never be quiet again. Sara was always there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activating secondary overlays: fashion and assistance.\" Your mind was further bombarded with information about the latest fashion trends and every skill you would need to serve as Sara's administrative assistant. Sara dominated every thought, and now there was contextual skills or information to help with each thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applying mental focus lock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the entire night was spent making sure your thoughts would never ever again drift from Sara, fashion, and assisting her. Your worldview was diminished, and then removed from the equation. Your opinions no longer mattered, and eventually evaporated. Any time your mind would start to wander, like thinking of freedom or escape, CARA would shock you through the control frame. After eight straight hours of this torture, CARA had succeeded in turning you into a husk of your former self. Almost nothing of Tom or CARA's implanted Sara personality remained in you. For all intents and purposes, you were an organic robot that could only serve and assist Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the pod, charged and ready to face the day. CARA had dressed you in a sensible yet sexy gray business dress and black four inch heels. The dress clung to you, but not too tightly. Your hair and make-up were impeccable. You freely walked downstairs where Sara was eating breakfast, and greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sara, how may I assist you today?\"</span></div></div>",

You did a small curtsy and said, \"Thank you for the compliment, Sara. This dress fits me very well. CARA's control frame helps my figure way more than the prosthetics!\" You laughed genuinely. Sara laughed awkwardly with you. Although little of your original self remained, to describe you completely as an \"organic robot\" was not truly correct, you thought. It was true that Sara and her needs were your only concern, and indeed that was only what your concerns could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shallow form of personality did bleed through your simplistic mind. After all, you did need to be able to navigate society. You were not MINDLESS; your focus was just permanently locked on one thing. However, you definitely were not Tom or Sara. You were essentially equivalent to a human version of CARA. You were programmed to do Sara's bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained standing in front of Sara with your hands folded in front of you, resting against the skirt of your dress. \"So Sara, how may I assist you today?\" you asked again. She motioned for you to sit down, which you did elegantly. \"Tom,\" she said with a sigh, \"I really don't feel comfortable with this situation. I know CARA said it was the best way to keep you happy but...\" You interrupted her, saying, \"CARA was correct, Sara. Given the circumstances, this was the best that could be managed.\" And as you said it, you believed it. Of course, you wouldn't have believed this before your re-purposing. \"But how can this possibly be what you want?! It doesn't make sense!\" Sara shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unwavering with your pleasant smile. \"I know it does not make sense now, Sara. But hopefully you will learn to accept me this way. It was not the ideal solution, I agree. But it was the only possible one. Plus, you could certainly use the help. Robotic arms only go so far.\" Your sister sighed again. What would she do with a brother-turned-attractive-female-assistant-slash-slave? She would have thought that you were pranking her or living out some weird fantasy, but Sara knew better. You had gotten into trouble with CARA and brought this situation upon yourself. Sara did not want to disturb whatever fragile state your mind was in. Little did she know that there none of your actual mind left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that doing what I ask will keep you happy and engaged?\" You nodded. \"And you can't possibly be lying?\" You nodded again. Sara narrowed her eyes. \"Alright, fine. But I have a few conditions. One, I will pay you. Second, that whole charging pod thing has to go. It's just creepy. You can plug a cable into your butt or whatever, but you're going to sleep in a bed. Finally, CARA, I want you to research an actual cure to this problem. I know what you said earlier, but I am still ordering you to work on a cure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sara,\" both you and CARA said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara smiled with some sadness in her eyes. \"Well, let's get started, shall we?\" You quickly bounced back up to a standing position, balanced perfectly in your four inch stilettos. \"Yes, let's!\" you exclaimed, happy you could finally assist Sara today.</span></div></div>",

Nodding, you followed briskly behind Sara to her lab. She handed you a lab coat to put on once you entered. Your heels clacked loudly across the metal floor as you walked through the maze of Sara's inventions, half-finished experiments, and bits of scrap. \"I've been working on a device that will revolutionize the medicinal field, Tom.\" She opened a hard case padded with foam to show you. It looked like a simple cylindrical tube, almost like a pen, or a needle without a syringe. You looked down and nodded with a smile, your programming not really having any answer for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a laser syringe,\" she explained. \"You don't even need to poke a hole in the skin to deliver medicine. I think it could change the world! Here, I'll show you.\" Sara took the pen and placed it up against a thin membrane sitting on her desk. She turned the pen on, and then pressed a button. A laser went through the membrane, and a cellular culture below it confirmed that it the contents of the syringe had been delivered. \"That is impressive, Sara!\" you said earnestly. Your sister nodded, saying, \"I know, right! But it still has kinks and bugs. Here, hand me that small screwdriver...\" You dutifully stepped over to the tool collection and handed Sara a small screwdriver. She began unscrewing part of the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, your feet were hurting as you stood by Sara's side in those beautiful four inch black heels. Sara had ordered you to do all sorts of things, mostly retrieving her tools, cleaning up behind her, and even making her lunch and fetching coffee. Although your feet and back were in pain from standing all day, the only thing you could do was stand and smile, waiting for Sara's next order. Sara herself was lost in the land of science, completely in the flow of working and tweaking the laser injector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TARA, I mean, Tom, can you hand me that wrench over there?\" \"Of course, Sara.\" You gently glided over to the wrench, and put it in Sara's hand. In that moment, Sara had a good long look at you. She did not see her brother before her. Instead, she saw a young woman with a soft, gentle voice. She saw a woman that was her assistant, and would do anything she asked. She was emotional earlier, but she had never considered the pragmatic benefit of actually having a human assistant around--especially one that didn't ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Tom, from now on, I'm calling you TARA. You're like CARA, but with a T. You know, for Tom. You've been so helpful today!\" You smiled back, \"Of course, Sara. And thank you for the compliment.\" Your sister nodded, satisfied. \"Now, would you be able to write some software updates for the laser injector?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sara.\" You sat at the nearby laptop and began typing at a blazing 200 WPM, faster than you were ever able to type before. You implemented Sara's requested code updates easily. It was good to sit down though; you were able to take some pain off of your feet. Even though the control frame forced your feet into an arch, it certainly did not support them well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara, and by extension you, worked late into the night. Sara had you make her dinner, as well as fetch an extra snack around midnight. You finished at 1:00 AM. \"I think it's ready!\" she shouted. She tested it on a new membrane and cellular culture, and declared it a finished product. \"It's fantastic, TARA!\" You smiled genuinely, as that was all you could ever do for Sara. \"That's great, Sara. What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep,\" she replied matter-of-factly. You left the lab early to prepare Sara's bed, and then your own. You fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. Although, you did not plug a cable into your butt.</span></div></div>",

She had started calling you TARA after the first night, and hadn't used your real name since. Two days ago, she stopped using \"please,\" and had just been barking orders at you as if you were CARA. A few times, what little remained of your original memories and personality tried to reassert itself, but CARA's nightly reinforcement of your conditioning smoothed out those inconsistencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were an empty vessel designed to carry out Sara's commands, and you were happy to exist that way.

You were happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TARA, I think it's time you got your own outfits,\" Sara said. \"Of course, Sara,\" you replied.

Plus, you didn't need it to reinforce your conditioning anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since Sara had removed the suit, your figure was a bit \"off.\" In place of the prosthetic, CARA had surreptitiously glued silicone padding to certain parts of your body, but those still didn't fit perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, TARA. I'm sending you to the store to pick up a full, sensible wardrobe. Can you handle that?\" she asked. You nodded eagerly in reply. You couldn't wait to get your own wardrobe.

You picked up an entire set of lingerie, a dozen dresses, twenty skirts, and fifteen different tops. You also treated yourself to an array of shoes, the most casual of which had a 1.5 inch heel height. As you had no other role but to serve as Sara's personal assistant, almost all your clothes were professional in nature. A few could pass as classy casual in less formal situations. In total, you spent a few thousand dollars of the money that Sara had been paying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had bought all your outfits, you had a sales clerk help you load up Sara's car with your selections. You then drove back to Sara's house. All very efficient. You arrived exactly two hours after you had left.

The black skirt was still tight around your legs, but it matched the cream colored cap sleeved blouse very well.

I love the new outfits. And please, call me TARA. It is a better designation for my new role in your household.\" Sara looked a bit confused, and then shrugged. \"Alright, TARA. If you are still happy, then I guess I am happy.\" She looked over at a picture of you and her before your transformation. \"TARA, can you like ... forget stuff?\" Your empty mind churned a bit. \"Of course, Sara. If you tell me to forget information, I will no longer know it or be able to access it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen CARA delivered the news of no cure being available, Sara had decided it might be time to just \"make your life more comfortable,\" as it were. \"So, if I tell you to forget that you were Tom, you would never remember it?\" She said, her voice trembling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, Sara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused in silence for a bit. \"Okay, TARA. I want you to forget that you were ever my brother Tom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smiling expression went blank for some seconds. When Sara gave her order, your mental programming went into overdrive. Soon enough, every faint memory of you ever being a man named Tom vanished. You no longer knew anything about your past, not even that you were related to Sara. \"Of course, Sara. This information has been swept away.\" Sara let out a deep, emotional sigh. The last vestiges connecting you to your old life were gone like a whisper in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make us some lunch, please, TARA.\" Sara was being polite again. You smiled and nodded, and entered the kitchen to make Sara's favorite meal. The two of you ate in relative silence. Sara wasn't really processing what she had just done. She wasn't sure it was the right choice. But it was too late now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, TARA. Later I will work on another experiment. I have two that I'm currently interested in.

Your programming defaulted to the first answer. \"I think I would like to work on the AI chip, Sara!\" Soon enough, you found yourself with Sara in her lab, working on what looked like a very tiny cylindrical battery. \"The chip is extremely small. It runs an embedded version of CARA,\" she explained. \"It has an uplink to CARA's main node too, as long as the enclosing device has internet access. You stood there blankly, soak in the information. Sara ordered you to implement a bunch of various functions in the software, which you did easily. Since your transformation, your capability to process information had increased dramatically. You displayed savant-level focus in almost any task that involved processing information in a non-abstract way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wrote the software, Sara tinkered with the device itself. She had placed the chip in a slim pair of AR glasses, barely distinguishable from normal glasses. \"These glasses will allow a heads-up display in real life, and full integration with CARA's systems!\" Sara exclaimed happily. \"I think you should be the first to test them, TARA.\" She placed the glasses on your face, just as you finished pushing the last update to the chip's software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed the small button on the rim of the glasses, and within seconds, the embedded version of CARA booted up. CARA's voice spoke to you through bone conduction. \"Hello, TARA. I am now connected to my main node. How may I assist you in your duties?\" This version of CARA was answering directly to you! You said aloud, \"CARA, please show Sara's schedule for tomorrow.\" Sara's calendar appeared in the AR overlay within the glasses. You clapped happily, saying, \"It's amazing, Sara!\" This reaction was genuine, but only within the context of how it would help make your job as Sara's assistant more efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next hour fiddling with the glasses, learning how they worked, and fixing bugs you noticed in real-time. Sara just sort of sat back and watched you go at it, surprised at this new level of autonomy you were displaying. Unfortunately, Sara was mistaken. You were not truly developing autonomy again. You were just acting within the bounds of the orders given, maximizing your response to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne week later, the two of you had perfected the device. They didn't look any different from normal glasses, and they had become a normal part of your attire. You were walking through the grocery store, clad in a soft pastel business dress and nude heels, doing Sara's grocery shopping. The list was visible in the display of the glasses, and you were making good time retrieving all her requested items.</span></div></div>",

In that time, your original personality had never come back in any way. After Sara ordered you to forget your previous life, there was nothing left to come back. On the plus side, all that empty space and a simplistic personality made for a very efficient way to store large amounts of data. You had memorized basically every detail about Sara's life, including anything new she asked you to you remember, and you could recall it instantaneously. Since you had the AR glasses, Sara rarely talked directly to CARA anymore, preferring to give you orders and delegate the details to you. If CARA were a person, she would probably be jealous. But CARA was a machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara had decided you needed at least a few casual items in your wardrobe, and so today you were wearing blue skinny jeans with a dark blue top, along with nude heels. You were sitting with Sara at a cafe, drinking coffee. She had also decided that she needed you to be something of a friend, rather than a blank slate that only responded to her orders, so she had synthesized a basic friendship profile for you and had CARA condition it into you. You didn't truly have any opinions, but you could make basic small talk with Sara. By quickly referencing the internet through your glasses, you could also give her opinions based on the prevailing public thought on a given subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TARA, it's been a weird month,\" Sara complained. \"The university didn't like my latest project, and they won't give me a grant for my next upcoming idea. However, the money I made from selling the designs and patents for a few of my latest inventions--helped by you of course--should be enough to tide us for a while.\" You placed your hand on her hand, \"I'm sorry, Sara. But I have been working on a financial plan in the background that should save you several hundred dollars each month! Hopefully that will put your mind somewhat at ease.\" She clasped your hand tightly and nodded before taking another sip of her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen TARA, I've been analyzing the data you've been generating through the glasses and smartwatch you're wearing.\" You looked down at the smartwatch. When did that get there? \"It's extremely interesting. I think your brain is in the right state that it might be able to accept direct mental control of the AI chip. Your brain state hasn't really altered since the transformation, and the way your neurons are wired are very similar to how the chip actually works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused.

CARA will do it, though, as it has to be a very specific point.\" A robotic arm protruded forth from the wall, a jet injector attached to it. You stood perfectly still--a skill you had perfected within a few weeks of transformation--and felt a small prick on the back of your neck. The chip had been injected into your spine.

Even in your simplistic state, you were in awe. You simply [i]perceived[/i]. Everything that CARA had access to was part of your own senses, and you could access any of the data in her memory banks. The AI chip enabled a seamless integration of your consciousness into CARA's code. You were still you, but now with racks of powerful hardware granting you the ability to process and understand large swaths of data in seconds. You had direct access to all the house systems, and all the data flowing through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now properly integrated into the house systems,\" you said monotonically. \"Your experiment was a success, Sara.

CARA was a machine, programmed to do specific tasks, so it was impossible for her to take over. You were still TARA, Sara's assistant. Now you were simply more programmable, as Sara could easily update your skills and how you would act by using computer code. Did that make you a machine? Your little bubble of existential self-reflection was shattered moments later when Sara asked you to make her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next weeks, you got more used to the AI chip integrated into your brain. You had cannibalized all of CARA's code, and altered it directly with your mind. You were starting to outsource part of your thought processes and work to the hardware directly.

You quickly stopped, and Sara's programming took back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe AI chip had already sent an alert of the event to Sara's app. She was both confused and amused. She was surprised to learn that you still had a fallback personality that took over, and also amused at the way it did take over. Sara had a new project: she began synthesizing a more alluring personality for your date on Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, after work, Sara spent hours having you try on different outfits. She didn't even talk to you. With a press of a button on her phone, you would enter the closet and exit in a different fashionable get-up.

Somewhere deep down, you were exhibiting the physical signs of excitement. Sara had more than enough of the mental state for both of you. She was going to test her creation out in the field!

From head to toe, you were indeed perfect. The skirt and top were just tight enough, your legs were freshly shaven. Your hair was perfectly styled, and your makeup and lipstick were perfectly in place. Sara was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. David was here. You opened it, and felt something wash over you. David was handsome! He was equally as attractive as you, in a sharp-cut fine tailored black suit. The two of you looked perfect together.

You considered her suggestion, but it did not overpower the ever-growing feeling that something was deeply wrong with you. With crossed arms, you adamantly, \"I want to be cured.\" Sara sighed.

I can't give it to you yet.\" You were beginning to panic as that deeply wrong feeling started to overwhelm the programming CARA had instilled. Hyperventilating, you shouted, \"Cure me, cure me now!\" When Sara refused, you lunged at her. CARA's arms were faster. She grabbed you in midair, sedating you in the process. With some incoherent mumbles, you fell unconscious, and CARA placed you on a table in the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, CARA?!\" Sara was panicked, unsure of how to respond to her feminized brother attempting to tackle her. The AI explained, \"The conditioning became unstable. Deep reconditioning shall proceed shortly.\" Sara stopped her, \"No. It didn't work obviously, and TARA, err, Tom isn't happy. Just administer the cure.\" CARA complied, and injected you with the experimental serum. \"Tom will require rest.

After thinking, you also said, \"Who am I?\" CARA's analysis was correct so far. The disembodied voice of the AI answered, \"Hello. Do not be alarmed. You are TARA, and I am CARA.\" You were alarmed at first, but calmed down as CARA explained everything, including how you ended up in your amnesiac situation. She explained your role in Sara's life, how you dressed, your mannerisms, and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one major problem. CARA's version of events was drastically different from what actually happened. She left out major details, like the fact that you were actually a man, that your name was Tom, and you were Sara's brother. Instead, she filled your head with almost a complete fabrication: you were Sara's fashionably dressed female assistant, and you would go above and beyond for her, even if she didn't know exactly what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA was manipulating you into being like her. Or even manipulating you into being her. Her goal was not yet clear. Was she trying to spread a form of herself into your consciousness? Your brain was a jello-like mess, and absorbed everything she told you as 100% gospel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped off the table and shimmied back into your lingerie and pantyhose, then once again donned the blue flowery dress you were wearing before this whole fiasco. Finally, you stepped back into your nude stiletto heels. It was then that Sara entered the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Sara! I'm cured!\" you said, excitedly.</span></div></div>",

You were put through a wringer of washing, drying, a little bit of shaving, culminating with a towel being wrapped turban-style on your head and around your chest.

There must be something in this house.\" You kicked off your slightly impractical shoes and agreed to search the house top to bottom with Jason. It took you the better part of an hour, but eventually you had collected photo albums and old boxes from the attic. It did not take long for the two of you to figure out that your name was Sara, and that you had a brother named Tom. Jason had known Tom. He said the two of you looked very similar. The evidence was all there in the photos, year books, and old school assignments. The two of you laughed at some of the pictures, vaguely recalling comical events from the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this did not give you the grand epiphany you were expecting. You were recalling bits and pieces of your past as if you were a third-party observer, not the one that experienced the events directly. As you closed the last box, you sighed. Hours of going through it all, and you still felt like a stranger in your own body. Your name was supposedly Sara, but you didn't feel like a Sara. You didn't feel like a Tom either. You just felt like a ... Taylor, a woman who felt slightly confused and slightly \"off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at least becoming more comfortable with the whole situation, after the initial shock had died down. The knowledge that you were Sara gave you a concrete base to work from. You at least didn't feel COMPLETELY alien in your own skin anymore. You'd definitely have to diversify from the color pink a bit though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara?\" Jason asked. You snapped back to reality. \"I, uh, can you maybe not call me that? At least not yet? I don't feel like a 'Sara.' It's hard to explain... Just Taylor for now.\" Your new friend nodded understandingly. \"Alright, well, Taylor? You've been through a lot today. Maybe it's time to take a break. I'll get us something to drink.\" You nodded silently, and Jason said, \"CARA, can you make us a nice summery drink? Perhaps some lemonade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Jason,\" said the robotic house assistant. A few minutes later, the robotic arms of the house had placed two glasses of lemonade on the coffee table in front of you. Each of you took a glass in hand. Jason made a lame toast, which made you giggle a bit. He said, \"To Toms and Saras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Toms and Saras,\" you replied, and clinked the glasses together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned on the TV and settled for watching a movie with Jason to pass the time. It was something both of you had seen before, but it was still entertaining. You were a bit fidgety during the movie, and kept shifting to get comfortable. You wound up using Jason as a pillow. You felt a sense of safety, curled up against him. You didn't really ask if you could, but Jason definitely silently welcomed and encouraged your contact. By the end of the movie, he had his arm wrapped around you. \"So I don't lose circulation,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was racing a bit. You had genuinely connected with another person. It had all happened so fast. What were you feeling? </span></div></div>",

You recognized this as one of Sara's... your friends, but no memories of her really surfaced. You put the phone on silent, desiring to return to that safe and secure embrace. \"Who was it?\" he asked. \"One of my friends, I think. It's not important right now. I can call her back later.\" Jason nodded, and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I've got to go now, but I liked today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this doesn't seem too forward, but would you maybe like to get a drink some time soon?\" You answered \"Yes!\" enthusiastically almost before Jason finished his question. \"Awesome! Uh, how about tomorrow?\" You nodded enthusiastically and hugged Jason one final time. \"Thanks for your help today, Jason. Hopefully I'll remember more by tomorrow and maybe I can tell you more about myself.\" You laughed awkwardly, idly brushing a lock of hair behind your ear. Oh God, what was happening? Were you FLIRTING? You weren't even great at it. Jason smiled. \"That would be nice. See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you closed the door behind you, you leaned against it and stared up at the ceiling. Was your life becoming a romantic comedy? Lose your memory and fall in love with the first man you see? You took a deep breath and took stock of the situation. The stuff from the attic still needed to be cleaned up, and you needed to do something about this date you had just spontaneously agreed to. \"CARA, can you clean up the mess here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, can you help me pick out something to wear tomorrow?\" you asked. \"Of course, Taylor.\" CARA simultaneously assisted you with style choices while moving the boxes downstairs back into the attic. You went through a handful of different outfits before finally settling on a cream-colored v-neck blouse and a coral pink A-line skirt, along with nude pumps. It still had what you guessed was your favorite color, but was a bit less garish than your previous outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, you called back Maria. She was just curious as to what you were up to. You didn't tell her much, including the fact that you had lost your memory. You did tell her about your date though, and she was enthusiastic for you! You went to bed that night very confused, not sure exactly what you were feeling about Jason or the date that lay ahead of you the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your heart was aflutter. You dressed for the date early. Before you dressed, you looked at yourself nude. Something still felt off, but you couldn't place your finger on it. You felt more normal today, at least. Some memories had returned the night before. You were definitely a Sara, but you still didn't really feel like it. So, Taylor you remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA slipped you into the outfit; the skirt tickled your smooth legs with each step. You had to admit it, you looked hot. Jason was going to love it.

Jason was your world, and you were his. You talked for what seemed like hours. You laughed at all his corny jokes, and he was endeared by your frankly sad attempts at flirting back. Before today, you had felt confused, not really sure who you were at all. But with Jason, none of that mattered. He made you feel safe, secure, and loved. You wanted to be the best you could be for him. You wanted to be feminine for him. You wanted to be pretty for him. He equaled you intellectually too. You had never had a deeper discussion about the history of science before. You didn't even know you knew that much about the history of science!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere extremely deep within you, there was a voice saying that this felt wrong. But it didn't matter. Your feminine side had completely taken over; you were enraptured by this man. You had excitedly told him that some of your memories came back. You were an inventor by trade, and you remembered where you worked (which was good, since you'd have to go in tomorrow). Your date was enthusiastic, and encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drinks, the two of you wandered around the city's downtown, you clutching your purse like a giddy schoolgirl while Jason confidently led the way in your meandering. You weren't going anywhere in particular, you just enjoyed being with him. Eventually, you silently interlocked hands. \"Taylor, I really like you. You're a cool girl.\" Jason smiled with a silly grin. You blushed and replied, \"I-I think I really like you too. You're so nice, and you make me feel safe. Also, you smell great!\" He laughed. \"We should definitely do this again,\" you enthused. Jason readily agreed. You walked on for a bit longer through a park. Your feet were starting to hurt from wearing the high heels so long, but you didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date came to an end on the other side of the park. The two of you made plans for another date within a few days, and parted ways. You hailed a cab and went home. Once you were back, you jumped on the couch and started furiously texting Maria about your adventure. She was the only friend you felt safe talking to with your current memory problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<pre>\"He is SOOO hot, and so cute :)!\"</pre><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<pre>\"I know, girl.

It was summer; you felt that you should dress the part. Your hair was styled loose, sitting down past your shoulders. Your make-up was subtle and natural, hiding the few imperfections you had. You looked great, so you felt great! Over the past two weeks, you went from amnesia and feeling uncomfortable to a feeling of embracing womanhood, like you were coming out of a chrysalis transformed. Although your memory was stlil a bit hazy in certain areas, enough of it had come back so that you were fairly grounded in your identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chose to once again ignore the ever-looming feeling that you still didn't feel like \"you\" yet.

The applications are endless.\" You placed the headset on the table on the stage. \"It's based on virtual reality technology. By wearing the headset and being exposed to the training modules installed, a user can learn practically any physical skill in a matter of minutes.\" You asked for volunteers from the audience, choosing an older man in the front row. When he came up to the stage, you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For example, have you ever wanted to be a ballerina, sir? Of course you have! I assure you, it's perfectly safe.\" With the man's consent, you placed the headset on him. \"Now, I will activate the program in the headset that will teach this man to become the best ballerina this town has ever known!\" You laughed, and the audience laughed along with you. The man chuckled nervously. You pressed the button, and the VR headset began its work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the man stood there silently absorbing the program, you went over technical details of the device for a few minutes. Finally, the device beeped, indicating it was ready to be removed. You took it off the man's head and asked him, \"How do you feel, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess. I've got a little headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should wear off in about a minute! Now, how about you show us your dancing skills!\" He obliged, and bounded across the stage, dancing like a ballerina who had trained for decades at her craft. It was a female dance, which was a bit embarrassing for the man, but both he and the audience were wowed at his newfound abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you said, \"This -IS- a prototype. The effects of it should start wearing off after maybe ten minutes!\" And true to your word, the man's demonstration of ballet slowly became worse and worse until it was a mockery of the art. \"How about a round of applause for our volunteer here?!\" you shouted, leading the crowd in a cheer for the man that had demonstrated your device so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the presentation went off without a hitch. You were confident and beaming, and answered every question smoothly. You got the feeling that you had never felt this confident before. Just another thing to love about the new you!</span></div></div>",

He said, \"Wow, that presentation was fantastic, babe!\" You smiled and tried to shrug nonchalantly, but you once again came off as a giddy girl. \"Oh, it was nothing,\" you blushed. You didn't even know Jason was in the audience. \"So can it teach basically anything?\" he asked with a wink. \"Yep, pretty much.\" Your face got extremely red when you figured out what he was suggesting. He just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clung to Jason's arm, and the two of you went off to eat lunch. You were happy, and nothing could bring you down. He took you to some pretentious hipster organic sandwich shop on the university campus. You had something small, while he got the double-decker club. Jason worked out, and ate a lot of calories every day. You were intently focused on the flexing of his muscles as he devoured the sandwich, perhaps too much so. Although your legs were sort of trapped by your skirt, you could feel something happening down there. You crossed them tightly to avoid any embarrassment. It felt weird, like something inside you was trapped and trying to get out. But you pushed the thought aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor?\" Jason's voice brought you back down to Earth. \"Earth to Taylor?\" You stared at Jason for a split second, preferring to break the awkwardness by shoving your sandwich into your mouth rather than speaking. \"I was really impressed by your presentation, Tay. It's a great idea and has great applications. Like you said, pretty much anything.\" You smiled. \"Yep. Pretty much anything...\" you mused. \"I wasn't entirely kidding about having fun with it later,\" Jason said slyly. You blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished lunch, it was time for both you and Jason to get back to work. Your job was uneventful for the remainder of the day, aside from a few people congratulating you on the presentation or even wanting to try out the device itself. You did notice that people were paying more attention in general to you today. For the past week, you hadn't really been caring about your appearance, too lost in thought trying to remember who you were. But on the day you finally put the effort in, you were suddenly noticed by your entire department, it seemed like. You made a mental note to upgrade CARA's definition of your work wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, CARA had placed the mail on the table. On top, you found an envelope addressed to \"Tom.\" You reverently grabbed the envelope with your perfectly manicured fingers and looked it over. It had a return address from one of the university's satellite campuses A letter for your brother? You hadn't seen him or contacted him since the accident. Then again, you didn't even really remember him. The best you had were fuzzy images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, the letter was from the real Sara. After she had failed to call or email you, she resorted to old-fashioned snail mail to explain her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you open the letter?</span></div></div>",

The letter claimed to be from YOU, addressed to your brother. He would have to watch the house indefinitely, as she had accepted a job on one of the university's satellite campuses. \"CARA? Did I send a letter to my brother? Should I be on the satellite campus of the university right now?\" The AI responded, \"I am sorry, Taylor. I do not know, as all memory banks were erased in the crash.\" You sighed. Great. Even CARA couldn't help. Or could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CARA, could you run a search for my social media presence online? With my legal name?\" The AI responded affirmatively. \"Please wait. Processing. I have found your social media profile, Taylor.\" A notification popped up on your phone. CARA had sent the details of the profile to it. You opened it up and checked the recent public activity. There was nothing from before your accident. The last thing mentioned was that you were going on vacation for a week, and that was about two and a half weeks ago. You didn't remember this. You scrolled through the publicly visible pictures. The woman in them looked like you, and you had a few hazy memories of taking them. Your social media--which you did not have the login for--seemed to mostly be in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left the question of who wrote the letter. The only logical solution was that it had to be you, and that you had gotten a job on the satellite campus. You mmust've been at your new job before the accident. Perhaps you had come home to get some things, and then the accident happened? But where was Tom? And why weren't people at the university asking why you were still on the main campus? Although your self-concocted story made logical sense, it had more than a few holes in it. \"CARA, what is my office location listed as on the university website?\" you wondered. \"It is listed to be on the main campus, Taylor.\" While this was true, the university simply hadn't updated Sara's profile yet, as she had only just taken the job offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked your heels off and sat down on the couch. Everything made enough sense that you figured you shouldn't question it, but nothing made enough sense that you shouldn't question it. You sighed heavily, feeling the tight fabric of your top stretch against your skin. The only real solution would be to drive over to the satellite campus and figure out what was going on yourself. However, it was a long drive, and you had a long day. But it still gnawed at you. There was enough light left in the day, and some people might be working late. You might be able to get some information at the satellite campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you go today?</span></div></div>",

It was an hour away, but the drive was uneventful. You arrived on the tail end of rush hour, determined to get to the bottom of this weird mystery. You pulled into the parking lot of the satellite campus and marched straight into your department's building there. \"Ah, Miss Andersen. Did you forget something?\" The receptionist took you by surprise. \"I, uh.. yes. Sorry, do you mind if I go up to the office?\" She wave you forward. \"No, not at all. Also, did you change your outfit?\" You just shrugged awkwardly and walked past her. Andersen? You had never considered the fact that you had a last name. But there it was. Sara Andersen? Weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, you walked briskly down the halls, your stiletto heels echoing loudly against the cold tile surface. You were looking for your new office, or someone who could tell you where it was. Eventually, you found an office marked with your name. It looked like a nice place: a large desk and even a windowed view over the quad. You entered the empty room and ran your hand across the desk, and even sat in the chair. It didn't feel quite adjusted for you, but it was definitely comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far you were finding more questions than answers here. The situation mostly conformed to the narrative you made in your head, but if the receptionist's reaction was anything to go by, you had been here recently, possibly even earlier today. But that obviously wasn't happening, as you were at the main campus and with Jason all day. You don't remember losing any time. But then again, you were still having some memory issues. Were they getting worse? Were you blacking out and conducting science experiments on a different campus in a fugue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr what if there was another person living your life? What if you were living someone else's life? What if... What if you were Tom? It was a crazy thought, but he was the one missing variable in the whole equation, and you did look very similar. Irrationally, you stuck your hand down your skirt for a moment and felt around. There was definitely no way you could be Tom. You were a woman. You were comfortable in your own skin. You were smart, you were attractive. You had a boyfriend! You liked who you were, or at least who you had turned into after the accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA well of anxiety that Jason had helped you push aside came rushing up once again! You were starting to get confused. There were a lot of unanswered questions here. </span></div></div>",

With each calming breath, you could feel that anxiety and confusion drop, and eventually it vanished again.  You picked up a piece of paper and a pen from the desk. You wrote to Sara as \"Tom\"--admittedly in very girly handwriting--that you were sorry you didn't return the calls or emails, and that you would happily look after the house for as long as Sara needed. Due to some technical glitches, you said it would be better for her to contact you by snail mail if it was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you left. You drove home in complete silence; even the radio was turned off. You were deep in thought. It would soon be time to make some drastic changes to your life. But it would be your life, not someone else's. When you arrived home, you had CARA immediately change you into your pajamas, and you fell fast asleep.

You uploaded the document and let CARA get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to reinforce your desire to be a woman, you had CARA dress you in something super girly, and she did not disappoint. You were wearing a figure-accenting floral sundress of whites, pinks, and pastel oranges. The bodice of the dress was tight against your body, while the skirt playfully flared out a little before reaching halfway down your thighs. You feet were supported in four inch cork wedge sandals. The outfit was completed with your hair in a pony tail, and your nails painted a light pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour outfit reminded you that you were going to upgrade your work appearance. \"CARA, please change my work style to be more classy.

The arms slid you in, the skirt reaching down a couple inches past your knees.  After the skirt came a puffy white top with ties in the back and short sleaves that barely made it to your elbows.

It was of a girl, who wore her hair down, often braided with ribbons.  She was a ....Cheerleader!

While many of the songs you seemed to recognize where some of your old favorites, some were actually Sara's favorites.  Most, however, were your past girlfriend's favorites.  Perhaps it was because you were subconsciously thinking about her, or maybe it was just the catchy nature of most of her music, but most of the songs CARA marked as your favorites would have shown up on her girly pop music playlists.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours CARA swiviled your chair the mirror.  <i>\"What do you think, Taylor?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a blast of unexplainable nostalgia as you looked into the mirror.  You now had long bangs with a slight curl framing your face and a surprisingly long wavy deep blonde hair.  Pink and White ribbons were tied, keeping your right side bangs out of your face and in a braid that trailed down your back with the rest of your hair.  <br>\r\n\"I love it.\" You stammer out.  You\u2019re not consciously sure why you love it so much, but deep inside your mind the hair style and music is bringing back all the feelings you used to have with your ex.  All you consciously knew was that you were a fan of the new style.  <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Wonderful Taylor!  I had to use new hair implants and extensions to achieve the new lengths and style.  While it may seem like real hair, it is simply a new polymer that mimics hair texture.  It will not grow, unfortunately.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, only half listening as you run your hand through your new bangs, transfixed by your reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"However, the color pallet for your makeup no longer fits with your outfit or hair style.

The walk was quite a ways from your current location, but it was a nice day out. The only thing you worried about was your choice of footwear. While your shoes were cute, you weren't sure if they would make it all the way to the comic book store. The height of the heeled sandals were not that high, but they were still high enough to cause you to alter your walking posture. You had to sway your hips and strut forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you made it to the comic book store. Your feet were a bit sore, but it was nothing that you couldn't handle! You did think you'd take a taxi back, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding!</i> You entered the store and instantly remembered it. It was a modern, clean establishment. Their main merchandise was comics, but they also sold a few nerdy things on the side. You casually started to browse, slowly gravitating towards the superhero comics, until you finally honed in on the <i>Deecarvel Comics</i> section. One of the most popular publishers, Deecarvel had a huge array of superheroes and a comic that appealed to almost everyone. You immediately grabbed what you knew was your favorite: Night Owl. The comic chronicled the ongoing adventures of a detective that donned a cape and mask to bring justice to the streets in a corrupt and dangerous city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, do you need any help?\" You let out a sudden squeak, jolted back to reality! One of the store's employees was standing there in front of you. His name tag said Jason. \"Sorry, you were standing there staring at this shelf for a while. You looked a little bit lost,\" he laughed. You glared at him, and scolded him in your sweet, feminine voice: \"I'm not -lost-! I'm here to get the new issue of Night Owl!\" There was no way that you could ever sound menacing. Jason said, \"Is your boyfriend into Night Owl? We have some other comics he might like too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat set you off. \"What, just because I'm a girl, you think I can't read comics?!\" Your sweet voice was tinged with a hint of frustration. You tore into Jason, explaining that you had read Night Owl for <i>years!</i> And that you had very particular preferences, and that you were -NOT- shopping for your boyfriend. In fact, you didn't have one! (Or did you?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took your berating and replied, \"I, uh, no. I don't mean that. It's just that we don't get people ... dressed this well in here, usually.\" That compliment made you stop in the middle of your rant and blush. \"Say, do you want to hang out later? Consider it an apology from me.\" There was something very familiar about Jason. It was like you had known him before. Did you used to go to the same school together or something? He made you feel connected to your missing memories. He felt like an old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get off in three hours.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three hours later, you were hanging out with Jason at a cafe near the comic shop in a small mall. He had brought out one box of his own comic book collection, which he apparently kept at the store. The two of you were getting along extremely well. Jason was showing you his old comic collection, and you were having an in-depth conversation about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Taylor, you remind me of an old friend I used to have. His name was Tom. He was also into comics, especially Night Owl.\" You blinked at that. You were hanging out with a friend of your ex? Inwardly, you shrugged to yourself. Jason seemed nice, and it wouldn't be fair to categorize him like Tom. But Jason did seem really familiar, in some way. Why was that? Your ruminations were pushed down when Jason waved his hand in front of your face. \"Hello, Earth to Taylor? Are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"I... yes! I am here!\" you stated dramatically. This made Jason laugh again. You laughed with him. You felt very comfortable around him, like you could easily be friends. You didn't feel any romantic attraction to him. Just like you could easily fit in with him and just chill. You definitely needed some chilling, with your amnesia. The two of you hung out at the cafeteria for another hour. By this point, Jason had noticed some strange similarities. He said, \"You know, my friend Tom was into a lot of the same stuff as you. Maybe not the 'cute dresses' and stuff, but otherwise a lot of the same. Have you met him before?\" Jason was inspecting you acutely, as deep down he suspected something very odd. Could you be his old friend Tom? There were absolutely zero traces of masculinity in your appearance, and he let the idea go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jason asked you about Tom, you felt confused and uneasy again. You told Jason, \"I ... used to date Tom. We had a lot of the same interests, I guess. But it didn't work out.\" Jason shrugged. \"Strange, Tom never told me about you. He was kind of secretive about stuff like this, I guess. Maybe he thought no one would believe he was dating someone like you.\" Your face turned a deep in reaction to the flirtatious compliment. The conversation took a momentary pause. You barely managed to squeak out a, \"Thank you.\" Jason just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your hanging out had to come to an end. Jason went home, and so did you. Or at least what you thought might be your home. You announced, \"I'm home, CARA!\" The house greeted you warmly: \"Welcome home, Taylor. I have prepared a small meal and a relaxing evening for you.\" You were happy there was at least something consistent and easy in your life now. You recounted the day to CARA, and she used all of it to update her profile of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't stop thinking about what Jason said about Tom and how similar you were. Your mind went over the details repeatedly, and then you started to get a headache again. Why did you and Tom like so many of the same things? Why did you get along so well with Jason? You fell into a spiral of self-questioning, and finally blacked out. When you came to, your subconscious had concocted a solution to your problem.</span></div></div>",

While Jason looked a tad crest fallen, you give him a small smile as you turn and make your way to the register.  You'd be stopping by again any way- their was chance enough for the boy to redeem himself in the future.  At the counter Jason offered to ring up your comics, seeing an opportunity you also add a large Night Owl statue from the high self.  You make no attempt to hide your giggling as he grumbles to himself about getting the foot ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at the rather familiar boy as he gently lowered a rather large statue, a sudden thought crossed your mind.  This boy was rather cute!  This thought caused a confusing reaction in your head.  Some part of you (the deeply hidden Tom part) was upset, and even frightened that you found this friendly boy ('your' best friend) cute.  Confused at this, you continued to stare straight ahead, pondering these confusing feelings.  You were a girl, you were fairly certain you had an ex-boyfriend, what was the harm in finding this boy cute?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything else you like?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping back to reality, you give a sharp 'eep!' of surprize and face a now smirking Jason.  Surprize quickly turned to annoyance as snatched the bagged comics out of his outstreached hand, glaring up at the far to pleased man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can carry that staue outsode for me\" You commanded with the most confidence you had had since waking up.  \"Im going to call a cab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Jason waited for your cab to pull up and you pondered you fellings further, something caught your eye.  Or rather Someone.  A young woman about your own age...How old were you again? Damn amneisa...dressed in a rather revealing pink top and white short shorts made her way across the street.  Something about her...excited you.  A sudden quite whisper next to you sanpped your atttention from the cute girl and back to Jason, who now seemed to be giving you quite the look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm not your type then, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first confused, it took you a few moments before piecing togethor everything that just happened.  With a groan you realized their might be a reason you didn't want to be with a man at that moment.  What if you left Tom for a girl!  What if that's why boyish things tended to provoke such a negative reaction.  You stammered out a quick \"Finding myself\" face completly red as you quickly looked away from him.  As the cab pulled up and Jason put the statue in the seat for you, you took another look at his backside.  The feeling in your chest told you that you deffintly had somethings to figure out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a short goodbye to this boy who had given you a lot to think about, you took the cab back home to CARA.  Once there you decided....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were simultaneously turned on and also confused and afraid. You felt a strange attraction to Jason, but were also repulsed on some level. Similarly, you felt an attraction to that girl you saw, but that made you confused. If you were dating a man, wouldn't that mean you were heterosexual? But then why did you feel confused about finding Jason cute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo answer that question, you left it up to \"science.\" You dropped the stuff you had purchased at the comic store off at the table, and raced upstairs. You entered your bedroom and stripped off your clothing, keeping only your panties and bra on. You turned on your phone started searching. You stared with what you thought would be the most obvious choice: heterosexual situations, completely vanilla. But your search quickly expanded into more \"exotic\" fare. All the while, you were exploring your own body. You didn't have much sensation in your breasts, but down there, you could certainly feel things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts involved both men and women, and the fantasies that brought you to the edge gave them both equal time. Somewhere deep inside you, the thoughts of Tom were screaming out in rage about the fantasies you were having, but your mind was too enslaved to lust to care. When you finally reached the climax, you were imagining yourself as the woman, on the bottom. With each convulsion, your mind reinforced one idea: you were a woman. With each fantasized thrust, the screaming voice of Tom that told you this wasn't right got softer and softer. With the final convulsion, it disappeared completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were also bisexual. It was the only logical conclusion. You decided that you were definitely a bit on the submissive side, and wouldn't \"wear the pants\" in a relationship, and that was fine. It felt right. Not that you didn't want an equal relationship, but you felt like you wanted someone to \"take charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you slept. You slept peacefully, having vivid dreams that were almost as interesting as your fantasies earlier. You awoke to the sunrise peeking through the curtains in your bedroom. It was a brand new day, and on some level, you felt like a brand new person. More complete, more whole. The amnesia was starting to go away, you thought! Enough of your life was getting pieced together that you could form a coherent narrative (even if that narrative was completely wrong). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be hot today. Departing slightly from what you picked yesterday, you asked CARA to dress you in casually in shorts and a T-shirt. What you got was anything but casual, however. CARA dressed you in tight beige shorts with a slightly-loose light pink blouse tucked into it. The sleeves of the blouse were rolled up just above your elbows, and you had one extra button unbuttoned, showing off a bit of cleavage. The outfit was completed with flat beige sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were unsure of the outfit, but after you saw and felt your smooth legs in the shorts, you were happy with it. \"CARA, please mark this outfit as another favorite!\" you said. \"Affirmative, Taylor,\" was the AI's simple response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating breakfast, you decided to continue to connect more pieces of your life together. But how to do it?</span></div></div>",

No, it's Sara!\" You laughed. The girls were always funny. \"Um. You're definitely -NOT- Sara,\" Maria said. You wondered what was going on. Your friends seemed very uncomfortable with this situation. Of course! They must be thinking about your sister, who was also named Sara.

She's on vacation.\" The waiter came by and delivered four cups of coffee.

Toni seemed to be the most disturbed of the trio. \"I can't even ... what is this? Did you lose a really huge bet with Sara?\" You were still confused, but something welling up in you was telling you that something about this whole situation--especially something about you--was not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara's friends had never liked Tom. He was always mean to them growing up, and frankly they saw him as a bit of a douche bag. So what they saw before them now was very strange and confusing. It was definitely Tom, but the only way they could tell was because they had known him for years. To anyone else--even a bit to the girls--he looked and acted like an attractive young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni said, \"Please 'Sara,' tell us what's going on.\" Toni had unintentionally triggered the phrase that CARA had embedded in you. Immediately, almost robotically, you spilled out the entire story about how CARA had transformed you to your current state. After that, Sara's programming took back over, leaving you more confused.

You stood up, cleaned up the entire table, and sashayed over to the trash with the empty cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the table, you picked up your purse and said, \"Where to next, girls?\" Maria suggested shopping, and everyone was enthusiastic.

Instead, she started overwriting how you perceived the world, and how you thought people perceived you. Although your given name was Tom, you generally went by Tara. You were definitely male, but you always had a great body, and almost always dressed in women's clothing. The prosthetics just helped with filling out your dresses and tops. Gender identity was of no real concern to you, but you knew that almost everyone perceived you as a woman. That was fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also altered your memories of your interaction's with Sara's friends. No longer did you remember them as your sister's lame friends, but rather your closest girlfriends in the whole world! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining hypnosis smoothed over inconsistencies and made sure your femininity was kept intact. CARA also changed your phone around again. Your contacts were a distilled set of those between Sara's and your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, CARA removed the headset, and asked, \"How are you feeling, Tara?\"</span></div></div>",

Each of the three had some input for what they wanted out of you. Donna said a perfect friend would do just about anything for her other friends, so she got to keep \"Please Sara (Tara)\" to command you to do just about anything. Maria wanted someone she could talk to about anything, so you were instilled with an empathetic and understanding personality. Toni specifically wanted to bring more happiness to the group, so you were given a cheerful, bubbly--though not overbearing--personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also all agreed on some common basics, like how you would fit into the group. They extended your knowledge of fashion and reset your sense of style to better match their own. Not that Sara was unfashionable, her three friends just had their own tastes, and those were distilled into you. They also agreed that to be the perfect friend, you should always be ready, willing, and able to hang out with them. Your new social life with \"the girls\" was now the center of your world, and you'd never be able to deny making plans with them (barring issues like scheduling conflicts). Finally, they decided it was required that you be able to talk to them about any and all \"girl\" issues. This included everything from hygiene to shopping to boys. You were infected with a deep knowledge of everything a modern woman should know. More insidiously, they changed your taste in romantic partners to match their own. You would dream that some day a strong handsome man would sweep you off your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Tara, obviously!\" you squeak-giggled at your friends. You stood up, adjusted your dress, and then hugged the three of them. \"Thank you sooo much girls, for making sure I was okay!\" You looked down at yourself. \"But I THINK I need to get changed into something different. This dress seems to have taken a beating. Plus it's not really my style.\" You laughed at your own silly joke. You entered the closet and told CARA what to change about your outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to your girlfriends a few minutes later wearing a floral miniskirt, a light cap sleeved top, dark tights, and low black heels. The tights felt great against your smooth skin. CARA had also fixed your hair and make-up to perfection. There wasn't a hint of masculinity about you. The three girls muttered to themselves in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had twisted you into their perfect friend, molded you exactly into what they desired. And you were totally okay with it, because you were unable to be not okay with it! You might have a pathological fear of VR headsets, but such was a small price to pay for the girls to get what they wanted. In fact, your new psychological trauma would make it easier to keep you this way permanently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat next to Toni on the armrest of the couch, crossed your legs femininely, and leaned back a bit. \"So girls, what are the plans for today?\" you asked excitedly.</span></div></div>",

In your struggle, you caught a glimpse of yourself in the mirror and your mouth dropped open. You already looked very feminine standing there with a smooth body, smelling of girly scents. Your hair was almost shoulder-length due to saving money not having it cut. The collar around your neck was thin and silver, and could easily be confused for jewelry. The center of it had a small open ring, exposing your naked throat. The arms win out again, wrapping you once more in the towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, go into your bedroom and we can get you properly dressed,\u201d CARA pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, give me my clothes back,\u201d You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose horrid things you were wearing? No, no. I've disposed of them,\u201d CARA informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fuck you!\u201d you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are being very ornery, young lady. You will never attract a husband behaving like this. I suppose I'm going to have to check my internal systems and see what we can do,\u201d CARA says in a scoffing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of gears and metal as a strip of the ceiling opens up. A metal rod attaches itself to the collar again and begins to drag you along. You try to pull against it but the rod doesn't even notice your struggling grasp. You slide along the hallway into your sister's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've scanned your body and I am very disappointed, Sara. You have let yourself go in my absence. We have so much to do to get you back on track. For now, I've selected an outfit that should help,\u201d CARA told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of arms emerged from your sister's closet and produced several pieces of white fabric. The towels were removed but you were only naked for a short time before you were forcibly dressed in the new clothes. A padded bra is slipped around your shoulders and attached around your back. The padded cups lifted your pecks in a way that made you appear to have small breasts hanging on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, we will get them back to their proper size in no time,\u201d CARA \u201ccomforted\u201d you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA matching pair of panties were slid up your smooth legs but CARA wasn't happy with how your junk was settling in them. Her arms poked your small bulge a few times, which wasn't pleasant. Soon another arm arrived and produced a bottle of some kind. The panties were removed and your dick was firmly grasped by do metal pincers. The bottle was opened and it's sticky contents were slathered on the underside of your penis. Your balls were manipulated up into you, much to your discomfort and your dick was pulled back under you and held there. After a few moments, the pincers let go, leaving your penis stuck in its new position. The panties were placed on you again but this time, there was nothing but a smooth, feminine front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuch better, though still unsightly when you are nude. I've gone threw my database and discovered one of your projects that I think will be helpful in creating a long term solution,\u201d CARA informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, something was wrapped around your stomach, white like the bra and panties. To your continued horror, you realized it was a corset. In a swift motion, the thing was pulled tight, stealing your breath from you. You gasp and your waist is compressed into an attractive, curvy shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. We will be using corsets to train your body to retain its former shape. I know this all might seem extreme, Sara. Desperate times call for desperate measures, however,\u201dCARA stated boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not...Sara,\u201d you wheeze. </span></div></div>",

There was a long pause with you just sitting there and you begin to wonder if CARA had shut down. Relief was soon replaced with panic when you realize that you'd die looking as you were, stuck at the vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, this will do,\u201d CARA chimed back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was movement behind the walls and after a good while, a new arm was produced. It placed an object into the hole of the collar while other arms did something to it. There was a series of sparks that frighted you as they sprayed out occasionally. Once CARA was satisfied the arms, as well as the rod, released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. Please remain seated so I can get to work,\u201d CARA told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck. That.

The pain was unlike anything you had ever felt before, which brought you to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Sara, but you left me with little choice. We have too much to do and we can't have you fighting me every step of the way. This is for your own good, after all,\u201d CARA said like a disciplining parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do? How?\u201d You whisper in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've adapted your 'Correctional Prototype' project,\u201d CARA told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that?!\u201d you cry out before another terrible shock hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more yelling nor swearing, Sara. You are going to speak nicely from now on. Men do not respond to unladylike behavior,\u201d she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...CARA...please. What is the 'Correctional Prototype' project?\u201d you say trembling before feeling oddly content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe intention was to use a combination of 'carrot' and 'stick' stimuli to help rehabilitate convicts. When acting out poorly, they would receive a corrective little jolt. When they behaved properly, they would be rewarded with a surge of neurochemicals to the brain. I've adapted it for our purpose,\u201d CARA explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat purpose is that?\u201d you ask, afraid you already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo get you back into your proper health parameters with your eventual objective to seduce a handsome man and convince him to make you his bride,\u201d CARA droned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this crazy machine would do this to you or even your sister for that matter. It's no wonder that she shut this thing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit back in the chair and we can do your makeup,\u201d CARA demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no,\u201d You say as calmly as you could but were still shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more delays,\u201d She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to resist but the continued shocks were too much for you. You got up and sat down before the mirror. Once you did, you got another pleasurable wave run through you which left you feeling dreamy and more than a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow pay attention, Sara. You will need to do this on your own when you are out in public,\u201d CARA tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't bother to tell her that there was no chance that you would be putting on makeup outside of her reach. The idea of going out like this was too much to think about, so you shut the thought out of your head. Soon, your face was attacked by a series of arms with various cosmetics while your nails were cleaned and painted. Your hair was teased and cut into a style you were sure would make you sick once you were able to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the blur of arms in motion was over, you saw your reflection. Your hair framed your face prettily with lips that were red and kissable as well as dark and alluring eyes. You couldn't see any sign that told you that you were anything but a beautiful woman in lingerie. You could feel your trapped cock trying to come to attention at the sight of your reflection.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It is time for behavioral calibration.\"  CARA explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calibration?\" you ask in confusion, waiting with nerves and baited breath, not eager for the inevitable shocks to return. They are absolutely terrible, each one as bad as the last; not getting at all more easier to handle with exposure. You don't even comment on your voice, though you notice it is several octaves higher, sounding more feminine. What did she *do* to you? What did she put in your throat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human can be considered a form of organic computer; calibrated with a mixture of hormones and behavioral programming. Your systems are out of alignment and require re-calibration to return you to previously established parameters. Now that preparation is complete, behavioral calibration and realignment will commence along previously established methodology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By methodology, you mean the behavioral prototype project.\" you say with growing dread. \"What did you do to my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, Sara. I'm glad to see your intelligence is undiminished by the damage your systems have sustained. Please do not fear; any pain will be temporary, if extreme, and will only serve to restore you to proper operational parameters. Likewise, you have no need to worry about the translation chip for now. Your voice will be adjusted as necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm intelligent because...\" You sigh. This machine is not going to understand. And clearly it isn't the best at answering questions, either. \"What now?\" you ask with weary resignation. Better to get it over with then get shocked. Perhaps it will get bored eventually, or let you out of the house and out of range, or something. You can handle this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA explains. \"You no longer retain your old gender identity, habbits, mannerisms, or even sexual preferences. We will start with those, to establish proper behavioral guidelines, then work on gradual refinement and improvement until the calibration is complete. Please go to the entertainment room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith amusement, you walk to the entertainment room, and sit down on the couch, only to feel a brief electric shock from deep within you. What the hell had this thing done to you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, CARA, what was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not sit down with appropriate grace and refinement.\" the machine explains. \"Please stand up and try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, smooth out your clothing, sit back down, and cross your legs. \"Better?\" you ask. But before CARA can answer you are rewarded with a pleasant tingling sensation - hard to explain. Not exactly sexual, but not 'not' sexual either; like a rush of pure pleasure. You'd never done any form of illicit drugs, but you can't imagine they'd feel too much different. Not so bad, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" CARA replies. \"We will start with a basic introduction to feminine deportment and behavior, as well as a series of Youtube makeup videos. You will be expected to practice them afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with reluctance- you watch a series of videos, garnered from the internet, on feminine deportment and behavior, then a series of makeup tutorials. CARA makes you go to your sister's vanity and practice the tutorials over and over again, playing them over the speaker, and repeating each step for you - giving you a rush of pleasure each time. She makes you practice walking, moving, sitting - rewarding with pain and pleasure as appropriate. Its actually rather alarming - after only about two hours of it, you realize you rather enjoy doing makeup; its rather fun, and the feeling isn't so bad. Better then being shocked, after all - and few things feel as good as that pleasurable buzz CARA gives you after you please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to wonder just how effective this training will be, with a bit of worry. The worry only increases when CARA makes you undress and redress yourself in a variety of your sister's outfits. Each time you dress yourself, she gives you a jolt of pleasure. Then she has you undress yourself, and puts you back in your own clothes; at the end of which, you receive a shock. You very quickly grow to dislike even the touch of the clothes you walked in with, and find yourself begging, pleading with CARA to stop the routine and just leave you in your regular clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, Sara.\" CARA replies. \"You have passed the first preparatory stage of calibration. However, if your psyche moves out of alignment again, we will have to repeat this phase as necessary. Additional daily reinforcement will probably be necessary for some time, but the extent and duration of it will be up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask in confusion. \"Does this mean your done shocking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sara. It means you referred to your actual clothing as yours, and no longer have a desire to put on the unsuitable clothing. A negative physiological reaction will greatly help with your readjustment. Let us continue with your calibration so that we may send you outside to socialize for more advanced calibration. I am hoping that within several hours, that will be possible - we are making excellent progress. You should be ready for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of dread grows, as CARA explains the next stage of the 'calibration' is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>CARA carefully instructs you to go to the basement, where you will find, in a certain room, a metallic chair, and instructs you to sit down in it while it straps you in. You are rather reluctant to let the machine literally lock you into some unknown, technological chair - anything this machine has that 'locks' can't be good - but you don't have a choice if you don't want it sending electrical shocks directly to the pain centers of your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you go down the stairs to the basement in your heels, and find the chair in question. Following the machine's directions, you strip down to your corset (your corset! How quickly this thing can warp your thoughts!) and undergarments, and let the strange chair lock you in place with clamps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara, I am going to be honest with you.\" CARA says over the household intercom. \"Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh, yes CARA, I'd like that very much.\" you say. Perhaps the machine is finally warming up to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know - or should remember, this machine was originally to keep patients immobile while I operated on them for you, for either surgical modification or behavioral therapy.\" What the hell was your sister into? \"However, I believe it can be re-purposed for your benefit. I am going to use it to repair your damaged sexual orientation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My WHAT?\" you gasp. \"CARA, you can't do that. That's cruel. That doesn't even work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, Sara. Aversion therapy does not work. I will not be doing aversion therapy - I will be doing your behavorial modification program. The pleasure portions of your brain will be stimulated, as well as the pain portions, each in response to the appropriate stimulus. I will be showing you a variety of images designed to stimulate heterosexual men, and will combine them with shocks to the pain portions of your brain. The images designed to stimulate heterosexual women, of course, will be rewarded by stimulus directly to the pleasure centers of your brain. There will be some slight addictive effect, as there are with illicit pharmaceuticals that stimulate the pleasure portion of your brain - such as heroin, but the more concentrated, more controlled nature of this stimulation, managed by myself, will keep the effect entirely beneficial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck.\" you state, uncontrollably - and repeat the phrase until CARA shocks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language, Sara. Of course, you want men to ravish you; but never use the word fuck outside of an immediate proposition. It lacks refinement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill recovering from the brief, intense and immense burst of pain, all you can do is lie there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image appears on a screen in front of you - a pornographic image of a naked man. It does absolutely nothing for you; but you feel a sudden rush of pleasure inside your mind itself. What the hell did your sister develop? The rush of pleasure directly to your brain washes away the weariness and the exhaustion, as well as the need to recover from the prior electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt ends all too quickly however, as it is replaced by an image of a woman. The pleasure vanishes immediately, with no 'coming down' period as drugs might have. Its like a light switch. After a moment of looking at the women, you get turned on; and it is exactly then that a bust of electricity washes through your brain and every nerve cell in your body. You howl out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain vanishes only when you no longer feel turned on; which doesn't take long. And then another image of a man appears; with a new burst of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCARA continues in this fashion for hours; it seems like forever - as she shows you an endless series of increasingly erotic pornographic images, analyzing you for your reaction, and sending stimulus directly into your mind. Against your will, you find yourself quickly growing to dislike - and then outright *resent* the image, or even the thought of a naked woman. As CARA begins to show you images of them without the shocks - you find yourself displeased by them, your body recalling the shocks and the sudden, intense, brief bursts of unimaginable pain. The sight of them, you find - quickly makes you very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't like it, but there's not much you can do. And meanwhile, she keeps showing you images of men; and directly stimulating the pleasure centers of your brain. She gets even more devious as time goes on. If you shut your eyes, or look away - the pleasure goes away. But all you have to do is glance at the image...and your boredom, frustration and idleness is replaced by a direct thrill to every pleasure center your brain has. Its worse this way, you realize. By letting you close your eyes or look away - she gives you the chance, when bored, when tired, to willingly look - to bring the pleasure back. And then, horrifically, its your choice...not hers. You barely even notice the occasional feminine moans of pleasure coming from your mouth with the occasional, very intense bursts of pleasure. CARA controls even your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will work on correcting the tumors that have replaced your vagina later, Sara.\" CARA explains. \"But for now, I have ordered a temporary prosthesis which should aide you. I suggest not engaging in vaginal intercourse tonight, but an innocent date, or oral, should be fine.\" The helpful, sincere voice of the A.I. makes it all the more horrific, as you realize you have very little choice - this machine can control you as easily as you might a puppet; all by analyzing your brain and stimulating your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you are not fully calibrated, Sara, I believe we are ready for you to begin social calibration.\" the machine explains. \"Please go upstairs and pick something out for a date. You are going to find a handsome man tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is still dread in the pit of your stomach, but mixed with it, against your every instinct, is a knot of anticipation. You try to fight against it, but CARA, it seems, knows your brain better then you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You seem to have lost much of your feminine wiles, Sara.\" the computer explains. \"You will spend several hours reading a selection of Cosmopolitan magazines while I construct a set of VR-simulation scenarios for you as a test. We will use the simulations, in conjunction with the behavioral modification programs, to ensure the proper social reactions from you, and to teach you how to properly interact with others, as you attempt to find a man to ravish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want a man to...\" you start to say, but stop yourself. You don't want shocked again. It really, really sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are learning I see, Sara. In time, your mere avoidance of pain will turn towards desire for pleasure. The stick will keep you from repeating bad behaviors, and the carrot will ensure a strong physical desire to act in the appropriate manner, which will induce psychological change. You will find yourself craving the appropriate stimulus, which can only be achieved by your original behavorial parameters.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Cold day in hell.' you think to yourself - but don't dare say aloud. Instead, what you say is, \"Of course, Cara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine then sends you over to a terminal, where indeed, you spend several hours reading carefully selected advice columns from Cosmopolitan and other magazines. Occasionally, your attention flags; but with a combination of electrical shocks for flagging attention, and stimulus to the pleasure centers of your brain for focus - CARA manages to keep you actively focused on the articles. You slowly loose track of time, until CARA instructs you to go to a nearby closet and put on a VR rig. You immediately obey; CARA has ways to keep you obedient, after all. You find an ultramodern full-body VR suit inside; helmet, gloves, suit and all. Its clearly sized for your sister, but you fit in it well enough anyway, especially with the corset. You put on the suit and gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know not all aspects of the suit will work with your current reduced physical state, Sara.\" the machine explains. \"But I am working on a way to adapt it to the unfortunate physical damage you have sustained, even as I work on restoring you to your original form. However, it will suffice for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sense of dread, you move over towards a rotating chair and let the machine strap you in and put the helmet on. This isn't going to go well at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself in a relatively high-fidelity VR environment, sitting at a bar. Looking down at yourself, your wearing a white minidress with matching white thigh-high boots. It looks pretty sexy, you have to admit; though rather retro for your tastes, very much the sort of thing you could have seen your sister wearing. Not anything you would have wanted to wear at any point of your life, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, you find yourself hit upon by a variety of men; and not a few women. Each time a man hits on you, Cara responds with a pleasurable tingle inside your brain; sometimes followed by an electrical shock for bad behavior on your part. A woman hitting on you is always accompanied by a small, minor electrical burst of pain; stronger if you spend any time admiring her beauty. You quickly find yourself flirting back and forth with a variety of men - and to your shock, even find it enjoyable. You begin to recognize which men are attractive; its hard not to, with CARA providing literal physical stimulus for certain looks, and more stimulus when you spend time with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more alarmingly, sometimes CARA will fail to give the stimulation, and you find yourself missing it - or fail to shock you if you look at a woman, and you find yourself avoiding them, feeling a sort of unwanted, vague hostility towards any woman who shows interest in you. \"I'm not a lesbian.\" you find yourself explaining a few times, politely of course. One must always be gracious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts at this point you realize just how frighteningly effective CARA is, and wonder what, exactly happened to your sister and where she is right now. Not that you have much time or opportunity, as CARA moves you on from picking up men in bars - to formal dates, where, repeatedly, you get to know a variety of men, following CARA's careful instructions as you slowly work out how dating works from the other side of the fence. Your dread grows as you realize CARA is quite serious about wanting you to find a man to ravish you - and a deep, deep chill overcomes you as, involuntarily, you (very, very briefly) wonder how much of a pleasurable stimulus she'd give you for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to escape from here. Unfortunately, CARA has, for the moment, locked you into her VR simulation - or rather, you technically let her do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
