She worked as an accountant of a Law firm in California, and made a descent money for the work she did . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ring Ring\" The phone rang . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Good Afternoon thank you for calling ---\" Lynn started her typical Phone etiquette . When her Daughter cut her off . <br>\r\n\" Mom the 20 dollars didn't get into my google account\" Susan Lynn's teenage daughter said almost in a frantic . \" Calm down let me check it out \" Lynn said as she pulled up there joint account on her work computer . She worked in a two person office space and the other lady was across the room . Lynn who was in her mid 40's was very attractive and had dark brown hair , she could wear anything she would like to work . Normally she was a T-shirt and Jeans kind of lady . She wore glasses for distance and up close reading and as the computer screen reflected in her glasses Susan became impatient . \" Mom I need the Money in the google account , otherwise I can't download it . \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Just hand tight it should be there ......Now ....Its there now . \" Lynn said back to Susan , who was on a phone at her school and checking her cell phone . \" It is there ----\" Susan hung up with Lynn . Lynn sat there for only a moment ' wow that was pleasant ' Lynn thought as a icon appeared on her desktop . Lynn being curious minimized the screens she had up and looked at the new Icon . The Icon on the screen was that of an I in a giant Circle that looked like a map Legend . \"Is that what all the fuse was about ? Your playing an online game ?\" Lynn thought as she noticed Susan and her joint account was linked to the Icon . Lynn scrolled the mouse over the Icon and read the description \" For an adventure you will never forget , all it takes is a click .\" Lynn raised an eyebrow , and then remembered that her other daughter was talking about a new app that was sweeping the nation . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey have you heard of that new thing that is an app where  you -----\" Lynn asked the other lady in her office . \" Oh yeah my husband and I used it last night . Its amazing , any story you want and Boom right there and its so real\" . She said from behind her computer to Lynn , as Lynn couldn't help but think about a good story she knew . \" Ah I know \" As she clicked the Icon to try it out , the screen went black . 'Oh Crap I just crashed my work computer' Lynn thought at first . It was lucky that the other lady in her office kept to herself because if she could see Lynn and what was happening she would of been concerned . As Lynn Clicked her mouse with no luck , she then pressed a few buttons nothing happened . Then a huge flash as the Eye of The Dark Lord Sauron filled her screen , Lynn could feel the heat of the pulsating flames coming from the eye . \" The one who will rule them all \" A voice echoed through the speakers at Lynn , as she sat there the eye grew larger and pulled her in through her monitor . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ahhhhhhhhhhh\" Lynn screamed as she fell through an abyss of darkness the flames from the eyes dissipated. Her fall was slowed down by hitting a few tree branches covered in Leafs .  Then she continued to fall further and further down a huge hole until the light was completely gone . She fell through a few more sticks fashioned together to form a roof . Lynn laid there on the ground unconscious, for what seemed to be hours . As she regained her consciousness she could hear voices , most of it sounded like gibberish. Her head still spinning from the fall , her vision was blurry as she looked up to see the way she came down . she adjusted her glasses and looked over to see .........  </span></div></div>",

Taking her fair share of hits and falls was part of growing up . But the fall she just took knocked her senseless for a few moments , realizing she landed on her back Lynn started to lift her right arm and then realized she had a soreness in her wrist . As she continued to see things along the wall she could hear the voices off to the side of her were getting louder . Lynn felt a tug on her Flip flops and quickly looked down to see two small Goblins trying to eat her flip flop . \" Ahhh \" She screamed as she quickly jerked her foot up , in the same motion Lynn flung herself up and could now see the source of the voices . \" Oh .....my\" Lynn said as she adjusted her glasses to see not one or two , but thousands of Goblins in front of her . Once again the two smaller Goblins tried to eat Lynn's flip flop off her foot . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey cut it out !!!\" She shouted at the goblins and swatted them away, as she did that a huge mob of goblins rushed her . Lynn could feel hands clawing at her arms her legs . Her Flip flops were torn from her feet , and she was positioned in the crowd of the goblins to stand straight up . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lets eat it NOW!!! \" One goblin snarrled out . \" I want to eat the little toes one by one !\" Another one said . All the voices in the crowd of Goblins where that of either eating or ripping stuff off of Lynn, her mouth covered by 4 sets of goblins hands . \" No \" One voice said over the others As Lynn could see there was a goblin just outside of the pack standing there watching all the others . \" Only the goblin King can make the ruling on what to do with this one \" The goblin said pointing at Lynn , and with that all the goblins began to move quickly down the narrow paths carrying Lynn with them . As they approached the huge cavern Lynn could hear a loud voice coming from an even bigger Goblin , but he wasn't talking about Lynn . He was actually having a conversation with a group of smaller people . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who the heck are  they ? Why are they so short ?' Lynn thought as the goblins carrying her started to make there way up the stairs , a huge blue light over came all of them . Lynn was knocked free from the main group and 4 other Goblins fell with her . ' Not again ' Lynn thought as she fell even further down the Goblin Hole . She made sure her feet were under her this time , but looking at her bare feet she realized she had not time to re position herself . She was going bare feet first into.......</span></div></div>",

As the Goblins fell into the water Lynn Managed to aim her goblin and land in the water on top of it , it would of killed the goblin had it been a landing on hard rock . But under water Lynn could see the goblins swimming away from a shore that was light up by the moon light . Lynn surfaced and could see more goblins falling along the shore , that was light up by the moon . Lynn swam along and hide behind some rocks . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn was socking wet now , she took this moment to put her hair in a pony tail and ring out her white shirt she was wearing . \" Ah\" She let out a quick little voice as to realize the ground in front of her was sharp . ' I have to walk carefully this place looks like broken glass ever where' , Lynn could hear a voice in the distance . It sounded like someone was singing a song . Lynn was ever so careful to not make noise as she could see a small grey person dragging along a goblin , it was singing a song which would of been nice except every few verses it would turn and wack the goblin on the head with a rock . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn could see the silhouette of the creature and realize it wasn't quite human , but not a full animal . ' I wonder if that thing is another goblin' she thought as she kept low to the rocks and crawled along , trying not to get cut by the sharp edges . As Lynn tucked herself down a crack between the rocks she made her way down to a lower path that would just go under the odd creature and the goblin it was beating . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of a something being crunched like that , Lynn could hear it as someone eating a huge drum stick or eating a big piece of meat. Just as Lynn tucked up against the rock the remains of the goblin were thrown down to the level she was on . Lynn covered her mouth quickly to not alert the thing above that had just decimated the golbin in front of her . Lynn knew it wasn't done with the goblin and it would most likely come to finish off its meal . Lynn grabbed some of the bones around her and tried to see if any of them were sharp or if they could be a weapon . As she looked she was mind full enough to keep the noise down , as she could hear the breathing of the creature above her . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a glimpse of it she could see a shiny item covered in dirty and rubbish . She looked closely at it as she freed it from the earth around it . </span></div></div>",

She thought if only she was invisible , then the creature wouldn't see her . Lynn paused of a few moments and then opened one of her eyes , she looked over at the creature Gollum and realized it wasn't attacking . Lynn looked at the creature with the huge round blue eyes , and 9 teeth . It was looking at Lynn , but it looked so sad . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What is it precious , where is the precious ? \" He said very concerned . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn waved her hand not to close to the creature and realized it couldn't see her , ' I wonder if it can hear me?' Lynn thought to herself . Just then Gollum looked with his eyes slightly closed , almost angry . \" We hear the precious, and the precious wonders ?\" , Gollum said as he looked around still . ' He can hear what I am thinking ?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGollum who was looking off in the distance looked back at Lynn's location , and studied the rocks and area around her . \" The precious is acting funny . \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' Are you going to eat me ?' Lynn thought to herself trying to hide any thoughts in her head . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Eat you ? Why would we eat the precious ? \" A much more playful almost child like version of Gollum Answered . Lynn smiled and as she smiled she was put to easy . As she let out a sigh of relief she didn't realize it but she appeared to Gollum . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh.....Who is this Precious ? \" Gollum said bewildered by the sudden sight of a woman in his cave . \"Its......the precious .....\" Gollum said once again with his eyes slightly closed and looking sinister . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait you can see me ?\" Lynn asked , to which she just blurted it out with out even thinking about the creature in front of her . \" Yes ....yes we see the precious\" Gollum said once again in his evil voice and look . He started to approach Lynn , \" Now wait ........whats your name ? \" Lynn asked with her hands reached out to halt the creature . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Precious wants our name ? Our name Precious wants our name ? \" The happy go lucky Creature answered . The coughed out \" Gollum Gollum \" . \" Your name is Gollum ? \" Lynn asked as Gollum brought his head  up slowly and looked at his Precious . \" Why does precious ask ? Precious knows \" Lynn re-positioned herself and her foot got a corner of a sharp rock \" Aghhhh\" She let out . Gollum dropped his evil look and looked concerned . \" Whats Wrong Precious ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I need to get out of this cave , the goblins took my flops . \" Lynn said as she rubbed her foot , she placed her foot back on the ground and pulled up her pants by her belt . She dusted herself off as Gollum looked on . \" Do you know a way out of here ?\" Lynn asked Gollum....</span></div></div>",

As he brought his head  up again he was grinning sinisterly at Lynn again . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The precious wants to leave us ....Why ? \" Gollum asked again as he started to walk on all fours towards Lynn . Lynn Shifted her weight from her left to her right leg and said \" because ......because we need to leave this place .....its dark and cold and it cuts .....the ....Precious?\" as she jester-ed to her feet . Gollum looked down at Lynn's feet and saw they were cut , \" Oh yes we take the precious , we take the precious now \" Before she could say anything Gollum Grabbed Lynn's hand and flung her on his back . \" Hang on Precious we go now . \" He said as he began to jump from rock to rock . Lynn was amazed at how strong he was , but also scared how quick he was able to move . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared a tunnel that lead into a darker cavern , Gollum put Lynn down . \" The precious is going this way \" He said pointing to the tunnel .

She thought about hitting the creature and had a thought of rage as she did this her left arm balled up and she punched Gollum in the head . Fire erupted from her fist as she made contact with him knocking him to the ground . She followed it up with a knee thrust into Gollum's chest . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Why ? Why is the precious so made at us ? \" Gollum asked cowering and covering his head up . \" I don't know what's wrong with you but if you ever come after me again I 'll kill you!!!\" Lynn said in a rage ....'Kill you ?' Did I just say that ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes !!! The precious did just say that !!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lynn Continued on Foot not realizing that she was in fact running down a hill side that recently had leafs fall over the rocks that where under her feet . For the first time in a few hours Lynn wasn't being pocked of probed , which gave her great speed to move quickly away from the Mountain she just escaped from . Lynn paused to catch her breath as she was starting to feel it in her chest . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' I haven't run like this in years ' she thought as she braced herself against a near by tree . She took a moment to look back and realize it wasn't just a small hill she fell into but a mountain . She had entered the Eastern Side of the Misty Mountains and had just passed the other side of it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now that is a Mountain .\" Lynn said , if she was near her house she would be thrilled to see such a sight but she wasn't anywhere near home or for that matter anywhere she recognized . Lynn then thought her phone's GPS should tell her where she is , and she pulled it out she realized it had to of been a few hours . Is Susan alright ? What happened at work ? Have they noticed I am gone ? Lynn thought about all of this as she pressed the button on her phone to turn it on . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow for getting smashed against me , dropped into a lake and all the other stuff I am surprised it still works\" Lynn said to herself surprised that her phone turned on perfectly . As she went through her home page , she located her app that had Maps on it . As she started the app , it showed her an odd map that she has never seen before . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Middle Earth ?' Lynn thought as it zoomed in and showed that she was near the river Anduin and that there was an Elvish road near by . A road would feel a lot better on my feet probably and this way I wouldn't have to fight off Goblins . Lynn thought as she caught her breathe and continued towards the Road . She didn't realize it but something was compelling her to go East , East through Mirkwood and towards the Lonely Mountain and south of the Mountain . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Climbing down the side of the hill top she could see the river and the start of the trail she needed to get on, as she continued a Ork pack came up behind her on the Rock shards above her location . She sensed them before they showed themselves, and ducked down to not be seen by them . 'I know I will use that trick I did with Gollum' She thought as she focused on being invisible the pack had started to come down the hill side . As Lynn looked on she could see the pack not only didn't see her but didn't care to either , they were after a group of small people . Dwarfs if you will , as Lynn sat up she noticed a Grey Wizard with them and with out even knowing it Lynn came to her feet and reached out her hands . As the Orks and Dwarfs began to fight and battle , Lynn saw one of them singled out by the White Ork and fall . Lynn ran over to the fight , not sure what she was going to do but something compelled her to help . As the White Ork was about to let the wolf he was riding eat the dwarf Lynn Reached out and Just like when she battled Gollum a force came from her right arm in the form of wind . She blew the wolf away along with the white ork . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ? .......\" Thorin oakenshield said as he passed out from the battle he had with the Ork's , Lynn rushed to his side and realized he couldn't see her still and for good reason . Lynn thought about flying away like an Eagle would and with out blinking and Eye Giant Eagles came and grabbed the company of Dwarfs and the Grey Wizard . As they soared through the air Lynn could see that the others still couldn't see her on top the Eagle carrying Thorin . As the Eagles dropped the Dwarfs off , Lynn slide down the back of the eagle and stood there for a moment . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' That was different she thought to herself ' as the company of the dwarfs greeted each other and said it was a miracle, Thorin looked towards Lynn and said \" It was no miracle , something .....some force aided them . \" Lynn stood silent and still not thinking of anything at all to avoid another Gollum incident . Thorin , Said it was a sign they were heading in the right direction and they company started down the trail they were on . Lynn let out a sigh of relief . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Normally when one becomes a hero they rise and take a bow \" A billowing voice said as a shadow over came her own . Lynn looked back to see Gandalf the grey the wizard was right behind her . \" You can appear now they are gone .....My name is Gandalf\" he said \" Whats yours ?\" <br>\r\n\" Finally a person I can talk to \" Lynn said as she dropped her cloak and threw her arms up in the air . \" Well now, your not what I thought\" Gandalf said surprised to see a mid 40 year old woman , who was still very attractive for her age standing there .  \" Oh ....Sorry my names Lynn\" she said as she placed one hand on her chest and reached out to shack his hand . \" I take it our a wizard from a far away land then?\" Gandalf said returning the good jester . \" Well I wouldn't call myself a wizard per-say .....\" Lynn started to say then Gandalf expressed \" Well you are able to disappear and save dwarfs when you need to ....that is a talent only a wizard would have in these parts.\" Gandalf continued still surprised to see a woman like Lynn standing there . We should go .....</span></div></div>",

She must be 12 heads high?\u201d Lynn asked as she settled on the small settle that the horse recently had placed on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c Why \u2026.if you measured by heads then yes , but we normally measure by age and in this case she is 230 yrs old.\u201d Gandalf mentioned as he walked over to his white stead and jumped on while still smoking his pipe. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLynn smiled as she grabbed a hold of the rains that was a new way to look at it and since the horse was much older than any she had ever ridden she took it with grace and understanding. As time passed in this new strange land Lynn didn\u2019t seem to notice that there was drastically strange things that were different from the world she knew . As they started down the trail Lynn remembered to check her phone\u2019s GPS , which had then on a narrow trail heading for Rivendale west of the Mirkwood . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Are we not heading to the Lonely Mountain ?\u201d Lynn asked as she looked up at the grey wizard which she was following . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c We must first meeting with the White council , or the group of elves and wizards of Middle Earth to see what we can do to assist you in your travels\u201d Gandalf\u2019s words seemed to comfort Lynn , but his thoughts contradicted what he spoke .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018She is extremely powerful , and I fear that if left to roam could cause more destructive then peaceful\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn didn\u2019t know how to even express her opinion of what she just heard from Gandalf\u2019s thoughts.

As they continued down the paths and over the mountains it was refreshing to see that not all creatures would attack them . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c It must be good fortune to have to along\u201d Gandalf remarked , as they cleared the Lonely Mountains .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c Why do you say that ?\u201d Lynn asked in a cheerful glee about herself . \u201cThe last few times I have come across this road either Orks or Goblins , birds or the Mountain itself have attacked me .

She was caught in the arms of an Elve woman who approached from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am Tauriel , if you need any further assistance I am her to serve\u201d The Red haired Elf woman , expressed very sincerely as she bowed down to Lynn as she placed her feet first on the ground . Lynn dusted off her pants looking down for just a moment , she looked up at Tauriel as if she had just heard a whisper . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I am one of the best woodland Elves , I should not have to pander to anyone let alone a human .\u2019 Tauriel looked puzzled at Lynn who once again just over heard a thought from a nearby person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh screw you !!!\u2019 Lynn thought , but quickly stopped thinking . Once again hoping it was not a shared ability. <br>\r\nBut Tauriel looked back at Lynn and said \u201c Is there something a matter ? You are staring at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c No no forgive me , you look very \u2026.beautiful , I have a son who would find you very attractive\u201d. Lynn said covering her odd behavior , and thinking of her Son Tyler .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c You honor me with your admiration , Please we must continue to the council chamber \u201c Tauriel , mentioned as a way to move past this rather odd meeting . As they walked along the halls more and more elves looked at Lynn who was embarrassed , not only was she not wearing shoes . but since she fell through the Goblin tunnels and on the trails her clothing has become not only dirty but tattered . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Is there a place I can freshen up ? I would hate to meet anyone dressed like this \u201c Lynn asked Tauriel who was following along but not walking next to Lynn .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018I agree your attire is rather messy for the council to see you\u2019 Lynn heard Tauriel thoughts briefly before she paused and said \u201c Not to worry Gandalf and the others wish to see you right away\" .  Lynn was surprised by this , knowing what her elf escort thought about her and knowing she was intentional brushing her off. Lynn had stopped and looked back at Tauriel , as she was about to turn and continue to the council chamber she could see in Tauriel\u2019s expression she should turn around . Tauriel\u2019s eyes opened widely and her mouth closed quickly she then went quickly down to her knee to kneel. As Lynn turned around she was then faced to face with \u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lynn was stunned to see such a beautiful woman , in front of her and also that she made not a sound in her approach . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018 You must be tired , and need refreshing please take your time and sleep .\u2018Galadriel\u2019s blue eyes opened wide when she thought this .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lynn was amazed that this elves\u2019 woman didn\u2019t need to say a word but just thought this to Lynn , as Lynn\u2019s eye lids grew heavy she found her knees to give way as she fell back .  \u201c Please take our guest to the \u2026\u2026..\u201d Was all Lynn heard before she was in a deep sleep . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking to the smell first of jasmine flowers , and the smell of the most exotic perfumes she has ever smelled Lynn\u2019s eyes opened to a blur of a white ceiling above her . As she blinked a few times she realized she needed her glasses , which she looked around and saw them on a table next to the bed she was laying on . As she grabbed her glass and slipped them on she was amazed to see what she was now wearing . Gone was her slicked back pony tail , her black hair was so naturally flowing it must have been brushed more than 50 times for it to flow with such easy . Lynn ran her fingers through it as was amazed , as she swung her legs over the side of the bed she was laying on with the nicest white blankets she has ever seen . The blankets and sheets felt like silk and just flowed over her body , and she placed her feet on the ground she noticed a pair of black boots that looked like the ones she has always wanted to buy from the store in the mall . With 3 kids she never had time or money for such amazing luxury items like the boots or the socks she was wearing . \u2018Wow did I win the lottery and not know it ?\u2019 Lynn thought as she slipped on the boots , and noticed that her Denim light blue jeans were gone as well . She was now wearing a tight pair of dark rock 47 jeans with the white stitching, and her brown warn belt that she had forever was also replaced with a new black leather belt double clasped . Her white shirt that was pretty much drown when she arrived at Rivendale was also replaced with a much heavier white fabric , and laced down to the mid section of her shirt which was now tucked in to her new jeans. As lynn found a reflective surface to look at herself in , she did a few twirls and admired her new wardrobe . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I hope everything is to your liking ?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice said from just behind Lynn , as Lynn spun around in shock to see Galadriel sitting in a white chair that was in the corner of the room . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Oh wow \u2026.you startled me \u2026..Yes everything is \u2026..\u201d Lynn started to say . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What your wildest dream would be ?\u201d Galadriel finished what Lynn was about to say, as she came to her feet and smiled at Lynn .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c Do not worry , I do not read others minds with out there knowledge of it .\u201d She said to Lynn as she came closer and tied Lynn\u2019s new lacey front shirt for her . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018 But you can\u2019t control yourself can you ?\u2019 She thought to Lynn knowing Lynn could hear her thoughts . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c How are you able to do that ?\u201d Lynn asked not knowing if she was saying it out loud or thinking it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c There is much I know of you and what you can do \u2026\u2026would you like me to teach you more ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lynn Crossed her arms and thought for a moment about the choice she had presented to her, and just as she was about to say her choice .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018If the Council figures out what you are , they will destroy you\u2019 Galadriel Looked at Lynn with her piercing blue eyes .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn dropped her arms to her side, and looked back at Galadriel raising her up on the left side as if she was a cocker spaniel curious about a sound she had just heard . As she adjusted her glasses, it was all too clear even without Galadriel in her head what Lynn was thinking at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would they do that ? What do you mean?\u201d Lynn asked frantically having this feeling she had about Gandalf being untrusting and the other elf woman was looking down on her as she entered the Keep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can show you a way out of here , away from the Council\u2019s eyes where they would not dare to follow. \u201c Galadriel said as she walked towards the doorway , just to the left of Lynn . As Lynn tracked her with her eyes and turned her head to not miss anything the elf was saying to her, and yet she felt in her gut that this was a better plan for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why would they want to destroy me?\u201d Lynn continued to look puzzled , and confused . Not being a fool and blindly following Galadriel was the first notation that this human woman was not like the other maidens in Middle Earth.  Galadriel looked back from the door way just spying over her left shoulder as her arms braced the door way opening, she didn\u2019t want to show her smile of acceptance just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c They would find that you are not a random woman of the kingdom of man , but rather your very different\u2026..Special\u201d She said turning towards Lynn and clasping her hands together . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am not special trust me I am so Ordinary . I work a very boring job , a very boring life , and I am -----\u201c As Lynn was going to continue her life story told from a lonely accountants point of view . Galadriel , interrupted \u2018But you\u2019re not ordinary at all , you have power that you have barely even tapped into. Power that I can show you how to use , how to master it\u2019. Galadriel stared at Lynn as she approached reaching her hands out and placing them gently on Lynn\u2019s upper arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c All you have to do is trust that I will guide you wisely , and you will show everyone just how special you are.\u201d She said as she leaned in and kissed Lynn on the forehead, it was not a normal exchange but Lynn closed her eyes and embraced it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c All right , I am in \u2026\u2026Can\u2019t believe I am saying this \u2026..but I am in what do we do ? Teach me Yoda.\u201d Lynn said smiling at Galadriel , who smiled back at her . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c First we have to get out of Rivendale , and make our way through the MerkyWoods\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Checking in either direction then reaching out and waving Lynn to follow her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( In a Whisper) \u201cShould we make for the horses?\u201d Lynn asked as the pair strolled along the Balcony terrace. To the casual on looker it would appear as Galadriel was giving Lynn a tour of Rivendale, as they both strolled along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018We must be mindful; your voice can travel a great distance.\u2019 Thinking a jester to Lynn as Galadriel peaked around the corner and down the stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the elves she was worried about but running into possibly Saruman the White , Gandalf or even Elrond. As they continued down a grand staircase, Galadriel felt the gaze of someone she did not want to attract and knew her plan was compromised. Another of the great and powerful wizards of Middle Earth Glorfindel watched from an adjacent balcony, not making a sound or thought. Galadriel continued and didn\u2019t mention it to Lynn as the pair came to one of the gates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Be still I will handle this matter with any guards who would ask anything of us\u2019 Galadriel held back her left hand open palm to signal to Lynn to wait at their location. As Galadriel continued forward, she was meet by two guards who without any warning or sound collapsed to the ground. Without a flick of a wrist or any motion from The Elfish woman in white, Lynn was amazed at this ability she just witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That was amazing\u2019 Lynn thought as she smiled at Galadriel, who returned a glance at Lynn and simply head nodded for Lynn to approach.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018 Now watch as I clear them away\u2019 Galadriel Looked at Lynn as the two guards bodies were pushed into the bushes on either side of the path with easy. Normally someone would be alarmed at this but Lynn found it intriguing and wanted to learn this power for herself. Something was silencing the voice of reason in her head , the same voice that Lynn had listened to for most of her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was amazing was the same force was constantly bringing memories of Lynn\u2019s life in which she was pushed around or in a recent day at work , Lynn was not only passed over for a promotion. But the young 20 something girl who ended up with the job Lynn was trying to get only got the job because her father was one of the investing partners in the company , and the girl gloated to Lynn saying \u201c Oh look you now work for me\u201d . <br>\r\n\u2018 I wish I could of done this to her\u2019 Lynn thought to herself as she was reliving her memory of the that day. Galadriel could also go thought the mindset Lynn was going through but kept it to herself , of course being one of the White Councils highest members helped her learn how to shield her thoughts . Galadriel was even more excited to get Lynn away from the council and begin to train her further . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued out of Rivendale Lynn couldn\u2019t help but think where were they going and what path would they take ? She recently road on the horse with Gandalf through the Lonely Mountain trail and Galadriel was heading in the same direction.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c Are we heading through the Mountains again?\" Lynn asked now that the two had put some distance between then and Rivendale. Galadriel paused following suit so did Lynn who took this time to pull up her pants and adjust her wardrobe. As she raised her brow and fixed her glasses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Galadriel said \u201c You do not have to be nervous around me \u2026.I only wish to guide you and help you with your new abilities\u201d . She had picked up on Lynn\u2019s constant fixing of her glasses as a nervous reaction . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am not nervous\u2026\u2026 what makes you think that ?\u201d Lynn asked with a smile and disarming tone of voice .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c I noticed you have a habit of adjusting your spectacles as someone who avoids conflict would avoid eye contact .\u201d Galadriel said as she reached out and gently touched Lynn\u2019s Glasses with her left index and thumb . Lynn was at first nervous felt a little weak in her legs , but she lingered on what Galadriel said about eye contact and didn\u2019t want to break it . Galadriel removed Lynn\u2019s glasses and looked deeply in to Lynn\u2019s Brown eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You\u2019re not afraid \u2026.

Galadriel stood next to her and smiled , as a huge cloud of green fog swept around them and engulfed them . The fog swept all around them with in a blink of an eye and Lynn felt colder then she had ever before in her life she shuttered at the temperature drop and quickly went to rub her arms .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Galadriel didn\u2019t let go of her and instead embraced her with her left arm hugging her and thinking to Lynn \u2018hang on we are almost there\u2019. Lynn\u2019s eyes felt like they were being forced back into her skull the fog had a mind of its own by the feeling of it as it went up Lynn\u2019s pant legs and froze her to the bone . Lynn felt a force pushing on her face as the fog entered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018 Almost there\u2019 Galadriel kept thinking to Lynn as Lynn\u2019s vision started to fade , it was what she would think dyeing feels like. Just as Lynn thought she couldn\u2019t take any more the fog vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaken by the portal Lynn stood shivering as Galadriel released her and spun in front of her , in a grand fashion smiling and waving her arms about .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWelcome to Caras Galadhon, Home of Lady Galadriel\u201d. Galadriel said as other elves emerged from the huge tree they were standing in front of . Lynn still feeling cold from the portal closed her eyes shivering, and clenching her fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She is human?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018How can a human use a portal?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018 Is she the one lady Galadriel spoke of ?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many random thoughts kept filling Lynn\u2019s head as she opened her eyes she could see that the elves were now all around her and staring at her. Amazed and intrigued all of their thought started to sound like white noise and then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018HUSH\u2019 Galadriel thought to the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is our guest and she is welcome here\u201d Galadriel said with a smile and her arms up in the air, gesturing to the crowd of elves .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018We must not delay \u2026.we must get started right away.\u2019 Galadriel thought to Lynn as she turned and started down a path on a huge branch . Lynn was still cold from the portal , as two of the elf woman came to assist her in walking down the path after Galadriel .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What did it feel like ?\u201d One of the elf woman who had shorter hair and green eyes , she was dressed in a dark green gown that covered ever part of her skin . Lynn thought she looked like she was in her teens , and didn\u2019t have the strength yet to say anything . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Hush up \u2026..Humans are different , I am surprised it didn\u2019t kill her \u201c The other Elf said swatting away the Short haired elf . \u201c Lady Galadriel had to of known that her power would protect her \u2026..she is so strong look at her garments \u2026.so different from any other human woman we have seen\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn was still shivering as she started to feel her feet again , and she could start putting pressure on her feet and control how fast or slow she was moving . She tried to slow the two elfs down but wasn\u2019t able to yet , either her strength hadn\u2019t returned yet or the elves were to strong and to determined to press on . The short haired elf was still curious about Lynn and her strange apparel, she had been guiding Lynn down the branch with her left hand on Lynn\u2019s left wrist and her right hand supporting Lynn\u2019s back . Lynn still shivering and her lips quivering as she started to feel warmer from the legs up slowly, she would blink but her eye lids were heavy and quivering as well . Still grasping her glasses in her left hand Lynn was lucky that her head way still up and not wobbling all around. The short haired elf caught a glimpse of Lynn\u2019s belt and already was intrigued at her dark denim jeans with the white stitching . She gently and slowly took her right hand down Lynn\u2019s back and felt the smooth black leather of Lynn\u2019s belt . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That will be enough help from you too for now.\u2019 Galadriel said as she was standing right in front of them . <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then in a blink of an eye the goblins were all massacred , the dwarfs beheaded , The elves ripped limb from limb and their heads made up the walls and paths of Rivendale , Gandalf\u2019s grey clothing now draped a skeleton that was burned . Lynn wanted to pull away from the horror that she was seeing then the mirror swirled again , and she saw her office burned to a crisp . Her co workers dead and burned, along with most of the buildings she had passed on the way to work  . The final horrific sight was Lynn sitting on a throne in the middle of a huge waste land that looked like her house , she was sitting there with an evil grin like Gollum\u2019s was in the cave . Her daughters and sons in chains , her husband was dead and crucified on a steak . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Lynn was a huge eye \u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a huge eye Lynn remembered she saw that before she got sucked into this weird world . She then remember this was a computer app on her computer . But the eye erupted flames again and knocked her out of the Mirror\u2019s vision . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c AGGHHHH\u201d Lynn said as she was knocked back from the Mirror , her memories of the eye fading as she took a moment to settle herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What you saw will come to pass if you do not embrace what I teach you\u201d Galadriel said as she stood up , Lynn bent over and placed her hands on the edge of the table closing her eyes and trying to remember everything . But the visions were fading , all she remembered was that it was all burning and it was her fault . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c How \u2026..How could I do that ?\u201d Lynn asked after she caught her breath and looked at the stunning woman in white next to her , a pale comparison to what she had just witnessed with all the fire and death . The red and black was so harsh on her mind but seeing Galadriel put her at easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You are the one power in all the land , The power that will destroy or build everything.\u201d Galadriel said as she reached out to help Lynn up to her feet . \u201c You are the power of Sauron made flesh\u201d Galadriel said as she held Lynn\u2019s hands and with a glance Galadriel removed the Mirror from the table . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c But \u2026..but I am just a \u2026.a\u2026.typist , or accountant \u2026.I am not anything like that \u201c Lynn said looking up with her doughting potty brown eyes . Realizing she couldn\u2019t see Galadriel all that well she released herself from Galadriel\u2019s embrace and pulled out her glasses and put them on . <br>\r\n\u201c See \u2026.I am as ordinary as you get . Nothing threaten or scary about me at all \u201c Lynn continued only this time she could see Galadriel starting to grin . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZa dashu snaku Zigur, Durbgu nazgshu, Durbgu dashshu!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel said as she opened her eyes wide at Lynn , who was then flung back on to the table . Face up , and unable to move . Galadriel laughed as she approached Lynn\u2019s side , Lynn couldn\u2019t move her body but she could move her eyes and see that the once fair blonde white skinned woman now had  darkness around her eyes and glowing battle armor on her chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair. I will rule this realm as none before.\u201d Galadriel smiled at Lynn with her sinister look just like Gollum had . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lynn couldn\u2019t look away but once again her vision was clouding up and fading to black. She lost consciousness <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The spell was not one of comfort or slumber but a binding spell in which it rendered the cursed unable to move or speak. <br>\r\nMatilda stood quietly for a moment, trying to grasp the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned somewhat to her side looking at me as confused as I stared at her. \u201cMy lady what has happened? Is she not our guest?\u201d Matilda inquired, for some reason believing I would indulge her question. I needed a assistant for the next spell that I would cast but not one with an innocent curiosity such as hers. If she grasped the scope of what this woman truly was she would most likely try to stop me or worse try in her naive way try to over throw my efforts and reap the glory for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are well versed , she is  our guest \u2026\u2026but you do not understand why she is a guest in my presence\u201d Michelle didn\u2019t respond right away, instead just looked back at Lynn, apparently justifying my actions in some way. I glanced over to her as well , this would be a good time to judge how I will use Matilda or rather how useful she truly is to her queen. Matilda raised her eye brows in worry , clasping her arms . I could see she was still enamored of Lynn from the walk down the branch .  As I reached out in Lynn\u2019s direction with an open palm, \u201c She is not of our lands\u201d . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c she is so unique and \u2026\u2026\u201d As Matilda started to express her excitement I was of course thinking the same thought she was practically shouting out of her mind .<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful?\u201d Raising my eye brow , and still leaving my hand out palm up . Matilda Nodded to me . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat surprises you more? The beauty or the age and grace that comes with it?\u201d I was interested what caught her attention first. Meeting this woman in Rivendale I was surprised at how she was so full of wonder and excited by her surroundings , then when she turned I was in awe of how beautiful she was for a human woman of her age . That is when I knew she wasn\u2019t from these parts and must be a grand witch from where she came from . Most human woman of her age would be very heavy set and haggard after birthing more than 2 off spring. But she was still very fit aside from a small bulge of the belly , and a little more skin in some places. Then the power I could sense the raw power she had and still in awe that she didn\u2019t demonstrate it to the full capacity . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am still Surprised with her garments, they are very strange but I want to touch them and explore their functions. Her dark hair is so thick and then her face is so fair and attractive\u2026.not as fair and beautiful as you my lady\u201d Matilda said as she was expressing her excitement and eagerness , she still had a reserve and respect for me that will be tested . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quiet alright , I am also enamored with her . That is why I had to restrain her .\u201d I reached out with my hand and Matilda reached out and accepted. As I walked her closer to our newly restrained guest, she didn\u2019t look away or at me she was hiding a smile on her face for Lynn . <br>\r\nAs the words I just spoke settled in Matilda\u2019s face erased the smile as she asked \u201c Why did you have to restrain her ?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I had to restrain her in order to take her power for myself \u201c I looked at Matilda as I squeezed her hand , I could force her into assisting me . But I feel she will support my cause once she understands it , if not I will force her to .........  </span></div></div>",

I am tempted to let her have her if she survives the spell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c I need you to remove her binding in her hair , and gather 3 strains of her hair\u201d I turned and collected the great goblet of Milistilith, it would be used as an alter for the spell to be cast from. As Matilda started to un-bind Lynn\u2019s flowing long black hair I could see Lynn looking at her puzzled and blinking her eyes from behind her optical device. What power do they have ? it doesn\u2019t matter I will have all of her abilities soon enough and know all about her devices. She removed the Binding and let the dark hair flow freely first then gentle place Lynn\u2019s head back down.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201c Gather three strands from the back , I wouldn\u2019t want any noticeable ones to go missing\u201d I gestured as she was about to grab just any three . Matilda brought them over to me , and as she handed them to me she wanted to ask what she should do so I told her .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c As I cast the spell I will be weakened by it , you need to be able to catch me so I do not fall out of range\u201d . Matilda nodded she understood she was a glorified pillow for my tumble in case I needed her , as she started to come and heel at my side . I couldn\u2019t help but give Lynn one final look , a look at the one who could rule over all the lands . But lay helpless and at my mercy for I was about to rob her of all of her titles and abilities , I would rob her of all of it . Who knows what is going to be left .

As she looked back at me with the same concern on her face from before , as I waited for this great wizard or witch to gloat the silence in the air was broken with..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What if you were to drink the liquid from the goblet?\u201d Matilda asked as she pointed out the potion was still in the goblet. The comment caught me off guard. \"Drink the Liquid?\" I thought to myself, dumbfound. I had been so consumed with casting the binding spell it never crossed my mind  to actually consume the potion. It was actually kind of nice to hear, even if she couldn't wrap my her head around what I was about to do .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grand notion, but I have to carefully ponder what the position would do\u201d Knowing full well what it would do if I cast it wrong , it could kill me .

Dark and twisted and fitting for the dark magic I had cast on Lynn and the goblet . I opened my eyes surprised at her suggestion and was greeted with an even more gleeful smile from Matilda . I whispered back to her , \u201c Yes \u2026..that will work out perfectly. You have just taken a big step in your favor to becoming an apprentice. I will need more from Her , but this time I want you to see what I am about to do.\u201d <br>\r\nMatilda nodded to me as she grinned , she showed her excitement and I could hear her thoughts ringing out how excited she was. As we walked over to the side of the table together I noticed Lynn was blinking her eyes and frantically looking around. She must of heard Matilda\u2019s thoughts as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c A few more hairs , these next to her ear are the ones that have her unique signature that tun all over her body.\u201d I explained as I plucked the hairs from Lynn\u2019s head I handed the goblet to Matilda who was all too eager to assist. I cupped Lynn\u2019s face with my right hand I could feel her skin under my fingers and as my thumb passed by her lips I couldn\u2019t help but think , her lips would soon be mine . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I pulled away I turned to Mailda who was ready for the first part of the spell .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c Watch closely\u2026..

As she began to float around Lynn's boots going under and over them , she could feel they were smooth and had a rough texture . The smell of leather was a bit musty and strong , as she continued to float up Lynn's legs it was as mist gathering and swirling about as it continued to make its way up Lynn's body . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynn still motionless could hear , smell , and feel everything around her . It was as if she was in a dark room in a drowsy state of mind , she felt a cold sensation on her legs but couldn't see them or recognize them . As the sensation crept up her body at first the stimulation was so intense but then it would fade out . Lynn laid motionless as Galadriel continued to move up the table . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out like hands Galadriel's mist form climbed up using Lynn's belt and continued to move up encompassing Lynn's whole body . Galabriel forced open Lynn's mouth and proceeded in . Lynn felt a pressure on her face and then a rush of smoke fill her mouth and continue into her body . Her lungs filled with the smoke and  as she continued to feel the sensation of smoke entering her mouth , just like that it was gone and left her feel empty again . As Lynn's body had a few twitches and a little spazam here and there Matilda looked at her and thought it looked as if something on the inside of her was making its way down her arms and legs . Matilda approached the table and ducked down next to Lynn's head , she grasped the edge of the table and peaked up to see Lynn still not moving . Her eyes still closed as she laid still . She wasn't at rest and her body was still stiff as a board , a fact that Matilda recognized as Lynn's legs were not touching the table . Her feet were and her bottom but it would appear as if she was flexing and her back wasn't resting on the table . As Matilda continued to look on the strangely dressed woman , who was both curious and fun for Matilda to see . She noticed Lynn's stomatch started to rise a little , and like a wave motion towards Lynn's head . Like something in her body was making its way up to her head . As if something was sending waves up to her head Lynn's body stopped moving , Matilda looked at her and then \" AHHH\"!!!! Matilda said in shock . As Lynn's arms raised 4 inches off the table at the same time , Lynn's mouth opened and took in a breath . \" Hhhhe ...\" Lynn's eyes opened as well . She blinked a couple of times and then closed them tightly . She opened her eyes wide , and began to sit up . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lynn's torso began to rise Matilda started to stand as well , \" My lady ?\" Matilda asked hesitantly . Lynn's arms came down slowly on top of her legs as she sat all the way up . Still not making any sign or movement to respond to Matilda . Lynn blinked again , and raised her hands looking inwards at her palms she then felt her face. Feeling her checks and working her way down to her neck and to her breasts , continuing on to feel her stomatch as she continued to inspect herself she then looked over at Matilda and smiled . \" Absolutely stunning \" She said , as she felt her legs and turned to get off the table . \" It is so tight in here \" , She continued to say sitting off to the side of the table . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Lady Galadriel , you are beautiful and new\" Matilda said smiling and clapping her hands . <br>\r\n\" Not new , not new at all \" Galadriel said as she stood up in her new body . She inspected Lynn's body further and gave her bottom a good look as she twisted and felt it . <br>\r\n\" This form has had a few winters , and kept in good shape . But she is seasoned very well . \" She was felling Lynn's jaw line and was able to get a little pitch of the flesh there . As she felt her new stomach , a few of Lynn's memories flooded her head . \" She has also given birth as well ......\" Galadriel paused a moment .<br>\r\n\" Mistress ? \" Matilda was concerned as Galadriel looked out as if she was in a trance . \" Interesting , this woman is not from our land at all ......she has interesting channels of thoughts to explore .\" Galadriel could see into Lynn's memory and found a lot of new information at her disposal . \" But for now I must ready myself for all to see that I have become the one power in this realm to be feared .\" As Galadriel continued she began to walk away from the alter , she stepped forward with her left leg , and when she tried to move her right she couldn't . Matilda had begun to walk ahead turned to she her mistress unable to move , \" What is the matter?\" Matilda asked . As Galadriel brought her left foot back and stood . <br>\r\n\" Hmmmm.....it would appear I need to rid myself of the other occupant. Tend to my vessel , make sure nothing happens while I deal with her.\" Galadriel said . She stood still and closed her eyes . As she fell back into the black void of thought a Battle arena appeared , as she floated down she stood in her white splendid gown and prepared herself for war . \" Come forward and face your new Master .\" She said out loud as one of the walls to the Arena fell and the void of black empty space appeared . A Strange orb of energy appeared in the arena and it formed to make Lynn . As Lynn stood there dressed in her normal attire, she looked around and was shocked . \" What ....?.....Where.....Huh?\" Lynn was so confused . As she was about to ask Galadriel a question , Galadriel attacked her with her hands  balled up into fists . She punched Lynn in the face and in the body, as she took the blows Lynn's moved over and Galadriel continued to attack and drive her towards the open breach in the arena . Lynn blocked a few of the shots and even through a punch and a combo , \" Why are you doing this ?\" Lynn asked as she grabbed hold of Galadriel's arm . Galadriel was still attacking her and kicked her with her right leg right in Lynn's stomach which dropped her to the ground . \" Ahhhhh\" Lynn let out as she held her stomach , Galadriel rushed behind her and grabbed her arms with her arms in an under hook motion . Helping Lynn back up to her feet she faced the open black void , as Lynn was still reeling from the last kick . \" I beat you and I get your body completely to myself and all the power that comes with it unrestricted . \" as much pain as Lynn was in she realized that she was being set up to be pushed out into the void . <br>\r\n\" NO!!!\" Lynn shouted as she struggled to fight out of Galadriel's hold , she thrusted her head back and tried to ride her capture of the better position but it was no use. As they approached the drop off of the arena , Galadriel mentioned \" when you fall you will fall forever , back into the recesses of your mind . You will never exist again. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaladriel was still using all of her efforts to toss Lynn into the void she didn't notice another figure approached . It might of been a shadow or in the corner of her eye just something that blended in . As she was forcing Lynn over the edge the shadow figure pushed Galadriel over as well . \"NOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo\" Galadriel said as she began to fall with Lynn into the void , she was able to look up and see briefly the shadow figure . It was none other then the one creature she was trying to steal power from Sauron Lord of Mordor . As she continued into the black she only got a glimpse of the figure as it shifted to a dark form of Lynn with glowing yellow eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda continued to guard Lynn's body as the dual within was taking place , she was very interested in the woman who was dressed kind of like a man . Matilda thought I wonder what she looks like with out the garnets on . Matilda knew what her Mistress was going to do so she ran over to one of there war chests hidden in the tree . With in the chest was a armour chest plate , and a few other Armour pieces . 'Perfect' Matilda thought as she waved her hands in the air and then lifted the pieces out of the chest . She used magic to fashion them into a leather chest plate . Once it was on the individual it would form other parts of the armour in leather as well . \" Mistress will be so pleased that her body is ready .\" Matilda said as she carried it over to the table . She then came back over to Lynn who was still standing there . \" Now time to see what kind of a lady you really are \" Matlida said as she spoke to herself . She lifted up Lynn's shirt first up and over her head , lifting her arms up and removing her shirt . She tossed it to the ground . <br>\r\n\"I see what Mistress Galadriel was saying now.\" Matilda got a better look at Lynn's skin and saw a few age lines and a stomach that was still shapely but not as tone as the elves were . They had only seen Dwarfs with belly's and there belly's were huge . Leaving Lynn's Bra on Matilda Knelled down and began to unbuckle Lynn's belt . She noticed the button under and started to undo it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment Lynn's arms raised up and she shouted \" RGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\" Lynn looked angry and Matilda fell back . Lynn's eyes were glowing yellow and her mouth when it was open was also glowing bright yellow . She kept her arms up as her eyes faded back to her normal eye colors . But she was still wearing an angry face , she closed her mouth and cracked her neck as she rotated her neck around . She noticed Matilda ,and didn't address her right away . \" At last I am free!!!!\" She said . She looked down at her body , and noticed her belt and pants were undone. \" You...\" She said speaking to Matilda . <br>\r\nMatilda pointed at herself and said \" meh .....me ?\" <br>\r\n\" Yes you were preparing your masters body I take it ?\" She said with her arms open and looking down at her body and back up at Matilda . <br>\r\n\" I was ....I was........\" Matilda started to say when Lynn cut her off . \" Yes you were that is why I am half naked . Continue to what you were doing as my servant and you will live . \"</span></div></div>",
