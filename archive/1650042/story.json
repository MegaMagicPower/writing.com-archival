He felt the blood rush out of the two places where his nipples should have been but were now replaced by holes with outpouring blood. Goku managed to examine his new body, and found that Ginyu naked wasn't something which could attract Chi Chi, and could even scare Gohan, even though he was all grown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinyu had obviously stripped and destroyed his clothes so that it would be harder for Goku to catch up to him, if he ever does at all...One thing Goku hated about Ginyu was that this body was huge and bulky, moving felt like having two tonnes on concrete on his back, Ginyu must have really been juicing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also no hair anywhere at all on this body, Goku felt his head, looked at his armpits and legs and everywhere else, and there was not an inch of hair anywhere at all on his body. His fingernails and toenails were black, like emo-style, but these were natural. Veins were excessive all over his head. And Ginyu's feet were huge, and his muscles bulged like there was no tomorrow. His horns were long and black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least, his dick. It was long, about 7/8 inches (when not erect) and Goku decided that he might like this body after all, even though it does have two holes and its naked and may not attrack the ladies, although, the dick might...</span></div></div>",

He slipped into the sayin armour witch literally snapped against the skin making it skin tight, and slipped on the cheast plate. he looked to find a full lenth mirror where the bed was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must like to dee his beatiful face every morning.\" Goku though sarcastically.

This might be my chance if I can get to frieza and do to him what Ginyu did to me then the universe is safe. Goku thought to himself. Come on body don\u2019t fail me now. Goku went to see frieza but didn\u2019t find him alone as he was with all of his guards including the ressurrected zarbon and dodoria. Damnit with this guys I won\u2019t be able to switch\u2019 I need to wait for a better opportunity to present itself. Goku could hear as frieza was giving his speech of killing those annoying monkeys and how he will become inmortal and kill them all. Geez this guy has some anger issues. But he seems tired perhaps I can use this to my advantage. He waited until it was night to go into friezas comparment sneakily to perform the change. His body was giving up as Ginyu injured himself heavily to kill him. Come on just a few more steps\u2019<br>\r\nAs Goku arrived friezas chamber he saw his sleeping looking up to the sky in his final form. Thanks for that frieza it might have been annoying trying to transform and all\u2019. Goku then thought of everyone who was depending on him on making it. If I don\u2019t do this everyone dies, Gohan, Chichi, Krillin, Bulma and Vegeta. Come on Goku you can do this\u2019. He thought as he said. \u201cCHANGE NOW\u201d. He said as frieza was beggining to open his eyes. Oh no not now. He thought as frieza was awoken and wanted answers. \u201c Ginyu explain yourself this inst\u201d But he was caught off sentence as the beam reached his mouth as his soul was separated from his body as was Gokus. \u201c You blasted monkey I should have know it was you. What so primitive you decided to steal my perfect body. It would be futile as not even Ginyu could do it\u201d Frieza said as he was fighting back the body swap. No Frieza I won\u2019t lose this everyone is counting on me\u201d. Goku said as he launched himself towards frieza to fight. Blast where lanched attacks were countered but no one outside of them could hear it. After some minutes both were rough up. This is over Goku you cannot win when I get back in my body you will be extermiented\u201d. That\u2019s where your wrong frieza cause we always find a way KAMEHAMEHA\u201d Goku instant transmisi\u00f3n in the back of frieza sending him flying into Ginyus body\u2019s. Now to get into his fast before he wakes up\u2019 Gokus spirit flew into friezas body instantly and merged with it. Now I can definetly feel the changes already he said as he took control of friezas body. \u201c You disgusting monkey who do you Think you are to do this to me\u201d. I already told you frieza I\u2019m Son Goku and now your reign of terror is over\u201d. He said this as he blasted frieza into obscurity. He then walked into a mirror to watch himself. Well no this is definatmy different. No bulging muscles no clothes I think but the power level is definitely higher than ginyus. Now what to do now?</span></div></div>",
