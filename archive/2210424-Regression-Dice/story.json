            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura had spent the last fifteen minutes staring dumbfounded at the box on her desk. The idea that a set of dice could make someone younger seemed impossible. As she looked in the mirror though she realized it was harder and harder to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura had carefully looked over her herself not only noticing the lack of grey but other changes as well. There had been a small scar on her left forearm from a hiking accident when she was 38. While it originally injury was nothing severe it had left a noticeable scar, at least it was noticeable to Laura. When she had rolled up the sleeve of her blouse she found the scar was no longer visible. Laura had spent several minutes running her fingers along her now smooth forearm and could feel no trace of the offending mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow could this be possible? Things like this don\u2019t exist in real life.\u201d Glancing back at the mirrror she sighed. This was real and it was really happening. Shaking her head she now began to carefully search the package for anything that would tell her where it came from. After several moments of fruitless searching she found what she was looking for. On the bottom of the box was an address. As she carefully examined it her eyes bulged. \u201cThat place is four hours away,\u201d she exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura now sat down pondering her situation. The dice had made her 36 again. While being back in her thirties wasn\u2019t a bad thing she couldn\u2019t help thinking about what the voice had said. \u201cEach roll will give you back more of what you lost,\u201d she mumbled. Working the puzzle out in her head she realized that each successive roll would make her younger. Another roll of the dice could leave her anywhere between 34 and 24. The prospect of becoming so young again was thrilling it was also a little unnerving. If the dice happened to roll a high number and then we\u2019re rolled again she could easily find herself returning to her teens or younger. Shaking her head she realized that wasn\u2019t an appealing option. She needed to return these dice as quickly as possible, failure to do so could mean they could accidentally be rolled, making her much younger than she wished to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door opening caused Laura to jump, turning quickly she could see Kaitlin had returned with dinner. As the 39 year old entered Laura tried her best to compose herself. \u201cHey Laura I got dinner,\u201d she called. Laura tried to smile but could see the look of concern on her friends face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feeling alright,\u201d Kaitlin asked. \u201cYou look pale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded sheepishly as she grabbed her meal and made her way back to her desk. \u201cUh yeah just hungry,\u201d she said quickly. Kaitlin gave her friend a bemused look as she scanned the desk. \u201cOh you opened the package what was in it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura paused as she watched her friend examine the opened package. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cIt...Uh..was meant for someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin furrowed her brow as she now picked up the box containing the dice. \u201cSo what is this,\u201d She\u2019s asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura could feel herself breaking into a cold sweat as she watched Kaitlin open the box. Curious the honey haired woman took the dice from their resting place, examining them carefully. \u201cThese are really nice,\u201d she said in awe, fingering the dice. \u201cBe careful with those,\u201d Laura said quickly. \u201cTheir fragile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCmon Laura don\u2019t be silly,\u201d she laughed. \u201cWho would make fragile dice.\u201d Before Laura could say another word she watched as Kaitlin rolled them on her desk. \u201cNo,\u201d she shouted as they clattered on the oak top. Laura watched in horror as the dice clattered across the table, finally landing on six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirty six years you have walked this earth. Now this number is but thirty, each roll of the dice shall restore more of what you have lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that,\u201d Kaitlin exclaimed in alarm. Before Laura could answer she could feel her body begin to tingle as a golden light covered her body. Laura watched dumbstruck as more orbs of light seemed to float off her body. In only a moment the feeling subsided leaving the two women staring at eachother in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaitlin don\u2019t touch those,\u201d Laura said quickly. Picking up the dice she carefully placed them in their case once more slamming the lid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaura what\u2019s going on,\u201d Kaitlin said. \u201cThat voice...then you start glowing. What the hell just happened?!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed as she looked at her friend. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you,\u201d she sighed. Kaitlin narrowed her eyes as she gazed at her friend. Laura seemed different somehow yet she couldn\u2019t quite place her finger on it. Laura\u2019s skin and hair seemed a little livelier but Kaitlin chalked it up to a trick of the light. \u201cWell try me,\u201d she said crossing her arms and staring at her seated friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed as she looked up from her desk. \u201cOkay fine,\u201d She huffed. \u201cThose dice are magical. Apparently they can make a person younger. I rolled the dice earlier and they made me 36. Now you justin rolled them so now I\u2019m 30.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah okay,\u201d Kaitlin giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a close look at me Kaitlin,\u201d Laura fumed. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in my forties.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin sighed as she approached her friend. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what her friend was up to but was willing to humor her. Stepping closer she now looked over her friend with a critical eye. As she did she was shocked as she realized her friend may be on to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL...Laura,\u201d She stammered. \u201cOh my god! You...you look..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I\u2019m thirty,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin nodded, still stunned at her friends transformation. \u201cBut...how,\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laura sighed. \u201cI think the dice are magical. They....they seem to make a person younger based on what they roll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that doesn\u2019t sound too bad,\u201d Kaitlin said. \u201cI mean I know I wouldn\u2019t mind being a little younger. Forty is only a few monthes away for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe problem is though Kaitlin is that it won\u2019t stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dice are connected to me somehow. Every time they get rolled I get a bit younger. The next time someone rolls them I could end up anywhere between 28 and 18.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin\u2019s eyes went wide as she realized the implications of what her friend was saying. Being a little younger wasn\u2019t a bad thing but if the dice kept getting rolled Laura could suddenly find herself reliving her childhood once more...or worse. \u201cSo what are you going to do,\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stood up, straightening out her outfit before looking at her friend. \u201cWell there\u2019s an address on the back,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to return them and find out why the year came to me. Hopefully then I can get the dice to stop affecting me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin nodded before looking her friend over. \u201cLet me help,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault the dice got rolled again. I don\u2019t want anything else to happen to you. I can see how freaked out you are about this so let me come with you so that maybe we can both fix this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe place isn\u2019t about a four hour trip from here,\u201d Laura sighed. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaitlin folded her arms as she narrowed her eyes at her friend. \u201cLaura in about 30 minutes you went from 43 to 30. What happens if the dice get rolled again while you\u2019re on the road. What if you keep getting younger and you get too young to drive. Please I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura sighed as she looked towards Kaitlin, she\u2019s had a point. If the dice kept getting rolled She\u2019s could find herself too young to drive. If she became stranded she would have no way to get where she needed to go. \u201cOkay fine,\u201d She lamented. \u201cBut we have to be quick. It\u2019s almost 6 p.m. now. I need to get to this address and fix this as soon a a possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do this Laura no worries,\u201d Kaitlin grinned. \u201cNow come on. Let\u2019s get this little road trip started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women\u2019s jumped into Laura\u2019s Toyota and turned out of the parking lot. THe trip itself would take four hours by the highway, giving the two women plenty of time to think. Laura asked that Kaitlin keep the box safe as they turned onto the freeway. \u201cI want to make sure nothing happens to that box,\u201d She\u2019s said handing the he box to Kaitlin. Kaitlin promise she\u2019s would keep it safe and not allow it to be rolled again. As Laura now sped down the high way she could only hope they couldn\u2019t reach the place where the dice came from safely.</span></div></div>",

Her heart sinks into her stomach as they clatter to the floor. Before she even has time to fully process the implications, the spirits voice speaks once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty one years you have walked this Earth, now this number is but twenty one, each roll of the dice shall restore more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes this time are more extreme than in either previous roll. Droping back to her early adulthood, her clothes become baggy as she loses all the weight she had gained since graduating college. Left with the odd mixture of more energy she had felt in a long time as well as deep dread, Laura quickly scooped up the dice and returned them to their case. Just as she placed the case into her coat pocket she heard a voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing her alone so late young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around to see Thomas the security guard. Her mind blanks as she struggles to come up with an explanation besides she was Laura but magical dice cut her age in over half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to look so frightened you aren't in any trouble. Interns just aren't allowed to be in the office without a supervisor outside of normal hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntern. She didn't much like the sound of the demotion, but until she could get this mess sorted it was a good enough excuse as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I guess I was so wrapped in work I lost track of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to wince as she heard her new youthful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas chuckles and then says, \"Careful if you say things like that to your bosses you will be volunteered for all of the long shifts. Come on I'll walk you out to the parking lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura seeing not much of a choice, accepts the offer and is led out of the building. Once they reach the parking lot she thanks Thomas for being so understanding. He says goodbye and tells her she should probably get some work clothes of her own and not borrow her mother's. Laura breathes a sigh of relief and makes her way to her car only to then realize she left her purse with her keys, walket, and phone back in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, what am I going to do now?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Apart from being awkward it was more than a little suspicious and not everyone would be as nonchalant about it as Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura recalls seeing the library across the street advertising a clothing exchange perhaps she'll find something there. She makes her way there with no problems and finds the room where clothing has been left for the public to browse. Thankfully, it appears no one but Laura is here and she begins looking for something her new size. Her mistake comes as she takes off her coat, not realizing in her haste to put the dice away she did not secure the pocket. Once again the dice clatter to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty one years you have walked this Earth, now this number is but nine, each roll of the dice shall restore more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura goes pale as the room seems to grow around her as she skips straight past high and middle school and straight to elementary. Her oversized clothes and make up now give Laura the appearance of a girl playing dress up with her mommy's things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully restores the dice to their case cursing her carelessness. Once that is done she sheepishly moves her search to the children's clothing. Here she finds an outfit that makes her feel every bit the young girl she now is with princess undies, a pair of sturdy play jeans, shirt depicting Elsa from Frozen, matching shoes that light up with each step, and a bright pink coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts the dice in her new coat's pocket and makes sure to zip it shut. Then she exists the room and makes her way to the bathroom where she washes off her make up. With that done she looks up to see what even to her looks to be a child young enough to warrant an early bed time and plenty of adult supervision. Feeling light headed she wonders how she could ever hope to get out of this situation now.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be as fast as driving but it would definitely beat walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe located an unlocked bike that was a good size for her new proportions. As she pulled it from the rack she worried the owner may return at any minute and rushed to get going. She should have taken the time to get used to staying balanced in her altered form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as Lauea starts moving she loses her balance. She falls to the ground and as she does she feels the handle bar catch on her coat. The coat tears and the dice clatter free once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but four. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura struggles to her feet the childish outfit, that were have been tiny compared to her normal clothes and fit snuggly on her 9 year old form, becomes tent like on her ever shrinking body. She wasn't sure whether the desire to cry was her own or a sign of her newfound toddlerhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic. Get the dice, get new clothes, get to the magic store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were meant to help her focus, but her them reaching her ears in a preschooler's voice was not comforting. Laura pulled herself together and managed to collect the dice and return to the clothing room. As she shut the door, she heard people going to investigate the toppled bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no difficulties stepping out of the clothes that she knew could only seem mature compared to whatever she was about to end up in. All the tables were tall enough that now she had to stand on her tippy toes just to see the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found underwear first, she thought the material felt weird before realizing they were thicker and absorbent so if a child had an accident in her \"big girl\" undies there wouldn't be a mess. Pulling them up her now tiny frame felt like taking another step or two back. Next, she found a shirt that said \"Mommy's little princess\" and a pair of denim overalls. She put them on and slid the dice case into the big pocket on the front. Finally, for shoes she found a smaller size of the same ones she had been wearing previously. She found it oddly comforting being able to find something acceptable for \"big kids\" in her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in her new clothes Laura was afraid of what she would see if she looked in a mirror now. She put her ear to the door and heard multiple people over by the entrance. She imagined, even if they would believe a 9 year old was ok to leave on her own, they wouldn't let a four year old \"wander off\". How was she going to get to the magic shop now?</span></div></div>",

It was hardly her first choice, but it sure as hell beat having an accident. Almost at a full sprint now, she rushes to the entrance and finds her first bit of luck for the day. Someone had apparently forgotten to lock the door when they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping inside she made her way to the first toilet she could locate, a toddler training potty. She undoes the buckles on her overalls and pulls them and her underwear down just in time. Almost the instant she sits down she feels her bladder give way. As she sits, Laura wonders how she went from a business professional to a toddler seconds away from not making it to the potty in such a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she feels the urine flow stop she cleans herself up and pulls back up her clothes. Making her way to wash her hands at a nearby sink that was part of a snack station, she feels her stomach growl. With all that happened she forgot she never actually ate dinner. Figuring she was already there, Laura helps herself to what remained of the day's snack; a juice box, a bag of animal crackers, and a banana. It wasn't what she would call fine dining but it was better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura brings her \"dinner\" over to what appeared to be mats for nap time and plops down. As she eats she feels the adrenaline that had kept her going fade. Feeling completely drained she doubts she will be able to make it the rest of the way without resting. Laying down she closes her eyes vowing to only rest for a few minutes. Promptly as any young child resisting bed time, she falls asleep.</span></div></div>",

First, the sight of the brightly colored room initially confused her before the memory of the day's events came back to her. Second, she found she had been sucking her thumb. Finally, she felt something strange and warm against her butt and back. She couldn't figure it out until she smelled it and remembered she only peed when she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura feels absolutely mortified, here she was waking up after a nap in a daycare having soiled herself. If she didn't feel like a toddler before she definitely did now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moves to stand up she feels the mess spreading. She looks around for somewhere to clean up and finds a changing room with a deep sink that looks to be for this exact situation. Removing the dice case from her overalls she sets it down on one of the tables before pulling off her now ruined clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter disposing of those, she climbs into the sink and does her best to rinse herself off. Feeling sufficiently clean, she finds climbing out of the sink soaking wet much harder than getting in was. After more than a couple slips she manages to hoist herself over the edge and stumble to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she once again found herself on the hunt for replacement clothes. Her shoes at least were still clean. Her heart skips a beat when she realized the only underwear available was disposable training pants. Even after the humiliation she just endured, putting on something so close to a diaper felt like a new low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moves to exit the changing room to search for any other clothes, she freezes when she catches sight of her reflection in the mirror deeply unsettled by what she saw. The brown haired toddler with her flashing shoes and pink training pants looks as perfectly at home in the daycare as her adult self does in her office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from the image she returned to her search. After searching everywhere she could reach, the best she came up was a Disney princess costume from a toy chest. Now at least dressed, Laura looks to a clock on the wall and finds out the time is just past midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she thinks. Not only would the store probably be closed, her new outfit was hardly warm enough to be comfortable outside for long and she has no pockets to put the dice in.</span></div></div>",

But how was she supposed to kill the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze drifts to the assorted toys, she wants to reject the idea outright. But when the alternative is sitting and staring at a wall it looks more inviting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Laura only half heartedly stacks some blocks trying to make a tall tower, but when she accidentally knocks it over she finds herself burst into giggles. After that she only gets more invested in her playtime completely losing track of time. She also adds to her outfit a princess tiara, a fairy wand, and a temporary butterfly tattoo on her cheek. By the time the sun starts to rise, she's set up a pretend tea party with dolls and stuffed animals, giving each their own voice and personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sunlight passes through to window, Laura is shocked to realize has much she had gotten into the role. She is further shocked when she realizes at some point she had unknowingly wet herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't me I'm a grown woman not a little girl who can't keep track of time or who forgets to use the potty. I need to get to that magic shop now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs a discarded backpack she had found during the night and carefully placed the dice inside. Then removes the wet training pant, whipes herself down, and pulls up a fresh pair. As a precaution, she puts a few extra pairs and a pack of whipes in the backpack as well. She then heads out the front door and, seeing a car start to pull into the driveway, bolts behind the building, hoping she wasn't seen, before starting back on the path towards the magic shop.</span></div></div>",

The urgency she felt even just back in the daycare is fading though. Sure, she dropped a lot of years so quickly at the start and that had left her rightfully panicked, but it was rushing that caused her last bit of shrinking. Besides the dice are safely secured now so there's nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer steps slowly became less cautious and less pointed towards her destination. She soon discovers how fun it is to twirl in her dress as she walks. The worry that embracing her inner, and now outer, child is gone. After all, she knows she's really a grownup and is going to get her age back soon enough, so why not enjoy her brief revisit to her childhood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon something catches her eye, a park with a massive children's area. There's a massive playscape with swings, slides, tunnels, bridges, and all other sorts of things. Laura doesn't really put much thought into her decision to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole area is pretty well fenced in so she doesn't feel like there's much risk of getting spotted anyway. She stows the backpack behind some bushes and makes her way over to a swing. Sitting down, she feels the padding of her training pants cushion her butt, and brushes aside any feelings of embarrassment that would have caused her earlier easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumping her legs as hard as she can, the swing propels her a distance into the air that would have been negligible in her normal body, but now makes her feel as if she's flying high above the ground. Once she's had her fill of the swing she jumps off. Still giddy, she runs over to explore other areas of the playscape.</span></div></div>",

She sits down kicking her legs idily as she tries to remember the last proper meal she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely too long ago, she concludes. But how was a toddler with no money supposed to get a meal? What if she went back to daycare? Wait did she really consider that? That's definitely not going to happen. She'll just have to keep moving and keep an eye out for an opportunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing back to her feet and making her way down the structure, Laura retrieves her backpack and gets back on the road. Shortly after, Laura has her attention drawn to a particularly crowded one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks down it, she sees a house with a bouncy castle and a big sign with balloons reading \"Happy 4th birthday Carly!\" out front. Moving closer, she can now see plenty of kids running around and grownups mostly talking amongst themselves. That seems promising to her, it looks packed enough that one extra attendee stopping for food won't draw any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way over trying to slip in unnoticed and seemingly succeeds. She then helps herself to some pizza and finds a seat at a table crowded with other kids her age. They at least don't seem suspicious of the new arrival. Laura quickly finds herself an active participant in their discussions about princesses, cartoons, and other matters that interest her new peers. Once she's done eating she is asked to play over to the bouncy castle and happily accepts. She leaves her backpack at the table and follows after her new friends.</span></div></div>",

After a while though she starts to feel the need to poop and makes her way to the exit. As she exits the bouncy castle, she sees she's been at this party far longer than expected. After she's done, she should probably get back on the path to the magic shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way back to the table and is relieved to find her bag where she left it. After picking it up she makes her way into the house. There she is greeted by a grownup, the mommy of the birthday girl Laura guesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie, what are you doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go potty.\" Something about the way she said that feels off to Laura, but she doesn't worry about it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're going all by yourself? What a big girl! You're mommy and daddy must be very proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finds herself beaming at the compliment, \"Uh huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll show you where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura follows her to the bathroom. The grownup steps in and places a child seat cushion on the toilet then steps out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you need any help ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it by myself. I'm a big girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grownup laughs and closes the door. Laura pulls down her training pants and climbs onto the toilet. As she sits, Laura looks at her backpack and realizes she didn't check to see if the dice were in there when she grabbed it. It didn't look like it had been messed with but she didn't want to risk leaving without them. She opens the pocket and is relieved to see the case is still there. Pulling the case out she decides to open it to make sure the dice weren't removed. The case opens with a pop and one of the dice falls on the ground. Laura covers her eyes and waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but three. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura almost loses her balance as she shrinks another few inches. Why did she have to open the case? She's sposed to be a big girl and big girls are smarter than that! Once she finishes with the potty she climbs down and picks up the loose die returning it and the case to the backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stands up straight, Laura sees her dress is now loose and goes a bit further down her body than before. Sighing, she decides she really needs to get to that magic shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls up her training pants and is dismayed to find they slide right back down. She steps out of them and briefly considers going without underwear, before she remembers the accident that led her to wearing the training pants to begin with. If she ruins her clothes again she'll be in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around to see if there's anything here that will fit her. She finds a box of training pants and tries a pair on but they're too big too. As she goes to put the pair back, she notices a box of diapers beneath the training pants. They're smaller probably left over from before Carly started potty training. Laura is unhappy with the idea of putting on something so babyish. She's thinking of whether or not to put them on when there's a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu uh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't have time to think about it. She turns on the sink then lays down and tapes the diaper in place, finding it to be a perfect fit. She hurridly shoves the training pants from her bag into the box and replaces them with diapers. Then she quickly rinses off her hands, turns of the sink, and opens the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you did do it all by yourself and you remembered to wash your hands! You are a big girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura blushes she doesn't feel like much of a big girl anymore. At least the grown up doesn't seem to notice her shrinkage. Laura heads back outside and prepares to make her exit when the grownup takes her hand and leads her back to the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here sweetie it's almost time for cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura obediently follows the grownup's command and figures some cake might make her feel better anyway. Soon she finds the rest of the attendees gathered around the table. Laura pouts when she realizes all the kids she was playing with earlier are bigger than her now and figures none of them are probably wearing diapers either. At least after the birthday girl blows out the candles Laura gets her slice of cake.</span></div></div>",

Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wakes a few hours later. As she wipes drool off her face the reality of the situation immediately returns to her. But she also feels something is even more wrong than before as she struggles to climb to her feet finding her limbs are not quite as cooperative as they should be and her clothes felt looser. When she looks down to see the loose dice displaying snake eyes, she feels both terror at how few years she must have left and relief she had apparently gotten the best possible result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tries to take a step forward, her ill fitting diaper seem to work against her, tripping her and she topples to the ground. Almost immediately she bursts into tears. Without thinking, she finds herself picking up a nearby pacifier and sticking it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sucks on this newfound source of comfort, she realizes she's going to need another wardrobe downgrade. With some difficulty she manages to kick off the diaper and remove her now useless garment. Taking the first unsteady step in search of something new, she imagines in her current state she would fit right in with all the embarrassing baby photos her parents had shown her friends over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the infant would find walking to be a horrific task... she could take very small... unsteady steps but anything further would result in her falling on her bare butt and sobbing quietly through her pacifier. However, with this new handicap in mind she did manage to make it over to the next side of the room and find some diapers appropriate for her new size... thankfully it seemed as if these people had left diapers for a one year old child which she would clearly need now, if she had trouble making it to the potty before... now she would most definitely have some. The infant would lay down on the diaper and immediately try to strap it up, finding it difficult with her arms being so stubby but ultimately she managed to do so thanks to the fact she was still. The infant would then find the only item of clothing leftover that she could reach in the drawers, a heavily padded sleep to match her now heavily padded diaper which took even more effort to put on. The one year old now looked the part fully, clad in a thick sleeper and diaper... Laura would frown a she looked at herself in the mirror, her toddler hair had pretty much been reduced to some infantile pigtails which barely left her head, and unlike before... there was no way she could hide her diaper like before, as it bulged out from every side in the sleeper. Regardless, the now baby girl had bigger issues as she went to pick up the dice without dropping it, immediately finding it a challenge as she had some of the worst hand eye coordination possible, but regardless she eventually managed and knowing her mistake now... she put the bag, and the dice case in the diaper drawer... pushing it closed with clear effort and readying herself to leave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which she found a problem. In her current state she couldn\u2019t reach doors well at all... and while the toddlers room was open when she first came in she now found it shut... probably unintentionally due to wind. The infant girl tried as she might she couldn\u2019t reach it and in frustration she muttered a single word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoopie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore immediately sitting down and trying to think of a way out of her situation.</span></div></div>",

She's out of town with her husband and daughter, but Laura does remember where she keeps the spare key. She could hopefully use Liz's computer to find the store again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe locates the fake rock, pops out the key, and let's herself inside. She removes her shoes and finds her feet are very sore both from walking so far and because she had been walking in shoes that were now too large. She takes off her socks to make sure her feet didn't have any injuries. They looked alright and Laura found the cold tile floor against the bare skin soothing so she left the socks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, the sight of a home set up for someone her current age is odd. She didn't really get to appreciate it back at the party with the mommy hovering over her. Whether it be high chairs, or scattered toys, or sippy cups she can see just how different a life in her current form is from the one she is used to. It's unsettling but she also can't help but feel a little comforted at the idea grown ups would take care of all the important stuff while she could be carefree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura brings her focus back to the task at hand and makes her way up the stairs to Liz's office, but finds the door shut and locked. Frustrated, Laura begins searching the rest of the house for any sort of device she could use to find the magic shop. In Liz's daughter's room, Laura is excited to find a tablet but as she tries to use it she finds that parental controls block everything but learning games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura tries to find a way to turn the parental controls off, but has no luck. Eventually, she decides to try out one of the games, hoping taking a minute to destress would provide clarity. She soon finds herself completely engrossed in the game. After a while she sets down the tablet and decides to look around the room more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes across a mirror and is curious to see the exact state she had been reduced to. She can't help but giggle at the sight of the toddler clad in a too big princess dress and a tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's curious to see if she could make the effect more even more extreme. First, she removes the tiara and instead uses pink ribbons to tie her hair into pigtails. Next, she finds a pacifier and sticks it in her mouth, finding the sucking motion to be quite pleasant. Then, she pulls off the dress. Finally, she finds a ruffle rump diaper cover and pulls it up. Examining her handiwork, she doubted anyone could ever guess that she was actually a grown woman.</span></div></div>",

Once inside she rips off her diaper and climbs on the potty and falls right through the seat. She hoists herself back out and relieves her bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButt still damp, she goes to retrieve a fresh diaper when she decides to try something out first. She fills the tub with water and bubble bath soap then strips and climbs in. With the tub is almost like a swimming pool in her current state, she finds delight in splashing in the bubbles and playing with the assorted bath toys. Once her fingers start to prune up, she pulls the plug from the drain and climbs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her bag to retrieve a fresh diaper, but finds the dice case still sitting on top. She grabs the case to move it aside, but with her hands still wet it slips from her fingers and to the floor. Once more the spirit's voice rings out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three years you have walked this Earth. Now this number is but one. Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost. Be warned you have no more years left to regain. Give the dice to a new bearer or risk the consquences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura only barely has time to process that warning before she feels her legs give out as she falls to her butt. She feels like she should cry about the situation, but instead she bursts into babyish laughter, partly muffled by the pacifier still in her mouth. She tried so hard to stay grown up and now here she was the furthest from it. The comedic irony overwhelms any sour feelings she should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she calms down, she sets about collecting the dice. With them in hand, she looks at the flimsy case that had failed so many times already and decides she needs a new container. She takes unsteady steps around the bathroom looking for something when she finds an open child proof bottle in the garbage. After stuffing it with toilet paper, she places the dice inside and seals the lid. She then sits down and tries to twist it back open with no hint of it budging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied the odds of them coming loose again are minimal, she considers the cool feeling of the tiles against her exposed butt. She sets the dice down and, after a few more awkward steps, crawls back to the nursery. She locates a pack of smaller diapers easily and, with somewhat more difficulty, tapes it on. Examining herself in the mirror once again, she sees a helpless baby staring back and wonders just what options she had left now.</span></div></div>",

The computer thankfully doesn't have a password, so Laura is able to look up the store. Unfortunately, she learns she has only made it a little over halfway since leaving the library. If she's going to make it she'll need to be fully rested, fed, and dressed first. She prints the directions and puts them with the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she attends to food. Managing the stairs is no small feet, but she succeeds in reaching the bottom without incident. By throwing her whole body weight against the door, she pushes open the fridge and finds several bottles labeled breast milk. She shivers at the thought of drinking it but decides to be practical. She takes one bottle and makes her way back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns to the nursery and places the bottle in a bottle warmer. After a few minutes, the bottle warmer beeps and she removes the bottle. Seeing the side of the crib was down, Laura climbs up to take her nap. Once she's inside she grabs the side for support and inadvertently presses a button. The open side slides up and knocks Laura off her feet. She looks up to see the mobile start spinning and hear soothing music playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to worry about getting out later, she removes her pacifier and starts drinking from the bottle. The warm milk and the music combine to almost instantly put her to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Well you are free to return them but I might got some bad news for ya.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the girl would point to a slot to place items that aren\u2019t wanted anymore... to which the toddler would hastily go to put the dice in.

Each roll of the dice returns more of what you have lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wakes a few hours later. As she wipes drool off her face the reality of the situation immediately returns to her. But she also feels something is even more wrong than before as she struggles to climb to her feet finding her limbs are not quite as cooperative as they should be and her clothes felt looser. When she looks down to see the loose dice displaying snake eyes, she feels both terror at how few years she must have left and relief she had apparently gotten the best possible result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tries to take a step forward, her ill fitting clothes seem to work against her and she topples to the ground. Almost immediately she bursts into tears. Without thinking, she finds herself picking up a nearby pacifier and sticking it in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sucks on this newfound source of comfort, she realizes she's going to need another wardrobe downgrade. With some difficulty she manages to undo the buckles on the overalls and remove her now useless outfit. Taking the first unsteady step in search of something new, she imagines in her current state she would fit right in with all the embarrassing baby photos her parents had shown her friends over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe manages to make her way to the changing room and locate the only underwear available for someone her new age. Laying down, she does her best to tape the diaper in place. As she rises back to her feet she finds it to further reduce her walking ability and falls to her butt. Sucking the pacifier harder to dispel the approaching tears, she gets back to her feet and toddles over to a bin of spare clothes. She finds a set of pink footie pajamas covered in rainbows and unicorns in her size and puts it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the nap area, gathering the dice proves far more difficult a task than she expected, as her hand eye coordination and balance had regressed along with her, but in the end she succeeds at returning them to the case safely.

Of course, given the diaper in between her legs and the awkwardness of her steps she would soon find herself back on her bottom after merely two steps and would groan as she got on all fours, crawling to the potty as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura would crawl and crawl... feeling her bladder start to loosen about halfway there, a large squirt of pee being ejected before she somehow miraculously managed to stop herself but at the cost of her needed to focus to hold it as she felt the now slightly damp wet spot of the diaper rub against her. She would slowly begin to crawl again cutely, her bladder and bowels near full to bursting still and her toddler control even worse then it had been when she was 4. As the girl crawled she fell victim to two more squirts, this time them being less major... but still dampening her diaper a fair amount and making the Business Woman feel more and more flustered at her inability to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like hours the 2 year old would make it to the potty she had used before, quickly standing up she would again feel another squirt hit her diaper before she stopped it... this time it was quite a long one and her diaper felt positively soaked in the front... but regardless she still felt she could somewhat make it as she unzipped her onesie, trying her hardest not to poop or pee more as she did so leaving her again clad in only her diaper as she went to grab the tapes but her bowels could no longer hold and neither could her bladder. As she made a grab for the tapes she felt herself squat down and the toddler felt her bladder start to let go again as she grunted. With quick thinking, the former business woman would rip off the diaper as fast as she could, pee still flowing as she managed to squat and eventually sit on the toddler potty which... was now as big as she was... and do her business as she filled the potty with a massive poopy and a small bit of pee sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the toddler pooped on the training potty she looked down to her diaper and frowned abit. She had clearly not made it there dry... and that showed with her clearly soaked diaper and the puddle in front of her potty. It was clear once she hit the road again she would need diapers... or she would ruin her clothes. She would think on this for some time, before finally finishing and grabbing alot of wipes wiping herself down as best she could with her bad hand/eye coordination and balance... before awkwardly toddling to her clothes and getting a new diaper... since her old one was soaked. She would then repeat the steps and once again stand as a diapered two year old girl in a pink unicorn onesie, sighing in defeat and once again tired after unleashing a massive poopy... she would toddle awkwardly over to the nap mat before passing out on top of it with her butt in the air again... cutely falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

The toddler had forgotten in her hunger that she was highly lactose intolerant and as a result the breakfast shake and her breakfast were now mere moments away from unleashing into her diaper. The toddler tried and tried but as she made it to her napping mat from the Bean Bag chair... she knew it was all too late as she felt her knees involuntarily squat and it was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toddler would feel absolutely disgusted as a brown, liquid mess filled her diaper from behind in a long continuous stream. The toddler would groan in absolute pain, having explosive diarrhea in a diaper for the first time in little over 40 years... and feeling absolutely disgusted and mortified for it.

So not knowing anything else to do, the toddler spit out her pacifier and began to sniffle cutely... trying not to cry but... failing miserably as tears streamed from her face and the 2 year old toddler lost all control and started bawling her eyes out in a temper tantrum, stomping her feet in frustration as she felt the mess cling to her thanks to the diaper... before eventually she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But back outside the house, four women around Laura's former age was walking down the entrance path.  Those four were in fact Laura's old college friends, getting ready for a surprise reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person is a Caucasian woman at 45 with a lean body and saggy C cup breasts wearing a dress that goes down to her knees and have on pantyhose and a pair a three inch heel pumps.  She flipped her long dull blonde hair to the side as she approached the front door, ready to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman that's 43 was next to her with caramel skin of a Latina, CC cup soft boobs, slighly pudgy body, and a mousy brown hair that's tied up in a ponytail.  She was wearing a white tank top with a jean jacket and a pair of tight leggings with sneakers.  She tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with worried and tired eyes, \"Say, Sandy...  I know you want to surprised our old college friend, but are you sure that is a good idea.  I mean, the least we would do is call her first before coming here, in case she's not in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy turned to her friend and told her, \"Relax, Anita.  I got everything under control.  I mean we haven't see her since our last reunion a few years back.  And considering that we are here on a little vacation, we might as well stop over to say hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next woman is an African American ghetto like girl in of 46 with D cups that sag and wilt, but holding on by the suport bar and a fat like flab on her body underneath the blue and yellow Ankara Pattern robe and sandles.  Twirling one of her black and gray dreadlocks, she said to Sandy, \"Anita has a point.  Lauren is our good friend and all, but we haven't heard from her in a long time and I don't know if she'll remember us.  Hell, I'm not sure if she's in the house at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an Asian woman at forty approahced her with modest B cups and a thin and lanky form underneath her busienss suit complete with loafers and black hair done up in a bun with a gray streak to the side.  \"I agree with Jacqueline.  It's not like you can ring the doorbell and she will come in.\" she said to her, \"Besides, you don't have a key to get in yourself either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy turned to the two and told her that she got it.  \"Jacqueline...  Mika...  Girls...  You worry too much. Lauren has been a good friend for us during our college days, helping us with our work for our classes.  She would be happy to see us after this long.  Besides, you remember when she leaves a key under the matress in emergencies cause she's always forgetful about leaving without another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked to each other and remembered something like that. That's when Anita turned to her and responded with, \"Yeah...  What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy soon approached the door and looked down at the Welcome mat in front of her feet.  Bending down, she peeled it and found something she needed.  Picking it up, she stood and turned back to them, dangling the emergency house key she found.  \"Old habits die hard and all.\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three saw this and never thought that she would accomplish that.  \"Ah...  Now I get it.\" Jacqueline said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sandy approached the front door and put the key into the hole.  She soon peeked back to them and told them, \"Get ready girls.  Time to give our friend the surprise of her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she turned the lock and knob and the door was fully opened.<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Lauren looked to her younger self and was still baffled on her now thirty something body.  She knew that this dice is addicting and anymore rolls can lead her to becoming a baby, or worse.  So her only option is to return the dice back to the shop and forget about it.  But fiding it would be a chore as she doesn't have a clue on where the address is actually at.  She has to find it and fast before these dice became addicted to her.  But as she was thinking about what to do, she heard the door opened and the voice of someone familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lauren!  Are you home!  It's your old college buddies, Sandy, Anita, Jaqueline, and Mika!  We thought we drop by to say hello!  Are you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard that voice and was shocked of what she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  My friends?!  Here?!  Now?!?  How did they get in here?  Don't tell me that they found the key underneath the doormat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon looked to her youthen body in her loose clothes and immediately realized something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let them see me like this!  They'll be shocked and confused!  I have to do something?  But what?  Should I hide, or should I reveal myself to explain?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lauren thought about what to do with a short amount of time and came up with a wise decision. Hide!  Quickly, she rushed up to her room and headed to a walk in closet hiding from plane sight and hoping that they won't come to her room.  Taking a breather, she said to herself, \"Good... Now I just have to wait here until they give up and leave the house. Hopefully they won't take too long.  That and the fact that they won't come to my room.  Just as long as they won't notice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon stopped herself and realized something else.  Something she forgot about as she rushed away to hide.  \"Shit!  Shit, shit, shit!  The Dice!  I must've left them on the coffee table while I was scared to be found.  I should've brought them with me to hide.  Then again, I do that and trip, I would regress even more if it lands on a certain number.  Can't get out now and grab them.  Those four would see me like this.  I just hope they don't find the dice, otherwise, this will lead to a lot more problems then I have to go through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she waited to see if they leave, or they discover the dice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sandy, Anita, Jacqueline, and Mika were in the house, searching for their friend. But they haven't seen her yet and didn't hear a single word from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Lauren?  Are you home?  We're here to say hi!\" Sandy said with a bit of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita sighed and told her friend, \"Give it up, Sandy. There haven't been a word from Lauren since we got in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.  Probable guess is that she's out shopping or at her job.\" Jacqueline continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  This was a complete waste of time.\" Mika finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy turned to them and told them, \"Now, now...  Let's not give up just yet.  We just need to expand our search.  Let's just split up so we can cover more ground.  Search every part of the house and return if you find anything.  Chop, chop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped her hands and have them spread out.  The three sighed and knew that this is a time waster, but they have no choice in the matter.  So they split up and searched for Lauren, not knowing that the dice is in the house.  So who's going to find the dice?</span></div></div>",

Dice only regress physically and ONLY regress.<br>\r\n2. Clothes don\u2019t change with regression.<br>\r\n3. Potty Training changes when regressed young enough<br>\r\n4. Endgame is getting to the magic shop, she doesn\u2019t know where it is at first so she\u2019ll have to do some digging.<br>\r\n5. All regressions must have the dice voice use the following line:<br>\r\n\u201c\u201cX\u201d Years is the number of years you have walked this earth, now that number is \u201cY\u201d. The dice returns what has been lost...\u201d<br>\r\nX = Current Year of Age Pre Regression<br>\r\nY = New Age Post Regression.<br>\r\n6. Dice regresses the user by subtracting the number from the age you currently have. So getting a 12 would reduce you 12 years and so on.<br>\r\n7. No Unbirth. The youngest age you can be regressed to is age 1, past that the dice cease to work.</td>",
