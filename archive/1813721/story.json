As they continued to run down the endless corridors, Harry glanced back to see Draco Malfoy leaping over bits of debris with intense determination. Harry readied his wand and flicked it over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupefy!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jet of red light flew behind him and, for the fifth time in a row, missed Draco by several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned as he spurred himself onwards. Little more than ten minutes ago, he had saved Draco's life from the fire in the room of requirement. Almost immediately after escaping the roaring flames, Draco had tried to kill him. He and Ron had dived down a nearby corridor and they were pursued by Draco, while Hermione had fled in the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Confringo!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fierce spark erupted from Malfoy's wand and dashed itself against a wall beside Harry. He flinched as he and Ron stumbled from the impact, almost falling through a blasted-out window. They had both been running at full sprint for the entire chase, and while Ron was quite prepared to outrun his opponent, Harry couldn't risk one of Draco's deadly spells hitting either of them. Still attempting to see the good in everyone, Harry cast several defensive spells that he hoped would shake Draco off rather than kill him - but he couldn't risk turning round and letting Malfoy catch up, and so all of his spells were fired blindly and always missed their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Expelliarmus!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Harry's wand spat out a simple spell in the hopes that Malfoy wouldn't be harmed, and again it flew wide of its mark. Exhausted and desperate for ideas, Harry racked his brains as he dashed down yet another corridor. For a second, he seized something - a wild, improbable idea - but something that just might work, if he could just think -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Diffindo!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry jumped as Ron yelped in pain - Draco's severing spell had sliced the Weasley boy's arm near his elbow. If Draco's aim was any better, he could've severed the limb completely. Harry thought frantically, forming the plan as quickly as he could; <i>the wall? a painting? ... a small rock?</i> <i>YES!</i> Harry half-turned and saw Malfoy, barely two metres away from him, with his arm raised, and knew he had to act now. If he aimed it right, some of the fallen debris would grow larger and trip Malfoy, buying him and Ron time to escape. He flicked his wand over his shoulder -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Engorgio!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Engorgio!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell burst from Harry's wand, went hurtling down the corridor towards the fallen masonry. Harry was rewarded with a gasp, and he ground to a halt, spinning on his heels to see how effectively his spell had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, he was utterly bewildered. Draco was standing completely motionless, and it was obviously him that had gasped, as there was no-one else around to have done it. And clearly he had gasped because the spell had hit. But Harry, noticing that Draco was indeed still standing, rather than lying on the floor - was confused to see that none of the chunks of rubble had been affected by his charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat, then, had he hit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as the question had formed in his head, Harry was granted the answer right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's face contorted from a look of horror to an expression of mild discomfort. Harry watched as Malfoy's fist clenched tightly against his wand, and the blonde boy became so rigid that he seemed to be standing up on tiptoe. Harry's mouth slowly fell open as Draco's head rose steadily higher, and he stared down at the boy's feet - he was not on tiptoe at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon suddenly appeared at Harry's side, bent over with his hands on his knees, panting for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harry,' he gasped, 'why - did - you - stop?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry didn't answer. Ron, eager for an explanation, turned to face his friend, but then saw the creeping terror spread across his face. He followed Harry's wide-eyed stare down the corridor and gaped at what was happening before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco was rising higher and higher by the second. Not only was he growing taller, but wider, too - proportionately expanding right infront of the two Gryffindor students, who stood rooted to the spot. Draco, who's face was still pulled into a tight grimace, groaned with the increased strain of his transformation. His expensive black suit began to tear at the seams and split at the steady expansion of his slender frame. His chest heaved in and out with each sharp breath, sending his shirt buttons popping off against the walls and windows that still remained intact. His blazer came apart at the seams, tearing from the new measurements of his back and arms. His leather belt creaked and writhed as his waist, still lithe and slim, was pushing it to its limits - and suddenly it snapped, the metal Malfoy crest-shaped buckle whipping Harry across the face, gouging his cheek. The fitted trousers revealed more and more of his ankles and shins as he rose, and then they ripped as his thighs burst through. His shiny, formal, size 12 shoes split and frayed as his long feet fought for freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Draco's height surpassed 10ft, his mammoth feet exploded from their stiff confines and sent shoe-leather and shreds of black sock flurrying around him, and as he progressively grew up to 14ft tall, the rest of his body escaped from his too-small clothes with an almost deafing rip, and the growth finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow wearing just a pair of tight, black and green boxer shorts, the 14ft tall Malfoy eased the grip on his wand and a look of calm washed over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron were unable to speak. They stood, staring at Draco's massive, slim but toned body, his blonde head just millimetres away from the ceiling. They stared too at the revealing boxers, comically small on the giant's frame, and they were faced with the alarming sight of Malfoy's sizeable cock. They were both filled with an uncertain mix of dread, curiosity and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome moments passed without anyone uttering a word; Harry and Ron, stunned into silence, simply gawped at Draco as he swayed, eyes closed, trying to compose himself after his entire body had been beseiged by an irritating and unrelenting cramp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply, and finally feeling his body relaxed and his mind at ease, Draco opened his eyes and was confronted with the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, christ ...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco decides to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Oh, christ ...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco flushed with pleasure. He quickly surveyed everything around him - the seemingly endless corridor was now almost too narrow to contain his new stature, and his head was just grazing the ceiling. Potter and Weasley were stood before him, less than half his height and looking completely dwarfed by his strong, lithe body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it all in, Malfoy felt his thick cock twitch in the tight black boxers. He brought his free hand up to his pecs and gently caressed the firm muscles with his fingertips, moaning softly. He felt his cock stir again and was about to let his hand wander further, let it glide down over his defined abs to his pulsing snake - when suddenly, he saw Potter's hand reach for Weasley's wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'STUPEFY!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis resonating voice caught the Gryffindors off guard, and his freezing spell stopped them before they had a chance to escape. Harry's arms snapped to his sides and he went rigid, falling backwards onto the hard stone floor. There was a thud and a puff of air as Ron fell beside him, also as stiff as a board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco chuckled and stepped forward, adjusting the semi-erect beast in his restrictive underwear, and planted his long, bony size 60 feet - well over 2ft long - either side of the constricted students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could not move his head, but from the corner of his eye he could see the powerful toes of his giant enemy crunched up, so close to his face that he could feel the warmth radiating from them. He heard the rather loud creak of the muscles and bones flexing in the large foot beside him. He followed the view up the strong ankle, over the thick calves and gorgeous, milky thighs - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped. The giant blonde's huge, 21inch organ, almost fully erect, hung over his head. Beside him, Ron gasped he too saw the monolith above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Like what you see?' Malfoy asked, stroking the prominent bulge with his thumb. 'How about we let you have some fun with it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the stupefy spell released its grip, Harry attempted to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold it, Potter -' the giant cautioned, 'I can't just give you complete freedom. Two choices, that should be fair.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron, feeling their necks tingle into waking, both nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good. Your choices then - you can worship ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Oh, christ ....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco exhaled as he took in the new scene. Judging by the look on Potter's face, whatever he had expected to do with that spell - it definitely wasn't this. For once in his life, Draco was grateful for something that Harry had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so the whole \"saving-his-life\" thing back with the fire was alright, but then, anyone could fly a broom, couldn't they? it was just Potter's good timing that made it look good. And yeah, they were still enemies - but then ... well, this <i>did</i> feel good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than good, in fact. That uncomfortable, rigid sensation had not lasted very long at all - a minute or two at the most - and it had died down extremely quickly. It was strange sensation that, possibly, Draco could even come to enjoy if it ever happened again. And he had to admit, while it was just a little bit painful, maybe  ... well, if these were the benefits that he could reap from just a small inconvenience like that ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco gave a short laugh as the two Gryffindors still stood before him. He raised his arm and brushed his hand through his hair, accidentally scraping his knuckles across the ceiling of the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ouch! Ooh, uhm, wow -' he lowered his head a fraction and looked up at the ceiling, then back down to Harry and Ron; 'Better watch out, boys - not a lot of headroom in this place!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and stood up to his full height again, feeling a few hairs on the very top of his head brush the cold stone ceiling. He raised his arms up and pushed against both sides of the hallway, unable to extend them fully. He pushed harder still and felt his defined muscles tense over his chest and abs, saw his triceps rise impressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down past the black boxers - though it was unusual to be nearly naked in a corridor at Hogwarts, with a body as fantastic as his now was, he was not ashamed to show it off - and saw his long feet scrunched up, forcing themselves against flagstones. Slowly, he lifted his right foot up, curling and uncurling his toes so that the bones in his slim, manly foot rose against the skin, and then forcefully stamped it back down. The minor answering rumble sent a shiver down his spine, as small flecks of dust and chalk fell from the ceiling above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Woah-ho, boys! Did you feel that?' Draco put his hands on his waist and looked directly at Harry and Ron, still flexing his feet and subtly tensing his muscles. 'If that's the rumble we get now, can you imagine the damage you'd cause if another of Potter's silly spells backfired?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco half-chuckled at the still silent boys, enjoying every minute of their complete horror an confusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, he stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>... another of Potter's spells ...</i> he'd never thought of using one of the small, unimportant spells like these ... and if this was a spur of the moment thing that went wrong, imagine what you could do if you tried to do it right ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry finally freed himself from staring to grab Ron while the giant Malfoy laughed. He tried to apologise, to explain - but all that came out were croaks. Ron shook his head, silently communicating that it would be hypocritical to judge Harry's poor spell-casting. They both seemed to relax and turned to join in with the new Malfoy's laughter. But this small moment of relief was extinguished when they saw a thought dawn on Draco, and he fixed them with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco ...</span></div></div>",

Well, thanks, I guess - but you know, I can <i>tell</i> it's your handiwork, Potter. You want to know why? How I can<i> tell</i> that it's your spell, that it's you that I have to thank and not Weasley?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryffindors continued to stare without saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Potter, I'll tell you anyway. It's because, really, of my Auntie Bella - you've met her, haven't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had met Draco's aunt Bellatrix. The first time he had properly seen her, she had killed his uncle. In the aftermath, he had chased her and tried to attack her with the unforgiveable curses - but she had escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, yes, you've met Bella. Well, she told me what your problem is - how you can't really <i>harm</i> anyone, Potter. You're too sappy for it! You tried cursing her, but you didn't really <i>mean</i> it - you're incapable of being mean, and incapable of making an effort.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco let his words sink in, stretching his nimble fingers, ready his wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So if this -' he gestured at his smooth, amazing, 14ft-tall body with his free hand, ' - if this is what happens when you half-ass a spell ... well, it's got me wondering what would happen if I meant it. If I put some force behind it. If I really wanted it to be big!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late, the bolts in Harry's head slid into place. He snapped out of his stupour and grasped Ron's wrist, yanking him free of the ground as Draco pointed his wand at the large, pale chest -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ENGORGIO!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds erupted in a blur; Ron's mouth seemed to simultaneously open widen and snap shut, realising with horror what Malfoy had just decided to do. And Harry, hand still locked firmly round Ron's wrist, was caught between watching the spectacle while trying to escape from it. And Draco ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco felt a eurphoria unlike anything he had experienced before. Potter's feeble enlarging charm was nothing compared to his forceful, power-hungry magic, sending waves of ecstacy through every inch of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer feeling the need to clench his fists, Malfoy relished the sensation of each inch, centimetre, millimetre of his being expanding with a speed that far surpassed his previous change. The surge of magic immediately jolted him up another 10ft, cracking his head on the ceiling, so that he was forced to squat with his feet planted firmly on the floor; his knees against his ches;, his firm, smooth asscrack poking out of his boxers; his back already grinding uncomfortably against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his eyes to see Potter and Weasley retreating, stumbling through the corridor, being shaken by the tremors caused by Draco's growth. He began to laugh, shaking the corridor further, looking back down to his modest, manly size 12 feet - now over 4ft in length - grinding the flagstones below into chalk. The sight of his fantastically sexy feet spurred him on, and he let out a new wave of bellowing laughter, forcing his back and head up through the stone ceiling as though it were carboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on, Potter!' the giant blonde called out, feeling his boxers finally fall apart and his 3ft long cock spring out into the open, growing steadily erect as his voice echoed down hallways and staircases, 'Why bother to run? Why bother to hide from me when I'm this damn big?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy shuddered with pleasure as his mammoth body rocketed up past 50ft, bulldozing walls, floors, ceilings, corridors, windows and classrooms as it filled out, griding rubble against his firm asscheeks, his fully erect 6ft cannon-like cock and size 280 feet crushing desks and books and chairs into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to grow, laughing the whole time at how the mighty stones of Hogwarts crumbled against his growing form like sand. With little effort, Malfoy raised his arms above his head and blasted out through the roof into the open air, rising like a Greek god into a raging conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the courtyard and the grounds Hogwarts, the students, teachers, ministry officials, memebrs of the order and the followers of Voldemort - even Voldemort himself - all staggered against the severe earthquakes, staring in horror and surprise as a titanic Draco Malfoy emerged from the roof of the school, growing in height and mass until he finally stopped - with his waistline even with the hole in the roof, his20ft cock poking rudely from the side of the building; his long, bony, masculine size 870 feet wriggling through the foundations, his meaty toes pounding against the soft ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy stretched his arms out, arched his back and groaned, as though freshly woken from a deep sleep. Gazing down on the stupefied wizarding community from his height of 150ft, he smacked his lips once or twice, sighed and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, this is going to be fun.'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The air was thick with confusion. Wizards and creatures, who had just moments ago been trying to kill eachother, were now united in a state of fear and bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors that had been caused by Draco's growing body had now subsided, yet the drumming of his massive toes - the biggest measuring 5ft long and 4ft wide - were still sending steady vibrations through the entire Hogwarts grounds. Rubble still cascaded down from the walls of the ancient wizarding castle, being further demolished by his obscene cock. His slim waistline, still tightly surrounded by the crumbling roof, quivered slightly in the cold evening air. He looked down at his magnificent smooth chest and saw his nipples getting hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Draco?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncertain, puzzled male voice called out from somewhere in one of the outer courtyards. Draco pivoted on the spot, attemtping to find the source - his huge feet further destroyed the foundations of the castle, and his achingly hard cock demolished two classrooms as he turned. Several hundred tiles slid from the ageing roof as his abs splintered the beams that held them in place. After a few seconds of searching, the giant blonde teen saw a solitary cloaked figure moving through the crowds of stunned onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lord Vol - er, I mean,' he corrected himself, puffing out his chest and thrusting his mighty cock forward, 'Alright, Voldemort.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin, ghost-like man tore his snake-like eyes away from the humongous rigid python at Draco's crotch and forced himself to make eye contact. He fixed the huge student with a withering gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, my dear Draco. What a wonderfully destructive piece of magic you have discovered. If you show me how to do it, I shall see that your family are well-rewarded.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantaneously, Draco erupted in a genuine fit of hysetrics. His great, barking laughs shook the school and the wizards in a 400 ft radius had to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Show you? YOU? Pfft, jog on! I'm not following orders from someone the same size as my bloody toe! I'm the one who figured out how to do this, so I'm the one who'll be giving orders from now on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmphasising his point, Malfoy dragged himself free of the building. Instead of lifting himself through the roof, he merely forced his way through what remained of the wall, obliterating an entire side of the building. A severe hail of bricks, mortar and slate rained down on the crowd below, and those who managed to survive were soon greeted with a more pressing danger -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge shadow spread over the courtyard as Draco's immense left foot soared over them, raining chunks of stone from between the huge toes as though they were fragments of pebble. They could only watch in terror as the foot slowly descended, filling their vision with the fast expanse of his long, lean sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deliberate thud, the cocky blonde forced his foot down into the courtyard and crushed over thirty wizards, arachnids and even a 20ft tall \"giant\" into paste. His incredible boner surged longer and thicker still, stiffening to 25ft long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco placed his right foot before Voldemort, crushing a further thirteen people. He looked down, but saw no further than his engorged cock - where, nestled in his wiry blonde pubes, he found a dark-haired dork and his ginger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AH!' Draco boomed, 'there you are, Potter. It seems that I caught up with you after all, eh?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as he pictured the \"chosen one\" and his hopeless lanky friend, both hurdling down the endless corridor, desperately trying to outrun Draco's expanding cock. The image of his strong, fleshy head finally gaining on Harry and Ron, forcing itself under their speeding legs and making them mount his fantastic shaft, was something that filled him with an intense pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't hear you, Potter,' he said, as Harry's high-pitched wails failed to reach his ears, 'but glad you've come along for the <i>ride</i>. I'm about to have a showdown with our little friend Voldemort that even <i>you</i> couldn't match!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy chuckled and directed his attention past his swollen penis and down to the pale wizard at his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, Volly. I'm feeling generous. Because you're such a powerful wizard - and because showing everyone that I'm a thousand times more powerful than you'll ever be is such a great opportunity - I'm going to give you two choices.

The atmosphere was tense - the gathered magical beings were transfixed by this showdown of epic proportions. Hundreds of eyes flicked between The Dark Lord, the colossal Draco Malfoy, and The Boy Who Lived - who was desperately clinging to the god's throbbing cock as though his life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, Voldemort reacted. Not submissively, not humbly in defeat - but defiantly, taking a stand at his gigantic former pawn -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Avada Kedav-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's hand was on him in seconds, pinching Voldemort's robes between his thumb and forefinger and hoisting him into the air before the curse could be finished. Voldemort, stunned beyond belief, dropped his wand and instantly went limp. His fighting spirirt disappeared almost as swiftly as it had materialised, and the dark wizard knew he had lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You little twat!' Draco roared, raising Voldemort 150ft above the ground and dangling him infront of his massive, angry face. 'You've just thrown away your vote, you slimy prick. Now, I've got a raging hard cock and nothing around for miles to use it on. Guess it's your new job to sort that out for me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco lowered his hand and dangled Voldemort over the tip of his aching, exposed head. The wizard, still limp with defeat, barely even watched as he was forced onto the swollen mushroom, his feet sliding into the gaping, sucking piss slit. The huge fingers released his robes and the fleshy tunnel continued to suck him inwards. As the slit rose up past his chest and up over his shoulders, Voldemort finally allowed himself a mournful glance upwards at his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremendous teen drew in a sharp breath as the most evil and dangerous wizard of all time disappeared into his enormous erection. Draco's hands began to dance over his body, exploring his heaving muscles as the tiny man writhed around in the sensitive fleshy passage. He let out a deep, guttral moan as he gripped his boner, carefully trapping the two struggling Gryffindors between his thumb and the massive shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he managed to get a firm grip on the thick, ropey pubes of the giant, Harry's world shifted as his nemesis was plunged into the end of the glorious beast. The answering spasm of pleasure meant only one thing to Harry - things were about to get a lot tougher for him and Ron. He saw the hand descend upon him and the large thumb pushed at his back, dragging him and Ron up the length of the great dick and close to the head. And then the pressure increased, as Draco's hand gripped the cock tighter and began to pump, dragging the two tiny students back and forth against the skin of his stiff rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco steadily began to grind his tool, groaning and flexing his muscles, making a truly fantastic sight for the witches and wizards who had survived the crushing attack of his feet. Back and forth, grunting louder and louder, Draco came closer and closer to climax. His former master was now a miniscule servant, sucked deep into his cavernous testicles, and his former classroom enemy and his friend were being unwillingly rubbed against his 25ft penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulbous toes suddenly crunched into the earth, raising the bones against the skin of Malfoy's slender, sexy feet, and the giant let out a resonating roar of ecstacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FUUUUUUUUCK!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco continued to pump as gallons of cum exploded over his audience, splashing over his magnificent feet and covering courtyards in his sticky white semen. The Dark Lord was forcefully expelled from the god's massive bollocks and he too was pummeled against the courtyard floor, his fall cushioned by a thick layer of sperm. After what seemed like an eternity of climaxing, Draco finally released his mammoth member and let Potter and Weasley fall the 70ft drop to join the cum-soaked Voldemort.</span></div></div>",

Thanks for this <b>big</b> advantage,' he purred, 'but it's got me to thinking. If this is Potter's doing - it<i> is</i> your half-assed spell casting, I take it? - well, then, there are more possibilities at hand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ron gaped, unable to understand where their 14ft tall nemesis was taking this new line of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not getting it? Okay. Potter cast a spell, but because he's a filthy half-blood, or because he's a sloppy git, or maybe a bloody poof - hey, who knows? - it didn't work the way he'd planned. Not just because he's got piss-poor aim, but because he doesn't mean it, am I right? You don't want to hurt anyone so you put no effort or force behind the curse. Getting it yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's mouth still hung open, but a small twitch in Harry's features showed that he at least was on his way to understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, my present good fortune,' he indicated his enlarged body, 'could've been something of my own doing if I'd considered the use of that silly, unimportant spell. And, can I say, I would've made it <i>much</i> more effective than merely doubling my height, Potter.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry half-nodded, half-shrugged, still trying to work out Malfoy's final point before the towering teen had a chance to act on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SO,' Draco emphasized, as though concluding a dramatic story as he flexed his wand hand, 'A flimsy household spell to enlarge things, you end up with this. A more forceful household spell, well aimed with specific intentions, like THIS -'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Malfoy was so swift in delivering the the Reducio charm that neither Harry nor Ron had the chance to shield themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of blue light, both of them were momentarily blinded.

Both of them stared at eachother, eyeing eachother up and down, realising that neither of them had changed height. When they turned on Draco, they saw that his height had not changed either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work. Malfoy got the spell wrong, or he didn't understand what happened. Or maybe Harry hadn't cast the spell wrong, maybe Malfoy's growth spurt was just a freak accident - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it happened again. Harry gasped as Draco began to expand infront of them, and a wave of dread swept over him. How much bigger would he get this time? Turning to Ron to confirm that the unthinkable was really happening, Harry was confornted with ... Ron's chest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't right. Harry was staring into his friend's broad, beefy, red sweater-clad chest, and it was slowly rising further above him. He looked up and caught his breath - Ron's large, confused face was gaping down at him .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt Ron's warm breath was over him as his friend stuttered loudly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'H-H-Harry? What's g-g-going on?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck. Malfoy had managed to wrok the spell perfectly. Harry felt himself dwindling down past 3ft tall, and he stumbled backwards over the uneven floor as the two guys steadily grew even larger around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon lurched forward, shifting his hand behind Harry's back to stop him from falling over. Harry felt his friend's sizeable mitt stretching over his back, the warm fingers brushing his hair while the soft, fleshy palm curled under him like a cushion. Ron stood back up, cupping Harry in both hands and supporting him as though he were a small child on a wobbly seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry spluttered questions and threats, alternating between an anxious need to reverse the spell and a furious desire to kill Malfoy. He turned in his friend's still expanding palms to see the giant advancing on them - felt the small tremors even through the cushioning of his trembling friend. The huge blonde stopped next to Ron, more than double his height, with his huge package hovering above Harry's head and bulging just level with Ron's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Potter,' Malfoy leered, 'I'm prepared to be the <b>bigger</b> man here; how low can you go?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry braced himself as Draco aimed his wand again ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the pair of wizard's shrink Draco starts to walk over to them causing the castle floor to shake under his massive feet and adonis like body.  When Harry finally was able to see again he could not believe what he was looking at as it looked like a mid-sized tree trunk before him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping Harry looks up at Draco's giant form and knowing that Draco had been fourteen feet tall could only guess that the spell from the blonde boy had reduced Harry to being around three feet tall.  Finding himself level with Draco's knee was off putting in itself, without taking into the fact that when Draco had grown he had ripped his robes so his cock was now swinging above Harry's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody Hell!? Ron exclaimed as his eyes finally cleared and he got a look at Draco from a new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you two look so cute just a couple of toys for me to play with,\" Draco said having to squat down on his knees, and still towering above the pair by a good ten feet, as he places a giant hand on the top of both Harry and Ron's small heads.  It was just than that the pair realized just as Draco's clothing had ripped when he grew their clothing had slipped off them as they shrunk.

As soon as their feet left the floor, leaving the twin piles of clothing behind them, the two males of the so called Golden Trio let their wands fall from their hands so they could grab hold of Draco's gigantic hands and tried to make him let them go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the good their efforts did they might as well have been dealing with Hagrid's half-brother, Grawp, in fact Draco was only two inches shorter than the actual giant.  Draco just continued to laugh as he stood to his impressive new height before lifting his hands to his side and began to slowly turn in circles making Harry think of an old carnival ride he had watched the Durslies ride at a carnival in his youth.  After about five minutes of this Draco decides to have some more personal fun with his new height as he pushes Harry into his armpit so he could use his wand again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gagged as his whole world became filled with the musk from Draco's armpit as he kicked his legs which zoned right above the blonde giant's hand holding Ron's head.  Draco reached down into the pile of clothing that had just recently been worn by Harry and picked out his normal wand.  Feeling the warmth of his wand as it felt good in his hand Draco used his borrowed wand to make his own grow to better fit his new size.  Once his wand fit perfectly in his giant hand Draco cast a spell to fix his underwear just enough that he could put one of the pair of boys into them.   With a twirl of his wand Draco placed it behind his ear as he once more took hold of Harry's head, freeing the Boy-Who_lived from his pit, and lifted both shrunken boys up to face level.

This time it is Ron whose face is put into Draco's pits so he can have a hand free to open up the front of his boxers-briefs.  Harry struggles and even tries to bend his head up to bite at Draco but everything fails as he is lowered into the green and silver underwear.  \"Ah now you are as snug as a bug Potty,\" Draco said as he lets his waistband snap back in place trapping Harry with his underwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the size difference Harry's legs hung from the same legholes as Draco's enormous thighs emerged from and the waistband was also just around Harry's waist.  It was almost like the times he had to share his Invisibility cloak with more than one person if that person was a giant cock that was almost half his size and covered in a bush of platinum blond hair.  Harry gulped as he tried to put at least some distance between himself and the giant cock but Draco's had repaired his underwear, which was originally made for his normal six foot height just large enough to barely contain his giant cock and now Harry.  Feeling Harry snug in his underwear Draco took Ron out from his pits and let out a laugh as the shrunken boy's flaming red hair was a mess due to the sweat from his pits.  \"Now what shall I do with you?\" Draco asked as he began to casually toss Ron into the air only to catch him again.  This was causing Ron to get a little sick but it also brought his three foot form close to Draco's head and the nearest wand.  Ron wonders if he could grab it and cast a spell to even the odds back up as Draco began to walk in a small circle in thought.  As he walked it caused Harry to rub pleasurably against his cock making it harden and Harry to freak out a little.  After about ten minutes....</span></div></div>",
