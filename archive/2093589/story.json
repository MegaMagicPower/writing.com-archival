You see, we have a bit of a need for pairs for our best clients, and humans- I mean PEOPLE like you make for great companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules and Misc Info-<br>\r\nThe main fetish this interactive caters to is vore, of course, but feel free to add other ones. Hell, feel free to ignore fetishes altogether and write out long dating sequences. Just make sure to leave alt options too for branching paths!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nADD. More additions means more time on the front page, which means more additions, which means more to love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to make decently readable additions, and preferably (though not necessarily) long ones. I'll try to be more lenient for this interactive than I have been for some of my others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of dates will be characters from various media. Video games, anime/manga, movies, comics... you name it! Don't worry too much about breaking character, as you're going to be writing them as hungry preds, ya know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOCs are allowed to be dates, they'll have their own category. Feel free to add your own, but only if you're willing to write a chapter or two about them to start people off. No point in having a character that no one knows anything about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PDS has an on-site IRC chat, but make sure to give iconic characters recognizable screen names. E-mail me more subtle ones if you want, I can give questioning people hints that way. Oh, and be consistent, one character isn't going to have more than one screen name, and I'll be keeping a list in a private list for myself to keep track of the ones I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than all that, have fun and enjoy! That's the main purpose of this, after all!</td>",
