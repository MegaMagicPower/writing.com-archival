Her other paw follows suit, and arcs over you as well, and the amazing feat repeats itself again! The furry colossus takes but only two steps and has already covered what would have taken you a day to travel! Her gargantuan tail descends to the ground right beside you! The force of her tail gently hitting the ground sends you flying into a blade of grass! If this grass wasn't here, you would have gone even further! <br>\r\nShe had stopped walking, and was thinking of what to do.<br>\r\nYou regain your composure and look up at your goddess again.

I should never have let him out of my sight!\"<br>\r\nYou are amazed that such a wondrous, gigantic being could have a thing for you! Of all people!

They are a data and the data doesn't have gender. (According to Renamon from Digimon Tamers).
