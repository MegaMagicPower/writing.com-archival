As the bell rung to signal the final period of teaching for the year, most students were happily playing and chatting away, but some teachers knew one classes time was up. Sitting at the front of class 3H a young boy was excited he knew he had good grades, he always did. While he was sitting in class the teacher walked up to him and said \"Hey Jacob, i would like you to stay behind after school for a bit, we just need to talk\". he nodded and sat through the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the other side of the school there was a different story.There was a class of boys there who were the worst graded and worst performing class in the whole school. They had no idea how doomed they were as they threw books and paper around the room for their final day of school. The teacher walked in and called out \"Right boys, you are all going to be part of something special today, so sit down and shut up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher clicked a button and smiled to himself as he played a funny video of epic fails on Youtube as he set up a special device on his desk. When it was set up he pressed a button which started it and left the room, the device worked. A bright yellow wave of light spread across the room, hitting every boy in the room, making them almost instantly shrink down to 6 inches tall. The teacher came back in and found all the boys naked and knocked out, he picked them up and put them all into a small box and gathered their clothes up and handed them in to the school's reusable clothes bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's POV do you want to follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob : The smart boy who is asked to stay behind to talk and collect his shrunken prize though he doesn't know it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames : The biggest bully in the school, was shrunk in the classroom and is knocked out in the box<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel : Jacob's little brother who waits outside Jacob's classroom after school<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith : The smartest boy in the lowest class, knocked out in Jacob's box<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry : The weakest member of the tiny class</span></div></div>",

He never forgot any equipment and always handed his homework in on time and fully complete. Jacob listened to the teacher all the time and never lost his concentration during class time. Mr Adams came to the front of the class and walked down to Jacob's desk and said \"Hey Jacob, i would like you to stay behind after school for a bit, we just need to talk\". He sat up straight and proper when he heard this and never thought it was because he had done something naughty, he never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat through the rest of the class, learning about how to dissect mice and about human anatomy. he was thrilled with these subjects and was giggling with excitement as the hands of the clock ticked down the seconds '5....4....3....2....1....RING' as the bell sounded, heralding the beginning of the summer holidays. Jacob watched as his fellow pupils got out of their seats and filed past him out the door to enjoy their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Adams smiled when the last boy left the room and he closed the door behind him and stood in front of Jacob \"Jacob, i have never been prouder of any pupil I have ever taught that i am of you\". He grinned as he said it and put his hand on Jacob's head. There was a knock at the door and Mr Adams smiled as he opened it and Mr Fleming came into the room \"Afternoon Sir\". Jacob exclaimed as he saw her enter the room with a rather large box wrapped in a cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and left the room and Mr Adams sat on his desk next to the box \"Jacob, our school is very overcrowded, with a lot of boys coming from less than savory backgrounds and poor households. Many of these boys have failed the test this year and the Headmaster has decided to give you this as a sign of our thanks for your work this year\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Adams hand grabbed the cloth that covered the box and lifted it away, revealing a small cage, with thin metal bars and to Jacob's amazement, 6 inch tall, naked, blacked out boys on the floor of the cage. \"H....how is t...his possible Sir?\" he asked as he looked around the cage and saw at least 22 boys inside. \"The school decided to save on costs by shrinking the unwanted students, the ones who failed the test and give them to someone who deserved them more, you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Sir, this means a lot\". Jacob grinned as he looked in at the boys all blacked out from the shrinking process. \"Glad you like them Jacob, put the cage in your bag and head off home, have a great summer, you've earned it\". Jacob giggled with excitement as he put the cage inside his backpack and left the classroom and started to head off home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he met up with outside the school gate?</span></div></div>",

His friend Blake sat beside him and they both grinned at each other, they each grabbed a book and threw them at the boys at the front of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Fleming came into the room and watched as the books hit the back of a students head and he started to cry. \"That's enough of that James\". He boomed at the class as he went over to his desk and put his papers down and stood there. \"WE got your test results back in today\" shakes his head slowly \"To be honest it was pathetic, 6 year olds could do better than this\". He threw down a handful of papers in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class recoiled a little at this, but James just sat there ignoring everything that was said as Mr Fleming started to read through the results, slowly and at pains to stress how bad the class had done. \"Blake, you got 8% of the answers right\". Blake felt pretty good, it was the best score of the class. \"And finally, James' results, they were by far the worst in the whole country, you got 0% of the answers right in this test\". he slammed the paper down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't care less, he was on the football team and had all the skills needed to get a football scholarship so he had no need for stupid test results. Mr Fleming continued with the lesson on human anatomy and how the human body digests it's food for nutrients. James was bored as ever and simply watched the clock hands ticking by, waiting till he could leave this stupid school for the holidays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Fleming stopped the class not too long before the bell was to ring and locked the door with a smile. There were cries as he did this but he did not care. \"Right boys you are all going to be part of something special today, so sit down and shut up\". He boomed at the class, and they all sat there in their seats without a sound.<br>\r\n\"You boys scored the worst in the school, and the school can't afford the costs of putting such low achievers through another year if they will just fail again. At the beginning of the year your parents signed a contract with the school that if you failed, the school would take ownership of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were mutters of disbelief at hearing this and one boy called out \"Does that mean the school owns us now?' he asked kind of scared and Mr Fleming nodded. He set up the screen at the front of the class as the bell rung and they all saw their fellow students flowing out of their classrooms to go to summer holidays. A video of epic fails on Youtube filled the screen and the boys all laughed at the video, while Mr Fleming set up the shrink ray and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames watched the video and laughed when a man tried to jump over a fence and got caught on it by his foot. There was a sudden beam of light and all the boys blacked out suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen does James come to?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This woke him up, he wiped his face with his hands \"What the hell was that stuff?' he exclaimed as he stood up and looked at his new surroundings,this wasn't the classroom. Looking around he saw a lot of cold metal bars covered in some sort of white cloth. James tried to calm himself and cried out \"Anybody out there, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was met with a loud booming voice coming from outside the cage and he recognized it as Mr Adams' voice, he felt a little better and cried out again \"Please sir help us\". But what he heard wasn't very good. Mr Adams was telling someone outside the cage about what was inside, James gulped and started to shake in fear of what they were talking about out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fears were realized when he saw the shadows of two people through the cloth, one was clearly Mr Adams, the other was a lot smaller, clearly a child of the school., James held his ear to the cloth and heard \"Enjoy them Jacob, you've earned them\". And then and sudden shape of a hand came over the cloth and it was ripped away, revealing the classroom at a massive size and the grinning face of a young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames recoiled in horror as he looked up at the grinning face of a boy who was slightly younger than him, but was so massive now. The others were starting to come to as well and all screamed out in sheer terror at the sight of Jacob's grinning face. Jacob lifted the cage up and unzipped his gym bag and placed it inside \"Hope you like the smell of my gym socks little runts\". he laughed as he zipped the bag shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sound haunted the boys in the cage, the sound of the zipper being closed, sealing them inside,as the smell from the boy's gym socks and gym shoes began to flow through the bag and entered every nose in the area. Many boys gagged and coughed as the thick smell stung their eyes and burned their throats, making the trip home a very hellish one for James and his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the bag started to move, as the giant boy lifted it up and slung it over his shoulder and walked home, a destination unknown to any of the tiny boys trapped inside the gym bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag stopped moving and James breathed a sigh but coughed on the thick, gagging smell from the bag. The sound sent shivers down their spines as the bag opened and light streamed in as the cage was lifted out and they were greeted with a horrible sight............</span></div></div>",

He, like his brother was a very good student and passed the tests with flying colors. Daniel sat at the front of his classroom, as normal but today Mr Blake came up to him and smiled \"Hey Daniel could you stay behind for a little bot after school, i just want to have a word with you?' Daniel nodded and smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class continued as normal, learning about the formation of the planets and why earth has life. The other boys in the class were getting restless as the seconds hand moved very slowly on the clock at the front of the room. Daniel sat there with excitement as the holidays were nearly here. The bell finally rung and the rest of the class stood up from their desks and packed up their gear and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Blake closed the door behind the last student and smiled down at Daniel at his desk. \"You are the best student in this class and by far the best for your age group in this school. The school has an overcrowding problem and we have found a way to do it, but i am asking for your help\". Daniel perked up at hearing this \"Sure Sir what can i do to help?\" The teacher stood up and went over to his desk and took out a small box covered in a cloth <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school has decided to shrink some boys who have failed the test and we want you to take them home for the holidays and have as much fun as possible with them, make them do whatever you want, eat them, crush them, sell them do whatever you want. When you come back next term i would like you to produce a report on what you did to them and how well it all went\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was buzzing with excitement at this brand new idea for him and he got to write a report about it too. \"I will give you this as extra credit for your end of year results, make me proud Daniel\". Pushing the cage over to Daniel, the boy pulled the cloth off and grinned down at the tiny, naked boys in the cage, they were all from the worst class for his age group and the cage contained?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jacob's face recoiled in horror, then he gave a sly grin \"My teacher gave me a cage full of boys from the worst class in the school\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys left the school and headed down the short road to their house. \"Mr Blake told me to do whatever i wanted with them, and write a report on what i did for extra credit\".
