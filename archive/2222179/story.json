            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exploration was always your thing. Your curiosity knew no bounds. It didn\u2019t matter whether that was clicking one more hyperlink on Wikipedia because you just had to find out what a halfpenny was, or if it meant breaking and entering to uncover secrets. You\u2019d gotten yourself caught up in the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend, Tony, told you about this secret lab underneath the science department of the university. He didn\u2019t have anything concrete but had heard rumours that that some weird stuff happened in there. Stuff that the scientists got paid to do but couldn\u2019t tell the students about. You didn\u2019t need much convincing  after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few nights later the pair of you met up. Tony had worked out the best way to get into the underground lab and you were just stoked, if a little nervous, to be involved. Getting in way easier than you thought. It should\u2019ve been difficult. The doors leading to the lab used these weird digital locks that you\u2019d never seen before but which only took Tony a few minutes and two tries to figure out. Did you know he\u2019s a computer science student? And he uses what they teach him to break into his own uni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few of these doors and a close call with a security guard, you get into the underground labs. Corridors and glassed rooms and desks and prototypes surround you on all sides. You\u2019re overwhelmed. And then you screw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew not to do anything dumb. You\u2019re better than that. But you went and touched something anyway. You didn\u2019t even go in search of the cool-looking stuff like Tony did. The first thing you could get your hands on. It was this small cylindrical device inside one of the glassed rooms. You touched it, and then you couldn\u2019t stop. It wouldn\u2019t come off. You freaked out. You shook and shook and shook your hand. You caused a commotion. Tony came running back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he helped you pry it off of you, but you could tell he was mad. No time to dwell. You can hear footsteps echoing in the corridors. You don\u2019t know how many. You don\u2019t know which ones. You need to go all the same. Urgency rises inside the pair of you and you run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few doors bypassed, a few guards dodged, one just barely, and you\u2019re out. You\u2019ve made it back to the front of the science department building. The commotion is too far underground for you to hear but you agree that it\u2019s no reason for either of you to wait around. You say your goodbyes and that you\u2019ll see each other tomorrow before parting ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back you can\u2019t help but try to look at the spot on your hand whether the device latched on. It was hard to tell because of how dark it was outside, but it looked as there wasn\u2019t any sign of anything happening. Weird, but it could just be that you can\u2019t see it. It also might\u2019ve not done anything. It probably did nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to your house and let yourself in. It\u2019s not the biggest place, but it\u2019ll do for how much you pay. Your housemate\u2019s already gone to bed but has left evidence that they\u2019ve been around. Leftover takeout on the kitchen table. You turn your nose up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room you find your dog, Jasper, sleeping beside the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s living the life,\u201d you say, smiling at him as you drop down on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroke the top of Jasper\u2019s head a couple of time before rolling your head back and resting your eyes for a moment. That moment gets weird though. You feel like you\u2019re sinking more than you normally sink in the sofa. Then you feel like you\u2019re rising. That\u2019s weird. It\u2019s really weird. Your eyes snap open and you\u2019re not on the sofa anymore. You\u2019re floating above it. You\u2019re floating above... is that you?? You can see your body sat on the sofa below you. It isn\u2019t moving. You try to look at yourself but you almost can\u2019t. It\u2019s like your partially see-through. Like a ghost. Are you a ghost??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is weird. It\u2019s too weird. You keep moving up but don\u2019t know how to stop. The ceiling\u2019s getting closer. You put your hands up to stop yourself but they just go straight through it. Your attention turns back to the scene below you. Maybe it\u2019s a weird dream. Like a lucid dream. If it is a dream you can control what happens. You\u2019re too panicked to just \u2018control\u2019 it though. You don\u2019t feel in \u2018control\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frantically reach down towards yourself. You\u2019re terrified as you keep getting further and further away, and then you rush downward. You throw your hands down, desperately trying to stop. You miss your body and manage to bring yourself to a halt just above Jasper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to breathe a sigh of relief but a moment is all you get. You look down and see one of your hands Ilyas gone through Jasper\u2019s back. It\u2019s inside him. It just passed through as if Jasper wasn\u2019t there. You freak out and pull your hand away but something comes out with it. Something big. A ghost, like you, but not you. Your mouth drops. That ghost looks like Jasper. It IS Jasper. You feel your head start to spin, if you still have a head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you freak out again and throw Jasper\u2019s ghost just to get it off your hand. The throw sends you actually spinning this time. The momentum<br>\r\nSends you downwards and you watch as Jasper\u2019s ghost hits your body and disappears right before you body starts to move again. That\u2019s all you see before you hit Jasper\u2019s body back first and everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensation comes flooding back to you all at once. You can feel the ground below you, hear sounds around you and smell scents around you. Something\u2019s off though. You try to groan but all you hear is a whimper. You try to rub your head but then you see your hand. It\u2019s a paw! You yelp as you jump up. Four legs catch you and you\u2019re stunned into silence. Brown fur covers your two front legs and all of the colours around you look off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUneasily, you try to walk slowly to the other side of the room. There\u2019s a full body mirror that your housemate left in the living room. You step in front of it and almost fall over. It\u2019s like you already knew but couldn\u2019t believe it. Jasper is looking back at you. He copies every nod, every tail wag, every movement. You turn away from the mirror and are caught by an even bigger shock. Your body is still on the sofa. It\u2019s still asleep, but it\u2019s moving. It\u2019s breathing and it\u2019s head is moving back and forth. All things it wasn\u2019t doing when you were a ghost and before Jasper hit it. Is that Jasper??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shock comes out as a couple of barks. This can\u2019t be real, this can\u2019t be real. You think to yourself over and over again as you walk in circles on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought hits you. It\u2019s a hopefully thought, but an idea all the same. You left your body before. Maybe you can do it again? You try to sit down in Jasper\u2019s body, which takes you a few goes, and focus. You hear a light thud and look down. You\u2019re floating again and you can see Jasper\u2019s body slumped on the ground below you. Your arms and the rest of you are all see-through again. You\u2019ve done it! Well, you\u2019ve almost done it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get this right,\u201d you mutter to yourself, not sure if anyone could hear you right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to float slowly towards your body. A small sense of pride washes over you as you feel more in control. You reach your body and waste no time. Your hand plunged into your body and pulls Jasper\u2019s ghost out. Even his ghost is sleeping. You throw his ghost at his body and the one disappears into the other almost as soon as it hits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here we go,\u201d you mumble, psyching yourself up as you push your way back into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir returns to your lungs and you lurch forward. You look down and pat yourself all over. It\u2019s looks and feels like you. You jump up front he sofa and step over a new snoring Jasper and look in the mirror. Your own face is looking back, copying every move you make. You\u2019ve done it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is buzzing. So much has happened. There\u2019s no way it can be real. But you\u2019re tired. You can\u2019t bring yourself to do any more thinking on it. You drag yourself upstairs and all but collapse on your bed. Until tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShouting from downstairs drags you kicking and screaming out of sleep. You push up from the pillow that must\u2018ve been cushioning your face all night. You hear your name being called by your housemate. By the way, who are you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Jamie Oxford - 19 year old guy in his first year of university. You live with your housemate Dan and, as you\u2019ve met, your dog Jasper. You\u2019re also single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Melanie \u201cMels\u201d Turner - 19 year old girl on her first year of university. You live with your housemate Becky and, as you\u2019ve met, your dog Jasper. You\u2019re also single.</span></div></div>",

Dan is still calling your name and figure you should see what he wants. You drag yourself across the room and poke your head through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you call to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m headed out mate. I\u2019ve got a lecture and I\u2019m running late. D\u2019you mind grabbing some toilet roll if you get a chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine,\u201d you say as you trudge to edge of your bed and fall back onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to rub your head. You stop and sit up. That reminded you of something. What\u2019s that french phrase? Whatever. You look down at your hand. It\u2019s your normal hand and arm. Nothing off or weird about it at all. But was last night weird. You cast your mind back. You and Tony caused a ruckus in the university\u2019s underground lab. That happened. Then you came home. That happened. What happened afterwards though? You must\u2019ve just gone straight to bed. It makes sense to you. You are still in your clothes from last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think a bit harder and remember the weirder bits of last night. The device, the part where you were a ghost, AND the part where you were Jasper. These hit you. You were a ghost... and then you were your dog. But no. It was a weird dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh it off to yourself and head downstairs to grab some breakfast. As you head down, you pull your phone out of your pocket and go to give Tony a call. You cut across the living room but something stops you before you can hit dial. Nothing was in your way. You thought you saw something. You look over. Jasper. He\u2019s still asleep, no surprise. But you swear he\u2019s in the exact same place and position that he was last night... when you left his body and put him back in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, it was just a dream... but this is a weird coincidence. What if it wasn\u2019t. You look<br>\r\nAt your phone, then back to Jasper...</span></div></div>",

What do you say? You didn\u2019t plan this far ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tony,\u201d you start uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sounds like he can sense the weirdness in your tone. You didn\u2019t hide it all that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright, Jamie? You sound weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Jasper and then at your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony. After last night did you see anything... weird?\u201d you finally ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird? Like what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. Like, something out of the ordinary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony goes quiet for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you\u2019re alright,\u201d he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you\u2019re just tiptoeing around the subject and it\u2019s getting frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. So something weird happened after I got home last night. I don\u2019t really know how to describe it. Can I come over and show you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony doesn\u2019t say anything for a moment. You can\u2019t help but really feel the weirdness of this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, I guess. It\u2019ll have to be quick though. I\u2019ve got a lecture in an hour\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be over in 10.\u201d you say before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run upstairs and grab a couple of bits before rushing back downstairs to the door. As you reach the door you look back into the living room and see Jasper still asleep. You could have one more try as him... no. You\u2019re in a rush. Forget it. You head out, hop on your bike, and cycle over to Tony\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later you arrive and are let in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s this thing you need to show me?\u201d Tony asks. He doesn\u2019t sound impressed or interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so last night we were in the underground labs, right?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Tony\u2019s tone makes you feel a bit stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat weird device that got stuck to me... I think it did something to me,\u201d you say hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018did something\u2019? Tony sounds more curious now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre your housemates here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as far as I know? Wait, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into his living room and take a seat on his sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie,\u201d he starts again, \u201cif this is about a rash or a lump I did not sign up for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no. Sit down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks confused and weirded out. His face tells you that he isn\u2019t sure of what to do or say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me,\u201d you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and uncomfortably he takes a seat on one of chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you begin, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll believe me if I tell you so I\u2019ll just show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me what?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to concentrate and quickly feel that familiar feeling from last night. The one you weren\u2019t sure you actually experienced where you felt weightless. You look down and see your own body unconscious on the sofa and getting further away as you rise up. You stop yourself from rising with more ease than last time and turn to face Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asks, looking at your body but not at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony! Look up here,\u201d you call, but he doesn\u2019t respond. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t hear you. Ohhh, what if he can\u2019t see or hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie? Is this what you wanted to show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise you need to take a different approach. You float down to Tony\u2019s chair and reach your hand into him like you had done with Jasper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, what\u2019s that?\u201d Tony asks just as you pull his ghost out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks right at you and loses all words. His eyes go wide and his mouth hangs open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony, don\u2019t freak out,\u201d you say, staying calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can I see through you?\u201d he almost shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just me,\u201d you say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks down at himself and freak out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can I see through me??\u201d he\u2019s not getting any calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust listen to me,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we dead???\u201d Tony yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try push your face into your hands but they just kind of go through your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Tony. Shut up and listen. You\u2019re not dead. I\u2019m not dead. We\u2019re not dead. This is the weird thing I was trying to tell you about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re right, Jamie. This is weird.\u201d he hits out. He\u2019s not doing much better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt settles in that words aren\u2019t going to calm him. You need action. No action is going to hit as hard as, well, a drastic one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Tony, this is the only way you\u2019ll listen to me,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tony can get a word in to question you you turn around and push him into your body. His ghost disappears into your former form which almost immediately comes to life. You watch your eyes flick open as your body jumps up and starts looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie? Jamie?\u201d Tony (in your body) starts asking, panic clearly setting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float down into Tony\u2019s body. The first thing you notice is the the feeling of the chair against your new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I looking at myself?\u201d you hear your old voice shout. Tony isn\u2019t taking this well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand, feeling off balance for a moment in Tony\u2019s body but getting the hang of it pretty quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony, it\u2019s me,\u201d you say, feeling surprised at hearing Tony\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, clearly still freaked out by not hearing his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Jamie. This is the thing I wanted to show you. I don\u2019t know how, that thing in the lab made me able to hop around different bodies,\u201d you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s breathing calms down a bit as he starts to look over your body, his current one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of explaining, Tony finally gets to a place where he\u2019s ready to talk completely calmly about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you can do this at will? Like, whenever you want?\u201d Tony asks with your voice whilst patting his new arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure,\u201d you say. You\u2019re not actually all that sure now that you think about it, \u201cI guess I\u2019ve only really been you and Jasper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nuts that you were your own dog last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony stops and looks over at you. You recognise the look he\u2019s giving you with your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, switch us back. I need to get to my lecture. But afterwards we need to meet up and test this out,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy wait until after the lecture?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I can\u2019t afford to miss any more of them?\u201d he comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no. Why don\u2019t we test it out at your lecture?\u201d you clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony gives you a smile and says...</span></div></div>",

We can\u2019t go as ourselves,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to think about it and agree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just fly over there and find some bodies to try,\u201d he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t need to be told twice as you start to float out of Tony\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, urm, Jamie?\u201d you hear Tony call after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d you look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I fly this thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost laugh to yourself. \u201cYou mean your ghost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll just get used to eventually. It\u2019s how I learned, you finish as you turn and start to float out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take too long for the pair of you to reach the computer science department building of the university. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so now what?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s eyes watch the people below keenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my class,\u201d he tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you say looking down at them and then back at him, \u201cI guess let\u2019s pick some people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d Tony says before diving down into the crowd without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you saw which person he dove into. It was a dark-haired guy. You don\u2019t have time to pick a person. You need to stay close to Tony or you might not be able to get him back. The pressure gets to you and you dive into the crowd as close to the person you think Tony is as possible. All of a sudden you feel the world around you again. Your back on solid ground, breathing air, and you can feel the nudges of all the people around you moving in the same direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you the guy that you think is Tony. No time to work out who you are just yet. You push your way through the crowd until you reach him. You pay him on the shoulder a few times. He turns and looks at you but doesn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony?\u201d you ask. This voice definitely isn\u2019t yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes go wide and he pulls you into one of the side corridors as soon as you get into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJamie, is that you?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d you say, \u201cwho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean my body?\u201d he steps back and flexes his new arm muscles, \u201cTrevor Bailey. A gym guy and rower who killed the idea that computer science is just full of lanky, beer-bellies geeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly you\u2019re a lanky beer-bellied geek,\u201d you start. \u201cWait, who am I?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, about that.

You\u2019re left outside his house wishing that that had gone a different way and wondering what to do in the meantime. You take your bike and start to ride it back to your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home gives you some time to think on what to do for the next few hours before you meet up with Tony. You take your bike into the house and park it in the back garden. Coming back into the house, you walk into the living room only for Jasper to rush at you seeking attention. You rub his head and remind him of what a good boy he\u2019s been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s a good boy? You. You\u2019re such a good boy. Hey,\u201d you pause, thinking about last night, \u201cthanks for letting me be you last night pal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sparks a thought. An idea of what to do. At least, a couple of ideas on what to do. Jasper\u2019s awake now. What if you swapped with him now and let him actually try being human while you get to grips with being a dog?<br>\r\nOr, you did agree to meet up with Tony after his lecture, but you never said who you would be. You could float yourself over to the uni and meet up with him as someone else?<br>\r\nYou could also just wait out the next few hours and meet Tony as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts course through your mind as you give Jasper the attention he craves until you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You run upstairs to your room and throw yourself down on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019ll be safe and out of the way here,\u201d you say to your own body as you pull your ghost out and start to float away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass through your bedroom door, through the walls, and then you\u2019re outside and getting further and further away from your house. As you get the hang of it you start building the courage and go gradually quicker and quicker. Nothing too crazy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the university to come into view and you hover above it for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTony won\u2019t be out for a few hours,\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cwhoever I pick will have to keep me busy for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at all of the different places across the campus. The science block and library don\u2019t interest you. Neither do the English, history or geography buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of floating around you narrow it down to two choices. The cafe courtyard has outdoor seating. You saw a few people out there who could be fun to be. Alternatively, there\u2019s the gym. You were never that strong or that fast, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. That level of fitness was just never for you. It could be fun to see what it\u2019s like though. And imagine the look on Tony\u2019s face if you went to meet him and just immediately picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s it, decision made. You\u2019re going to the gym. You float down, being careful not to make contact with anyone on the way. You\u2019d never been inside the uni gym before so you figured that going through the front door as if you weren\u2019t a ghost is the best way forward. You ignore the reception desk, half expecting them to spot and stop you, and look for some form of directions. You spot them just beyond pointing towards the gym, the pool, and the track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for you to decide that the gym is the place to go. You follow the corridors and staircases as per the signs, almost bumping into a member of staff and a someone else who were both headed in the other direction until you find what you were looking for. A large, open room with rows and rows of treadmills, bike machines and other cardio equipment at one side. Free weights dominate the other side of the room whilst weight machines cover the space in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere aren\u2019t too many people around but a couple of them do catch your eye. Over in the weight section you see a large well-built man part let go of the pull up bar to take a quick break. He walks over to the water fountain to take a drink. On the other side of the room you a toned woman come out of the changing rooms and head for one of the treadmills. You recognise her. She\u2019s not a stranger to you like the other man is. Well, not as much of a stranger. You think her name\u2019s Ellie. She\u2019s in some of your lectures and has definitely caught your eye more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one last look around the room but already know that these two are your options. You look between the two and quickly make up your mind as you start to float towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You float over all of the weight and cardio machines between you and Ellie until you were right beside her. Your mind races. Yesterday none of this would have seemed possible. 24 hours later and you\u2019ve been a dog, another man, and, in a few moments, a woman as well. Ellie climbs onto the treadmill and starts to press at the buttons. You need to do it now or your first experience as Ellie will be your balance on a treadmill. Taking a deep breath, or the ghost equivalent, you push forward and into Ellie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the feelings that you\u2019ve been slowly getting used to rush at you all at once. You can suddenly breathe again, you can feel the ground beneath your feet and you\u2019re no longer see through. This is different though. There\u2019s a weight on your chest that forces you to lean forward, and you have to work hard to stand straight. You look down at your new chest and see the slightest bit of Ellie\u2019s cleavage through her sports bra. Your new hands race up to your chest. That\u2019s when you notice them. Far more slender than you\u2019re used to. Her arms are thinner than yours, and even than Tony\u2019s. You don\u2019t think you can compare Jasper\u2019s. There\u2019s a wristband with a numbered a key hanging there. It must be her locker number. Your hands run below your chest to your midsection. It\u2019s all smooth and slim right up until your new hands meet your new abs. You\u2019ve never had those before. They\u2019re not huge, but they\u2019re there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get so caught up in exploring your new body that you almost forget where you are. You have a quick glance around the room. No one\u2019s been watching you. There still aren\u2019t all that many people there. The guy you noticed before is still over in the corner, and there\u2019s only 3 or 4 others in the room. You turn back to your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll borrow you in lectures every now and then,\u201d you say to yourself, getting a kick out of hearing Ellie\u2019s soft voice say the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve still got a lot of time to kill before Tony\u2019s out of his lecture. You look to the treadmill and start fiddling with the controls. After a couple of minutes of not knowing what you\u2019re doing you manage to get it started. The machine starts off at a crawl, so slow that you actually struggle to walk. Part of that struggle is also you not being familiar with a woman\u2019s body, though. You increase the speed to more of a normal walking pace and go from there. The feeling of your new breasts bouncing with every step throws you a bit at first. It\u2019s both distracting and tips your balance, but you get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you say to yourself as you prepare to speed it up again, \u201clet\u2019s take this slow so I can figure out what you can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later you\u2019ve covered 5km, according to the treadmill\u2019s display, and feel like you could go on forever. You gradually slow down the treadmill to a stop and climb off of it. That felt amazing though! You completely love the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what being fit feels like,\u201d you hug yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room at the other machines and wonder what else you could try out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you climb out of your last weight machine. You feel like you\u2019ve had such a good workout, something you\u2019ve never felt before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should take up running,\u201d you say to yourself with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out of the room. As you leave you spot a a man sat at bench watching you go. You don\u2019t know Or recognise him but your body reacts to the sight of him. You\u2019re not sure what to do and, without really thinking, you wink at him as you walk out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was weird. That was weird. That was weird,\u201d you say to yourself over and over as you head towards the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in, hoping Ellie\u2019s locker won\u2019t be hard to find, and come face to face with a man stood naked in the middle of the room. You stop dead in your tracks and your eyes shoot straight down as you remember whose body you\u2019re in and realise that you\u2019re in the men\u2019s room. The man spots you and doesn\u2019t attempt to cover up. He shoots you a wink which almost makes you throw up as you turn on your heels and leave as quickly as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that no one saw you go into the wrong changing room, you head into women\u2019s changing rooms this time. You just want to get out of the gym and wish that Ellie\u2019s locker wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find. As luck would have it, it isn\u2019t. You pull out her things, throw a shirt on over her sports bra, and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass by the gym reception you pull her phone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c21 messages and 2 missed calls in the last hour? How are you people so popular,\u201d you ask yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen on her phone changes suddenly. The notifications disappear and are replaced with text that reads \u2018facial recognitions\u2019 a second or two later the text turns green and her phone unlocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was easy. And lucky,\u201d you say to yourself, seriously thinking that you might revisit Ellie\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crosses your mind. You want something to remember this by. You open up the camera app, try to pull the hottest face you can, and snap a picture. With a smile you send the picture to your own phone with the caption \u2018hey hot stuff\u2019, and then delete the picture and message from Ellie\u2019s phone so that she\u2019ll be none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the computer science building to meet Tony, loving the feeling of having everyone you pass watch you with either lust or envy. They all either want to be Ellie or sleep with Ellie. But you\u2019re Ellie, so they all either want to be your or sleep with you. You can\u2019t help but grin and feel powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the computer science building you see masses of students filing out. You\u2019ve made it just in time. You hang hang back and keep an eye out for Tony.  He ends up being one of the last to come out. He steps foot outside of the building and stops to look around. After a few moments he pulls out his phone and starts typing away. Tony stands around for a few more minutes, periodically checking his phone, before walking away. You follow at a safe distance behind... this could be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Tony to one of the courtyard cafes. He goes inside and comes out a few minutes later with a drink in hand. When he grabs a seat an empty outdoor table you decide to make your move. He\u2019s still looking around and is caught off guard when you approach him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you say sweetly, \u201cis that seat taken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks taken aback, \u201cum, no. You can have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you beam a smile as you join him at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you wanted to sit here?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere else would I want to sit?\u201d you tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks across at another table before turning back to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he starts unconfidently, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you look down at the table, \u201ccould I be the friend you\u2019re looking for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d he starts but trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou extend your hand out to him, \u201chi. I\u2019m Ellie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes it hesitantly and shakes, \u201cTony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re so bad at this,\u201d you break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMate, it\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d you thrust your hands towards yourself, \u201cIt\u2019s Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s mouth drops and you worry that his jaw\u2019 unhinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you - are you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at him, \u201cdo I need to prove it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes please,\u201d he replies, both quicker than your expected and quicker than you\u2019re comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you say, feeling annoyed that you\u2019re giving up Ellie\u2019s body so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus and pull your ghost out of Ellie\u2019s body. Her hand rushes up to her head as she starts to rub it. You need to be quick. You pull Tony\u2019s ghost from his body and push it into Ellie\u2019s and dive into Tony\u2019s before it collapses in a public place. Sensation returns to you as you turn to the body you\u2019d inhabited only seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks like he\u2019s in a dream. Ellie\u2019s face is grinning from ear to ear. Her hands dab at her face, cup her breasts, and run along her sides as Tony settles into his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl,\u201d he says with Ellie\u2019s voice, turning his attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d you say back with Tony\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a hot girl,\u201d he says again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut like, a really hot girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forget that I was her first,\u201d you almost laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane!\u201d he almost shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a few minutes trying to calm Tony down so that the two of you can discuss plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s the plan?\u201d Tony finally asks, clearly trying to not play with his new chest in a public space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were coming up with the plan?\u201d you say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, I was I a lecture I couldn\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay, we\u2019ll figure something out,\u201d you start, \u201cfirst things first though...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ellie\u2019s might well still be in here, but mine isn\u2019t my body. You\u2019re the only one in my body. If you leave my body it\u2019s gonna go unconscious and you\u2019re going to draw attention to yourself,\u201d Tony argues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it hard to argue with his point. Partly because it\u2019s a good point and partly because it came from Ellie\u2019s mouth, even if Tony is the one in control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d you say, \u201cl\u2019ll drop your body off at yours and ghost my way over to mine. See you at my place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony examines the back of his new hand before giving an \u2018mhmm\u2019 in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, you\u2019ve left Tony\u2019s body on his bed in his house, floated over to yours and jumped back into your body. You check your phone and only have a few notifications from the hours you\u2019ve been away. There\u2019s a message from the family group chat, four missed calls from Tony, each only about 2 minutes apart, and a picture from an unknown number. You smile and open that message. You\u2019re greeted with the selfie you took as Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird to think that that was me who took that,\u201d you say aloud before you put your phone down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the doorbell makes you jump. You race down the stairs and open the door to reveal Ellie. You know it\u2019s not Ellie, though. Tony\u2019s still in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the trouble I had getting here,\u201d he says through her voice, \u201c4 different guys tried to pick me up. Only three of them metaphorically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just say the word and I\u2019ll swap with you,\u201d you say. He doesn\u2019t give you an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe walk over gave me some thinking time though,\u201d he said as walked over into your living room and sat himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, hear me out,\u201d Tony started, \u201clet\u2019s...\u201d</span></div></div>",

That means that he was you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling as ready as you\u2019ll ever feel, you sit back and focus. You concentrate hard, not really remember how this works. It doesn\u2019t take long for that weird yet kind of familiar feeling to come back. Y\u2019know, that one where you\u2019re floating. You look down and are almost surprised. You\u2019re a ghost again. You can see through your hands and see your body unconscious on the sofa below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe novelty wears off quickly. You look across the living room and see Jasper. You float your ghost self over to him with far more ease than you did the first time. Slowly, you reach your hands into Jasper and pull his ghost out. You can\u2019t help but think how funny it is that his ghost stays sleeping through this. You turn back and push his ghost into your body.

You look down and see your furry legs supporting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of excitement you run to the mirror. It\u2019s Jasper. You see Jasper looking back. You give yourself a big doggy grin and start yapping in joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears pick up a noise that brings your cheers to an abrupt end. What is that? It\u2019s quiet and subtle.

You\u2019re almost afraid to look down but you do anyway. Your hands rush up to your chest, but they\u2019re not your hands, and it\u2019s not your chest. The hands in front of you are more tanned and manicured than your own and the chest bigger. The outfit isn\u2019t yours, it\u2019s Becky\u2019s. As you look down a few strands of brown hair fall in front of your face... but you\u2019re a blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t need to be told. You already know what\u2019s happening but you rush to your bedroom mirror anyway. The face looking back at you isn\u2019t yours, but you knew that. It\u2019s the shocked face of your housemate. Becky\u2019s face sits wide-mouthed on top of her shoulders. Just like with Jasper\u2019s body last night, her reflection follows every movement you make. Every smile and frown, every wave of your hands. You\u2019re Becky.

It went into my body. Where was Becky\u2019s ghost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought hits you. Last night you pulled Jasper\u2019s ghost out of his body. You didn\u2019t pull Becky\u2019s ghost out. You just went straight in. There\u2019s so much to this new power of yours you don\u2019t understand. It would be boring to keep it to yourself though, right? Maybe you should jump back into your own body and come clean to Becky. You could go tell all to Tony. Or... you could stick as Becky for a bit. The two of you have a lecture together later today and it could be fun to go as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mull it over you feel a vibration in your pocket. You pull Becky\u2019s phone out and look. She, well, you\u2019ve got a call from Caleb, Becky\u2019 as boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one more look in the mirror at your new reflection and...</span></div></div>",

Becky and Caleb have been together since before university started. They\u2019re hometown sweethearts who decided they would do everything in their power to make it work after Caleb got a job in their hometown and Becky got a place at uni here, three hours away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great. Did you have anything in mind?,\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a few ideas. But maybe we could start with lunch. Melanie can join us if you guys want,\u201d Caleb replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly glance over at your old body, still unconscious on the bed. Both your ghost and Becky\u2019s ghost are in Becky\u2019s body at the moment. Although it looks like yours is the most dominant. You figure that your body must just be empty right now. So it won\u2019t be going anywhere. You turn your attention back to the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Mels is gonna be out of the way today,\u201d you say, struggling to hold back a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll see you in a few hours then. I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis catches you off guard but you have to stay in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d you finish before hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the call is done you collapse back onto your own bed. A real mix of feelings wash over you as your process the call. Becky\u2019s boyfriend is coming over to see Becky. Right now, you\u2019re Becky. It was you who made the plans with Becky\u2019s boyfriend, not Becky. Oh, Will Becky remember this? Does she know what\u2019s going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity gets the better of you. You take your ghost out of her body and float above the bed. Looking down you see both your body and Becky lying there, except Becky\u2019s body is conscious and yours isn\u2019t. She rubs her face and then looks around confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did I get on the bed?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to your body and sees it lying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMels? MELS?\u201d she starts shaking your body as her precious panic starts to come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou act quickly and jump back into Becky\u2019s body, now finding yourself sat on your bed with a hand rested on your old body\u2019s shoulder. You take it away and turn back to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d you begin, getting more used to Becky\u2019s voice, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thinking about Caleb driving up again.

You\u2019re welcome to join us for lunch if you want,\u201d she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the excitement in her face and hear it in her tone. Caleb and she grew up in the same town and had been together since before university. When they finished school, Caleb got himself a job in their hometown whilst Becky got herself a place at university here, three hours away. It\u2019s not the worst distance in the world. They could\u2019ve been on the other side of the country, or even the world. The three hour distance makes regular quick visits inconvenient and difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know,\u201d you say in reply to Becky\u2019s offer, \u201cI\u2019m just about to go and see Jacob so I\u2019ll let you know where I\u2019m at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d she says as she disappears away from your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her footsteps draw away towards her bedroom and then jump up, grab your things, and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes 10 minutes to reach Tony\u2019s. He greets you with a smile as he lets you in. You go straight to his living room and throw yourself down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asks, \u201cyou said you had to show me something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits down on one of the chairs in the room as you compose yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so you know that... thing that stuck to my arm last night?\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean in the labs? Hard to forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it... did something to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs your arm okay?\u201d he asks, his showing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh yeah, yeah. There\u2019s nothing wrong with my arm,\u201d you say, presenting it to him, \u201cnot a scratch, burn, scar or mark or any kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully examines your arm. For a moment you could swear you knew what he was looking for before you remind yourself that he\u2019s a computer science student. Surely neither medicine nor biology come up for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so what\u2019s going on? What do you think it did?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. An internal struggle rises up. Part of you wants to say the words and get it over with, part of you is convinced it\u2019s a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, it gave me this kind of power...\u201d you say, not really sure how that sentence was going to end when you started it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPower?\u201d he asks, sitting back and looking less impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how else to describe it. I can leave my body,\u201d you pause and think about how ridiculous this must sound, \u201cand go into other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo into other people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like, I can become them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looks perplexed and confused. You\u2019re not convinced that he believes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, maybe I just need to show you,\u201d you say, trying to regain some kind of footing and look less ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to show me how you take over other people\u2019s bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you believe me if I showed you I could do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, obviously I would. It would have to be undeniable, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus for a moment and pull your ghost out of your body. You hear the light thud as your body falls back on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMels? What\u2019re you doing?\u201d you hear Tony\u2019s voice. His attention isn\u2019t on ghost you though. He has no idea that you\u2019re floating above him. He\u2019s watching your body as it lays unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is getting weird, Mels,\u201d he says to your body, still unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float right up to Tony and stop beside him, taking a moment to enjoy how your getting the hang of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for this, pal,\u201d you say to Tony, even though her can\u2019t hear you, as you reach into his body and pull his ghost out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony\u2019s body\u2019s head falls back unconscious and you look up and see his ghost floating above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What is this?\u201d he asks as he looks through his hands and realises that he\u2019s floating above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you,\u201d you say up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spots you, also as a ghost, \u201cthis is real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReal as can be, man,\u201d you say as you look back down at your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the part about being other people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your attention to focus solely on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you float into my body and find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d he looks around, \u201cI don\u2019t really know how to manoeuvre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float up to him and grab him by the ghost leg, \u201cmy bad, let me give you a hand with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and throw his ghost into your body. He connects and disappears into it. Immediately you see your body start to move. It sits up and starts breathing heavily. Blonde hair falls in front of its eyes and it tries to pat it away but only to catch sight of its hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, no way,\u201d Tony in your body says over and over again as he grabs his new hair, pats his new face, and runs his hands over his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMels? Where are you?\u201d he calls out with your own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over to Tony\u2019s body and start to float towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis time yesterday I was stuck in class and wanting something exciting to do. Who knew that I\u2019d be a man 24 hours later,\u201d you say to yourself as you push your way into his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll feeling and sensations return to you at once. Suddenly you can breathe normally and feel the things that are touching you once more. It\u2019s different this time though. You feel heavier, bulkier, especially around your stomach. You look down and find Tony\u2019s beer-belly. You pat it and give it a bit a of jiggle. Then you see your new arms and hands. Bigger and hairier than your own. You can help but think about how weird and out there this. It only gets moreso when you notice the tent forming in your pants. Your eyes are fixed on it. You\u2019ve got a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMels? Is that you?\u201d you hear your own voice ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see your old body watching you in shock. You know it\u2019s Tony in there. You try to shoot him one of your winning smiles but you\u2019re not sure how it comes across in his form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me. I haven\u2019t been a guy yet. It\u2019s different,\u201d you say slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMels, this is insane,\u201d he stands up and loses balance for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d you say back as you prod your new package through your trousers with one of your new fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to use this. We need to do something with this,\u201d Tony says as he manages to walk over to you and places his hands on your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is nuts. You look up and you see your own face above you. You look straight ahead and you see your own chest, your own cleavage. The sight of it only makes the tent in your pants grow as much as you will for it to stop. You look back up at Tony in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smile down at you and says, \u201c...\u201d</span></div></div>",

A thousand thoughts a second race through your head. This is all really real. You thought it was just a dream but you were a ghost this morning right in front of Becky. And she couldn\u2019t see or hear you. She must\u2019ve thought you fainted. Imagine what you could do with this. First though, breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump off the bed and head downstairs. As you pass through the living room on your way to the kitchen you see Jasper sat by the sofa. He\u2019s happily tapping away, excited to see you. What a good dog.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look thoughtfully at Jasper as you continue to stroke him. It\u2019s almost weird, looking down at your dog and knowing that you\u2019re about to BE your dog. Scratch that. It\u2019s not almost weird. It\u2019s completely flat out weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to promise to look after my body, okay boy,\u201d you say to Jasper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop stroking him and sit yourself down on the sofa like you had last night. He walks up to you, wagging his tail excitedly. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d think he knew. He doesn\u2019t know though. No one knows. Not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus and pull your ghost out of your body, this time on purpose. You feel yourself starting to float as you look down and see your body unconscious on the sofa with Jasper at its feet trying to get your attention. He doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re up here though. Anticipation holds you in place and you almost forget what you had set out to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float down towards Jasper, reach in, and pull his ghost out of him. His body immediately goes limp and falls onto its side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope Becky doesn\u2019t come back now,\u201d you say to yourself, remembering the earlier incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper\u2019s ghost looks down and sees both his own body and yours lying still beneath the pair of you. He turns in the air and sees you and starts tapping and barking. You can\u2019t tell if he excited or terrified but previous experience tells you that it\u2019s the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay boy. It\u2019s okay,\u201d you say. Your intent is to calm him. It doesn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push Jasper slowly towards your body as he continues . Closer, closer, until finally you push him into your body. His ghosts disappears into you and you watch as your body immediately comes to life. It jumps up from the sofa in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What was that?\u201d your body says, it\u2019s head turning back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can talk,\u201d you note to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper turns again before looking down. He sees his new chest, his arms and his legs (all previously yours), loses balance and collapses where stands. You feel your ghostly face contort as though you felt his physical pain. Jasper sits on the floor with his new hands on his new chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asks aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands rush up to his throat and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that voice,\u201d he says again, making your voice sound confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can do anything more he looks down and sees his own body. You\u2019re still floating above so his body lies unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is that... is that me?\u201d Jasper in your body asks as he edges closer to his old body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you can\u2019t just leave Jasper to this new situation on his own any longer. You float down towards his body and push your way in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you find yourself laid on your side. You can feel the carpeted ground beneath you and your tail starting to wag. You look up and see Jasper in your old body towering above you, wide eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he stutters with your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s really strange watching your own body act independently of you. You try to push yourself to your feet, struggling at first without hands but quickly getting the hang of it. Jasper pushes him backwards until his back hits the sofa. You try to speak to him, to try and reassure him but it comes across as a bunch of barks and yaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s okay?\u201d Jasper asks, replying to what you were trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, can he understand you? You yap the question at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You understand me?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yap a yes to him and then leap, excited about this. It isn\u2019t long before you explain everything that\u2019s going on to Jasper. You\u2019re surprised at how well he takes it. Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t want to pass up the chance to be human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes himself up to standing, clearly still uneasy being on two human legs, and walks to mirror on the other side of the living room. You follow him over and stand side by side. You can\u2019t help but think how weird this is. Anyone looking in at this wouldn\u2019t think it was odd. Just a dog and it\u2019s owner standing next to each other. Those people would have no idea that the two are in each other\u2019s bodies though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is,\u201d Jasper says slowly, raising his new hands up to his new face, \u201cso cool! I mean, I\u2019m human. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yap excitedly up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that you would do this. That you would want to be me,\u201d Jasper says, beaming down me of your smiles at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yap again at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d he says as he kneels down in front of you, \u201cthis is going to be fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper puts his hand on your head and starts stroking. You go weak and fall over with enjoyment. He works his hands down to your belly and starts scratching and rubbing. You cheerfully yap again and again as your tongue hangs loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s a good boy?\u201d he starts to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why dogs love it so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasper stops sooner than you would have liked and slumps onto the sofa, looking again at his new hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. This is so cool!\u201d he says again as you climb back to your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to do something. I want to know what being human is like,\u201d he says aloud. You\u2019re not sure if he\u2019s talking to you or himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d he throws your arms up...</span></div></div>",

I know how to fix it, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky gives you a confused and not very well coordinated look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you did this?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething weird happened last night,\u201d you say, not feeling totally sure on whether to share this or not, \u201cI got home afterwards and this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been like this since last night?\u201d Becky sounds as though she\u2019s starting to freak out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no. Whatever happened last night made me able to leave my body as, well, I guess as a ghost. I got back into my body. I don\u2019t have full control over it yet though and I accidentally knocked you out of your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Becky follows slowly, \u201cso I can just get back into my body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. You could even get into my body if you wanted,\u201d you tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky\u2019s eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thing we could do?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I found out last night... when I accidentally ended up in Jasper\u2019s body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky floats silently for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that...\u201d she starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you try to scratch the back of your head, forgetting that it\u2019s not solid right now, \u201csorry I woke you up in the night with all my barking. I was suddenly our dog. Can you blame me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looks between you and your bodies below for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I could go into your body?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you could,\u201d you say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I would be you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky pulls a face as if she\u2019s concentrating really hard and then begins to slowly float downwards. She ignores her body on the floor and aims for your body laid out on the bed. You watch as she gets closer and closer and then disappears into your body. Almost instantly your body shoots and and takes a deep breath through its nose. Your hands rush up and start patting your body from the head downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be real,\u201d your body says before covering its mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float down towards Becky\u2019s body and jump in. All of the sensations of life immediately come rushing back to you. You feel like you can smell and feel like a normal person again. You push yourself up into a seated position and look over your new body. Becky\u2019s tanned and manicured hands, her longer hair. Both Becky\u2019s chest and general frame are little larger than yours. They might take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky has climbed off of the bed and is watching her new reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she almost shouts, turning to face you as you cup your new chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d you say back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something with this,\u201d Becky announces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean something other than what we\u2019re doing right now?\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but like. I don\u2019t know. We could go shopping for each other or... or we could out and meet some guys tonight like this,\u201d she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a boyfriend?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she stops looking in the mirror and puts her full attention on you, \u201cI\u2019m in your body so I\u2019m technically you. Therefore I don\u2019t have a boyfriend and it won\u2019t be cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me? I\u2019m in your body so I technically do have a boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mels,\u201d she starts, \u201cyou\u2019re not really me and you\u2019re not actually dating Caleb. You have my blessing to do whatever if we go out tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky turns back towards the mirror and watches her new face as she contemplates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she finally says, \u201clet\u2019s...\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s so strange seeing Becky\u2019s mannerisms and hearing her tone come from your face and your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, yeah, let\u2019s do it,\u201d you say, \u201cbut if your boyfriend calls me I\u2019m not dealing with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll all be fine,\u201d she says back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky inspects the mirror closely, precisely dabbing parts of her new face and pulling faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Becks?\u201d you ask her as you push yourself up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get my head around being you,\u201d she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stands up straight and puts her hand out towards the mirror as though she expected it to shake her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Melanie Turner, but my friends call me Mels,\u201d she says to the mirror, trying to make herself sound cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright well, if you need me I\u2019ll be in my new room,\u201d you say as you head out and go across to Becky\u2019s bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, you figure it is kind of your bedroom now. Only technically. You throw yourself down on Becky\u2019s bed and stretch across it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Becky,\u201d you say aloud to yourself, still feeling a bit weirded out by the sound of your housemate\u2019s voice leaving your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Becky,\u201d you say again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb\u2019s my boyfriend. I\u2019m Becky. I live with Melanie. Man this is weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and walk over to the mirror by her desk. You haven\u2019t actually looked at yourself since you and Becky swapped. You haven\u2019t actually been another human other than yourself and Becky. Your dog Jasper is the only other one you\u2019ve swapped with. First thing you did with him was look in the mirror. Becky has a pretty face but not a bitchy one. You\u2019ve thought it ever since you first met. Although you never thought you\u2019d one day be wearing her face. Strands of her long brown hair keep falling in front of your face and blocking the view. You\u2019re actually really enjoying seeing her look back at you in the mirror. Not that you don\u2019t like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cast your mind to tonight. There\u2019s so much more to figure out. Where are you gonna go? When\u2019re you gonna go? Are you swapping back at any point before tonight? Are you going to get your old body ready and then swap or just get your new body ready? You can work it all with Becky. For now though, you need to get used to seeing someone else\u2019s face in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day flies by. You hardly notice and morning turns into noon and then evening. You\u2019d spent the day getting used to being in each other\u2019s bodies, going for a few walks trying on outfits for tonight and trying to make Becky look even better than she already did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say in Becky\u2019s bedroom, technically yours at the moment, putting the finishing touches to your makeup. The bedroom door flew open and you turned to see Becky dance into room in your body. She was already ready and had made your body look HOT. You couldn\u2019t string a sentence together as you made a mental note to take makeup tips for Becky in future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Becky started as she handed you a cup without telling you what the drink inside was, \u201cthe taxi\u2019s taking us to Basemnt in like 5 minutes so we\u2019ve gotta drink up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t help but smile as you take your first sip from the cup. It was just beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMate, you made my body look so hot!\u201d you tell Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins from ear to ear and gives you a twirl of your own body. The dress, the face, the hair. You can help but think that your body looks perfect. What guy won\u2019t be hitting on your friend in your body tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of you get the rest of the drinks down you just in time for the taxi to arrive. You jump in and, in no time at all, you\u2019re outside Basemnt. The queue outside is long. Too long you think. Maybe you should try somewhere else. Becky doesn\u2019t share your concern. She strides over to the bouncer, followed by you, and doesn\u2019t even need to turn on the charm before the guy lets both of you in ahead of the queue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get inside and can hardly hear yourself think. Despite that, you can\u2019t help but be excited for tonight. The music\u2019s booming, the vibe is buzzing, the people are packed in, the night is young, and you\u2019re in the body of your hot friend, even if she made your body look even hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of you push your way to one of the bars and buy your first round of drinks. The night has officially started. You drink. You dance. You laugh. You take pictures. At one point you lose Becky for a few minutes but don\u2019t think anything of it. It doesn\u2019t take long to find her, but when you do you see that she\u2019s chatting with a guy. He\u2019s a cute guy as well. You smile for your friend and leave her to her fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the bar you\u2019re ordering again. It might be your 5th of the night, it might be your 8th. You can\u2019t remember how many. Becky\u2019s tolerance is so much better than yours though. As you\u2019re getting ready to pay this guy appears next to you. He shoots you a smile that almost makes you melt inside before turning to the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake it two of whatever she\u2019s ordered. It\u2019s on me,\u201d he shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs is focus is on the bartender you look him up and down. His dress sense is excellent. His hair is impeccable. Arms? Just right. And he\u2019s buying this round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back over to the crowd but can\u2019t see any sign of Becky or her mystery man anymore. The sound of two bottles clinking next to you at the bar draws your attention back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do I call you?\u201d the man shouts in your ear to be heard over the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about to tell him that you\u2019re name is Melanie when you look down and remember that things have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Becky,\u201d you tell him, feeling giddy about having finally said it to another person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSebastian,\u201d he replies as you take a swig of your drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for the drink, Sebastian,\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night goes on as most nights out do, for the most part. Throughout Basemnt people drank and danced, a couple of people had fights over girls who weren\u2019t even interested and mistaken identities. One guy threw up just outside and a second guy was drunk enough to slide along the sick while sat on a baking tray that he\u2019s brought out with him. But you spent that evening with Sebastian. You\u2019d talked and drank together and, as closing loomed nearer, the pair of you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood outside and Sebastian hailed a taxi. You turned to him as it pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a good time tonight,\u201d you say both sweetly and genuinely, \u201cdo you, maybe, wanna come back to mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at the taxi and then back at you, \u201cnot tonight, but I\u2019d love to see you again. You\u2019ve got my number. Call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a wave of disappointment wash across you, but at the same time, a small feeling of accomplishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, your driver\u2019s waiting...\u201d Sebastian starts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn\u2019t get to finish his sentence when you pull him in unexpectedly and lock lips. The first few seconds he was shocked, but then he kissed back. For a moment you felt such a deep desire to experience all of the passion that you could be having with him tonight but then you break the kiss. He looks pleased, you feel warm inside, and you climb into the taxi and are whisked home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll is silent back at your house except for the yapping of Jasper as you return later than he\u2019s used to. You\u2019re not sure if Becky\u2019s back yet. You look down at Jasper and give him a quick pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood boy. Who\u2019s a good boy? Isn\u2019t it funny how I was you this time yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave Jasper be, head up to Becky\u2019s room, and collapse onto her bed. It\u2019s been a mental day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re woken not long later. Or, a while later. You\u2019re not sure how much longer later. You hear the front door crash open and then be hurriedly locked. Lots of muffled noises and surprisingly loud whispers. But you\u2019d recognise your own voice anywhere. Becky\u2019s just gotten back, and she\u2019s brought someone with her. Part of you wants to go and check it out, but you\u2019re also tired and want to go to bed. You think about it for a moment and...</span></div></div>",

The main character\u2019s \u2018ghost is the same size and shape as the main character so would really struggle to jump into a really small body, like an ant or fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) when jumping into other bodies the main character can pull the other person/ animal\u2019s \u2018ghost\u2019 out first and place it in another body. Alternatively the main character can just jump straight in without pulling the other person\u2019s ghost out. They\u2019ll have no memory of what happens whilst the main character is in control<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) anyone who is in \u2018ghost form\u2019 has the same abilities as the main character, but only the main character can leave a body whenever they choose</td>",
