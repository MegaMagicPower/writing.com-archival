Center near his house. The chubby 9-year old chipmunk was practically bouncing with joy and had a large beaming smile on his face. He'd just had his first baking lesson and was overjoyed at being able to learn how to cook wonderful, delicious new sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I might even be able to make that special cake for Dave's birthday,\" he thought. For you see, Theodore had planned to make Dave his triple-ultra-super-whammy chocolate fudge cake for his birthday which was in two weeks, the recipe was very hard however and he hoped that these baking classes would give him the skill necessary to make the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the thing about triple-ultra-super-whammy chocolate fudge cake was that it looked exactly the same ruined or not, so one would be able to tell the difference unless they ate it. If it was wrong, then it wouldn't taste the same. It'd be all right, but one could tell that it was missing something. And, there was also the fact that unless perfectly made, the cake itself would contain a LOT of empty calories. In fact, since Theodore always made a huge cake with at least 8 slices and since each slice had at least 500 calories, it was a real diet killer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Theodore decided to ignore this fact and had instead decided to think about who would help him eat the cakes every time he made a mistake, which he was sure he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't ask Eleanor, she and her sisters are grounding until Dave's birthday because of Brittany. And Simon won't be much help, since he doesn't enjoy chocolate that much. I guess that leaves...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya doing Theodore!\" asked Alvin, Theodore's older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alvin...\" he whispered. 'Of course, Alvin's perfect. He's not one to turn down a free chocolate cake,' he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Alvin asked. \"Um...I just wanted to know if you could do me a favor Alvin. Could help me test my cakes for Dave's birthday? I'd need someone to help me eat them and tell if it's good or not. I mean, you don't hafta, it's okay if you don't wanna because I know that you have other things to do and I wouldn't want to bother you and then you also have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Slow down Theodore, of course I'll help you! After all, it's chocolate! And what kid would turn down chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really! Thanks Alvin! Here, let me start the oven up, we can start right now!\" exclaimed Theodore as he started gathering the necessary ingredients required. \"I hope we get it right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later though, after having each 4 slices, which is 2,000 calories each, the cake was deamed a failure. They both left the table however, a little heavier than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alvin, are you okay if we made two cakes a day, and maybe a third one on the weekends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yawn* \"Sure Theodore, whatever you say. I'm sleepy from all that cake.\" said an exhausted Alvin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yawn* \"Me too. Good night Alvin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Theodore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Currently, it's Monday. Also, it takes 3,500 calories to make 1 pound. As of right now, I'm making Alvin about 90lbs. and Theodore about 100lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He made his way into the kitchen, where Theodore was making breakfast. \"Theo? What are you doing? Where's Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he, Simon, and the girls left early this morning. They will be back in a few days, there was a problem with grandma or something like that. Anyway, I told him that I needed to stay and that I needef your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Awesome! No rules for the next few days? I call the videogames!\", Alvin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but eat your breakfast first. I also baked another cake, so you can have some with your breakfast.\", Theo said,  with an eye roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin hooted. Cake with breakfast? It was too good to pass up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped up on the counter and helped himself, taking four waffles and drenching them in syrup. This was followed by a few strips of bacon and sausage links, and to top it off, a massive slice of cake. Theo's eyes widened. \"Alvin, are you sure you can handle all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin looked at his plate.</span></div></div>",

To his surprise, Alvin's plate was empty! Alvin sat, licking the sticky syrup and crumbs of his paw, other hand resting on his stuffed, sticky, fur-covered belly. Theo gazed in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin patted his enlarged gut, belching again. \"How was that, Theo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheo masked his amazement, quickly pretending to be disinterested. \"If I was Simon, I would say that was impressive. But you forget that I'm not the thinnest chipmunk ever and you just ate a normal meal for me.\", he quickly lied. He didn't know why, but he wanted to see Alvin get fat in the next few days. Maybe so he wouldn't feel so alone,  or do he could make fun of Alvin like Alvin did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin protested. \"Woah, woah, woah! Who said I was done?

He looked down at his own stomach. He knew exactly how difficult it was to get rid of that weight once you got it. He gathered up the remaining 4 waffles, 7 strips of bacon, and 5 sausage links and placed them on a plate, which he took to Alvin. Alvin licked his lips and said, \"Thanks Theo! I would have gotten it myself, but I need to conserve my energy for this upcoming battle.\" He motioned to the screen as Theodore retrieved the cake and syrup. Drowning the waffles in syrup, Alvin proceeded to eat the breakfast with gusto. He was already slowing down when Theo returned with the slightly more than half full jug of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheo sat on the couch next to Alvin and tried to focus on the videogame, but he found Alvin's growing belly to be a bit distracting. For some reason, he found it extremely attractive....</span></div></div>",

A globe of sticky, fur-covered stomach covered the television from his view. He rested one hand on his belly, releasing another belch. His stomach hurt, but it felt comfortably full and warm. He liked the feeling, though he would never tell anyone. He ran his hand up the curve, starting at the bottom. He felt massive after eating so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheo watched him enjoy himself. He grinned. This was going to be easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Later, a little after noon***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alvin? Ready for lunch?\", Theo asked expectantly.

Normally, \"big\" was not a word used to describe chipmunks. He liked being big. He stared at his stretched, gorged belly for a moment. Then he shifted so he could see past it to the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Theodore was making sandwiches in the kitchen, when the phone rang. Curious, he hopped over to it and picked it up. \"Hello?\", he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Theodore. It's me,  Dave.\" He seemed to hesitate for a moment. \"Listen, grandma is pretty sick, so I have to take care of her. Simon and Jeanette are in charge, but no one else, other than me and you, knows how to cook. So, I was thinking... maybe I could pick you up and bring you down here to help Simon? It would only be until grandma gets better-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave! I'd be happy to help. Do you want Alvin to come too?\", Theo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave sighed. \"No,  I don't think he'll help very much. It would be better if he just stayed there. I'll be there in about half an hour. Thanks, Theodore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Dave!\" Theo said,  happily. He quickly finished the sandwiches, and rushed out to tell Alvin.</span></div></div>",

He had just finished off the last of Theo's sandwiches. He felt even larger than before. His gut was so swollen, he could barely move. Amazingly, he forced himself into the sitting position,  though he had to lean back. He rose to his feet panting, and headed for the bathroom. That gallon of milk from earlier needed to be released<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***after***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin stood in front of the mirror, shirtless. After all,  he couldn't even pull it over his belly anyway, and he was by himself. He studied the curves of his swollen body. It stuck out almost two inches from his body,  and even rounded out the sides of his belly. He loved it; the size, roundness, smoothness,  firmness... everything! He stroked it, feeling every inch of his furry food-baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he left the bathroom, still rubbing his rounded gut. What to do?</span></div></div>",

He didn't know how to cook anything. He could only eat stuff that didn't need to be cooked! Disappointed, he stopped to think. Suddenly, an idea popped into his head. Perhaps Dave had left that emergency money in the cupboard! He grinned. That would easily feed him for a few days. Alvin started to hoist himself up to the counter,  which took a lot longer than usual due to the large amount of food sitting in his round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Alvin finally reached the cupboard, panting.

Eight pounds in a week!\" exclaimed a bewildered Alvin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Alvin was on the bathroom scale panicking about his sudden weight gain. His appearance hadn't changed much, but it was still noticeable. His face had gone from a more angular face to a more cherubic look due to his plump cheeks and slight second chin. His once slim stomach had become a small pot belly that was only barely contained by his pajamas. His chest had started to poof out and his rear stuck out about and inch more. His arms and legs had lost all definition they might have had and were covered in a layer of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I should have known this would've happened! I mean, all 8 slices of cake a day! And there's Theodore, he's looked like he's gained some weight also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the truth. Theodore was quickly crossing the line from chubby to down right fat. His face had two chins and a diminishing neck, his gut had grown considerably and had two flabby chipmunk boy boobs resting on top of them. Also, he had gotten a slight waddle recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do. I can't upset Theodore and I really don't want to stop eating his cakes.

No one ever did notice the two growing chipmunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother week went by and Dave\u2019s birthday had arrived and Theodore was still having trouble with the cake recipe . Thanks to the numerous amounts of cake a day, he had gained a considerable amount of weight. He no longer looked like the cute little butterball he once was. Even calling him fat was a under statement. Theo\u2019s neck was completely hidden under his three and half chins. His green hoodie no longer covered his belly and was starting to look more like a half shirt.  His stomach now touches the ground at all times. This made the chore of walking, more like waddling, very difficult. His thighs had also grown to accommodate his new ample form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlvin was starting to look more and more like Theodore use to look a week ago. Being a slightly taller than Theodore, Alvin didn't have that cute butterball look that Theodore always had. His arms became rounder and continued losing their definition they had previously. His thighs had grown right along with his butt giving him a more pare shape looking body. Alvin also had a nice little belly to accommodate his wider appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this cake it right. I don\u2019t think I can stand eating anymore,\u201d said Theodore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. If I eat anymore cake, I won\u2019t be able to get up!\u201d replied Alvin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chipmunk took a bite of Theodore\u2019s latest cake and crossed their fingers.

All that was left was a chipmunk and his cake. As slice after slice when into his mouth his desire for more increase. By the time he finished the cake, the world was starting to come back into focus. Alvin snapped out of his food filled bliss wanting more. Luckily for him the next cake was done. Walking into the kitchen Alvin could see the cake sitting on the counter. Theodore was nowhere around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHe must have went to get Dave,\u201d Alvin said to himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think Theodore would mind if I have a little taste to make sure this one was correct too.\u201d Alvin took his chubby hand and grabbed a little piece from the back so no one would notice. Like before, this cake was a masterpiece of flavor.

His chipmunk arms were never made for heavy lifting and it was tougher  for him to reach the container with his slightly bigger bottom weighing him down. Once he finally had the jug, Alvin unscrewed the cap, placed his mouth where the cap once was and stared to chug.  His little throat gulped and gulped as the crisp liquid was rushed down his throat. About half way through the gallon, Alvin decided that the milk was too cool and too refreshing to let it all go to waste. Alvin also knew his stomach would not be satisfied until he emptied the container. And empty it he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alvin had finished, he placed the empty jug back on the counter.

His slow ponderous footsteps scraped lightly against the tile as his fat body wobbled to and fro, his long red shirt no longer reaching his feet, but instead hovering several inches above them.  The chipmunk spotted the couch and made a slow bee line towards it, eyes drooping as the sugar and butter began making him drowsy.  Though clambering up the couch was going to be difficult as his pudgy arms were pudgy and weak, unlike Theodore who's been actually working making cakes, Alvin has been lazy doing nothing much but eat them.  He cursed and he flailed, his fat plump cheeks cradling his small puffy tail jiggling while his short legs thrashed against finding a foothold in the fabric.  The chipmunk even desperately began hopping up and down, his bloated body sloshing up and down and thick moobs slapping against his gut, clear that he's gained a considerable amount of weight and even more with the two massive cakes in his gut preventing him from getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait *pant pant* what am... *wheeze* I thinking\" he commented to himself, looking around to find the padded foot rest that rested near the fireplace.  He went over to slowly retrieve it with waning breath and sweat slowly starting to collect on his fur.  Though the first few attempts still failed, his large taught gut getting in the way of his climb, so instead he went over on his side, and soon he was on the foot rest with his gut sprawled out in front of him.  Small grabby paws pulled at the sofa's fabric to get him upright, and he backed his padded posterior onto the soft cushions.  The chipmunk wheezed heavily, grabbing onto what he could of his gut to calm himself down, though he could feel his paws sinking into his yielding fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... I 'might' need to go on a diet\" he huffed, \"right after this nap.\"  He turned his cap around and pulled it down to cover his eyes and slowly rested on his back.  His soft body oozing outwards from gravity onto the soft sofa cushions a bit as the warmth radiating from his overly plush body comforted him into a restful sleep.</span></div></div>",

And then it hit her. It was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hugged him she could feel a clear difference between hugging him and hugging Theodore. While Theodore had been much more warmer and cuddly Simon felt much more even in comparison. Even the feeling of being able to reach around his waist felt like a bit of a dissapointment. She loved Simon but she also liked feeling Theodore's body, \"If only there was a way to combine the two.\" she thought. And then she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wery simple but effective idea at the same time. If she wanted Simon to get the same body as Theodore then she would have to make him get on. She remembers how on dates Simon always seemed to have no controll on his apetite when he was close to Jeanette. \"Maybe I could use that.\" She thought. But at the same time it didn't felt right for her to trick him into becoming a fatty without his knowing. \"Maybe I should first tell him about my desire's before doing anything?\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat and thought about it for a moment before coming to the conclusion...</span></div></div>",

Once he finally had the thing, he unscrewed the cap, placed his mouth to the opening and turned the container straight upside down, using his hands to balance it and keep milk from spilling all over the floor (though a little did anyway).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis little throat gulped and gulped and gulped as the crisp liquid was dragged down by gravity. It was so refreshing to wash down all of those delicious cookies with some nice cold milk that Theodore knew he wouldn't be satisfied until he emptied the container. And empty it he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, a look of perfect contentment washed over Theodore's face as the milk settled in his stomach. Then, Theodore felt an ache that immediately informed him he had made a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore looked down toward the floor to find that the tummy he typically saw in the way of his feet now totally obscured his vision. A bloated belly full of cookies and milk hung heavily off of his frame, and he doubled over as a pulsing pain shot through his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" Theodore groaned, holding his stomach. \"Well, I guess that WAS a lot to eat in one sitting. Even for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore slowly and painfully waddled over to the couch to try and relax while waiting for his stomach to settle. With some effort, he managed to get up onto the cushions and lay his head back on the armrest. He rubbed his gut softly, trying to ease his protesting tummy and he found his eyelids growing heavy as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yawn escaped his lips as the ache began to decrease and his drowsiness began to increase. Too quickly for him to realize it, he had fallen fast asleep.</span></div></div>",

I'm surprised you saw enough of the movie to know what the monster was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it was a mistake to take you boys to a movie like that at night,\" Dave said, putting his key in the lock of the knob as they arrived at the front door. \"You're gonna have night...mares....\" Dave's voice trailed off as he walked into the house. He was at a loss for words for what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theodore?\" Simon said, almost as awestruck. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheodore didn't hear them, as he was still dozing on the couch, snoring softly. His belly, now considerably less bloated but still quite flabby after the digestion of his snack a few hours ago, heaved up and down with his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theodore? Theodore!\" Simon pressed, shaking Theodore from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh! Er...what?\" Theodore jolted awake in a rush, rubbing the sand from his eyes. \"Simon? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I would like to know,\" Simon said, placing his hand on Theodore's gelatinous gut and giving it a shake. \"Did you binge while we were out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, n-no,\" Theodore stuttered, looking down at his newly layered frame. \"I mean, I just made myself some cookies and\u2014and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are four cookie trays here!\" Alvin hollered from the kitchen. \"You made FOUR trays worth of cookies? There aren't even any leftovers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...I....\" Theodore's throat seemed to collapse around his words. The shouting and interrogation was sending him into a panic. This was not his favorite way to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've got an appetite, butterball, but did you have to eat ALL of the cookies?\" Alvin said, stomping into the living room. \"You're not hibernating for the winter, pal, you don't need that much blubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALVIN!\" Dave bellowed, finally finding his voice again. \"That's enough out of you. You don't speak to your little brother that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave, if he's gonna make a pig of himself every time we go somewhere without him, we're gonna have to chain him up in the garage or something,\" Alvin said, seeming to think he was stating a cold, hard truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Theodore said, nearly on the verge of tears. \"I didn't mean to...to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Theodore,\" Simon said, rubbing the chubby 'munk's back. \"No one's mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg to dif\u2014FREMFUFFM.\" Alvin's mouth was muffled by Dave's hand before he could lose his temper again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. We'll talk about this in the morning; everyone upstairs. It's past your bedtime anyway. And I don't wanna here a PEEP out of any of you for the rest of the night,\" Dave warned, emphasizing the point for Alvin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three brothers shuffled upstairs and to their bedroom in silence. They changed into their pajamas, with Theodore having particular difficulty buttoning his onesie. He managed to make it work, since his digestive system had displaced the cookies and milk from his stomach into fat around his body so it wasn't all concentrated in one spot, but his overall bulkier shape made it a tight fit. He looked like a chipmunk stuffed into a cloth disposable glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio got into bed without a sound. None of them felt like risking Dave's wrath tonight, especially not Alvin, who was already starting to feel badly about what he had said to Theodore. He made a mental note to apologize to him in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, after the boys had fallen asleep, a ruckus downstairs stirred Simon to consciousness. He pushed himself up onto his elbows and put his glasses on, looking around the room. He noticed Theodore was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting the worst and hoping to be wrong, Simon padded downstairs as quietly as he could to investigate the noises he heard.</span></div></div>",

Theodore, he saw, was lazily rummaging through the cabinets, grabbing food stuffs as he went\u2014instantly edible things, like loaves of bread, wedges of cheese, bags of chips and packaged sweets. Pans, containers and cooking utensils were strewn about the floor, haphazardly cast aside in Theodore's hunt for eatable items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theodore!\" Simon shouted, stepping into the kitchen proper and putting his hands on his hips like a scolding father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Theodore turned around with his arms full of food, though it was not in response to Simon's presence at all. It was at this moment that Simon realized Theodore's eyes were closed and his mouth was moving in a peculiar way. There was nothing in it, and he wasn't speaking (aside from some unintelligible mumblings here and there). It seemed like he was still sleeping and eating an invisible something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon waved his hand in front of Theodore's face, testing for recognition. \"Theodore, are you...sleepwalking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware that Simon was even standing near him, Theodore strode toward the front door with his mountain of new found treats, caging them with his arms on his little shelf of a belly. He was leaving the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's immediate instinct was to try and stop him, but he had read that it was unwise to wake sleepwalkers due to the way they may react to waking up so suddenly in a strange location. Though he questioned the validity of such a concept, Simon didn't want to take any chances. He decided the safest thing to do would be to follow Theodore and try to keep him out of trouble until he woke up on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to run upstairs to wake anyone else, Simon laced up his shoes, slipped on his thin jacket and began trailing Theodore as the barefoot 'munk made his way down the cold, stone sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, brother,\" Simon said. \"The things I do for a brother.\"</span></div></div>",

No.  It was a new layer of fat he had absentmindedly added to his frame and made him feel ashamed of gaining.<br>\r\n   He started out for the exit when an aroma attacted him.  He followed it to the source and found a free sample table.  It was a kind of fish on a toothpick.

She was a beautiful, talented, growing girl- she deserved to treat herself a little if she decided she wanted to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany grunted a little as she slid out of bed, blinking in surprise, she looked down at her huge belly. The food she'd eaten was all human sized, so it had much more of an impact on her chipmunk sized figure. Her belly bulged out, packed with all the food and shaped into a big round orb, which hung off the front of her nearly enough to touch the floor. Being so round, it was about as wide as it was tall- and stuck out as far from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was taken aback by her size, she hadn't even noticed- being so wrapped up in eating. She thought for a moment about whether she should go to get more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore brushing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it isn't really that much.\" She said, giving her huge belly a gentle pat that made it wobble. \"I am a growing girl, after all- this is probably perfectly normal for a healthy appetite like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of my healthy appetite...\" She said, licking her lips as she headed downstairs to get more food. She had to grab her belly with both arms and hold it up in front of her to comfortably make it down the stairs, but it was no concern to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got back to the Kitchen, she passed by Jeanette again. When Jeanette saw Brittany, her eyes almost bugged out of her head in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh- Brittany!\" Jeanette exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Brittany asked with an eyebrow raised, before pointing to her belly. \"...oh, this? This is nothing, honestly I'm surprised you even noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette scoffed a little, \"Brittany- that is <b>not</b> nothing! You-\" but she quickly cut herself off when she saw Brittany shooting her a very nasty look. Jeanette sighed. \"Fine, whatever. It's nothing- you're as skinny as ever.\" She remarked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, it's just a little bloating.\" Brittany asserted. \"Once it digests you'll never even know I ate anything- I have a great metabolism.\" She said, before smirking. \"That's why I have the best figure out of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm...\" Jeanette mumbled, going back to reading her book.

It was so much she couldn't even carry it all up to her room at once, and had to make a few return trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big-bellied diva briefly considered eating only half of her snacks, maybe saving the rest for later- but all it took was one big rumble from her huge belly to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought this up here so I could enjoy it!\" Brittany said, \"I'm not gonna hold back- this is for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as she grabbed a can of soda which was almost as tall as she was. She sat down in the middle of her bed, her paws kicked out in front of her, legs spread apart a bit to make room for her huge belly. She wiggled her toes in anticipation, shimmying her hips side to side as she settled into a comfortable position, and popped the tab off the can of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I deserve this!\" She reminded herself, before hoisting the can to her lips with both arms, beginning to chug the fizzy sugary drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next several minutes, Brittany worked her way through the stockpile of snacks with incredible gusto, enthusiastically eating and eating, paying no mind to how her already oversized belly grew more and more with every swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore open bags of chips, popcorn, and pretzels, taking big bites of chips as big as her head into her mouth one after another, feasting on popcorn piece by piece, upending the bag to get all the stray crumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd go on right to a box of cookies, each one big enough for her to need to hold with two hands, savoring the chewiness or crunchiness of one type compared to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug into pastries like she was looking for buried treasure, from cheap snack cakes to bakery made cakes in plastic tins, she tore off chunks and shoveled them into her maw, lapping up the icing with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd bite off parts of candy bars, turning them around in her hands, getting through the rich chocolate coating to the cookies, caramel, peanut butter, nougat, and whatever else was hiding inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, she'd guzzle down a can of soda, or sometimes even a whole liter. Allowing the tide of fizzy sugary flavored sweet liquid to wash over her, as she shoved her whole face in the whole and gulped down as much as she could until it was all empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll throughout her binge, Brittany tossed aside the empty bottles and bags and boxes, not paying any mind if she got some loose crumbs or sugar or icing or something on her face, fingers, or even her chest. She was being a tiny bit of a slob, but her messy eating was just because she was enjoying it so much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finally finished gorging, Brittany let out a long, loud, brassy belch, which shook her almost as much as her tummy rumbling earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><i><u>BBBBRRRRRRWWWWWUUOOOOOORRRRRRPPPP</u></i></b>- <i>hic</i>- ahh....now <i>that</i> was a snack!\" Brittany said, licking a little sugar residue off of her lips. She gently rubbed her belly, looking up at it rise before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd eaten so much that her belly had swollen to a ludicrous size. As she sat with her footpaws out in front of her, it rose up high, far and wide in front of her. It was so full it had a bit of a pink tint to it at the end, along with a few stretch marks. Brittany hiccupped, giving it a satisfied pat as her eyelids began to droop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...my perfectly healthy appetite's nice and satisfied for now...<i><b>urp</b></i>...\" She yawned as she began to fall into a food coma, her belly gurgling as it worked to digest all that unhealthy junk food packed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...need to take a li'l nap...once I wake up, this bloating is gonna be gone...<i><b>urp</b></i>...and I'll be nice and skinny...just like normal...\" She said, as she drifted off to sleep, her body already beginning to plump up as the food was turned into pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A simple Sketch to show how much bigger Brittany is after eating ALL the junk food in the house by herself! <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aWhlE47.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/aWhlE47.jpg</a> )</span></div></div>",

She now resembled a great big fat orb, just a bit bigger than a beachball, but considering how small she was originally she was almost totally swallowed up by fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany's head was nearly engulfed by a thick cascading set of chins, which rested on her rotund chest. A few folds and rolls broke up the ball of fat, giving it a hint of form- her little footpaws poking out of a few tires of fat that were once her legs, dangling uselessly in the air- as the round overstuffed soft and squishy chipmunk had already eaten herself into immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here's a rough little doodle of Brittany's current size and proportions <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/kTG3Vu2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/kTG3Vu2.jpg</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette was stunned, quickly hopping up onto her sister's bed, approaching Brittany's head and shaking her, causing her multitude of chins to wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brittany? Brittany! Wake up!!\" Jeanette yelled, until- after a moment of stirring- the bloated ball of fat that was Brittany slowly blinked awake. Jeanette sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"bluhg...wh-...Jeanette? Why are you...what's going on?\" Brittany said, trying to get up for a moment- finding she was totally pinned in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?? Um- you ATE ALL the junk food in the house and now you're HUGE! That's what's going on!! I told you that wasn't nothing earlier, and now look how fat you are!\" Jeanette exclaimed.

Just like I said, once I digested that little snack, the bloating went away, and I went right back to my perfect figure. Didn't I tell you I had a good metabolism?\" Said Brittany, wiggling her little paw, as if she was trying to gesture or show off, but only succeeding in making the fat encasing her body wobble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Oh yeah? Then what do you call this, huh?\" She demanded, grabbing one of Brittany's numerous chins, the fat squishing between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fur.\" Brittany said, completely stonefaced. \"I'm fluffy, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- but....Well fine! If you're in such good shape then get up and walk!\" Jeanette demanded again, getting frustrated with her sister's stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to.\" Brittany said, turning up her nose. \"I <i>am</i> a beautiful, talented, wealthy superstar after all. If I don't feel like walking, I shouldn't have to walk.\" Brittany asserted, wiggling her toes a little- unable to find purchase, she added \"I could if I wanted to, of course- but I could do any old chore.

It was a chore, to be sure, but they figured it'd all be worth it to get her closer to the food- so they wouldn't have to keep making return trips up and down the stairs. Even if it did mean trying to hold up a huge blob of smothering fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they did get her down to the bottom of the stairs, where it was much easier to move her around. Elenor and Jeanette standing side by side, pushing Brittany from behind- the rotund blob of a chipmunk sort of sliding along, sometimes getting caught a bit and doing an awkward sort of flop-roll over, her sisters careful to keep her head up, so it wouldn't be pinned underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brittany, do you want us to put you on a chair in the kitchen, in front of the table, or on the couch in the living room?\" Elenor asked, taking a break from moving her to step over in front of her face so she could ask where to put her next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany thought for a moment about where she'd like to be...the chair was in the kitchen, which obviously meant quicker food, but the couch was nice and soft, and in front of the TV.

Hopping up themselves, they adjusted her position slightly- So that she was sitting upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany was so big she took up the whole center cushion of the couch, her face, forepaws, and pudgy little hindpaws poking out from her round body, suspended uselessly in lard. \"She looks like a throw pillow...\" Eleanor commented, before Jeanette shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engorged Brittany gave a self satisfied sigh, as she allowed herself to settle comfortably into her doughy, tender, flabby frame. Even as her field of vision was framed by her own enormous cheeks, and she was looking over the horizon of her own chins at the TV (which Eleanor had turned on, trying to find a good channel for her swollen sister), Brittany's vanity still brought her willful ignorance of her own enormity. In her mind, she was still slim- In possession of the perfect figure, and a flawless metabolism. She was only making her sisters carry her because she didn't feel like walking, being too important and talented for such a task. Sure- her sisters were her co-stars, but she was the leader!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor settled on the food network, which was showing an array of cooking competitions. \"Oooh- good choice.\" Brittany commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor giggled sweetly, looking up at her massively fat sister. \"Thanks! I thought you'd like it, considering your...erhm...interest in food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany chuckled, licking her lips. \"Well- it's definitely making me hungry!\" Despite the gigantic quantity of food she'd recently consumed, she wanted more. The one thing on Brittany's mind was hedonism- She wanted to eat, lots! She wanted to taste a wide array of every flavor she could, savoring the sweetness of it all. She wanted to feel full, warm, comfy and cozy, all while never having to move a muscle.

However...the one Chipette who stood out the most &amp; the most talented singer, was Eleanor (the plump chipette). Her solo alone, was a highlight according to her fellow sisters, Brittany (the cool chipette) &amp; Jeanette (the smart chipette).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, they got a letter with an advertisement poster of the contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: \u201dGirls. Look what i found inside our mailbox!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: \u201dCool, let me see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a poster with some extra letters of how the contest will be. It was from the people who worked so hard for making the contest. Jeanette started to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: (reading) \u201dDear, Chipettes. We are gladly informing that one of you can be entering the annual singing contest for talented singers. (To her sisters) Girls. One of us might be in the contest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany &amp; Eleanor: (cheering) \u201dWho-hoo! Score one for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the conditions, Jeanette had to be aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: However.......(Brittany &amp; Eleanor stopped cheering).....there are conditions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette kept reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: (reads) \u201d1. The members have to be only solo-performers....which means: No fellow members to join in. 2. In order to have a powerful singing voice, you need to have a big deep voice to sound convincing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: (surprised) Big voice?? Where are we going to get a big voice. We don\u2019t have anything like that....we\u2019re rodents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: \u201dTrue. But which one of us will be competing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chipettes started to think...... and kept doing so.....until Eleanor stepped in to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: \u201dI\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Brittany &amp; Jeanette were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth: \u201dYou\u2019ll do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: \u201dYeah, why not? I mean....i\u2019m a very talented singer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: \u201dCool. But there is one tiny problem. (stating the truth, sadly) You don\u2019t have a big voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: (in her normal high-pitched voice) Well.....then I\u2019ll try getting a big voice. Do you the any solutions, Jeanette....dear sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTook time for Jeanette to come up an idea....but then she got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: \u201dWell.....i have read that a person\u2019s vocal chords gets deeper, the more bigger he or she is. Which means you have to be big yourself to have a big voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: (surprised) \u201dYou mean.......fatter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette: (nods yes) Exactly,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor: \u201dBut........ how will i get very big so fast before the contest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany then thought up a brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: \u201dOh, i think i have a solution to make you bigger, Eleanor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany then used a phone to call for chocolate-service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany: \u201dHello. I would like to order a large order of chocolate, right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened then?</span></div></div>",

Simon and Jeanette being the least voluminous of the six got up to go get the plates poles and trays containing cake ice cream and all manner of chocolate and sweets for the group's desert. Simon was wearing his normal blue shirt and jeans both stretched tight against his fat his shirt riding up slightly to expose his belly. Jeanette was wearing a violet button up shirt each and every button straining against the press of her fatty belly and chest. The button of her pants didn't have it any easier her stomach barking out over the waistline of her jeans. Both brainy Chipmunks put on weight mostly in their bellies. Although obviously there over 400 pound frames had plenty of fat all over their bulging guts were clearly the most predominant parts of their weight gain.<br>\r\nAlvin and Britney was salivating at the site of the piles of high-calorie goodness being put down on the table in front of them. The two hot tempered Chipmunks were more bulky and thick all over then there belly heavy siblings. Alvin's trademark redshirt was stretched tight against his torso and the black shorts he was wearing when doing much better. Britney was sitting a little more comfortably pink sweater large and stretching enough to accompany her heavyset frame. Her matching leggings went doing as well however stretched to the limit and even past it has small tears started showing.<br>\r\nFinally there was Theodor and Eleanor the biggest of the Chipmunks both rather bottom heavy with thick tree trunk thighs and big bench filling butts. The doors green T-shirt look like a crop top thanks to its small size compared to the gargantuan expanse of his gut while his black shorts looked painted on. Eleanor's green dress was doing a better job covering her least while she was sitting down though she knew after a meal like that it was going to take them careful adjustments and even more careful movements to get home without her skirt lighting up and flashing somebody. And even more tailoring after she got home to make the dress wellbore after she metabolized everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue clad chipmunks had finished setting out everything for dessert and sitting down again so they all began digging in.</span></div></div>",
