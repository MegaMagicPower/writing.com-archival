You brush it off as you look at his PlayStation 3 while its turning on, Its not the best setup (Just your standard setup) but whatever, you don't care.  You also see his little row of games, eventually noticing that they are in ABC order for some reason.  Kiba notices you staring at the line of games on the shelf. \"Yea, I'm just a bit OCD about that, I'm not to sure why ether.\" You both let out a little chuckle. \"So, Donald, I don't have too many two player games, but I guess you can watch me play for a little bit.\"  Said Kiba. \"Yea sure, I don't mind too much just as long as I get to play.\"   \"Well good, See anything you like on that shelf.\"  You stare at the shelf for a little while. \"How bout....\"</span></span></div></div>",

You look away, and see the other park lights start to light up along the pathway. You narrow your eyes, and see a man taking his dog for a walk.<br>\r\nAs he passes, the dog, a Great Dane, licks your hand, and wags his tail as he goes by. <br>\r\n\"Oh, come on...\" you say to yourself, wiping your hand on your jeans.<br>\r\nYou lean back on the bench, staring up a the stars again. You close your eyes, and imagine going to school next week. So much had happened this summer, where had the time gone? Your 5th girlfriend (who dumped you), the friend who moved away to go to college, moving from one house to another, all of it.<br>\r\nThe world just couldn't leave you alone, could it?<br>\r\nNo, it couldn't.<br>\r\nA noise next to you makes you open your eyes. You turn to see a man sitting next to you, munching a sandwich. He just sat there, chewing for a while, before finally saying, \"It's a good night out.\"<br>\r\nYou grunt.<br>\r\nThe man takes another bite of his sandwich, and chews slowly, making you fight the urge to slap the thing out of his hand.<br>\r\nHe looks at you, and you tense up. You'd heard of addicts and molesters haunting the park at night, but didn't think they were real.<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\nBut yet, this man's eyes are clear blue, staring icily back at you.<br>\r\nYou shiver.<br>\r\n\"There's nothing to be worried about,\" the man said. \"i just wanted to ask you something, Mark, about your future education.\"<br>\r\nYou freeze. \"How do you know my name?\" you finally choke out.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know a lot about you.\" the man said, speaking slowly. \"I know quite a lot, actually.

Next thing you'll tell me is that fricken dwarves exist, and that fairies live in every corner of my house.\"<br>\r\nAt this, the man smiles, and stands up. You take another step back, as the man was easily over 7 feet tall, with a full black beard and a heavy looking jacket. Reaching out a massive hand, he plunks it down onto your shoulder, pinning you under it's weight.<br>\r\n\"You're closer than you think,\" he says.<br>\r\nWith that, his other hand began waving in the air, making it shimmer vaguely.<br>\r\n\"Now...\" he says as he sets his second hand on your head. \"Sleep.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name was Exolo, son of the great paladin Exoltia and the late warrior Ragil. I had never done much with my life, never really excelled in sword, sorcery, faith or science, and for most of my life I'd only ever had to deal with the company of other humans. I might bump into the occasional anthro or fae back home in Wistava, but as a human owned city where everything was built to accommodate humans everyone who came there was at least the same shape. Then Mom lost her job and had to move out near the frontier, out where the towns were mixed and both travel and trade come from as many people as they could get. Of all shapes, sizes and sorts. It was here I had to face the most dangerous, the most eerily perilous task in my life. The first day of college in a new city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that's what my mother kept telling me as she fitted the last few plates onto my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom! Why do I have to go in full armor? I'm sure the teacher's won't let anyone get hurt there so it's not like I'll need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned as she adjusted the purple tinted metal. Brushing my short brown aside so it would not catch she put the helmet in place. \"Do you remember the bullies who used to give you so much trouble when you growing up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked at that one. \"The only trouble was having to expl- ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it will be much worse\" Exoltia's harsh tone cut off any attempt at reminiscing my younger days. \"Those fights were fair and even, everyone had roughly the same level of power. But this city is filled to the brim with monsters! Of every sort one could think of! Imagine if your old pests had the body of a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it mom, ALL sorts. Human might not be the majority but if this school has elves, mice and fairies and they get along safely with everything else I should be just fine. Armor or no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves and fairies that can cast! That can fly! You can't even manage a healing spell for when you do get hurt. Even if they are safe enough and no one does have any ill temper towards you, fat chance that is, just think of what a minor accident could do your weak little body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at that one. Strait up into the hulking, fearsome gaze of a woman who scares off werewolves and vampires for a living. Being a freelance bodyguard in a heavily mythical area took guts no matter what race you were. The fact she was in full body armor herself almost every moment of every day, even when she sleeps, sort of exemplified just what type of woman this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not weak.\" I glowered, fully aware of just who I was comparing myself to. \"But If I do get in over my head won't the armor just get in the way? I can't run as fun or really dodge that well while I'm wearing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had half a moment to let the look on my mom's face sink in before her heavy gauntlet clanged hard against the metal of my helmet. With my ears ringing and my skull acheing madly I bowed at the shoulders and placed hands at the side of my head. Didn't matter what sort of protection you have, if mom hits you it HURTS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone daft in your old age boy? What is this, early onset Alzheimer's at eighteen? That's enchanted armor! Or did you forget about the quickrelease already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked as the pain died down, going over the list of enchantments in my head. Immunity to acid and rust, almost airtight in how it protected the main body. It was resistant to both fire and cold but it didn't make the wearer flat out immune. A strong enough blast of either is still going to hurt. It was lighter than normal and not the restrictive in the slightest, but still heavy and uncomfortable when worn over my usual robes. Something mom always insisted on. And then there was that quick release, something mom invented special for her whenever she found a situation where speed and stealth was more useful than protection. Heavy armor is noisy. Just mutter the right words into that mark near the neck and each piece of the armor would fall off in an instant. Thankfully it only works for the wearer, so an enemy can't strip away the protection with a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember it, right ... right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze boy, now go get your sword and backpack so we can leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDowntrodden, I clanked through the hallway to grab that loathsome scrap of metal mom made me forge. Her's was a massive greatsword, thick and heavy, with numerous offensive enchantments. Mine was slapped together in ten minutes. Didn't even bother with a test swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it mom, but do I really need to carry this thing around all day? It won't even fit in the bag you know.\" I whined. Instantly wishing I hadn't said anything as she predictably offered no sympathy. She carried her giant blade everywhere, same as the armor, and mine was just a shortsword. She could duel wield with blades the size of mine, I never liked using swords at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the answer to that on Exo. Come on, you don't want to be la-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShhhh ... shunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were both stricken with silence as the metal portion slid out of the handle, piercing into the floor with a metallic ringing sound. My sword fell apart within the first ten seconds of wielding it. Panic stricken, I looked across to my mother's furious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamnit!\" she shouted, her hands flaring with a brilliant light as her patron god took that statement as a request. Her fists closed around the door handle, and with a slight twitch she shattered the wood from it's hinges, sending splinters flying into the yard. \"No time to get you a new one and that pathetic scrap heap is useless. Out! Out with you! Hurry to school or it's another eight hours of training you for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously I dropped the blade, rushed past the yard and onto the sidewalk, then started the slow walk to my nearby college. Mom stopped long enough to lay a simple trap down where the door was, then continued in the same direction as me towards her current place of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved slow and noisily, I was tired, sweaty, and miserable under my pile of metal. It was already tiresome to lift my feet off the ground and I hated that sound as my bulky shoes slammed into the cement sidewalk. I wasn't exactly tall or muscular, but not small or weak either. Unless one chose to compare me to that monster of a woman from which I was spawned. Looking behind, I saw her rushing up behind me at the same speed as a jogger, utterly undeterred by the bouncy sheets of metal weighing her down. Her hands folded together and her eyes closed as she recited a short prayer, and an instant later magic swirled around her chest, legs, and feet. She took two steps out onto the street, then bolted at an insane speed. I could not feel any wind through my armor but I could see leaves fluttering about in her wake. A car came zhooming up from behind, and I saw her wave the occupant inside as she easily kept up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments both were too far away to see, and I still had a short ways to go. Man, why couldn't she at least be a normal paladin! Most get to summon a horse and ride around on that, but Exoltia never needed one. patron saint of The Traveler, along with the usual powers of healing and smiting, she got a limited number of times she could teleport each day. Or open interconnecting portals. Or freakin run at superspeed while wearing half a ton of metal! Jesus, I could see WHY it's useful to charge into a fight. A heavy fighters much more of a threat when he charges you with the speed of a car. But it's still weird that I'm the only one in my family who's ever had the slightest interest in driving or owning a car. I'm the only one who'd ever need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was less annoying, and more depressing, to think about the members of my family who were no longer alive ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I didn't. I looked at the sparkling green lawns, the dark furred, elderly brownie watering her flowers, the oddly proportioned goblin children playing around in their driveway. It was the usual sights, other than an old witch in the bright red house no one around here was particularly exotic or dangerous. And I'm pretty sure that witch was a fine person, and only seemed weird because I hadn't gotten a chance to meet her yet. Heh, a helmeted suit of armor clanking down a street in the morning light? I was probably the strangest and most dangerous person around. I know for a fact mom was the most intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the sweat from my brow, I took off my helmet and placed it in the leather sack I used for a backpack. Not exactly modern but it was the type mom knew how to make, and I was sort of used to how it distributed weight. My short hair flowing in the wind, I closed my eyes and enjoyed the cool air on my beads of sweat as I neared a large building. Cocking an eyebrow at the size, I read \"Newbrook University college\" and stepped into the car lot. There were dorms on one side, classes on another, and all were unusually large. The doors and windows seemed massive, but given the proportions it could only have been one story high. I saw merged flashes of the other students milling about, getting out of cars and moving on to their own classes, but my attention was instead focused on how to get into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at it, I noticed much smaller ones off to the side, doors roughly sized for a rodent or gnome, but there wasn't one in between dragon sized and mouse sized. Grunting, I shoved into the door and found it easy enough to move, if a bit noisy, then squeezed my way into the main hall. Rows upon rows of lockers, intermittent with the doors to different classrooms were all there was to say about the background. It was instead the students who were the most clamorous in greeting me.</span></div></div>",

The family in general had on it a curse. The curse came from a long dead grandfather who during his life sat as a judge during the Salem witchcraft trials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the story was told from father to son within the family, a witch on trial tried to use her gender to sway the judgement, and when she taunted, coaxing, flaunted before him of what old granddad, he took it as an insult. Somewhere during the lengthy trial, the witch woman approached granddad and tried to kiss him. He slapped her face, and had the woman flogged in public for her being so daring. The witch  woman cursed then granddad, as caused him to ignore his wife and see then the lovely attributes of jennet donkeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs told, the history of granddad turned a fated corner, and he ceased to be, but was suspected that he became a donkey himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, as though the decades, each new generation, the menfolk when coming of age, usually at eighteen, but some at twenty-one, they began to show physical aberrations, deviating from being all human, to  becoming in part or all as an animal; mattering upon their personal preferences toward various animal breeds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthropic deviations in the species of all males in the family, as many like granddad went the way of being equines, donkey, ponies, horses, and one odd relation went full-on into becoming a stallion Zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planning to attend a college brought on the need to earn money, and when a girlfriend did the arrangements, her grand idea for getting a good paying job was as a farmhand at her Uncle's goat milking business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother was not happy at the choosing to work at milking goats, as their species and mine might well merge. Mom was right, as during that first summer my body became infected from association with doe goats. The milking was done by hands on, and the lunch time breaks came with served up goat milk to drink. As such, I became as one socially diseased, as cursed male, my body began to grow black goat fur, as similar to the black color of my human hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur sprigs grew around my ears, as flared big my eyebrows. Clipping off of the fur caused it to spread, as gaining fur covering all my neck, and soon then my chest and back. The growth of black fur was unrelenting, spreading to by the end of the first summer working at the goat farm, I had a full body pelt of black goat fur from head to my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Darren who owned the goat farm had seen me showering before leaving the farm to go home. He asked as how the fur happened and I told him of our family history. To say the dear man questioned the tale as told, was to me not a laughing matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body fur was but the beginning to fall and winter months of ridicule at high school, by foes and friends knowing I had grown a pelt of goat fur. Class girls thought to date me and wanted to comb their long petite fingers through the curly locks of goat fur what covered my body, arms, legs and everywhere. Their sensual taunting worked to arouse me, and from my male feeling as stout, the curse moved to cause me changing of my maleness to be that like a buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy working around the doe goats and milking them began to affect my preference of liking doe goats as friendly companionship more so than dating girls. Oh but please understand me that I never thought to act like some buck goat in rut, no, no way, as that is evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy third summer spent milking goats caused me to sprout two horns growing from the peak of my forehead. The drinking of goat milk at break times and lunch worked to enhance my horns to grow some eight inches long. It happened that summer my ears conformed to being similar of what a goat has for floppy ears.  My mother cried when she first noticed I had sprouted horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy two younger brothers, Jay and Wilson both thought my changed self as really neat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad had left the family some years earlier, as when I turned ten, he by then resembled being more a Jack donkey, that mom later sold dad to an amusement park for him to pull a trolley. My dad never saw how his son had changed or caused the curse to include then of bovine animals as possible futures of the family males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen came the end of summer and my time to return to school, what had become me was more an Anthropic male goat than I was looking human enough to attending high school. I tried then home-schooling and tending to my studies I gained the next spring my graduated high school degree. I wondered what to do next when again my still friendly girl-friend suggest the entry into the Mythical College.</font><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Mom saw the notice from Bovine Hall, she began to cry. Her crying was not from the thought of losing my friendly self living at home, but from the social relief from bias neighbors and family relatives what thought less of me because I became as a male buck goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuck Goat, yea I did change the family curse, broadening it to envelope another species and breeds that might defile the family further. As from just after being born, buck goat tend to fight for the want to dominate, first each the other bucks, as then stand mounted, dominating the herd of doe goats with breeding rights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeding rights, that was what everybody had on their evil minds. Relatives worried I might molest their sweet daughters, maybe injuring them with my..., well not my horns! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not help the matter when after Auntie Maria, an old maid spinster of our family on father's side, she wrote a letter, sending it to the family as a whole. Auntie dear suggested my Anthropomorphic self was the result of devils, and my becoming to be a black furred almost goat, meant I was in league with evil. I read her letter and quickly, as without much thought, wrote out an e-mail to the family, denouncing I was evil, and reassuring their daughters Hymen was safe and intact! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Being evil is stupid and acting stupid is from evil,</i></b>\" as I learned the hard way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happens, the young male goats do about the same as will their elders, when it comes to preparing for the Rut season. Most male goats seem to appreciate urinating upon their forelegs, and dipping their heads to whiz on beards and the back of their heads. The result is a wild stench to where the farmer tending the goats needs to wear as use breathing apparatus, lest they get infected with bacterial diseases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a real doe or a rarer anthro-doe should enter her mating season, the wagging of her tail rapidly, termed as flagging, spreads her scent into the breeze. Noted, and since by yours-truly, the odor of doe goat urine as it contains chemicals what radiates to her buck that she is ready to breed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy part begins after the Flehmen and sniffing, as a Buck will do his urination thing, and with some other less moral style manners, they will mate. Flehmen reaction happens, as with the curling of the upper lip after giving the doe goat a royal sniff, works to help capture her mating scent, and works to arouse the Buck to..., mate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA special sensitivity in the lips their lips to determine, as how far along the doe is with feeling her estrus. This is what I might need to deal with if my portion of the curse does me an injustice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe a freshman at college, even a college specified for those handicapped with curses or rare diseases, as with attending there, I expect the usual hazing, harassment, as even the female will coax me to mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthropic's like true animals tend to brawl, some fight, as it can go on for hours until the pecking order is specified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollege, even a school for higher learning a new student needs to deal with sinister brutality, deception, bedevilment, and egotistic professors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy curriculum blocks out as: English Literature, New Math, Anthro-science, and some form of athletics.</font></span></div></div>",

I'm just a gassy dragon\" you laughed.<br>\r\nYou swung your powerful tail round and gashed the other dragon round the head, knocking him against the wall and onto the floor.

Eventually the foul stench of dragon farts overpowered the human child, and he fainted in the corridor. You celebrated with another farty blast on his head and then went back to your room.<br>\r\nAs you entered, Kiba exclaimed \"Phooey! What is that smell!\"<br>\r\n\"Errrrrm, Some human farted in the hall\" you said nervously.<br>\r\n\"Tell the truth\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I farted on that kid and two dragons and almost killed them!\"<br>\r\nKiba and Phoenix stood there, their mouths wide open</span></div></div>",

Nothing hurt you?\u201d They began to ask you just when that girl entered to the classroom and your looks crossed with anger. \u201cYoshihane-kun is so mean! Doing that to our Yuu-sama\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get mad, my sweethearts\u201d you told them, \u201cI\u2019m not that weak to get injured by such a little punch.\u201d You smiled and charmed them.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you even faint.\u201d One of the girls exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was just because I was exhausted by the game and I want to skip some classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so mean, Yuu-sama, we were so concerned and you just want to skip classes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but just to be rested for all you, sweethearts!\u201d You replied seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just before your fan club continued, the bell gave start to the fifth period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left school time came to be quite relaxing by the simple look at you fans concerned by what passed at the end of the third period. But that came to end with the bell announcing the end of the sixth period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay sat seeing the white ceiling, while everyone got out of the classroom. You took your time waking to the entrance of the building. You got to your shoes case and inside there you found a pink envelope closed with a red heart sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was no surprised, but satisfied by your natural charming. You opened it and read the letter and went to the designed place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your time walking to the back part of the gym. It would be inevitable; you had always been a heartbreaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got there just to see a little but cut girl of long purple hair down the shadow of far tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a few steps, when she realized that you had gotten to the appointment and ran to your encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like you Yuu-chan!\u201d She said hiding her face against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was you!\u201d You answered realizing what was all that about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuu-chan,\u201d she turned her face to you and looked into your eyes with her deep green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember what I told you last time?\u201d You said getting mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you want to spank me?\u201d She said with a childish tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get near to me you freak!\u201d You shouted kicking outside the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so mean, Yuu-chan\u201d said the one who got up while its long purple wig fell down discovering Yuki\u2019s green hair. \u201cAnd I was just trying to cheer you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you think that something so awkward would cheer me up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s no guy who doesn\u2019t get cheer when a cute girl confessed to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you are no a cute girl!\u201d you smashed Yuki again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuu-chan!\u201d Yuki replied with a crying voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd cut out that Yuu-chan now,\u201d you sentenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so mean,\u201d Yuki said indignant, \u201cbaka, Yuu-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat ever!\u201d You answered while getting out of that place.</span></div></div>",

No matter how you looked at it, you were now completely tied to some rare people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked down to the male dormitories through the rod that would drive you through the school woods to the back part of the building. Trees, shadows and silence that was all what you want at that moment and that rod was the best place to get them. That was because the passage itself was kind of misleading, so most of the student body don\u2019t bother themselves taking it if it was no necessary. And for your luck, you didn\u2019t get into anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked slow, trying to forget all the crap that took place that day and trying to think on what might come next. You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d You realized that you got out of the correct path just after noticing the building in which you had entered, the Library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hello.\u201d A cute girl with glasses told you just entering. \u201cMight I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, where am I?\u201d You asked still getting out of your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the Third Library building.\u201d She told you while getting near to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe third one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d She answered reaching you at the entrance. \u201cMight you have gotten lost?\u201d She asked you with a fresh smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it was fate?\u201d You answered and she just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be a freshman, don\u2019t you?\u201d She walked toward her desk and began to look for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d she replied, \u201cyour first question just entering was \u2018where am I?\u2019 wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it was.\u201d You laughed. \u201cSo what are you looking for\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d She exclaimed with out stop mixing the stuff of her desk. \u201cMy name is Kiyomi Hanasakura, from third year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you looking for, Kiyomi-chan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d She exclaimed raising a key on the air to show you. \u201cAnd you are still my kouhai!\u201d She faced you, \u201cSo call me senpai!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Kiyomi-senpai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHanasakura-senpai for you!\u201d She scolded you pointing you with her finger barely a millimeter away from your nose. She giggled. \u201cNow follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t do anything but sighed and followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk through the library took longer than what you thought it was going to take, but five stairs later you got in front of an old and dusty door. And after giving you a big smile, Kiyomi opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was on the other side was beautiful. A little, nice and lonely cafeteria warmed by the afternoon orange sun that entered through the glass walls and perfumed by a few vases with flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis used to be the student council office when this was the main library building,\u201d Kiyomi sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d You asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least that\u2019s what the teacher in charge of the Library Club like to tell us, since now just the Third Division of Library Club used it.\u201d She giggled with a little shadow in her purple eyes. \u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied feeling a little curious about the place and about your hostess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ryusuke is rather thin, standing 5' 9\" tall.  He is rather partial to solid-colored V-necks and tees, plain hoodies, jeans and black canvas sneakers.  He wears several watches on his right wrist (each for a different timezone) and sports headphones most of the time.  The only indication that he is out of the ordinary comes from his shadow, which is that of a fox because he is a kitsune, a fox that can shapeshift into human form.  He is ambidextrous and temperamental, with rare but sudden mood swings that attest to his wild nature.<br>\r\n<b>other</b>: Ryusuke has been sent to the college to get him out of the way; he is studying to be a music major.  He is from another country and should be expected to have different views of college life.  He is not a party animal, though he does not spend all of his time studying either.  He likes to sleep and play music; he can play the synthesizer, bass, guitar, and flute.  He has no interest in romance, though he will play along just to oblige those friends he makes.  He is a misogynist, but can endure working with the opposite gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis roommate's name is John Kumiega.  He has brown hair and light blue eyes; he stands 6' 1\" tall and wears button-down flannel plaid shirts and long dark pants that he tucks into his boots.  He is a wolf anthro, though the only signs of it come from his wolf ears and tail.  He is faster, stronger, and more enduring than normal humans, with better sight, hearing, and smell.  He insists on calling Ryusuke strange names such as \"Yukey\" and \"Lis\".  He is a philosophy major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nYou give a sigh as you park your bike by your dorm.  You'd like to leave immediately and crawl back under your duvet at home, but you can't, and you walk up the steps gingerly after locking your ride, slinging your pack over your shoulder.  \"Hmm, August Hall, A-13,\" you mutter as you glance at the doors.  \"Ah... here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly unlock the door and go in, coughing with distaste at the smell- the scent of old leftovers, sweaty gym clothes, and\u2014what's that?\u2014<i>vomit?</i> washes over you as you gasp in the fetid air.  \"Oh Cod,\" you groan before managing to open the grimy window and fanning out as much of that disgusting air as possible.  As a faint breeze wafts in, you take deep breaths to rid yourself of that horrible impression, then turn back to survey the disaster behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's actually not as dirty as you thought it would be, only slightly messy and worn, a few stray articles littering the maple wood floor.  A sturdy black table, three (grey) wooden chairs, a desk lamp.  Two beanbag chairs (dark blue), two dressers (identical), a tall full-length mirror, with one corner cracked by some sort of blunt instrument.  Two extra doorways, one leading to, let's see, a small kitchen, the other a rather old-fashioned lavatory\u2014no, that's not the word, it's supposed to be <i>bathroom</i>\u2014 with relatively clean fixtures.  A closet filled with junk.  \"Hell,\" you say tiredly as you throw your bag into a corner and sinking into a beanbag.  \"Where have I been sent to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden slight movement from the bunk beds startles you; you turn to stare at a moving pile of blankets from the lower bunk, when a grubby face looks out and grumbles, \"Whoozzit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" you reply, at a loss for words.  \"Er, I guess I'm your new roommate... who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure gets up, rubbing its eyes, and you see that it's a guy, maybe a year older than you, with ruffled brown hair, bleary blue eyes, and an affectionate attitude as he lurches out of bed and grabs you, pulling you onto the floor as he growls, \"Hey, you're fresh meat, aren't ya?  Welcome to hell, buddy!  I'm sure you'll like it here wit' me, li'l friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou disentangle yourself with some embarrassment, standing up as you shift away.  \"I don't believe we've been formally introduced yet,\" you say cordially, ignoring the messy heap before you.  \"My name is Ryusuke Ueno, although you may call me Galway.  I'd rather not explain why I am called that, although I will tell you that it has something to do with music.  How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" your roommate grunts, getting up.  \"Hmph, name's John, John Parker Kumiega, though y' can call me Johnny-boy.  How's that, huh?\"  Swaying a bit, he stumbles to the bathroom and retches, coming out with a slight grin.  \"Huh, sorry for the mess, man, forgot I was suppos' ta be getting a new roomie today.  You 'kay with this?  You're lucky ya got ta be with me, my last roomie lasted only a month... anyway, the other dorms have shared facil'ties, so you've got the good stuff right here wit' me!  Lucky, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\"  You notice his wolf ears and tail, though you decline to comment.  You ignore \"Johnny-boy\" as you climb the ladder to see that the top bunk is indeed for you, and put your pack onto it.  Taking some of your things down, you put them into the indicated receptacles and find yourself done with making yourself \"at home\".  As your roommate prattles on, you finally start listening to hear him say, \"Yep, and that's why I never drink Pepto-Bismol in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalm in frustration.  Looking out of your second-story window, you gaze over the grounds, then suggest a tour, since it's your first day at the college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" John says jovially, cuffing you upside the head as you check your pockets for your keys.  \"By the way,\" he says, becoming serious, \"really sorry for the bad first impression.  You don't really have to call me Johnny-boy, John, Parker or even Kumiega'll do just fine.  I'll call you Yukey, 'kay?  Yeah, I'll try laying off the drink next time, but when you get thirsty... abnegation ain't the first thing you'd think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrightening up, he grabs you and gives you a quick noogie, then heads out the door singing \"Mazurek D\u0105browskiego\", trailing you along like the little freshman you are.</span></div></div>",

Despite being a mythical creature yourself, Homuncules are ignored by all three races, wither they be anthro, human, or mythical. They were ignored for their small size and pitiful physical prowess. In ages long since past they were once used to replace lab animals because they were very easy to make and their existence was thought expandable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thanks to the amazing intelligence and longevity they showed they were welcomed into society after a long fifty years of struggling to get rights. Even after obtaining rights Homuncules were forbidden to enter any educational facility because of the great risk factor of getting injured or killed. But all that changes with you.

I sighed mently and then looked ahead when i heard the teachers voice. it was cold and scary i would say but what dragon isn't scary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElGroan looked at them all as i stared at him,like i had a choice. if i could look away i would but only the strongest survive and keeping my eyes on the mabye strongest dragon yet would be a good test for me. Elgroan smirked as he noticed only few did the same as me which was the test for them. \"thouse who didnt look at me when i came in leave\" he said coldly. everone looked at eachouther puzzled as to why they needed to leave now. he glared at the class once he didnt see them leaveing \"NOW!\" he roared.everone jumped but me, i refused to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the ones who didnt stare at him like most left and they didnt come to this class again. and they needed it to pass,oh well they had next year to get over it. \"now on with the lesson\" Elgroan said and went to his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again am always on my feet, it was always a family thing. I soon arrived at my dorm room for the girls, seeing another one infront of me, I thought mabye this was the waiting line for my number of my room so I followed her. My heels makeing loud noises as I walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl heard the footsteps and turned around, I was pretty tall so she had to look up. \"wow! your tall and pretty!\" she excalimed, I laughed at this girl. Everyone would usaully make fun of her height or run away, \"uh... thank you I guess...?\" she said. Stareing down at the girl, the girl just giggled. \"nice to meet you! my names Rin!\" she said, very hyper not to my likeing at all. But I wasnt one to be rude to I answered, \"My name is Mojo69... nice to meet you\" I said, hearing a cought form the office girl in front of us. Rin turned around takeing her number for her dorm. \"thank you!, and it was nice meeting you\" she said, running off with her freinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head walking to the office girl \"hello, name please?\" she asked, even though she heard me say it. \"Mojo69\" I stated with a hard glare as she stiffled a laugh. \"oh am sorry!, here you go.\" she said handing her the number, \"whatever..\" I muttered before going to my room. Seeing rin there, I blinked. \"hello Rin...\" Rin looked at her, eyes sparkleing happily.. \"hi!!\" she waved as I walked in and started unpacking with her, before resting a bit.</span></div></div>",
