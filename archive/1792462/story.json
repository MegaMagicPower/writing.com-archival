You take a step forward to see what was going on, you reach your hand out cautiously, the bush starts to move less and as your about to touch it.<br>\r\n\"Marcus get up here\" you hear your dad shout to you <br>\r\nyou look back between your dad and the bush and decide it better not to anger your dad like that and run up to your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey dad are we there yet?\"whined your older sister.<br>\r\n<i>does it look like were there idiot</i> you thought to yourself<br>\r\n\"hehehe\" you heard an almost non-human laugh for it was so deep it was barley audible.  you spun around to see what was there, yet nothing appeared, now you are starting to wonder what the hell is going on.<br>\r\n\"did you guys hear that?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"hear what, dear?\" said your mum in her usual calm tone<br>\r\n\"someone or something laughed\" you replied you eyes still looking for any signs of movement<br>\r\n\"son, there is nothing there\" said your dad as he continued to march up the path<br>\r\n you look suspiciously in that direction one last time in the hope of seeing something but your hopes were dashed as you followed your dad up the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the entire journey could not focus on what you were doing as you kept getting the feeling that someone or something was watching you. Studying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had finally completed the mountain journey,  you pumped your fist in victory and then looked out the people had not lied, though to say the view was amazing would be an understatement as the way the light bounced of the water almost creating a path that lead of the horizon the cool breeze comforting you under the unforgiving sun, gave you a feeling of complete comfort like a baby in its mothers care, momentarily forgetting that feeling of being studied. When you went back down the mountain you were 100% sure you were being watched and when you spun around you saw.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it turned his attention to your dad who had been knocked into the bushes in beasts first attack, getting up still dazed, he ran and the beast only laughed as he easily caught him placing his jaws on his left leg, and after a bit of tugging and screaming, ripped it off and swallowed it whole.your dad helpless as a baby without a carer tried to crawl towards you  his arms and his body was shaking with agony and pain. He looks up at you as if apologising. only then did the monster put him out of his misery by putting his paw on his head pressed until his head collapsed under it like a grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast now having had it's fun looked at you and walked up. its eyes boring into you with venom. You break down and cry not sure if its  that you watched you family die right in front of your eyes or that you were scared this was the end. Your crying and pleading that this all just a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe black beast pounced at you claws bared and jaw open</span></div></div>",

There are two giant beasts right in front of you. You recognise the black monster the brutally murdered your family. But there was a white beast, of similar shape and size, doing battle with it. They were locked in a vicious embrace of claws and teeth. Emitting from it were ungodly growls and barks that paralysed your muscles and struck fear into your heart. You see the black beats bite into the white monsters paw and blood leaks out, unsure weather it's your family's or from the monsters in front of you. A the same time the white monster gouges at the back of the black beast leaving clear claw marks but you see nothing spill from the deep wound. The monsters claw at throats. Bite at backs. Swipe for underbelly. Gnaw at limbs. Such a confusion of violent acts for a reason you did not yet know. Whilst this duel of two savages was happening You hear the voice again \"RUN YOU FOOL\"<br>\r\nYou don't know what it is but you agree with the advice. You look where to go and are stuck with a dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up the hill where you came from, to that peaceful peak where you felt happiest and safe, but you knew it only lead to a dead end. And down, past the on going struggle of monsters, where you came up a had more places to run to but have no idea where to go once at the bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head down, turn and bolt......</span></div></div>",
