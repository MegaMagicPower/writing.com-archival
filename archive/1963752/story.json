Now Featuring Characters from The Spin-Off of Total Drama, \"The Ridonculous Race\"!<br>\r\nThe rules that you saw have changed... Slightly. Here is the NEW list of Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a Total Drama Interactive (Muscle Growth) that I hope will be filled up with a lot of chapters. There are some rules and conditions though:<br>\r\nConditions:<br>\r\nCondition 1A: The story (or stories) <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">must</span> take place outside of the actual show, like say, in the hometowns of the contestants or so.<br>\r\nCondition 1B: If you want your story to take place DURING one of the seasons of Total Drama, then you MUST let me know beforehand.<br>\r\nCondition 2A- The character that you choose to experience the muscle growth will be the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">only character to undergo it from that point onwards</span>.<br>\r\nCondition 2B - The above mentioned Rule has changed. When you Pick a Character, that character MUST undergo the Growth. However, you can now have up to two other characters join along for the ride!<br>\r\nRules: <br>\r\nRule 1: I will already leave behind some choices, those choices are the only ones that can be chosen.<br>\r\nRule 2: Needless to say all choices will be Male only.<br>\r\nRule 3A: There will be no suddenly making the character into a 50ft giant on the first part of the story or something like that.<br>\r\nRule 3B: Of course their growth can still be fast... just not INSTANT. And, as mentioned not as early.<br>\r\nRule 4: Nudity can be allowed, but nothing that involved cum or similar. But NOTE that I like reading about how characters outgrow their clothing.<br>\r\nRule 5: There will be no sexual intercourse. Making out will be allowed though.<br>\r\nRule 6: I will be watching every one in a while. <br>\r\nRule 7: and the most Important one: Remember to have fun writing the sequence out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Let's Pick a Character! Have Fun!</span></div></div>",

Obversely) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan pushed his peas around his plate, mixing them into his mashed potato. His mother gives him a worried look, unsure of what could be wrong. <br>\r\n\"Honey, don't play with your food. I know you won the money but we don't waste food in this house.\" His mother says to him in a firm but caring voice.<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry.\" He replies, pushing his plate away and getting up from his seat. \"If you want me, I'll be upstairs.\" Then he just walked out of the room, arms crossed and head down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Duncan had got back from Total Drama, his life felt so boring and meaningless. He wanted to feel the thill he used to, but he didn't have the courage to go back to his Delinquent ways. He just needs something to distract him from his current boring life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down at his newly purchased laptop, connected connected to their newly installed internet and began searching the web for ways to give his life more meaning. <br>\r\nAs he is searching though ideas he notices one of those annoying ads about people who had lots fat and gained muscle all in small amount of time. Duncan gets up and looks at himself in his full length mirror. Despite being the bad ass of Total Drama, he still managed to be one of the skinniest guys there, and the tight fitting long sleeved shirt didn't help emphasise his lack of muscle. He rolls up his sleeve and flexes his arm as hard as he can, but the only thing that appears is a small lump. <br>\r\n\"You would think from all the bad ass things I did I would be a lot stronger.\" <br>\r\nHe goes to sit back down at his laptop, rolling his sleeve back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Duncan do next?</span></div></div>",

The first result to come up was for a local gym Duncan had never heard of. \"Bad Boy Gym. We will help you reach your full badass potential. Only $10 a month. Thats perfect!\" He exclaims.<br>\r\nDuncan shuts of his laptop and throws on a blue tank top and shorts, highlighting his this frame. \"This better work.\" he says once more flexing his tiny bicep before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to Bad Boy Gym. I'm Sam.\" Duncan looked over at the front desk to find the face of what looks like a 15 year old but when Sam came out from behind the counter, Duncan was shocked to see that he had the body of a professional athlete. Sam was wearing a shirt that looked to be a mens medium. Big shirt for a kid, and yet his arms competed strongly against the restricting sleeves \"Nice to meet you.\" Sam said putting out a thickly muscled arm.<br>\r\n\"Duncan.\" He reaches out to shake his hand and winces at the sudden grip of the hand shake.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I wasn't even squeezing....\" Sam smiles proud of his overwhelming strength over Duncan.<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're strong!!! How old are you.\" Duncan asked cradling his hand<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I turn 15 in a month. I'm proud of my muscles.\" As he says bringing his arm up to show off his amazing bicep. The fabric of his shirt sleeve stretches further. <br>\r\n\"Wow. I want to be that big.\" Duncan exclaims reaching out to feel it. \"And hard!!! Wow. It won't even move, I can't squeeze it at all!\" <br>\r\nSam smiles as Duncan tries with all his might to make the bicep bend. \"Dude, I'm not even flexing that much.\" Sam flexes harder causing Duncan's fingers to separate around it.<br>\r\n\"Wow. How big is it?\" <br>\r\n\"Only 17 inches at the moment. But that's not important. I assume you are here to get a gym membership.\" Sam says lowering his bicep and walking back behind the counter.<br>\r\n\"Yup. I want to be big so people will be scared of me again.\"<br>\r\n\"Great well, first day is on the house. If you come back tomorrow we will sort out monthly payments then.\" Sam smiles nicely. \"Go right on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan enters the gym expecting to see a lot of buff guys working out. But it was completely empty and kind of small. It had a nice balance of machines to equipment. </span></div></div>",

He walks over to the dumbbell rack and looks at the weight on all of them. He considers going big to not look weak but realises it was pointless as he was the only one in there. He picks up the 5kg dumbbells and goes to sit on the bench. He starts slowly lifting the weight, feeling the weight already.<br>\r\nWow, I am really weak. Duncan thinks to himself. <br>\r\nDuncan didn't noticed Sam walk in and watch him curl. <br>\r\n\"Good technique but you cant expect to get strong unless you go big.\" Duncan almost drops the weight in shock. \"Mind if I work out with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Duncan smiles trying to hide his embarrassment <br>\r\n\"Cool, I brought you an energy smoothie too. I swear by these. Sometimes I think its this that  is making me so strong.\" Sam hands Duncan the smoothie and downs his in one big gulp.<br>\r\nDuncan looks at it before doing the same. He was expecting it to taste horrible like all other energy drink smoothies he had heard about but it tasted faintly of strawberry. It was delicious.<br>\r\nSam walked over to the rack and goes straight for the 40kg dumbbell. He goes to sit on the bench next to Duncan and starts lifting slowly. Duncan stared at his bicep as it competed with the sleeve for dominance.<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to grow by watching....\" <br>\r\nDuncan immediately goes back to lifting. He felt like he had an endless amount of energy after that smoothie. As he continued to lift the 5kg weight started to feel like nothing. So he decides to get up and get a heavier weight.</span></div></div>",

Duncan thinks, still curling the 10kgs easily. <br>\r\nSam sits and ever so slowly he lifts the dumbbell. His bicep strains so much it actually starts to rip the sleeve. It takes a full 10 seconds to get it to the top but he did it. <br>\r\nSam drops the weight on the ground with a loud bang. He gets up and flexes his massive biceps saying, \"Thanks for that challenge, I got a great pump out of that.\" Duncan continues to curl while watching Sam flex. \"Your biceps look pumped too.\" Duncan looked down and realised that they really were bigger. He hadn't even noticed but his biceps looked a whole inch bigger than when he started. \"Go on give them a flex.\" Duncan put the weights down and copied what Sam did. What used to be a bump was now a decent looking bicep accented by a tricep he hadn't even worked out. Sam reached out and coped a feel squeezing about the same amount as when he shook his hand. The bicep didn't move so Sam squeezed harder. \"Wow its so hard, wasn't expecting that. Hold on let me measure it for reference of your growth.\" Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out a measuring tape. He rapped the tape around Duncan's bicep. \"Now I want you to flex as hard as you can.\" </span></div></div>",

Not bad for a beginner,\" Sam said smiling at his new friend.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping it was going to be closer to you 17 inches.\"<br>\r\n\"Look not everyone can have as amazing arms as me after just an hour of lifting.\" Sam tired to cheer Duncan up. It wasn't working though. \"Look you continue to work out and I'll make us another smoothie. Okay?\"<br>\r\nDuncan sat down and began curling the 10kgs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam comes back in with two more smoothies and a shirt. \"I brought you a gift. I figure you want to get big and to do that you need to feel like a part of this gym so I've got you a shirt, you can have it. Free of charge.\" Sam smile holding it up smiled. It was the same shirt that Sam was wearing, only smaller. It had the logo of the gym over the left chest. It had short sleeves, not what Duncan was sed to. He either wore a long sleve shirt to cover up his muscleless body or a tank top, ususally just around the house though. \"I din't know what size you were so I got you a childs medium. Is that alright?\" <br>\r\n\"Yea, thats perfect.. But I'm going to look tiny compared to you...\" Duncan took off his tank top and put on his new shirt. His arms almost filled up the sleeve but not quite.<br>\r\n\"Clothing is a good way to look bigger than you really are. Tank tops are good when you have defined muscle to show. For you I recommend something like this purely cause it makes you look bigger. It shows off your arms quite nicely.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Sam.\" Duncan resisted the urge to run up and hug Sam in order to keep his 'Bad Boy' persona. <br>\r\n\"Right, drink your smoothie.\" Duncan and Sam both gulped it down quickly and easily. Duncan once again got the delicious taste of strawberry and was instantly filled with energy. \"I think you should stop curling and come do some chin-ups with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. But I can't promise I will be able to do very many.\" Duncan said worried about looking like a fool in front of Sam<br>\r\n'You'll do fine. Right there are two chin-up bars here so we can both do it at the same time.\" Sam lead him over to a wall where there were indead two bars attatched to the wall. <br>\r\n\"I want to see how many chin ups you can do without stopping.\" Sam challanged \"3, 2, 1, GO!!!\"</span></div></div>",

Duncan struggled to do many, but as he continued it got ever so slightly easier. But he was now tired and had to stop at 25. Once he finished he looked over at Sam who wasn't even breaking a sweat. After another minute or so of watching Sam go up and down at an alarming rate, he began to slow down. He had slowed down enough to see Sam bicep bulge every time he went up. His bicep ripping the sleeve a little bit more every time he went up.<br>\r\nFinally Sam stopped. \"I think I need a new shirt.\" He said looking down at the tatters of his sleeves. The rest of his shirt was till intact, it was just tight. <br>\r\n\"I want to be able to do that.\" Duncan said in a trance, still looking at his biceps.<br>\r\n\"One day i'm sure you will. Hey, do you mind if I work out shirtless? I can't be bothered going to find another one. I just get another one when I make some more smoothies.\" Sam smiled at Duncan waiting for a response.<br>\r\n\"Yea... Sure... Thats fine...\" Duncan shook his head to stop staring at Sam.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Sam lifted up his shirt and Duncan nearly fainted. There was the most defined rock hard abs ever on a kid his age. His pecs were sizeable for his age and size too. And when Duncan saw it all in front of him, Arms, Abs, Pecs. He was so overcome. \"Shall we continue?\" <br>\r\n\"Yea.\" Duncan peeled his eyes away log enough to catch his breath and go back to the bar where he started doing chin ups again. Off in the distance he heard a phone ring.<br>\r\n\"I've got to get that. You continue with what you are doing.\" Sam then left towards the reception.<br>\r\nDuncan found it a lot easier to concentrate with Sam not in the room. The chin ups we becoming easier and easier. He continued at a medium pace not actually counting how may he was doing, just wanting to do a lot. He felt his arms grow more snug in the sleeve of his new shirt. A smile creeped across his face as he picked up the pace a bit. He looked over at his bicep to see it competing with the sleeve for dominance. Duncan was about to do what Sam had done only 10 minutes ago.<br>\r\nDuncan heard a faint rip as the sleeve began to tear.</span></div></div>",

Sam watched as the tape ever so slowly moved under his hands. <br>\r\n\"Nevermind. Make that 14 inches.\" Sam said with even more suprise.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!!! This feels amazing, I can't wait to be as big as you.\" Duncan exclaimed with joy, while feeling how big and hard his bicep was.<br>\r\n\"You know what, I'll go make you another smoothi. You continue curling and I'll be back in a minute.\" Sam said grabbing Duncan empty smoothie bottle and leaving towards the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I may try doubling my weight again. Like Sam said, only way to get big is to lift big.\" Duncan back the 10kgs and picked up the the 20kgs. It felt light, not as light as when he swapped from the 5 to the 10 but lighter than he was expecting for 20kgs. Duncan sat down and began curling slowly with the best form he could. He marvelled at the roundness of his new arm, watching it as it bulged and flattened everytime he lifted the weight. Vains we even starting to develop on his arm.<br>\r\n\"Here's your smoothie.\" Sam said it to him. Duncan put the weight in his left hand down and took it from Sam, while he continued curling with his right not wanting to give up any nessecary lifting time lifting time.  He gulped it down and handed it back to Sam before lifting the other weight back up.<br>\r\n\"Could you make me another one in like an hour?\" Duncan asked, eyes still watched his bicep bulge.<br>\r\n\"Yea sure. Hey I am going to work out someting else now, you want to come work out with me again?<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid that these arm,\" Duncan says dropping the weights and flexing again. \"are going to get bigger than yours?\" <br>\r\n\"No,\" Sam looked sheepish, \"Well, yes.\" Duncan smirked. \"But its going to look weird if you have really big arms and small everythig else isn't it?\" <br>\r\nDuncan thought for a minute. \"I guess your right.\" Duncan heard Sam let out a sigh of what sounded like relief. \"This doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying to get bigger than you.\" <br>\r\n\"You can try.\" Sam said poking out his tongue.</span></div></div>",

That would be so cool!\" Duncan turned around to see Sam lifting up his tight shirt.<br>\r\n\"You mean like this?\" Duncan's eyes widened, for under that shirt was the tightest six pack he had ever seen on a kid his age.Everything was perfectly shaped and symmetrical, it looked so perfect. Duncan could see that Sam was flexing a little which meant it did not 'naturally' look like that. But from what was in from to him, It must look good even when he's not flexing. \"How about we do this while shirtless?\" Sam said lifting his shirt all the way off. \"That way I can watch as your abs develop.\" Sam smiled widely.<br>\r\n\"I don't have abs though, or not yet at least. I'm have a flat stomach.\" Duncan said going back you being slightly intimidated of Sam once again.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on it can't be that bad, and anyway you arms will make for what your stomach doesn't YET have.\" Sam said as he stepped forward and started lifting up Duncan's shirt.<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Duncan blushed but allowed Sam to take off his shirt. <br>\r\n\"It's really not that bad. I mean at least there is no added fat that you have to burn off.\" Sam said encouragingly while stepping back too like at him<br>\r\nDuncan by no means had a bad stomach. While he did not abs, he did had a very flat stomach with only the perfect amount of fat. He even had the beginnings of what could be a very nice V taper. <br>\r\n\"Okay lets begin. There are a couple of chin up bars here,\" Sam said indicating to the Horizontal bars about 2 metres off the ground. \"They are this high so you can't cheat by touching the ground. So what we are going to to is a few Ab exercises which involve lifting you legs that will create tension in you abs, and that should help strengthen them.\" Once Sam had finished talking he went to stand under a bar and jumped (quite high) and grabbed onto the bar. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\nDuncan jogged over to the bar to his left of Sam, he made a very poor attempt to jump up to the bar and only managed to hit it with the tip of his finger. \"Try again.\"<br>\r\nThis time Duncan crouched right down, and leapt up as high as he could, He flung his left hand down to help with the elevation. He grabbed onto it with his right hand and used his new strength to grab on with his left hand. <br>\r\n\"Maybe we should have worked out legs first, then you could have had that extra power.\" Sam laughed, Duncan laughed too and realised it hurt his stomach a bit. \"Laughing is good for the abs, especially when you are hanging like this. Right so what we are going to do is, a minute of these,\" He proceeded to lift his legs up (bent at the knee) so his knees almost touched his chest. \"followed by a minute of this.\" He put his legs out straight so that his legs and body were perpendicular from each other. \"We rotate between those two for 15 minutes then move onto these.\" He proceeded to do almost what he did with the first one but instead it was faster and he turned his body side to side as he lifted his legs, \"for another 15 minutes. We will then take a break and see how you feel.\"<br>\r\nDuncan felt scared, there was no way he thought he could do all of that.<br>\r\n\"3, 2, 1, GO!!!\" Sam started<br>\r\nDuncan waited for a couple of seconds before realising he should start too.</span></div></div>",

Sam watched the clock on the wall and called out when to change exercise. When he final said stop Duncan dropped to the floor and lay on his back dripping with sweet. He watched Sam gracefully drop from the bar landing on his feet and walking over to Duncan. Duncan couldn't help but notice Sam's abs. They were glistening with sweet and looked rock hard and so pumped.<br>\r\n\"Looked like it had a good effect on you.\" Sam sat down next to him and pocked Duncan's stomach. Duncan followed his gaze to find a wall of abs where his once flat stomach had been. \"I'm surprised that that simple exercise gave you a six pack.\" <br>\r\n\"Am jealous?\" Duncan asked smugly. He knew the answer was yes.<br>\r\n\"Hey they are still not match for my abs,\" He proceeded in twisting his body slightly to give a better effect. \"And I bet they aren't as hard as they look.\" Sam cockily when to touch his abs again. He put one finger out and pushed slightly. Duncan's stomach didn't move at all. \"Well, they are a bit hard, I'll give you that.\" Sam pushed harder. Still it didn't move. Sam looked shocked. He continued pushing harder and harder till Duncan reaconed he was using about three quarters of his strength. \"See not that hard.\" Sam said trying to hide the embarrassment in his voice.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure yours are still harder.\" Duncan said subtly tried to reassure him.<br>\r\nDuncan stood up and grabbed the bar again<br>\r\n\"You ready for more already?\" Sam said still breathing heavily.<br>\r\n\"No it's fine. I am just going to do a couple of chin-ups and pull-ups to see how easy it is with these new arms.\" Duncan let go of the bar with on arm to flex his 14 inch bicep.<br>\r\n\"You know what would be a good test, see how many you can do before getting tired.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" He says beginning with the chin-ups.</span></div></div>",

He raped the tape around the bicep, surprised to find how hard it was. \"15 and a half. Another inch and a half in another hour. It's quite hard too.\" <br>\r\n\"Squeeze it as hard as you can.\" Duncan challenged. <br>\r\n\"You sure.

He squeezed a little harder. still nothing. <br>\r\nIt's like the same thing that happened to his abs, He thought. He decided to finally squeeze with all his might.

Sam was surprised by the pressure he was feeling. He pushed back, getting it past his side of half way. Sam smiled smugly but was surprised to see that Duncan was smiling too. Duncan added more force to bring them back to centre. Both Duncan and Sam pushed harder and harder to try to bring the other person down. Both their arms were rippling with muscle as well as their shoulders and pecs from the pressure (Keeping in mind they are both still shirtless.). Sam was looking directly at Duncan's bicep which was now massively pumped and striated, veins running along it like a snake. <br>\r\nSam saw the bicep bulge further and felt the pressure increase. But he held his ground. He was however slightly worried about the fact that Duncan's arm looked to be growing. Duncan's grip became like a vice and the pressure continued to increase. Sam's arm began to shake as he used all his strength to keep Duncan from winning.<br>\r\n\"This feels amazing!\" Duncan said lifting his left arm to flex. His bicep looked to be about 16 inches, probably bigger, and still growing. \"Come on Sam, try harder.\"<br>\r\nSam pushed with every last bit of strength he had, but as he did, Duncan's arms grew faster till it reached the same size as Sam's. <br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Duncan said with a smile and pushed his arm down to the table. <br>\r\nSam looked shocked. \"I never knew being this big would be so fun.\" Duncan said doing a double bicep flex. \"Those Smoothies work wonders.\"<br>\r\nSam couldn't say anything. He simply reached out to and grabbed Duncan's bicep. As he grabbed it. Duncan lifted his arm up, lifting Sam off the ground slightly. <br>\r\n\"You are so light.\" Duncan said<br>\r\nSam grabbed the bicep with his other hand and started to do chin ups. \"This is so fun!!!\" Sam responded. After completing 20 chin ups, Sam jumped down and said. \"You look a bit weird with 17 inch biceps and and a six pack but tiny legs so should be move onto legs.\"<br>\r\n\"Lets do it.\" Duncan said looking down at his tiny legs.<br>\r\nSam walked over to the squat rack. Duncan followed behind realising he hadn't really looked at Sam's legs. He was wearing short gym shorts that were stretched quite tight. His thighs looked to be  about 20 inches and his carves looked about 16 inches. <br>\r\n\"You can start. How much shall I load it with.\" Sam asked standing at a rack that was loaded with 200kgs already.</span></div></div>",

Your arms are just no match for mine yet.\" And with that he slowly and carefully but still very easily brought Duncan's arm down.<br>\r\n\"Damn I though I would at least be able to move you arm a little bit.\" Duncan said with dismay, watching Sam's amazing muscle ripple all over this increadibly muscular, pumped, shirtless upper body.<br>\r\n\"Right should we get started in bulking up those twigs you call legs now?\" Sam asks with a smile on his face. To emphasise the fact the stick out his leg in front of him and flexed. And his leg ripped in response, his amazing calfs becoming more shredded and his thigh looking oh so thick. <br>\r\nDuncan looked down at his indead twig like legs. On the mirrors on the wall, he looked ridiculous. His upper body looked like a well built athlete while his legs still looked like they belonged to a nerd or something.<br>\r\n\"Lets do this.\" Feeling a lot of insperation to make himself look more even.<br>\r\nThey headed over to the squats area. There was only room for one person to work out at a time so Sam had to go first to show Duncan how to do it properly. He loaded it up with a flattering 250kgs. <br>\r\n\"Thats a lot.\" Duncan said in awe.<br>\r\n\"Actually its not that much. Squats is easier to do heavier weights so this is my starting weight.\" She set himself up underneath the bar. \"I recommend you start with like 50kgs and work your way up from there.\" He then proceeded lift it off the rack and began squatting it. Duncan observed his Calves and Thighs tighten under th wight, but as expected he did not struggle lift and drop with the weight on his shoulders. He stopped at 20 reps and began to take off the some of the wights.<br>\r\n\"Your turn now.\" He said leaving 50kgs on the bar.<br>\r\nDuncan got into position under the bar, getting his hands into position. He xxpected himself to be strong enough to lift the weight, what with his new arms and everything. But squatting seemed like it would be a lot of work on his tiny legs.</span></div></div>",

As expected it didn't put much pressure on his buff arms but his legs definitely felt the weight, and he hadn't even started squatting. He went down very slowly, copying Sam's good form. On his way up his legs started to wobble, but he managed to push through it and go back up. He continued squatting, occasionally hearing Sam gasp silently to himself. Duncan couldn't see but he assumed he was looking at his own reflection or something. That could be the only real explanation. <br>\r\nDuncan stopped at 20, as Sam had. But not from tiredness. More from the fact it was getting to light. He wanted to move it up a notch. He stepped out from under the bar to see Sam looking down at his legs and smiling. Duncan looked down and found that he was not looking at his normal twig like legs. Although nowhere near Sam's size or muscularity, his calfs had developed, creating a nice tear drop form on the back of his legs. He also noticed that his thighs looked a little rounder. <br>\r\n\"Good job. Muscle grows well on you doesn't it. You ready for something heavier?\" Sam didn't even wait for an answer and added another 50 kgs onto the bar. \"I think you can handle 100kgs now.\"<br>\r\nDuncan didn't argue. He just wanted to get bigger so he hoped back under the bar and began to squat again. As he squatted he listened for Sam's gasping and assumed that meant his legs were growing more. After 50 reps of that (Duncan lost count and just focused on lifting to impress Sam), Duncan felt a hand on his shoulder. He put the bar back on the rack and looked over at Sam.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say its almost closing time.\" <br>\r\n\"Really? But I was getting a really good pump.\" He them proceeded to flex his legs that were now three times bigger than when he first arrived, which was really not that big, but it meant he had grown. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you can come back tomorrow or another day. It would be interesting to see how big you can get. Should we sort out the monthly subscription?\" Sam said putting back on his shirt, that looked ridiculously small on his pumped up frame. <br>\r\nDuncan follows suit, finding that his tank top was now quite tight around his chest. He could see his abs poking through the top too. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry you get a free shirt when you first sign up anyway.\" They walked back out to the reception, sam went behind the desk and began typing on the computer. \"Thats $50 a month. You get a free t-shirt and 12 hour access to the gym a day. We run from 6 till 6 daily. As long as no one else is in the gym with us I will continue to work out with you and keep on supplying you with smoothies. These are something I like to keep to myself.\" <br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks. I feel honoured.\" He proceeded to hand over the cash. <br>\r\n\"What size are you?\" <br>\r\n\"Well this is a child medium so...\"<br>\r\n\"Adults small it is.\" <br>\r\nHe handed the shirt over the counter to Duncan.<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for the help. I really enjoyed myself and seem to have got a lot out of today.\" He again proceeded to flex his 15 and half inch bicep of which Sam reached over the counter to have one more feel. Duncan enjoyed Sam admiring his new arm. \"Don't worry it's going to get a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't doubt that.\" <br>\r\nDuncan left smiling and waving at Sam. \"See you tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

My parents are out on buisness so I have to babysit my little bother today.\" As he said that a young blond haired boy came out from behind the counter and hid slighly behind Sam. He was wearing long skinny jeans that accented his calfs nicely, they had the similer roundness that Sam's calfs had. He was also wearing a short sleeved green shirt, his arms were not so much muscular as they were sturdy. He definitly looked like Sam, face and bodytype wise, their family must have good muscle genetics. \"This is Marc, he is 7 and a little shy but warms up well to people eventually. He is quite strong for his age too. You don't mind if he watches you work out do you? Marc injoys watching me work out and sometimes comes to join in but I have some paperwork I need to complete and was hoping you could entertain him for about an hour will I file everything.\"<br>\r\n\"No, thats fine. Hi Marc, I'm Duncan. A friend of your brother's.\" Duncan put a hand out politly for him to shake if he wished. Marc hung back holding onto his brothers tight shorts. <br>\r\n\"It's okay, he'll come around. Why don't you go get started. I'll fix you a Smoothie and Marc out when it's ready.\"<br>\r\nDuncan nodded and walked into the once again empty workout room. He though it a good idea to warm up by doing some chin-ups as he knew he could do quite a few of those.<br>\r\nHe began slowly, fearing he may be sore from yeterday but found that he just felt very energized and picked up the pace. He breesed past his previous record with only minimal tiring. He loved the feel of his biceps as they pushed against the sleeve of his shirt. It felt like they were growing with every chin-up and that it would burst the sleeve at any moment. Of course he wasn't growing that fast, it was mearly his imagination. <br>\r\nSam and Marc walked in as Duncan was finishing last few chin-ups.<br>\r\n\"Looking good Duncan.\" Sam said handing Duncan the smoothie<br>\r\n\"I feel great, not sore at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Yea neither do I. Funny, I thought I would be sore considering the fact I have out grown my shirts but guess not. Anyway, Marc you go watch Duncan while I do some boring paperwork.\"<br>\r\nHe pulled Marc off him and walked out of the room. <br>\r\n\"So, Marc. What do you thing I should work out first.\" Duncan said lowering himself so that he was about Marc's level. <br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation of looking at the floor, he looked up and immediatly his eys locked onto Duncan's arms. \"Can I feel your arms?\" He whispered<br>\r\nDuncan flexed his arm and brought it towards Marc who reached out both hand to sqeeze. Duncan was surprised when he actually felt some strain on his bicep. Although not as strong as his bother or Duncan, Marc was clearly quite strong. Duncan playfully tensed and relaxed his arm, watching Marc smile as his hands were forced up and down from the tensing bicep.<br>\r\n\"I think you need to do arms, cause they are not very hard OR big.\" Marc said with a lot more confidence than before. Duncan was a little shocked by this kid forwardness. \"They are tiny compared to my brothers, and I can't sqeeze his at ALL.\"<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm doing arms first.\"</span></div></div>",

Bother says if you want be big you have to lift big.\". He was indeed right, Sam had told  him that yesterday. Duncan moved over and picks up the 15 kg weight instead. <br>\r\nAs Duncan sits down to start doing bicep curls, Marc walks over to the rack and pulls off the 5 kg weight. \"Be careful with that. That's how much I was lifting yesterday.\" As if to show off, Marc sits down next to Duncan and begins easily lifting the weight. Watching Marc lift reminded him of watching Sam lift, perfect pose and correct lifting method with no signs of struggle. <br>\r\nDuncan continued to lift, watching his bicep bulge to fill his sleeve with every lift. He keep half an eye on Marc to make sure he didn't hurt himself. But he was just the same as when he started perfect form and no signs of struggle. <br>\r\n'How does this kid do it?' Duncan thought.<br>\r\nAs if in response, Marc says \"Brother says that I am not allowed to lift anything heavier till I am at least 10 or I could seriously hurt myself. I have been lifting 5 kgs for a year now though. I wish I could lift something heavier so I can grow big like my brother.\" He stops lifting for a moment and flexes a double bicep pose. Although, there is no serious muscle, the flex definitely showed a bicep that had not been clear before. Duncan figured it must have been 8 maybe even 9 inches.<br>\r\n\"He probably doesn't think you are strong enough.\" Duncan said 'or he is afraid you might out grow him' Duncan added in his head. At half his brother's size and half his brother's age, and with his genetics, he wouldn't put it past Sam to not want Marc to work out too much out of fear of being out sized.<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't tell your brother, you can use the 10 kg. I'll keep an eye on you to make sure you don't hurt yourself.\"<br>\r\nMarc beamed a smile wider than the great wall of china and jumped off the bench in anticipation to start lifting 'big'.<br>\r\nAs Marc turned back to sit down with his new weights he exclaimed to Duncan, \"Your arms look bigger already, told you to go big.\" Marc was indeed correct as Duncan noticed his sleeve was almost at breaking point as his bicep continued to swell. \"I hope you get bigger than by brother, cause then he won't be able to stop me from working out BIG.\" He said very focused on his newly heavy weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour Duncan heard a tearing sound. His bicep was now so swoll that it was ripping his sleeve ever so slowly. It was only a tear but then it was only the beginning. Duncan looked over at Marc to make sure he was okay. He was more than okay, He was beyond happy even. He had sweet running down his head and his arms as he continued to pump that weight like his life depended on it. His arms also looked like a definite nine inches by now too. Ever so quietly, Duncan could hear him muttering \"Bigger, must get bigger, huge, must be big.\" Duncan thought he was taking it a little too seriously. <br>\r\n\"I think it is time we stop and compare, before your brother walks in and finds you doing something you shouldn't.\" Marc looked very sad by this but put the weight away anyway. <br>\r\n\"WOW, YOUR ARM IS HUGE.\" His face lit up again. He jumped up to grab on as I flexed my new 16 inch bicep. \"Am I heavy?\" <br>\r\n\"I can't even feel you.\" Duncan responded with delight<br>\r\nMarc began doing chin-ups on his arm. Duncan didn't mind, he really couldn't feel Marc on his arm at all. As he watched Marc do chin-up with the ease and grace and speed of his brother, he noticed Marc's bicep which was too bulging beyond belief for a kid his age. Duncan couldn't help himself. He reached out for a feel of how hard Sam's Brother's Bicep may be. </span></div></div>",

It seemed brand new, although it came with no packaging nor instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemote in hand, he stared at it for a moment  \u201cYou mean to tell me that someone mailed me a television remote control yet didn\u2019t bother to leave any instructions on how to set it up? Just lovely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn frustration, he three himself down onto his recliner chair. After about an hour, he looked at what appeared to be a standard remote control. It looked peculiar, unlike any remote control he\u2019s ever seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon inspection, he found that the control featured no number buttons, a glass screen, directional buttons, and a scanner on the flat surface above the power button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curiously peaked, he pressed the power button. The screen came to life and he nearly dropped the almost-remote when he heard a small robotic voice say \u201cScanning for human life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, exact measurements were placed on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Dave<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20194\u2019\u2019<br>\r\nWeight: 90 pounds <br>\r\nShoe size: US6<br>\r\nSexuality: Bisexual<br>\r\nMuscle mass: 0<br>\r\nMake any changes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was curious as to what this could entail  Pressing the up button, it began to cycle through his different body parts. He cycled through each of his body parts in part bewilderment, part amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he made his way down to his feet. Being so small in size, Dave had always wondered what it would be like to be a massive, tall, muscular, gorgeous hulk of a man. He figured that if this machine was going to change his body, it would be on his own terms. To test what this control could really do, he decided that his fantasy will start to come true with his small feet  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting his body relax, he slowly started pressing the right diagonal button while the FEET option was highlighted. There was no change nor feeling at first. However, a few seconds later, Dave felt a pleasurable tingly feeling arise in his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched slowly as his feet grew before his very eyes. Very slowly, he watched as his feet grow past their tiny size six, stretching out the threading on his socks. He continued to press the diagonal button, obsessed with the growth feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched his feet continue to swell larger and larger in his socks, they eventually started to tear through, now able to see his feet expanding in the flesh. He let out a soft moan. Slowly but surely, he was transforming himself into a god. He\u2019ll be bigger than those jocks Lightning, Alejandro, Topher, and Tyler in no time. He refused to stop the growth in his feet until they were completely bare, the remains of his tiny socks now in tatters on the floor. He went back to the main menu to check his measurements yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Dave<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20194\u2019\u2019<br>\r\nWeight: 93 pounds<br>\r\nShoe size: US13<br>\r\nSexuality: Bisexual<br>\r\nMuscle mass: 0<br>\r\nMake any changes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even second guessing now, Dave agreed to let the strange device make the changes he\u2019d always wanted to his body. He cycled through the options until he found THIGHS. Without thinking, he pressed down on the right diagonal button to let his next growth begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasurable, tingly feeling came back, this time in his thin, scrawny thighs, as he selected. Eventually, like his feet, his thighs slowly started to bulge and grow thick with immense muscle. He watched in ecstasy and excitement as his once scrawny thighs were filling up and thickening with hardened muscle right before his eyes. Becoming so large, they stretched out the fabric of his denim skinny jeans, they eventually started to burst through, becoming as thick as gorgeous, velvety tree trunks. To make matters more exciting, his groin and butt grew larger, thicker, and muscular. There was a loud BOOM sound as his jeans exploded along with his underwear. He let loose a series of wild, animal-like moans. Now with his feet and thighs more than doubled in size, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to check his measurements now. He just started cycling through his body parts until he landed on his......</span></div></div>",

Nothing about this store really yelled 'magic', it was just a place filled with worthless junk and knick knacks. <br>\r\nAt least it was well organised. In one corner was a shelf filled with leaves and rocks labeled as 'Nature Magic'. In another corner were jars filled with various pieces of earth like sand and dirt claiming to be different types of 'Protection Spells'. <br>\r\nTrent walked up to the front counter on which sat various pieces of old jewellery all claiming to do different things. A ring with an emerald gem was labeled 'Luck'. there was a pink gem rimmed necklace labeled 'Love'. From what Trent could see there wasn't really any jewellery labeled 'Strength' or 'Muscle'. <br>\r\nSurely there must be something here. Trent thought taking another careful look around the store. Even if it isn't really magic, it would give me the motivation to work out that I need. <br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, boy. How can I help you?\" Trent turned to see who belonged to the sweet sounding voice. Walking out of the door way behind the counter was a beautiful long blond haired woman. She wore a long slimming blue dress with bare arms. She was tall and slim and Trent could not help but stare. <br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Trent stumbled towards the counter. Once he regained his balance he continued. \"I'm looking for something that could help me build muscle.\" Trent said, puffing his small chest for emphasis.<br>\r\n\"Why come to a magic shop, why not just go to the gym?\" The lady asked with a kind smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I guess I just need motivation or a jump start.\" Trent said questioning his real motives for using a magic shop as his first stop to becoming huge.<br>\r\n\"Well you're in luck. My son and I were actually just brewing up another batch of 'Instant Muscle'. Would you care to join us?\" She said motioning to the back room.<br>\r\n\"Um sure.\" She lead me out back into a room about the same size the shop. Against the same wall as the door we had walked through was a wooden stair case, which either led to an attic or to their bedrooms. Judging by the rest of the room Trent figured they must live here since there was food in cupboards and dishes in the sink. In the centre of the room was the dinning table and sitting on one of the chairs was a young boy, no older than ten. <br>\r\n\"This is my son, Marc. He is a little shy so give him some time to get used to you. Marc, this is...\" The woman turned to Trent realising she had not asked his name.<br>\r\n\"I'm Trent. I was on Total Drama for two season.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought you looked familiar. Nice to have you here.\" She said with another pleasant smile. \"Why don't you two get to know each other while I go up stairs and get what we need.\" She motioned Trent towards the chair next to her son and left hurriedly towards the stairs. <br>\r\nTrent sits in the seat looking at the young boy who is siting silently looking down at the table. \"Nice to meet you.\" Trent said in a friendly tone. Marc stayed silent. Trent decided to try another tactic. \"Do you make spells with your mum often.\" Marc was definitely listening as his eyes flicked towards Trent quickly and then away again. <br>\r\n\"She says it's a good bonding exercise for us. Also it helps if I learn what to do for when she is busy with the shop.\" Marc didn't exactly look or sound happy. \"She said she wanted to make some 'Instant Muscle' spells for the shop.\" He looked up at Trent, \"I think she is making some so that I won't get bullied at school.\"<br>\r\n\"Well it couldn't hurt, I mean I want muscle cause it will make me cool and I can get my girl friend back. Wow, I sound really conceited. Don't you want to be strong, I would be so cool.\" Trent said trying to cheer him up. <br>\r\n\"Yea, I guess so.\" He said, \"Hey, can I see you muscles now, before you use the spell. I want to know how much one spell will make me grow before I take one too.\" Marc looked up at Trent with big puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" Trent rolled up his sleeve for the second time that day. He flexed as hard as he could super weak in front of the little kid. His tiny bicep rose on his arm, no bigger than earlier that day. Marc reached out to touch it and gave it a squeeze. Trent was disappointed with himself when the 10 year old was able to dent it. Even if Marc was not strong enough to hurt Trent, it still hurt his pride.<br>\r\n\"Are you guys ready to get started?\" Trent rolled down his sleeve quickly as Marc's mother walked down the stairs. \"Are you guys getting along?\" All three people smiled for different reasons. <br>\r\n\"Now Trent, would you like to help, or watch? If you help I'll give a spell for free.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Free spell. I'll definitely help.\" Trent was low on cash since he hadn't won the million and he usually spends all his money on guitars.<br>\r\nMarc's mum dropped box full of weird items on the table and began unloading it. He said out load what things were as she pulled them out of the box.<br>\r\n\"A dumbbell, a jar of sweet, muscle fibres from a bodybuilder.\" Trent almost threw up when she opened a small wooden box to show him, they were still bloody. \"Protein powder, a tank top, spray tan in a bottle, a picture of a bodybuilder, and...\" She paused for emphasis, \"Cookie dough.\" <br>\r\n\"Cookie dough?\" Trent questioned. <br>\r\n\"We make them into cookies. A spell is most potent when you eat it.\" Marc explained.<br>\r\n\"One cookie should add about 10lbs of muscle. How much do you weigh now?\" The lady asked still smiling.<br>\r\n\"About 115lbs, I have a little muscle in my arms but not much.\" Trent explained.<br>\r\n\"I only weigh 65. I don't have any muscle.\" Marc said copying Trent.<br>\r\nWell, we are going to fix that.\" She handed Marc the bowl of cookie dough. \"I need you guys to pour a tablespoon of sweet, a cup protein powder, two chopped up muscle fibres, and a drizzle of the spray tan onto the dough. I will cut the picture and tank top into confetti for sprinkles.\" Trent thought this was insane. They were literally going to make cookies out of there smelly items. <br>\r\n\"What about the dumbbell?\" Trent asked as he measured the sweet on to a tablespoon.<br>\r\n\"Rolling Pin.\" She said simply cutting the picture up into confetti pieces.<br>\r\nMarc and Trent worked on mixing the ingredients into the dough. Trent stirred since the dough was so sticky and needed a little muscle to get it to work, Marc tried but couldn't get the wooden spoon to move much. After they mixed it all up mostly, they laid the dough out on the table. It smelt like a gym and so did they. Marc's mother handed Trent the 5lb rolling pin dumbbell which he could barely lift, which was fine since it was being used as a rolling pin not a weight. Trent and Marc worked together to get the dough the right thickness everywhere, it wasn't easy with a dumbbell.<br>\r\nMarc's mother handed us some cookie cutter, they were shaped like dumbbells and flexed arms. They managed to cut out 40 cookies in total, 20 of each shape. They then sprinkled them with the mixed tank top/bodybuilder photo confetti before putting them in the oven to cook for half an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarc's mother then pulled the baked cookie out of the oven. They still smelt terrible.<br>\r\n\"So, Trent, for your help you can have one for free. How many would you like to buy?She asked placing the tray on the table.<br>\r\n\"Can I try my free one first before I decide?\" Trent asks politely, realising although she had said they add 10lbs of muscle, something may have gone wrong to make them more potent. Best to be sure that he doesn't over buy and over eat.<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" She said still smiling as Marc handed him one of the hot cookies. It smelt terrible. He couldn't believe he was actually going to eat this. He slowly brought it closer to his mouth and took a small bite. \"You need to eat it in no more than two bites if you want to full effect.\" She explained to him before he took his second. Trent realised that it didn't actually taste as bad as the smell. He quickly finished the biscuit with the second bit and waited.<br>\r\n\"Do you feel anything?\" Marc asked.<br>\r\nTrent was about to say that he didn't when he got a warm feeling in his stomach. The feeling began to tingle and move about. Trent felt like he was on a roller-coaster that was making his stomach wretch. His stomach became hotter and he had the urge to take off his shirt, although he didn't because that would be weird in front of strangers. The hot tingling moved to his arms. They felt like jelly then they felt solid again but more solid than normal.<br>\r\nMarc and his mother watched as Trent rolled up his sleeve to examine his arm. His forearms looked far thicker than a normal guitarists. They were striated and vainly, it looked like he had just had an amazing arm workout. Trent rolled his sleeve up further too find his bicep, no longer a tiny bump, bulging with muscle. Nice and round and again definitely bigger than that of a normal guitarist, even one that might work out. His under arm developed a nice horseshoe tricep that finished his nice round arm. Marc reached out to feel. He squeezed but was unable to dent it anymore. <br>\r\n\"It's so hard now.\" He said in awe of Trent's growing arms.<br>\r\n\"I'm not even flexing.\" Marc felt his hands move as the skin under it stretched to make way for the flexed size bulging. Immovable veins snaked their way along the bicep and up his thick forearm. \"Nice. 15 inches if I had to guess.\" Trent said with a malicious smile.<br>\r\n\"What about your abs?\" Marc asked already lifting Trent's shirt up. This had clearly been the feeling in his stomach earlier as instead of being flat, it covered by six thick mounds with deep caverns separating them. <br>\r\n\"I have a six-pack!\" He said thumping them with his strong arms. \"Amazing! I barely felt that.\" At this moment he felt the tingling heat again, this time it was moving down. Trent's skinny jeans felt tight, much tighter than normal. Suddenly a tear ripped straight up his calfs. He reached down and ripped the pant legs off at the knee showing off his new teardrop calfs. They looked like the calfs of a runner or biker. He accidentally put his had on his thigh and felt the mass that was now packed into the upper part of his now short skinny jeans. <br>\r\n\"This is amazing! Thanks so much.\" Trent said rolling down his sleeve again, which was on the verge of ripping also. <br>\r\n\"Now that you have tried one, how many would you like to buy?\" The lady asked ignoring her son who was clearly eager to try a cookie now too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll have 10 please.\" Trent asked greedily thinking of all the muscle he could gain. Of course he didn't want to get overly huge (Or at lease not yet...), but with 10 he had a large variety of things he could do. He could take some and save some for later when he needs them. Or he could give them to his friends and family if he thinks they need it. <br>\r\nBut that was not important now, all Trent wanted to do was get home an look at his new body. <br>\r\nThe kind shop lady packed the cookies up into a weird little drawstring bag much like an old coin bag that thieves use in movies. Trent said thank you to the lady, handed her some money and left, listening to the excited sounds of Marc trying one of the cookies  on his way out. <br>\r\nTrent went straight home, he was too excited to stop and do anything else on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving home Trent yelled \"Mum, I'm home.\"<br>\r\nHe listened out for the usual, \"Thats great honey.\" Followed by, \"Did you find what you wanted?\" <br>\r\n\"Yup, I found it.\" Trent replied as his mum popped into view from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Look at you, finally got some meat on your bones. You should have listened to your father and I when we told you to start going to the gym. Rock stars and guitarists don't have twigs for arms you know.\" Trent rolled his eyes. His mother put her hands on his buffed shoulders, \"Honey, I love you but I'm glad you gained a bit of muscle. You were starting to look a bit unhealthy.\" With a final squeeze (that didn't have any effect on Trent's hard shoulders) she turned and left towards the kitchen. \"Dinner's at seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent raced up to his room. He was itching to see his body without his shirt on but something his mother had said was bothering him. <i>I'm glad you gained a bit of muscle.</i> What does she mean a little, He had grown magically in a couple of hours. If she thinks I look muscular now, he thought, wait till I have another cookie. I'll be as strong as dad, maybe even stronger. <br>\r\nHe opened the bag and pulled out a flexing arm cookie. He then placed the rest of the bag in a secret compartment in the bottom draw of his desk. He didn't know why the desk came with a fake bottom, he didn't usually have a reason to hide items from anyone but he didn't want the biscuits to 'accidentally' be eaten by someone. \"Better safe than sorry.\" He reassured himself.<br>\r\nFor the second time that day, Trent walked over to his full length mirror. He took a deep breath and took a bite of the cookie. A smile spread across his face as he felt the familiar tingle appear in his stomach. He ate the other half of the biscuit as he enjoyed the tingle heat up and begin to spread. <br>\r\nHis arms felt warm. He loved it. What felt even better was how tight his sleeves were. He bought his arms up, feeling the material constrict further. Slowly he balled his fists and watched in the mirror as his biceps peaked massively, easily tearing through thee sleeves his favourite shirt. He then flexed his forearms ripping the upper part of the sleeves in half too. \"Well I have no use for these anymore.\" He said smugly, ripping the torn sleeves clean off the shirt. \"It's like a tank top now.\" <br>\r\nHe continued to flex his arms, admiring their 16 and a half inches of pure steely muscle. His 'tank top' was now very tight around his chest, his pecs fighting for air. He pulled up his shirt to see his abs had defined further, although not quite an 8 pack they were defined beyond belief. Accented nicely by his V taper which lead down to his ever tightening pants. <br>\r\nHis calfs were now looking massive and veiny just with the new mass they had to support. They looked like a cyclist who went to the gym to work out his legs further. Further up his thighs were ripping with muscle and fighting against thee tight stretchy fabric of his skinny jeans. \"I should change into something looser.\" With that he flexed his legs and ripped his jeans right off. He was now standing in front of the mirror in a very tight, revealing 'tank top' and his boxers that were just big enough to hold his new size. He looked like an amateur junior bodybuilder. He was now well out of the realm of guitarist muscles. He bet he could even rip a guitar in half if he wanted, and if he couldn't he had more cookies how help.<br>\r\nAs he grabbed a pair of sweat pants from his dresser he thought about what he wanted to do with his new muscle. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dinner time, honey. Come set the table before your father gets back his after work gym session.\" Trent quickly pulled on the sweatpants and bounced down the stairs with his new weight.<br>\r\nDespite Trent's father being an accountant, he went to the gym quite frequently and had got quite a nice body because of it. There were only two thing that Trent's father want from him: to become an accountant and to gain some muscle. To the first request, Trent responded with \"NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.\" and the second request was now fulfilled. <br>\r\nAs he walked into the kitchen to get the cutlery, he expected his mother to be surprised by his yet again sudden growth. But she didn't really make a fuss about it. All she said was \"Your arms look quite big in that shirt. You should wear it more often.\" and then turned back to plating up the food. <br>\r\nTrent was slightly frustrated by her lack of a reaction. He hoped his father would either be proud or shocked because he just wanted someone to show appreciation for his muscles.<br>\r\nAs he was thinking this he was carrying the cutlery to the table. Knives in one hand, folks in the other. Without realising he began to tense in frustration. Why can't mum be more proud of me. He thought as his biceps tensed showing great definition. As he tensed, the cutlery in his hands began to morph. He placed the cutlery on the table noticing it was bent in the middle. \"Did I do that?\" He then began bending them back into shape one by one the best he could. Usually it would have taken a great deal of focus and effort for him to bend a fork but now he was bending it with very little of his strength. <br>\r\n\"I'm home.\" Said the deep manly voice of Trent's father. \"I had the best work out this afternoon. I feel so pumped.\" His father walked into the room in his workout clothes. He had on some very skimpy red shorts the showed his fathers muscular defined legs. Not quite what his sons were now but still really amazing for an accountant. He wore a blue and white striped t-shirt that fit snuggly over his upper body. His chest heaved as he walked into the room. He was right about being pumped, Trent could see it in his arms. They bulged in the sleeves with veins running up and down them like a map. <br>\r\nTrent guessed that he was a bit bigger than his father at his current size but he was shorter than him due to not inheriting his height. Trent was average hight while his father was tall. <br>\r\n\"Trent, look at you.\" His father said upon laying eyes on him. \"You finally decided to do something about that twig body of yours.\" <br>\r\nGreat. Thats just what I wanted to hear. He thought sarcastically rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n\"You look amazing.\" His father continued.<br>\r\nNow that is what I want to hear. He thought smiling proudly.<br>\r\n\"Give me a flex.\" His father prompted. Trent did a double bicep flex his father showing off his massively peaked arms. \"Nice definition. Amazing size. Very veiny. High peaks\" he said walking up and feeling his sons bicep. \"Very solid.\" He squeezed. There was no give. He frowned and squeezed harder. No matter how hard he squeezed he could not make Trent's bicep move. \"Harder than I expected.\" He cage one final squeeze but there was still no give. <br>\r\nTrent was beaming. His father had passed the proud stage and was now shocked. Two for one. Score. <br>\r\n\"Hey dad. How about while mum finished serving up dinner, we have an arm wrestle like we used to years ago. Except this time I am going to win for real.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky son. You may be big and hard and incredibly muscular...\" Trent's father got lost in though momentarily \"But that doesn't mean you are strong.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" Trent said sitting at the dining table setting his arm in place. His father sat across from his and grabbed his arm. Trent squeezed his hand which made him wince slightly in pain. \"Three, Two, One. Go!\" <br>\r\nTrent was unsure of how strong he was compared to his father so he just braced himself for a lot of force. He was right to do so as his father wasn't going easy. He could tell his father was pushing a lot though and he wasn't using quite so much strength to hold him there. Trent gambled and when decided to start pushing the opposing force, and was surprised when his fathers hand began to fall. His fathers face looked shocked at this. His father pushed with all the strength he could muster which put them at a stand still at a 45 degree angle. Trent smiled. He was clearly the stronger one. Not by much but being stronger was what counted. Trent very slowly pushed his fathers arm down, not quite using all of his strength while trying to get a good arm workout out of this situation. <br>\r\n\"Guess I'm the strong one around here now.\" Trent said striking another double bicep pose, his right arm pumped slightly after the arm wrestle. Trent's father was still shocked from his defeat. \"Hey dad. How hard are you arms? Flex so I can have a feel.\" <br>\r\n\"Um...\" His father complied reluctantly to his request, flexing his right bicep for his superior son. Trent rapped a hand around most of the bicep feeling the solid mass under his hand. He gave it a gentle squeeze. Not super surprised that it didn't give, he squeezed harder forcing the arm into submission. His father gasped at the sharp pain in his arm pulling it away. <br>\r\nHis mother walked into the room carrying the three plates of food. Trent go out of the chair and collected his food from his mother saying, \"I'm going to go and eat my food up stairs. Also, you don't mind if I invite a friend over do you.\" His mother and father saiid nothing. \"Great, thanks.\" He said walking out of the room giving one last bicep flex as he left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent went back to his room nibbling on the food on his plate hungrily. he quickly grabbed his phone and took a photo in the full length mirror flexing his massive bicep. He logged onto a social networking site and uploaded the photo. Within a minute he got back two messages. <br>\r\nOne was from his good friend, Luke, who also played guitar. They were the same age. He was pretty skinny and was usually picked on when Trent wasn't around. He had messaged \"What happened bro, you been going to the gym without me? I haven't seen you since before Total Drama. We should catch up so you can teach me all your tricks :P\" <br>\r\nThe other message was from a kid he used to baby sit. His name was Kai and Trent figured he must be about 12 now. He was unsure how he had got onto the social network since you need to be 14 but he probably just faked his age. He was a nice kid, very hyperactive and loved to lift things. He often explained to Trent how when he was old enough he was going to start working out and get really huge. His message read \"wow you look so awesome. how did you get so big. can you take me to the gym i want to get strong. you are my new idol. please you are the only one who ever let me lift whatever i wanted even if it was way too heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should he invite over for the night?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luke was the obvious choice since he was one of Trent's actual friends. Not like all the girls who liked him for his looks.<br>\r\n\"Hey, dude. Come on over. Mum is fine with you staying the night if you want.\" He messaged back. <br>\r\nTrent looked over at the mirror. Am I too small? He thought. I am the quite big for my age, but I want Luke to be really impressed. He retrieved two cookies from the hiding place and put the rest back safely. He made a quick mental note that he now had seven cookies left.<br>\r\nLooking back at his phone he found a reply from Luke. \"Cool, i'll pack some stuff an be over in 5.\" Luke lived just around the corner from Trent so it made it easy to visit each other frequently, not that Trent had since he had left for Total Drama. <br>\r\nTrent walked back over to the mirror, admiring how buff his arms looked in his shirt. He really loved the shirt he was wearing even without the sleeves, but if he ate one more cookie it wouldn't fit anymore. He weighed up his options to keep his shirt on or take it off before eating the cookie. He came to the conclusion that even if he took it off, it wouldn't fit anymore thus making it useless. So he kept it on for his own amusement. <br>\r\nHe downed the cookie in one this time, chewing it slowly to take in the weird but tantalising flavours. Soon the familiar tingle began yet again in his stomach. Trent fully expected the shirt to rip the moment the tingle started but it didn't. Instead it felt less tight around his waist, like it was getting thinner. However his abs begin to push against the fabric more and soon Trent could see tight eight-pack through the stretched fabric. Growth moved up to his chest where the shirt finally started to feel tight. His pecs, back and shoulders all pushed for room in the ever decreasing space available inside the shirt. Trent watched with glee as the shirt showed its first tear since the sleeves, which slowly split down the centre gradually uncovering the mass of muscle developing underneath. His chest big heaving boulders of mass sitting atop a glorious array of perfectly sculpted abs evenly split by deep valleys. His shoulders were wide and his trap were high. Trent hit a most muscular pose and the rest of the shirt ripped and fell away giving full view of the upper body of a well developed bodybuilder. He observed his arms which by how had to be close to, if not, 18 inches. He felt the sort skin covering the hard peaks with veins crisscrossing in a multitude of directions. The veins themselves were even too hard for Trent to squeeze. <br>\r\nHe looked lower in the mirror and watched the sweatpants fill out with muscle, his legs were trunks of meat that made the sweats look like normal sized pants. Not skinny but not loose fitting either. <br>\r\nHe marvelled at his pumped body and contemplated trying to fit into one of his bigger shirts he got for christmas but thought it would make a better impression on Luke if he remained shirtless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent heard a faint knock at the door and began running downstairs yelling, \"That's Luke. Don't worry, I'll get it.\" He opened the door to find Luke, skinny as ever, holding two bags and his guitar on his back. Luke's initial reaction went from 'tired of walking with heavy bags, please help me' to 'Have you grown in the time since you posted that photo?'<br>\r\nTrent gave an impressive one armed bicep flex that made Luke drop the bag on the ground. Luke reached out and gave it a quick squeeze. To no one's surprise, it didn't move.<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough showing off and help me with these bags.\" Luke motioned to the bags on the ground in from of him. Trent picked them up with one arm each and proceeded to do a couple of curls. Trent noticed that the one in his left had was dramatically heavier that the one in his right, not that it felt all that heavy to him. \"I brought over some dumbbells my parents got me for christmas last year. I think they were trying to tell me something.\" He looked down at the bag in Trent's hand that he was still curling. \"Doesn't look like they are heavy enough for you though.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on lets get this stuff upstairs.\" Trent said turning and carrying the bags upstairs with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they got a mattress set up for Luke to sleep on. Luke got out the dumbbells and began curling. <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Trent asked watching Luke struggle with the medium sized weight.<br>\r\n\"Working out. Remember, you are going to teach your trick to being big. <br>\r\n\"Oh okay, right.\" Trent smiled and pulled out the the other cookie he had retrieved earlier. \"Here, I made these the other day, I find it can be helpful to eat while working out.\" A smile spread across his face as Luke took the cookie. He ate the cookie in one bite with a look of determination as he continued to curl.<br>\r\nTrent eagerly waited for the growth to begin. He was overly excited because watching yourself grow was not the same as watching someone else grow. <br>\r\nTrent thought for a moment. What if the cookie was not as potent on him, what if it was only more potent on me and presumably Marc because we made them. Or what if it is more potent on him than it is on me because he is working out at the same time. Then it began.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Surely, he thought, if they got just one look at how handsome I am and how good I am at hosting, they would ship me off immediately to some popular event in need of hosting.<br>\r\n\"I need a publicity stunt that will get their attention but is not very popular.\" Topher went over to his desk where he opened his laptop and searched on the biggest gossip sights for some publicity stunts. \"If I can find something good, all I really need is to turn up and my face should be able to do the rest.\"<br>\r\nTopher scrolled though news about celebrities who had or were having children; celebrity breakups and datings; lots of scandal about drug; and the news that Shawn had just won Total Drama: Pahkitew Island. <br>\r\nTopher kept scrolling and found two articles of interest.<br>\r\nThe first was a famous male model, Sam Lucca (age 17), who had recently become very buff. There had been a lot of speculation around how he gained so much muscle in a short amount of time. And also a lot of questioning about why a model would want to get big, granted models need to look hot with good definition and a wicked six-pack but Sam had taken it further and was gaining what would be considered TOO much for a model. <br>\r\nTopher looked at the picture attached to the article. It was a before and after shot. The before was from the most recent modelling shoot he had done. He had a very well defined six-pack, no more so than any other model though, his arms held muscle but nothing more than about 16 inches to give him the \"Manly\" look. His chest was defined but not sticking out very far, Topher thought they looked hard, same with his abs. <br>\r\nThe after picture was clearly taken by the paparazzi as the lighting was terrible and was taken through a window. The picture showed Sam in the gym looking directly at the camera. He was shirtless, but wearing some very big tight jeans. He was doing a double bicep pose showing of his now huge, what Topher thought to be about 19 inch arms. His abs were glistening from the workout he was clearly doing, and they were now a very hard eight-pack. He was WAY bigger than he was before and also WAY bigger than a model should be.<br>\r\nThe article continued to say that no one is 100% sure how he is doing it but there is speculation of steroids or other illegal substances. No one seemed to think that this was natural.<br>\r\n\"That could be interesting, I bet if I could get him to tell me something I would be in for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second article was about the filming of the latest superhero movie in Topher's hometown. Apparently they were filming a scene in a chemical factory. While they were filming one of the interns stumbled across genetic testing they were doing on rats. Turns out that the factory was conducting 'legal' experiments on rats to see if they could make them stronger and musclier. So far the experiments had been a bust till said intern accidentally poured a little bit of some strange chemical into one of the rats cage. <br>\r\nThe intern said that nothing had happened to the rat and that it was fine. He wiped up the chemical and made sure the rat was okay and then left. The scientist who was in the room at the time made sure to keep an eye on the rat and to study anything strange that might happen to it. <br>\r\nThe scientist reported that the rat seemed very heathy and continued as usual. He says he noticed it the rat running on the wheel he went to lunch and when he came back 2 hours later it was still running. He had checked the video recordings of the rat to see if it had stopped at all. Apparently he had been running for at least 2 hours. The scientist also noticed that as he watched the rat run on the wheel (at 10 times the speed to get though the video quickly) that he had grown quite a bit from the start to the end of the video. The rat had grown in size which was all muscle. <br>\r\nThe article finished by saying they would continue experimenting on just the singe rat to see what will happen to it. <br>\r\n\"Wow, I wonder what the chemical could do to a human? Maybe they need some help.\" Topher said slyly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had clearly had a lot of people trying to interview him. \"Thats right, I am here to help you.\"<br>\r\n\"Come in. I'm sure you are interested to see how much the rat has grown since the article was posted.\" He motioned towards the centre of the room where there was a cage, not the size of a normal though. It had many cages linked together by tubes. Each cage contained what looked like miniature work out equipment. In one there was the wheel, in another there was a bench press, in another there was a dumbbell rack, and in another there was a chin up bar.<br>\r\n\"The rat can use these.\"<br>\r\n\"He can now.\" Greg snapped his fingers over by the dumbbell rack cage. Topher watched as the biggest rat Topher had ever seen walked on is back legs out of the connecting tube. He was completely shaved of all fur so he could see all of the bulging, rippling muscles the rat owned.<br>\r\n\"As you can see the rat has gained about 5 kgs of muscle.\" Greg said. The rat walked over to the weights rack and grabbed one of the miniature weights. \"That is a half kg dumbbell that we managed to fit into a small weight using heavy metals.\" The rat proceeded to pump the weigh with some visible strain. The rats arm bulged to a size that a rats arm could never be every time he lifted it.<br>\r\n\"Have you thought about what might happen if the rat gets too strong?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, granted at the rate he is growing, he won't be a rat much longer. But we have worked out that the chemical has done something to his brain that makes him want to work out, so as long as we allow him to continue to work out we shouldn't have a problem.\" Greg explains.<br>\r\n\"Have you ever though about using a human subject?\" Topher enquired<br>\r\n\"Well it seems kinda dangerous because we don't know the rate it would work on a human. It could be the same rate as the rat which means the a human would need to work out constantly for about 3 months to double their weight. But the rate could be scaled up on a human to adjust the bigger beginning strength meaning the humans would gain ridiculous amounts of muscle just doing every day tasks.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He noticed a green substance in a vile over in the corner of the room. He slid over while was busy with the rat and grabbed the chemical. He didn't know whether it would be more effective to drink it or pour it on himself. Since he needed to get out of here before they noticed anything so he drank it. Greg was will busy admiring the rat so Topher just slipped out. He walked out of the room before anyone noticed anything was wrong. <br>\r\nHe began walking home while ringing him mum. She didn't answer. Thinking back to the article Topher realised the rat began by running, so that when he decided to just run home. The half hour drive turned into a 2 hour run, but Topher didn't feel tired at all. <br>\r\nWhen he got home he ran straight to his room where he locked the door. He walked over to the mirror and immediately noticed his legs. His legs had grown and were now pushing against the fabric of his jeans. He reached down to feel his legs through the fabric. \"Wow they are rock hard already.\"<br>\r\nTopher proceeded to take off his shirt. He was discouraged to find that his upper body had not grown at all. He had a decent upper body, he was no model but he liked to keep his body in shape in case he had to ever take his top of for a show. He had a 4 pack that he was proud and when he flexed his arms a little bump popped up.<br>\r\n\"I should measure it to see how big I get.\" He went over to his draw and found the measuring tape right at the back. He wrapped it around his are and smiled as it was 13 and a half inched. \"Not bad to start.\"<br>\r\nHe dropped the tape and on the floor to do some sit-ups. He got up to 30 before feeling a little tired, but he pushed on and by the time he got to 50 he wasn't tired anymore. So he started pumping them out faster. \"I'm going to be so hot that no network will be able to refuse me.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he continued his jog through the forest, Devin was having a conversation with himself out loud as he pondered what exactly he could do with himself to make him more appealing to Carrie. He loves Carrie, and while he may think that their relationship may be due to a rush of emotions and pressure placed upon him due to the completion, he believes that she is his soul mate and, whether it be romantically or just a friendship, he would do anything within his power to ensure that she would be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie loves big muscular guys like Ryan and Lightning? Oh, I\u2019ll give her big hulking brute. I\u2019ll be absolutely HUGE. I don\u2019t care what it takes, I will be the best version of me to make Carrie happy. I love her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued his \u2018therapy session\u2019 with himself on his jog, he stopped paying attention to his surroundings. As a bit more time passed, Devin tripped over a wall of grey-colored bricks and fell into a puddle of water. Taking a moment to come back to his senses he climbed back out of the puddle and grey brick wall, and turned to look at what he had fallen into  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha....wow!\u201d Standing proudly before Devin was a large, beautiful water fountain in the middle of this secluded forest. The brick looked exquisitely carved and was pain-stakingly detailed including angels blowing crystal clear water from their mouths up to the next level of the fountain, and so on, reaching the third tier, with water erupting from the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevin stripped off his soaking wet Power On long sleeve t-shirt, and closely examined the fountain. He circled around until he found a gilded plaque featuring a description of the fountain. \u201cThe Fountain of Dreams. Throw in a penny and your wish will come true.... hm. This sounds too good to be true. But who is it going to harm. He dug around in his pockets, eventually pulling out two pennies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, he tossed one in. \u201cI wish my clothes and I were dry.\u201d Within the blink of an eye, Devin felt all the dampness of his clothes and body evaporate and flee. He was slightly taken aback. He found the only wishing fountain in the world to actually WORK. All of his fantasies could now come true. He took the other penny in his left palm and pulled back his fist, ready to throw it in. Then something caught his eye... his reflection staring back at him. Devin observes his shirtless body as if he was staring into a mirror. While had always been toned with abs of stone, a<br>\r\nslightly taller-than-average height, Devin always felt jealous of other men that were bigger and more powerful than he was. Carrie\u2019s wandering eye towards Ryan only fueled that envy more. Feeling the small chest he had, Devin narrowed his eyes and tossed in his second penny. \u201cI want the body of a god.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment, looking around at his surroundings and then at his own body. There had been no change. He felt disheartened. He poured out his absolute wish to the fountain, and even after granting his previous wish, but there was no change in himself after. He felt a rage burning up inside of him. He was getting hot, starting to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his shirt and putting it back on, he angrily kicked the fountain and stomped away. \u201cStupid fountain, if you can\u2019t grant me my biggest wish, who will.\u201d After about a minute of stomping around and sulking in the forest, Devin sat down on a tree log that was cut down, releasing a sigh of defeat. \u201cI guess Carrie will never love m-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was talking, there was a loud <b>RIIIIPPP</b> sound. Devin looked down and saw that....</span></div></div>",

Now Featuring Characters from The Spin-Off of Total Drama, \"The Ridonculous Race\"!<br>\r\nThe rules that you saw have changed... Slightly. Here is the NEW list of Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a Total Drama Interactive (Muscle Growth) that I hope will be filled up with a lot of chapters. There are some rules and conditions though:<br>\r\nConditions:<br>\r\nCondition 1A: The story (or stories) <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">must</span> take place outside of the actual show, like say, in the hometowns of the contestants or so.<br>\r\nCondition 1B: If you want your story to take place DURING one of the seasons of Total Drama, then you MUST let me know beforehand.<br>\r\nCondition 2A- The character that you choose to experience the muscle growth will be the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">only character to undergo it from that point onwards.</span><br>\r\nCondition 2B - The above mentioned Rule has changed. When you Pick a Character, that character MUST undergo the Growth. However, you can now have up to two other characters join along for the ride!<br>\r\nRules: <br>\r\nRule 1: I will already leave behind some choices, those choices are the only ones that can be chosen.<br>\r\nRule 2: Needless to say all choices will be Male only.<br>\r\nRule 3A: There will be no suddenly making the character into a 50ft giant on the first part of the story or something like that.<br>\r\nRule 3B: Of course their growth can still be fast... just not INSTANT. And, as mentioned not as early.<br>\r\nRule 4: Nudity can be allowed, but nothing that involved cum or similar. But NOTE that I like reading about how characters outgrow their clothing.<br>\r\nRule 5: There will be no hardcore NSFW content unless I personally give permission to do so.<br>\r\nRule 6: I will be watching every one in a while. <br>\r\nRule 7: and the most Important one: Remember to have fun writing the sequence out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, enjoy everyone!</td>",
