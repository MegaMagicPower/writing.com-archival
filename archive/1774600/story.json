Suddenly the darkness is bright light and you shield your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough! You said you'd take me to the snack bar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take it easy for a minute, wondering where you are, and why Alex's voice is talking about a snack bar and such. Slowly your eyes adjust to the light of the beach, and you understand that you're on the beach, but you don't remember coming here. You figure you were dreaming about your house, which is why you feel so confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Alex, who's fairly annoyed, not that you really care if you bug him a bit. He usually annoys you at home, so it's fair-game that you do a bit to him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure...snack bar, Alex. Let's go\"<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" He replies in turn, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, Alex beside you as you lead him to the snack bar. As you both walk, eyes, mostly from the girls, on the beach seem to gravitate to you. Not that you mind, that's why you like the beach, you worked hard for your bod, so why not let others enjoy you as well? Nothing serious would come from it, but it was fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, if I knew you were gonna stop to show off as well, I would've been home at this rate.\" Alex says, just wanting you to hurry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, you glare at him, only to be shocked.

You know exactly what he's gonna ask for, because he has no money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Snickers bar is seventy-five cents! Do you have three quarters?\" he asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" you sigh, as you dig into your small plastic pouch which is strapped around your waist. You pull out the pouch but you give him a Dollar and two quarters instead. \"Please buy me one as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a buck fifty and then you step out of the line and you wait for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later your little brother comes walking up to you, holding two chocolate bars in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin! Here's your Snickers bar!\" he says as he hands you your snack. \"Thanks! I was so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Remember Alex...\" You say to him as you both tear the wrapper from your chocolate bars before you begin to eat. \"You gotta wait twenty minutes before you get into the water. Otherwise you'll get stomach cramps and you'll throw up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...\" Alex says between bites, \"I'll build a... A sand castle... or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at him while he was eating his Snickers bar, I began to notice something about him while we were walking back to the spot where we had our lounge chairs in the sand. With every bite he took, it seemed like Alex was growing bigger and taller! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had taken one bit out of his chocolate bar, and he seemed to be three inches taller already! His shoulders seemed broader, his abdominal muscles were more defined, and his biceps bulged a little more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took his second bite, his calves somehow grew larger, his legs appeared longer, and his pectorals bulged a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his third bite, he grew another three inches, his shoulders widened even more, and his quads grew thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after he had finished his snack, Alex had gained over a foot in height, over twenty pounds in muscle, his torso had widened, his shoulders were bigger and his legs, his arms and his chest were far more muscular than they were just a few minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin? Can we stay here till tonight?\" he asked me as he stood right in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped wide open as it dawned on me that I was actually looking UP to my little brother, who, at little over six feet tall, wasn't that little anymore. In fact, he was TALLER than me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, Alex... But, don't get sunburned, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Mom gave me a bottle of lotion! Can you rub it on me?\" he said, as he handed me a bottle of suntan lotion out of the big beach bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I see that I got a lot of skin to cover...\" I sighed, as I examined him from head to toe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though you were bewildered by the fact that your little brother had just grown into a tall muscular stud, you couldn't figure out how to ask him about it...which was weird, because on any other day you would have been yelling and go crazy, but today you just simply accepted it. You were still stunned and surprised, but you can't seem to make something big deal out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro?\" Alex snapped you out of your thoughts. \"Are you going to put some lotion on me or not? I'd do it myself, but my muscles get in the way or reaching all those tough spots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez, was Alex really that musclebound? Instead of freaking, you took the bottle of lotion and squirted some into your hand. \"Okay Alex, turn around so I can get your back.\" You told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently your brother turned around, exposing his broad muscular back to you. You were amazed at how defined and muscular his back had gotten, but shrugged it off as you began to rub lotion on it. Looking at it was mind blowing enough, but touching Alex made you realize that those muscles were real. Alex's body was firm to the touch, with a bit of warmth. Privately you had hoped this was some sort of weird dream or that Alex was actually some sort of robot, but it all felt too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rub lotion on his back, you suddenly noticed you seemed to be using the lotion up a lot faster than you should. As you looked at Alex's back, you frowned. Was Alex....growing again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back, as broad as it was before, seemed even broader now. Firm muscles were visible under his skin, and his light tan only accentuated it. His shoulders were capped with some sizable traps and deltoids, and his lats spread outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop?\" Alex asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, just thinking about how big you've gotten.\" You said out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave a short laugh. \"Yea, and I'm still a growing boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the understatement of the century. Privately you wondered how Alex could be growing. He wasn't eating anything right now. \"Alex, can you turn around so I can get your front?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing bro.\" Alex did as he was told. As you looked at his front, you couldn't help but be stunned by how big and developed he was. His chest stuck out and his abs were really defined, and his arms and legs had a definite thickness to it. Once again you recovered quickly and returned to the task at hand. You begin to rub lotion on his arms. As you did, you could feel the bicep and triceps swell underneath the palm of your hands, pushing them apart so you could no longer reach around them, even with both hands on it! The forearms thickened and swelled, cords of muscles forming under his skin. When you applied the lotion to the other arm, the same changes occurred until he had two very big, very powerful looking arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you moved onto his torso. Like his back and arms, as soon as you put the lotion on his chest they began to visibly swell before your eyes. The more lotion you rubbed on, the bigger and fuller they became, pushing back at you. When your hands brushed his nipples, Alex breathed in sharply, causing his chest to jump out in size. \"Sorry, a little sensitive.\" Alex chuckled. Your hands moved down to his abs, and as your fingers traced the outline, they became deeper, more shredded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you got to his legs. When you applied the lotion on his thighs, the quads grew bigger and fuller, soon filling up his swim trunks. His calves also inflated bigger, becoming the size of softballs and looked like they could swim for hours on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished applying the lotion on your brother, you stepped back to get a good look at what you've done. Alex had retained his height from his last growth spurt, but his body had still gotten a whole lot bigger. What was once your small and skinny kid brother a few moments ago was now a huge musclebound bodybuilder that looked like he could take on any Mr. Olympia title! Still at a little over 6 feet tall, Alex was now sporting a 300 lbs. physique that made you look puny and weak. his pecs were like steel plates jutting out of his chest. His 8 pack abs were super defined and ripped. His arms must tape at least 22 inches around, cold! His shoulders were so wide and loaded with big traps and delts. his legs were so thick, you were actually comparing their size with the size of your waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done yet?\" He asked, seemingly unaware of his sudden transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea, I am.\" You replied somewhat numbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, now I can go play!\" He turned around and began dashing off, kicking sand everywhere with his powerful legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind as racing as you tried to figure out how this was all possible. What was causing this tremendous growth in your brother? as you recalled what went on during those growth spurts, you think....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You recognize one of the taller boys from a distance because it just has to be your brother Alex. Then, right next to him, you see another man riding a surfboard. He must be almost twice as tall! Amazing! If Alex was already over six feet tall, then how big was this other guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes pass by, and you occasionally look over at the ocean before you as you lay on your towel and work on your tan. Suddenly, you spot Alex from a distance, carrying his surfboard in his muscular arms. My goodness your brother looks like a teenager now. Even worse, he can easily pass for an adult man from a distance since he\u2019s so big and tall and muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there is an even bigger guy walking next to him. Who is he? You spot the two talking, as the bigger guy is pointing at this huge villa, which is located near the end of the beach. You see an enormous building which seems so have really high ceilings and doors. Finally, Alex and the man come walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin! Hey, Justin!\u201d Alex says excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see two huge figures towering over you. The first is your brother, who seems even bigger, taller and more buff than ever. Nobody on earth would ever believe that your \u201clittle\u201d brother is still twelve years old anymore. Sheet, he looks like he\u2019s eighteen now. He\u2019s got three-hundred pounds of raw muscle and he\u2019s over six feet tall with not an ounce of fat on him. How do you say Olympic Gymnast? The only thing still giving away the fact that he\u2019s twelve years old is his face, and his squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJustin! This is George! I met him while I was surfing!\u201d Alex said, pointing at the giant man standing next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and realized that the giant wasn\u2019t even a man\u2026 He was a kid, just like Alex! But, he was over ten feet tall and he was just loaded with muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d George said, as he shook my hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge had red, curly hair and a friendly expression on his face. You could tell that he was a lot younger than he looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 How\u2026 How old are you, George?\u201d I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Oh I\u2019m thirteen! I work out with other Alpha Kids, in that big white building over there! Alex can join it once he passes ten feet in height!\u201d George explained to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his explanation sent shivers up my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an Alpha Kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! We\u2019re the future kids of America! You can only join if you\u2019re over ten feet tall! And you can tell if you\u2019ll be that tall if you have a big growth spurt during puberty and it seems like Alex is going through that right now! So, once he passes ten feet, he\u2019ll be an Alpha!\u201d he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 What do you do there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe eat special food which is very healthy and we work out and we learn how to become leaders of the future over all normal people who are smaller than us!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that cool?\u201d Alex cheered. \u201cI wanna be an Alpha Kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I gotta go! Hopefully I\u2019ll see you guys out here again tomorrow! See you guys later!\u201d George said, as he turned around and started running towards the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlpha Kids are like between ten and fifty feet tall! I can\u2019t wait! Isn\u2019t that cool, huh, Justin?\u201d Alex grinned, as he grabbed his towel and started drying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 very\u2026 cool\u2026\u201d I stuttered in disbelief. Just the thought of Alex being fifty feet tall gave me Goosebumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we go eat now? I\u2019m starving!\u201d Alex whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy. He\u2019s hungry again! Does that mean he\u2019s gonna grow even more? It might not take so long after all for Alex\u2019s wish to come true and for him to become one of the Alpha Kids\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned around and headed for the restaurant where Alex ate twice as much as I did. Good thing we put everything on my parents\u2019 account. Whew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had decided to go on a five-day cruise. Since you were on your summer vacation from school, they had asked you to stay at the beach house with Alex all week. They wired over extra cash for you to buy food and sun tan lotion at the small grocery store located down the street. Plus, there was a hotel nearby where you could go eat at, where your parents had an account. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all worked out. You go to the small shop down the street with Alex, where you buy a box of a dozen bottles of suntan lotion. At the rate that Alex is growing, you figure you\u2019ll be using two bottles just to cover that huge body of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing is, when you walked in the store, you ran into Aunt Doreen. She thought you were Alex and that Alex was Justin! After a few moments, you politely corrected her by pointing out that you were Justin and that the bigger kid standing next to you was your younger brother Alex. The only reason he was bigger and taller than you was because he had experienced a recent growth spurt. She remarked how big Alex had gotten and then she apologized for the fact that she thought that Alex was me, the older brother, much to Alex\u2019s amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, after we got up, Alex was complaining that he was starving once again. So, we went to the small restaurant in the hotel where he ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes which was their special for that day. He had four plates with pancake stacks! Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we changed and walked back out to the beach, we located our spot, we set down the umbrella and the lounge chairs and the towels, when he turned towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I can\u2019t wait to go swimming! I feel great! Time to hit the water!\u201d Alex cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You just had that big breakfast! Let the food digest for a few minutes! By the way, it\u2019s gonna get really hot and I need to put some sunscreen on you before you hit the water, so hold up!\u201d I warned him sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh! Great! I like it when you rub suntan lotion on my body!\u201d Alex said with a huge smile on his face. \u201cIt feels so good when you rub it on me and\u2026 Uhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Alex stopped talking. He closed his eyes as if he had fallen into a deep trance. He clenched his fists and he craned his head upwards with his eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex? Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\u201d you said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I\u2019m gonna grow a little bit\u2026. Uhhhhh\u2026\u201d he suddenly groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, my little brother experienced an amazing growth spurt, which happened before my very eyes! His legs suddenly grew seven inches longer, it seemed, while his muscles seemed to expand a few inches all at once! His torso grew bigger and wider at the same time, while his shoulders increased as well! His pectorals bulged a bit and his biceps seemed to add two more inches in size! Not only did he grow over a foot in height, but his muscles just increased in size, all at once! His quads increased in width by three inches at least, not to mention that his calves inflated even more, like balloons! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I looked on, I could have sworn that I saw my six-foot-tall twelve-year-old brother grow into a seven-foot-tall He-Man of a muscle-man within sixty seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRR!!!!! Was the sound of bones cracking, which came from Alex\u2019s body, while the fantastic growth spurt was taking place. And all I could do was just stand there and watch, with my jaw wide open, as I witnessed my younger brother grow before my very own eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex? Hey! ALEX!\u201d I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes, looking around like he was in a daze. Then, when he looked down, he saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Justin. THERE you are. Down there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it now dawned on you that your little brother was now looking down at you. And boy, was he TALL! It seemed like he had grown over a foot taller! He must have been over 7 feet tall by now! And a whole foot taller than you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, big guy!

Not only did his incredible muscularity frighten the daylights out of you, but these increasing growth spurts were a sign that Alex was going to be gigantic within a matter of days! Each growth spurt was more dramatic than the previous one, and they were occurring more frequently and he was growing by greater increments with each passing one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex\u2026\u201d I said in a soft tone. \u201cAre\u2026 Are you feeling alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy big little brother looked down on me with a smile on his face. It was weird having to look up to the big kid. But, in a way, I couldn\u2019t help feel proud of my little bro. Sure, he annoyed the snot out of me sometimes, but I still loved him to death. I always protected him from bullies and now it seemed like the roles were about to be reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I\u2019m feeling great!\u201d he beamed. \u201cAnd, no matter how big I get, I\u2019ll always protect you, Justin. Even if from now on, you\u2019re gonna be the little bro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks, bro!\u201d I said, as I reached down and pulled two unopened bottles of suntan lotion out of the big beach bag. \u201cLet\u2019s get you all you all rubbed in with this lotion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to splash some suntan lotion over Alex\u2019s mighty pectorals when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alex is going into hyper puberty. His body is going into overdrive, performing normal pubescent operations but in a vastly increased mode.

It's annoying, but hey, least you're the bigger, stronger one between you both, so in your mind it works out, because that's actually getting you looks, while he's still just a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrive at the snack bar and order a hotdog and a cola for yourself, and Alex orders a burger with fries and a cola as well.

He gets you some ice to put on your forehead, and as you look over him your eyes go wide. Alex is bigger. There's no doubt about it. Not to mention, he's more ripped than you've ever managed. In fact in just a few short minutes he's gone from being a scrawny kid to total beach bod stud, and now HE'S the one getting all the attention. Even as he helps you out, it's clear people are walking by multiple times just to capture glimpses of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's body is well proportioned and ripped. He's got the works, abs, pecs, biceps, shoulders, forearms, big quads, solid calves, everything, which are all the more highlighted by his natural tan. Another strong wave of dizziness hits, and you nearly pass out from it. By the time you recover enough not to feel like you wanna puke, Alex's muscles are doubled in size and still as ripped, yet it sits on his frame (which so far is not any taller, but it is wider to handle the extra bulk) perfectly, as if it is the most natural thing in the world, and to Alex, it seems like it really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third wave of dizziness hits, and...</span></div></div>",

Your first instinct is to step back, but you can't bring yourself to remove your hand from his incredible bicep. It gives off a powerful, warm feeling, and something about it seems almost\u2026 intoxicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, though, you find that if you want to keep touching your brother's arms, you'd have to stand on your tiptoes. He's already gotten nearly a foot taller than he was just a minute ago, and doesn't seem to be showing any signs of stopping. You look up, your mouth nearly quivering with a mixture of fear and astonishment. Alex is too busy enjoying the pleasurable growing sensation to notice you, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, yeah!\" he moans, as he flexes his arm and chest muscles, making his pecs dance a little on his body. \"This feels so good!\" He closes his eyes, and starts to move his tongue across his lips in a slow, sultry manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so entranced by this that you barely notice the sound of something ripping, but your attention is grabbed when Alex's board shorts finally tear off and float to the ground. This caused Alex's equally-impressive cock, now eye level with you, to burst forth from its cotton prison, slapping you in the face as it did. A strong musk fills your nostrils - one that is unique, and oddly arousing. Your own hard-on begins to press against the fabric of your pants, and you feel an intense desire to reach out and touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex notices you staring at his cock, and smiles down at you, his face looming over you in an imposing but comforting manner. \"Go ahead,\" he says, \"I know you want to as much as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to consider all this, unsure of what to do. Gulping, you finally decide to \u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were shocked as your brother's sudden second growth spurt seemed to have brought him from his small frail 12 year old body that you remembered to a hulking 12 foot behemoth of a man. But still he seemed as youthful in his expression and playful in nature as he had always been. There was something magical about that youthful boy in a massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more shocked were you that his nether regions seemed to suddenly explode out of their clothed prison, and even hit you in the face with what now seemed to be a more than impressive size for an adult man let alone a 12 year old boy! It stretched up and out in front of you slightly over 2 feet long and as thick as your lower arm! And now he was begging for you to play with him... Your amazingly hot giant brother offered himself to you. All of his 12 foot tall - and still sporadically growing body, and 2 foot boy meat. You realized that the act of growing must be a huge turn on for him, and you feel a hint of jealousy well up in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 'little' brother chuckled above you and flexed his cock in your face as your marveled over his size. \"Seemed I wasn't quite done with that spurt after all, bro!\" He gloated and rubbed his big hands across his bulging pecs while looking down at you with a pleasure-ridden expression. \"MMmmmh, and I think you now realized another one of the side effects of the project..\" He flexed his cock for emphasis making it jump and sway heavily beside your head, smearing a large drop of pre your nose as it fell across your face. \"Go on, lil bro. Touch it! You might not get a chance to reach it ever again!\" He laughed down at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled his sensual musk, and that coupled with your brothers body and advances made you grasp his member tightly. You gasp as it seemed to throb and thicken in your hands, expanding out against your palms and adding at least another two inches to his darkening length, and a large spurt of pre shoots down into your hair! \"OOOH! Mmmmmph\" Your brother moans above you and starts rubbing down his immense muscles, flexing randomly above you. \"Your hands are soooo soft, lil bro... I can't believe we haven't done this, Oooo.. Sooner! Of course I wasn't Mmm, so BIG back then. Perhaps you like my big powerful body, lil man\" he moans down to you, feeling pride in himself as he feels his body commands your respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to stroke in big powerful strokes down his throbbing length. It takes both your hands to circle around your brother's thick cock, but his copious amounts of pre running down his length and onto you, makes the surface easy to rub and stroke, and you do so with all your might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go harder!\" Your brother shouts, and you try to add all your strength to your fingers, massaging the large organ in front of you. \"HARDER!\" He starts to look down at you with a disappointed expression. Apparently your fingers were loosing grip on his moist length they were beginning to protest as it took everything you had to press into his cock. \"I suppose I have to do everything myself!\" He grunted and moved his hand from his massive chest down to his cock and wrapped it around both your hands at the same time. You gasp as his grip nearly crushes your hands against his warm sensitive flesh and he starts to stroke himself with your hands! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your arms almost being pulled off in the violent strokes up and down his length. His other hand kept running across his pecs and flexing bowling-ball-sized bicep on his stroking arm. He groaned loudly and started to tremble, as you saw his cantaloupe sized balls contract and pulse lightly, and you knew he was close. \"OOOOOH, this is going to be A BIIIIIiii -\" He started. His cock was aimed straight at your face, and since he still held your arms there was no way for you to avoid what your younger brother had coming your way. \"Fuck!\" With a moan from above you saw his cock stretch momentarily bigger before your eyes as it filled with his big load, and your face was instantly covered with musky white cream that splattered back across your brothers own body. His spurts were coming fast and furious and he unloaded so much cum over you that your entire front was soaking in his essences. His orgasm started to subside slowly and trickle down over you, and his steel grip around your sore hands loosened. You fell down into the moist sand below you, sore and soaked looking up at your young brother\u2019s huge grinning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I too much for you already, bro? I hope not! Because this is just the beginning!\" He laughed and reached down to pick you up and...</span></div></div>",

I had the same reaction when I first heard about it, but you came out FINE. If you had any problems, they would've shown in a week, and you're still you after a month, isn't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kind of sucks that you get the body of an adonis and I have to go the hard way.\" You frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, man, don't start that again.\" He says in an annoyed voice. \"I know how bullshit it is that I got rich and famous from some fluke and you didn't really have any choice in the matter, so this vacation was supposed to be my way of clearing the air. You want anything while you're here, its yours, but it's not fair to me that I should get resentment just because I got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him, his muscles standing out like a miniature statue of the Hulk covered in stretched skin. All the wealth and fitness he could want, and he doesn't even have to work for it... but deep down, you know he's right. If you'd had his windfall, you'd want people to be happy for you, too. And speaking of wind... you look around the beach, with pristine white sand and massive azure waves rolling into the crescent of the coastline. There are almost no clouds in the sky, and the scenery is beautiful, but the beach is only scarcely populated- you can see some people playing volleyball down a ways, a little kid making a sandcastle even farther in the distance, and several babes riding surfboards trying to catch the best surf, but that's it. You can't ruin a perfect day like this with a bad attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and force a smile. \"You're right, Alex. What do you want to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother returns the grin. \"That's more like it. Betcha you can't...\"</span></div></div>",

There are eight of them, four girls and four guys, and they look to be around your age. They're all deeply tanned, so you assume they come out here a lot. The girls are wearing bikinis that leave little to the imagination, and do they ever look good in them! All four are attractive, trim and well-endowed in the chest area. The guys have only got swimsuits on and it's clear they must work out a lot. Their bronzed physiques are even better than yours-- but not nearly as good as Alex's.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo!\" Alex shouts at the group. \"You got room for a couple more players?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit surprised at the confidence and assertiveness in Alex's voice as he addresses these older teens. What has happened to your shy and quiet younger sibling? Must've been replaced by this new and improved version, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looks you both over, though their gazes linger appreciably longer on Alex. You try not to let that bother you. After all, Alex is built like a freaking tank now; it's only natural that he'll draw attention, especially considering he's so young.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you!\" says a red-headed girl, pointing at your brother. \"You're that kid who tested out the Gilgamesh formula, right? You've got to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Alex admits, flashing her a smile. \"And you can see how well it worked,\" he continues cockily, hitting a most impressive double bicep flex. Instantly the teens congregate around Alex, asking him excited questions, urging him to flex some more for them, and two of the girls even asking if they could feel his muscles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex handles the attention as if he was already used to being a celebrity. He answers their questions, goes through a variety of poses which show off just how spectacular his body is, and lets both the redhead and one of the blondes feel his rock-hard, eighteen inch upper arms, which are certainly the biggest on the beach.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your patience gives out.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we going to play volleyball or what?\" you ask irritiably.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bro's right,\" Alex agrees. \"Let's get a game going!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally both sides want Alex for their team. He settles the argument by opting for the cute redhead's side. All of the players take their positions and the game begins.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt quickly becomes a frustrating experience from your perspective. You're justifiably proud of your athletic ability, but you've never really had much of a chance to play volleyball before. You're still getting the hang of it, while everyone else is an experienced player. Everyone except your brother, of course, but it turns out he doesn't need experience.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the very start Alex completely dominates the match. You thought his short height would be a big disadvantage for him, but his sculpted, muscular legs are so strong he's able to jump four feet vertically, negating that handicap. And whenever he hits the ball, it reacts like it's been shot out of a cannon.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike you, Alex has never been an athlete, so you're flabbergasted by the amazing speed and coordination he displays throughout the game. Apparently it wasn't only his muscles and strength which got a boost; from what you're seeing it looks like he's grown physically superior across the board, in every respect far above what a twelve year-old should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the score is 9-1 in favor of Alex's team. He has personally scored seven of those points, and your team's one point only came about because Kim, the redhead, got in Alex's way when he was trying to return a shot. Even though he knocked her sprawling, she apologizes profusey to him for that! In fact all of the teens on the other side of the net are treating star player Alex as if he was the team captain, gladly accepting his authority in spite of the fact that he's five years younger than they are. It makes your insides twist a bit to see how much respect and admiration they're giving your Herculean kid brother.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving that to one side, you focus on the game. Melanie, the auburn haired girl on your side, is serving. She hits the ball over the net, and the next instant Alex is there, spiking the ball viciously downward. You try to deflect it, but it's coming at you so fast and with so much force that it smashes you directly in the face. Everything goes black.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

The other guys and girls in the group were fit and attractive enough before; now, though, their bodies seem to be much more impressive. The shortest in the group, a beautiful, tan-skinned and blonde-haired girl, is an inch taller than you, while the rest are even bigger, everyone six feet tall or taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, they all seemed to have sprouted muscles from nowhere. The guys' shoulders are broadened, their arms swelled up to the size of bowling-balls, and their trunks are wrapped skin-tight around their massive tree-trunk thighs. The girls' transformation is in many ways even more impressive, Amazonian, almost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven weirder, however, is the fact that all these bigger bodies now have much younger-looking faces attached to them. Instead of being your age, like before, they now seem to be only twelve or thirteen years old, just like your brother. It's a weird disconnect, seeing so many chiseled-looking six-foot-tall kids in front of you, perhaps the weirdest thing that has happened to you so far today (definitely in the top three).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, bro,\" Alex says, and as you look at him you realize he's gone through a change as well. He's now nearly six and a half feet tall, a head above everyone else in the group. His musculature is still as impressive as before, but everything seems just all-around bigger because of the difference in height. The changes aren't just physical, either; he carries himself now with poise and confidence, and all of the others seem to be looking up to him, acting like he's the leader of the group. You can only continue to stare at your brother while he continues. \"All we did was just hang out here and chat while we waited for you to wake up. Nothing really happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you all look so different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex starts to crack a smile, and a chuckle escapes his lips. \"Different? What's different about us, Justin? You were only out for a few seconds; nothing's changed!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullshit, you think to yourself. You remember what you saw, how everyone looked during the game. These other guys and girls are supposed to be your age, and you're supposed to be among the taller ones in the group, not the shortest. Still, you realize as you examined Alex's face further, he seems to not have any trace of deception or duplicity in his face. Whatever's happening to them and to him, he seems to be completely oblivious to the changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you sure?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Alex exclaims. \"We're all part of the test group for Project Gilgamesh. Remember, Justin? We were just talking about it right before the game started.\" A couple of the others nod in agreement at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think carefully for a moment. \"I remember talking about YOU being a test subject just now, but I'm almost positive these other guys weren't.\" A sudden wave of wooziness came over you, causing you to lose your balance and fall to your knees. \"I-I swear that-- that you guys were... not this... big...\" Some of the girls come over to you with a concerned look on their faces, offering to help you up by extending their arms - their powerful, mighty, all-too-unreal arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Alex shakes his head, waving the girls away from you. \"It's okay, ladies,\" he says, \"he'll be fine. He just gets a little forgetful sometimes, leading to these dizzy spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't,\" you say as the girls shrug and go back to talking to the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you do,\" Alex chuckles. \"Remember when we drove down four hours to Six Flags, but we couldn't get in because you forgot our passes at home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" You have no idea what your brother is talking about. You don't recall ever taking a trip to any Six Flags with your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee,\" Alex scratches his head as he looks on you with concern. \"your memory IS getting pretty bad. I guess mom might need to take you back to the doctor; your condition seems to be getting worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor? you think to yourself. Condition?! None of those words sound very good. You have no interest in being poked and prodded, anyways, at least anytime soon. Slowly getting to your feet, you look back at the group of teens -- well, former teens, you guess -- only to see something that nearly sent you falling back once again.</span></div></div>",

Even their clothes are becoming different, top-pieces receding into nothing and bottoms all turning into the same identical pair of trunks. It\u2019s only when the faces start changing, though, that you understand what they\u2019re turning into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it ends, you're surrounded by nine identical Alexes. You glance around quickly- on every side, you're surrounded by indistinguishable barrel-chested pecs, on the exact same eight-pack abs. You're so shocked, you actually feel a little numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD you we couldn't use him for a tenth! You nearly knocked his brains out!\" The Alex behind you chides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Alex, the one in front of you, shrugs a pair of shoulders the width of a recliner. \"Alright, alright, so sue me- it was a bad idea. Sorry for wanting in on the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then find one of the others, there's seven more somewhere, at least one of them's probably interested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him first, and I wanted in before the game ended! I'm sorry, geez, he's my brother too y'know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Alex... W-Wuh-...What ... what just happened?\" You realize your stutter only after you announce it, and it only scares you more. Your voice breaks up the conversation and causes the entire ring of Alex titans to focus on you. You're scared, but you don't care. This is the weirdest and creepiest thing that's happened in a day full of weird and creepy things, and you want to know what's causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about, bro?\" the Alex on your right asks. You turn to face him. He was the one who used to be Kim. He's got a small grin on his face, but the arch in his eyebrows shows he's legitimately concerned about what you're talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 happened to you? What happened to everyone?\u201d The duplicates only look at you with more solemnity, but judging by the silence and the confused squints on several of their faces, you\u2019re still not making any sense. Your response comes from the Alex next to the last one to talk\u2026 you think he was one of the former male blonde-haired teenagers you were playing against. You THINK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 this is part of the Gilgamesh Project.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gil-\" You shut your eyes tight, quickly give yourself a mental slap, and resume. \"You told me the Gilgamesh project was supposed to increase muscle mass. It doesn\u2019t explain\u2026\u201d you wave your arms at everyone. \u201cThis. Ten minutes ago half of you were GIRLS, for God\u2019s sake, how do you not remember that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alexes exchange glances, then every single one of them bursts into laughter. \u201cOh, man, you really DID get brain damaged by that hit!\u201d An Alex to your left wheezes. \u201cDudes, I\u2019ll fill him in,\u201d The Alex next to that one tells him, and while he\u2019s still recovering from some deep chuckles, he grabs your arm and pulls you over to the side. It\u2019s impossible to resist- it\u2019s like your arm was tied to a motorboat while your hand was caught in a big meaty vice. He takes you over about a dozen paces away, then \u201cgently\u201d pushes you to the ground. You let out a HOOF as your breath quickly but temporarily leaves you. Alex collapses on the ground next to you in an Indian-style sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026 guess I should ask what you remember last.\u201d He says with a smile you know he\u2019s trying to control. You\u2019re getting really sick of this joke that you seem to be the only one out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you want to know what I remember last?\u201d You snap exasperatedly. \u201dLast thing I remember was me waking up on this beach you invited me to, then suddenly you have muscles the size of fucking watermelons from some miracle drug I chickened out on, then you challenged me to a game of volleyball with eight other strangers and smacked me in the head, then I wake up and everyone was a foot over their original size, then they all morphed into YOU right before my eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAlex- this Alex, at least- doesn\u2019t want to laugh this time. He looks at you serious and gives you full-focus, and when you finish, speaks with an empathetic voice. \u201cWow. Is that everything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot him a look that clearly and in no small terms wants an explanation, so he quickly follows up. \u201cAlright, alright, seen that look before. Long story short, you\u2019re not too far off. There IS a Gilgamesh Project that I signed up for, and it DID give me these muscles. What you haven\u2019t mentioned is that Gilgamesh was also a cloning project- you know, why make one super-soldier, when you can just make a dozen out of him? At times, Alexes' muscles increase in size, and at different times, every Alex multiplies into two Alexes. We're not on this island for vacation- we're here for surveillance. Neither the labs that gave Alex the shot nor the government wants us being an ethics case or Alex clones dividing out of check to the outside world, so--\" he gestures to the beach around him, his arms spanning the size of a rowboat. \"We get quarantined in paradise. They figured there would be fewer problems and complaints that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding. There's no way that's possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no less plausible than your brother going all Agent Smith and taking over a bunch of peoples\u2019 bodies. You want a different explanation for why you've got sixteen brothers roaming the island, make it on your own time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis look and voice tell you he doesn\u2019t have patience for this, and want a debate. You decide to go with it. \u201cAll right, what else did I forget?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t chicken out, mate. You went through with that project just like me. That's why you're here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. And it didn\u2019t take well in you. I can't explain everything, they told a different Alex... from what I understand, they\u2019ve isolated all the other problems, but the ultimate effect is that the medicine\u2026 well, it\u2019s playing tricks on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that supposed to mean?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCombination of mild amnesia and hallucinations. We thought you were good enough to come out until you took that head-knock. You okay, by the way?\" He asks again, in an off-handed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about everything you've seen today. You take a look at this Alex- everything from his calming smile to his impossible godly physique which goes right down to his toes- then look behind him to the group resuming their volleyball game. Your brother.. your little big scrawny burly only brother brothers... separate and regroup their teams on either side of the net. Every single one is a carbon copy of the one next to him, and a paragon of muscle. One Alex jumps into the air vertically, his bowling-ball calves propelling him up seven, eight feet, and he responds an impossible pop serve with a crushing nuke from his glistening triceps back to the opposing side. You can't even keep up with the ball as it moves so fast, being battered right and left by eight different lightly-tanned colossi <i>that are all your little brother.</i> You shake your head. The universe shifted its status quo several times today already, but this one calls for a timeout. \"I think I just need some time to digest this, Alex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods once, then pushes himself to a standing position. He pulls you up as well. He's only a handful of inches taller than you, but his muscles make him look like its several feet instead. Again his hands seem to smother yours in their grip. You grimace nervously. \"You've acted like this before, so it'll probably help to say that you'll get through this.. though I have to admit, I don't think anyone was expecting to be called a girl,\" he chuckles. \"In the meantime, I'll take you to the bungalows. Grab a cot, rest, talk to mom, get this out.\" You look again at the volleyball court as cheers from one side combine with cries of disappointment from the other- someone must have scored. The chorus's pitch is almost one single note. Two Alexes high-five one another and switch places, and it's like nothing ever happened. Why is that so <i>natural</i> for him/them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, every single Alex there starts shaking, their bodies in spasms. Instead of being surprised or shocked, they all start letting out whoops of excitement. You can feel the ripples in your hand, as well- the same one that's still in your escort Alex's oversized fist. You look into his face to see him beaming, eyes wide with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna have to belay that a sec, looks like we got another one coming!\" The Alex next to you says in an excited voice as he visibly shaking. Your stomach drops as you look at him vibrating, and you silently voice \u201cOh, God, not again\u201d in your head\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before your eyes the trembling Alexes scattered across the beach become indistinguishable blurs which expand outward to around ten feet across.  Gradually the indistinct images resolve themselves into two separate Alexes each.  Where once there were eight Alexes playing volleyball, now there are sixteen.  Two stand directly in front of you, one still holding your wrist in a viselike grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll take good care of our little bro?\" the other Alex asks the one holding you, neither of them displaying any reaction to what has just occurred.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet, Alex!\" the other replies enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my man!\" he replies, clapping the beaming Alex on one incredibly broad shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stand there, numbly watching the two indistinguishable Alexes converse.  Wait a minute-they're not quite indistinguishable after all.  The Alex who spoke first looks to be about an inch taller than the second one.  And the black swim trunks they're wearing each have a different number sewn on in red thread: a \"1\" for the bigger Alex and a \"14\" for the \"smaller\" one (relatively speaking).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Fourteen will look out for you, bro,\" the larger giant reassures you.  \"Just ask him for anything you need. See you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Fourteen takes that as his cue to head for the cabins you see in the distance, beyond the shimmering white sand, dragging you along effortlessly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, wait a minute!\" you protest, trying in vain to stop him; you might as well be trying to stop a freight train.  \"I want some answers!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alex halts and turns back toward you, seeming to check a sigh as he does so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to know now?\" he asks with what you suspect is forced patience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did all of you just divide into two like that?  I KNOW that's not biologically possible!\" you insist hotly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Divide in two?\" he asks you with a blank look on his face, as if he has no idea what you're talking about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it, he must know what you mean!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just told me a minute ago that sometimes Alexes multiply into two and that's what I just saw happen to all of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfuriatingly this Alex bursts into laughter again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you are a trip!  You really thought we could split in two?  Like amobeas or something?\" he asks with a grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me you could!  I saw it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dude,\" he says.  \"You didn't, because it didn't happen.  The only way more Alexes can be made is through blood transfusions and that takes at least a month; I should know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  What story are they trying to tell you now?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know what's going on!\" you say in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the Alex does sigh.  \"Okay, one more time.  Doe the words \"Project Gilgamesh\" mean anything to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  That's how you said the original Alex got to be so big and so mucular.  Then they created you clones.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" he corrects you.  \"Project Gilgamesh is what made Alex into such a superboy, but the treatment didn't work on anyone else they tried it on.  It even caused some nasty side-effects, like the amneisa and halluciantions you're got.  The scientists kept testing Alex, trying to figure out why he was the only success, and eventually they discovered the effect the treatment had on his blood.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how viruses changes your cells to produce more viruses?\"  You nod.  \"Well, after the treatment the DNA in Alex's blood became kind of like that.  Only instead of rewiring cells to make more viruses, it overwrites the hosts' genetic code, replacing it with Alex's.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head spins as you try to wrap your mind around the concept.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying-you're saying if enough of Alex's blood is injected into someone that person actually becomes a copy of Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" he answers.  \"Alex is blood type O negative, so he's a universal donor.  The transformation doesn't happen all at once,of course; it takes a coupla months and it's pretty painful.  But it's way more than worth it!\" he insists with relish, letting go of your wrist to hit a sanity-shatteing double flex which shows off biceps the size of basketballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were you before?\" you ask quietly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother's handsome face darkens.  \"My name used to be Matt Hendricks.  Some of our parents still like to call us by our old names, but we all prefer to be called Alex now,\" he explains stiffly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One through fourteen?\" you ask bemusedly, gesturing at his swimsuit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original through thirty-two,\" he corrects you, shrugging his barn-door wide shoulders.  \"We needed some way to distinguish between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you do this?\" you ask.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the towering, massively muscle-bound Alex looks visibly angry and you instinctively cringe back in fear of his wrath, knowing this six foot six Greek god could snap you in two like a twig.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" he snarls.  \"Who WOULDN'T want to be like Alex?  Who wouldn't love to become an identical twin to the biggest and strongest twelve year-old in the world?  And that's just if you used to be normal!  Before I receieved Alex's blood I was a quadraplegic!  I'd been stuck in that wheelchair, my arms and legs useless, since the age of six!  Then the government approached my parents and I, with a testing procedure they said could cure me.  They told me what would happen and I was <i>glad</i>.  Being cured would have been miracle enough, but what I got was so much better:  I was remade in Alex's image!     Mom and Dad can keep calling me Matt if it makes them feel better, but Matt Hendricks is dead.  I'm Alex Fourteen, and I wouldn't trade that for the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth, then close it, having no idea how to respond to to such sincere, hearfelt passion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" the dark-haired titan urges you, taking your wrist in another unbreakable grip.  \"Alex wants you to lie down in your bungalow.  The hallucinations and amnesia do seem to be pretty bad today, so it's best if you take a rest, little brother.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you calling me that?\" you ask irritiably, focusing on the irrelevancy.  \"I'm five years older than Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're older; so what?\" Alex Fourteen asks dismissively.  \"It's pretty obvious Alex is the big brother now!  And since we're genetically identical to Alex, you're our little brother too,\" he points out smugly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're fuming at that when you hear a shout from the water's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alex Six killed a shark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately all the other Alexes on the beach start racing toward the one who spoke at blinding speed, all except Alex Fourteen.  A large part of you wants to ignore this latest insanity and simply go to sleep, but the pull of your curiousity proves to be too much for you.  When Alex Fourteen frowns down at you, you have your agrument ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex said to ask you for whatever I need, and I need to see what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly he lets you go and you run down to the the circle of surrounding Alex Six.  He's come out of the water dragging what you think is a great white shark by the fin, only it's lower jaw has been completely torn away from its body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of water gleam in the sulight on Alex Six's sculpted, medicine ball-sized pecs as he excitedly describes what happend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the fin coming toward me, so I went undewater and when it tried to chomp me I grabbed it its lower jaw and rippped it right off!  It was easy!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go, dude!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, man!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the original Alex steps forward and the rest immediately fall into respectful silence, staring at him in rapt attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Alex Six,\" he states and the shark-killer preens in pleasure.  \"Just goes to prove there's nothing in nature stronger or deadlier than an Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of assent greets his statement and you can almost feel the camraderie, the sense of fellowship between these gargantuan Goliaths.  It's clear that their bond with each other supercedes any other relationship in their lives.  You remember what Alex Fourteen said about how he wouldn't trade being an Alex for the world, and you can see the same feeling mirrored on every identical face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you understand the quarantine and you wonder fearfully if even the government truly understands what they've created here.           <br>\r\n                                           <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Go!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off at once, running hard for kid's castle.  Alex might be stronger than you (an impossible concept which is going to be blowing your mind for months to come), but your longer legs give you a substantial advantage in a race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're running flat-out,  doing a good job of controlling your breathing, when you catch sight of something in your peripheral vision on your right.  It's Alex!  He accelerates to your side and looks over at you, grinning.  With an effort you increase your pace, but in spite of this Alex actually pulls ahead of you!  In a second you're staring at his sculpted, beautifully defined back muscles as he sprints forward like a rocket, steadily widening the gap between the two of you.  You pour on eveything you have left, only to see Alex outdistance you even more.  Damn it, how can such a short kid be so <u>fast</u>?!?!        <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is shooting past the volleyball players like a Polaris missile now while you trail far behind in his wake.  They actually pause their game to stare and a couple of the girls giggle as their gazes shift between you and your little brother.  Your face reddens in embarassment and you try without sucess to gain ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex beats you to the goal by a good hundred feet.  When you finallly arrive, panting, you find him standing there with his hands on his hips and a big smile on his face.  He isn't even out of breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toldja you couldn't do it,\" he reminds you smugly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have the air to frame a reply to that and the little six year-old sitting and building the castle interjects into the silence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Superboy?\" he ask, looking up at Alex with wide eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do manage a snort of contempt at this.  Although you've gotta admit, aside from the fact that Alex's black hair is curly instead of straight, he does indeed resemble the famous comic book character.  Except, of course, he's much more muscular than Superboy has ever been portrayed as being.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Alex playfully tells the enthralled munchkin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where's your costume?\" the child asks curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it at home so I could get some sun,\" your younger brother explains and the kid nods in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can crush my sand castle if you want,\" the boy offers shyly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex accepts the invitation, smashing the sand structure with two stomps.  The little boy responds by dropping his head and kissing the tanned feet that crushed his castle.  Then he scrambles up and runs off down the beach.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nYou're inexplicably disturbed by the scene; something about it troubles you in a way you can't quite understand.  So when Alex looks to you with a laugh and says, \"Kids!\", your reply is a sour one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still a kid too,\" you remind him snidely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression of good-natured mirth leaves your sibling's face.  He takes a step toward you and you have to fight not to retreat before him.  With his amazing physique Alex is truly intimidating now, much more so than even the biggest jock in your high school.  And from the look of him he's probably way stronger than any high school althelete could ever hope to be.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring up at you Alex flexes his very deep chest and then begins to smoothly bounce his soccer ball-sized pecs.  \"You really think I'm still a kid?\" he asks quietly and you have no answer for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you're spared the necessity of giving one as the guys and girls from the volleyball game crowd around, focusing on Alex and ignoring you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Alex King, aren't you?\" the red-headed girl aks excitedly.  \"The most successful test subject from the Gilgamesh project?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me!\" your brother confirms cockily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited babble breaks loose among the teens and suddenly they all seem to have questions for your little stud sibling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is the treatment going to be available to the public?\" a six foot two blond who looks like a weight-lifter demands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be available by December,\" Alex assures him.  \"It'll make the perfect Christmas gift . . . if you have someone you want to spend a million and a half dollars on!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million point five?  That's how much the treatment is going to cost?  And Alex got ten million from them just to take it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of money, how much have you made since you took the treatment?\" another boy asks.  \"Didn't you get stock options as part of the promotional deal?  And Dad says Atlas' stock has split five times!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shrugs his exceedingly broad shoulders and tries to look modest.  \"Between the stock, the endorsements, and everything else . . . well, let's just say that after the first hundred million you kind of stop counting.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way!  Your little brother can't be that rich!  Can he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the government developed the treatment,\" a blond girl asks in confusion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a government researcher who made the intial breakthrough,\" Alex corrects. \"The development of the program, though, was done through a public-private partnership with Atlas Pharmaceuticals.  They provided most of the capital and they get the distribution rights.  With the budget crisis the government couldn't afford to spend the money to build these cannons!\" Alex shouts, proudly flexing his massive, eighteen inch biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ripple of ooohs and aaahhs pass through the group and even you can't deny how absolutely magnificent Alex appears, like a bronzed, preteen Hercules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how strong are you?\" the redhead whispers, rolling her shoulder seductively.  For frick's sake, she's flirting with a twelve year-old!  He won't even understand that she's coming on to him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I show you?\" Alex asks slyly.  He cups her bottom in his left hand and effortlessly lifts it up to his eye-level.  Then he does the same with his right hand and the hotter blond.  Both girls squeal and run their hands across Alex's bulging arm muscles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only shake your head in disbelief, overwhelmed by the utterly insane turn your life has taken. The puny little brother you picked on all of these years has become a world famous, incredibly wealthy mega-hunk, holding up and two of the hottest girls you've ever seen in each of his powerful hands.  Could things possibly get any crazier?        </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes of oohing and ahhing over your brother, the teens all said goodbye and headed off down the beach. Waving at them, Alex turned to you and smiled. \"Now I understand why you always used to work out. It sure is nice to get some attention like that every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him, nearly dumbfounded. \"Once in a while? How often has this happened? For that matter, how long have you been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs and shakes his head. \"Geez, Justin, where have you been? The Gilgamesh project has been going on for over a year now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do some quick, simple math in your head. \"You mean, you've been like this since you were eleven? That can't be true! I've seen you in the past year, and you were no bigger than an average kid your age. A little on the small side, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex places his thick arm around your shoulder and pulls you closer to him. \"Don't go jumping too far ahead now, bro. You're right, it took a while for any of the effects to become noticeable. But about six months ago -- BAM! Once these babies started, there was no stopping them.\" He took the arm on the opposite side from you, flexed the bicep, and gave it a quick kiss of admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months?!\" You try to think back. Surely you've seen Alex within that time frame -- though as you try to remember, you find that details from the last half a year have become very hazy in your memory. You remember celebrating Alex's 11th birthday last June, then the rest of the school year -- but everything since the beginning of this calendar year seems to be missing in details. Could it really be true? If so, was the chunks of your memory that seemed to be missing related somehow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on.\" Alex stops walking, his hand holding your shoulder firmly, stopping you as well. You turn and look at him, and he seems to have a somewhat queasy look on his face, his hand holding his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of brotherly concern washes over you. \"Alex, are you okay?\" You secretly hope that he's not about to blow chunks or something all over the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" he says, but the weakness in his voice does nothing to quell your worries. \"This has happened before. It's actually a good--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops mid-sentence, his body suddenly jerking straight up, his arms suddenly being held outward, as if being forced by some invisible presence, either internal or external, you're not sure which. As you stare at him dumbfounded, you are shocked to see Alex suddenly start to grow. His body expands both upward and outward, his short-but-powerful frame stretching into an impressive, imposing figure. His muscles on his chest and arms get even bigger, adding onto what already could be considered super-human physique. Your eyes involuntarily travel down to his feet, which have seemingly ditched the sandals he was wearing earlier and are now bare, and much larger than yours you notice, even factoring in his larger height, which now is greater than even yours. Looking back up at his face, you notice that it seems to be developing a little as well, giving Alex the appearance of being slightly older - not quite your age yet, but nonetheless a young teenage god, instead of the preteen hunk he had been before. During this entire transformation, you begin to pick up that Alex is moaning slightly, a monotone, low-pitched sound coming from his throat. You aren't sure whether that's a sign of pleasure, pain, or something in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed to be a lifetime, the transformation stopped. Alex's body seemed to slump over a bit, his shoulder's sagging, and his head turned down. You rush up to him, momentarily taken aback by how intimidating he is up close, especially now that you have to look up to him, as he rises above you by a couple of head-lengths. But he's still your brother, goddammit, and if he looks like he's in trouble, you're going to do whatever it takes to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" you exclaim. \"Are you all right?! What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh\u2026\" he is still moaning, his eyes not having opened up yet. He seems to be teetering a little, swaying back and forth, but manages to keep his balance. \"That was\u2026\" he pauses, trying to find the right word. \"\u2026a lot different than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't quite know what to say yet, so you remain silent as you make sure Alex doesn't need any medical attention. He eventually opens his eyes and looks down at you. His eyes seem to softly light up when he sees your concern, and a half-smile forms on his face. \"Thanks, Justin,\" he says, his voice powerful, but you can tell it's still a fraction of what it could be with his current size and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he begins to regain his composure, he begins to look down at his body, and he seems to be as surprised as you by how he has transformed. \"Whoa\u2026\" his voice trails off as he looks at both his front and backside, his large hands running across the swimming trunks that had stretched out completely and were on the verge of breaking and leaving him naked. \"This is way more than anything that's happened before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you nod in agreement. \"Not only are you more muscular, you're taller and older-looking too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Alex still is in shock, but he seems to be gradually becoming excited about what happened. \"I haven't taken part in any of the Gilgamesh treatment for over a month. I wonder why this is suddenly starting to happen now\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex contemplates this for a moment, and you step back, glad that your brother is okay. You don't have too long to stay relieved, however, as after a minute, something unexpected happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the approaching figure draws closer any doubts you might have had about him being another Gilgamesh test subject disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks a couple inches shorter than your now seven foot-tall \"little brother\", but his utterly amazing physique is every bit the equal of Alex's.  He's deeply tanned all over, which you can tell because he's only wearing a red swimsuit strained to the breaking point.  Even to another guy his face is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, boasting the absolutely flawless features of a sixteen year-old Greek god.  Completing his striking good looks are a pair of stunning azure eyes and long, flowing golden-blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis real-life Apollo skids to a stop in front of you and Alex and his expression breaks into a dazzling smile, which Alex immediately returns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troy!  What are you doing here?\" Alex asks in obvious delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed my best bud.  Besides, what's the point of having your own private jet if you don't use it?\" the blond behemoth asks, shrugging his barn-door wide shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, Troy?  <i>Troy Samson</i>?!?!  No way, that's impossible!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy has been Alex's best friend since they met in the first grade.  The little pain in the neck has always mouthed off to you and never hesitated to get in your way when it was time for you to teach Alex a lesson.  Consequently you ended up having to teach Troy a few things too.  You never hurt him much, just enough to show him who was boss, but he never seemed to learn.  Now the idea that the immensely muscular titan towering over is really Troy is enough to send a shiver of fear up your spine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've had a growth spurt too,\" Troy says to Alex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it just happened, man!  I can't figure it out; why now?  We've completed the program already!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did say we'd keep getting bigger and stronger,\" Troy points out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but not like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you complaining?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not!  You know me better than that!  I'd like to understand what's going on, though.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two bronzed, mega-buff colossi converse you stand there quietly, utterly ignored by each of them.  What's worse is that you can't even muster up any indignation over your treatment; you're far too intimidated by the hulking He-Men looming above you.  Not even in your wildest nightmares did you imagine that Alex and Troy would ever become so superior to you.  You feel like a frigging little kid compared to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brief period of being overlooked ends soon comes to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on is that we've gotten even more awesome than we already were!\" Troy proclaims.  \"Now you're really this shrimp's BIG brother,\" he sneers, taking a step forward and arrogantly flexing his sculpted, beach-ball sized pecs in your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, trying not to visibly tremble.  The thought of what the now-supremely mighty Troy could do to you with a mere flick of a finger terrifies you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Troy!' Alex chides his friend, grabbing a shoulder the size of a watermelon.  \"You agreed to lay off Justin, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all the times he bullied us?\" Troy snorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you've already gotten him back enough?  You've beaten him up every time you came over to our house for the last six months!  Heck, you even made him lick your shoes last time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  Talk about disgusting!  Not to mention humiliating.  Have you really spent the last half year as this enhanced twelve year-old's helpless punching bag?  If only you could remember!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy can't you?  If you refused the treatment then what could possibly be causing these gaps in your recollection?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are questions you should be devoting more attention to, but at the moment you're too upset over what you've heard to think clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let him do that to me?\" you demand of Alex, your outrage overwhelming your fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Troy's right, Justin; you did pick on us a lot before we got way too strong for you.  Then you became the victim and we got to be the bullies.  Payback's a bitch, bro.  Anyway, we didn't really hurt you, not like we could have.  After the last time I did talk to Troy for you and he agreed to let up, didn't you, Troy?\" Alex asks warningly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Troy scowls.  \"Wait, why're you guys acting like all this is news to Justin?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been  having some trouble remembering,\" Alex admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he doesn't remember what I did to him . . . \" Troy starts menacingly, a cruel sparkle in his cerulean eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Alex intones.  \"Enought fighting!  Why don't we . . .     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>WHAT did he say to you?!? Looks like this experimental treatment has made your little brother too big for his britches. It's time to remind the overgrown runt who's really in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, twerp,\" you warn him, taking a quick glance around to make sure Mom and Dad aren't in sight. \"Don't forget, I can still pound you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of backing down Alex only smirks up at you confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think so . . . wimp?\" he asks daringly. Placing a hand on your chest he shoves you with unbelievable force and you go flying backwards, hitting the sand hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that's it! You tried to be nice, but now he's gone too far! In spite of his great new build and obvious physical power, Alex is still only twelve years old and more than a head shorter than you. You're gonna teach him why that means he shouldn't mess with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling up, you charge toward your cocky sibling, who simply stands waiting for you, his hands on his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to leave any bruises for your parents to see, so a gut-shot is probably the way to go. You fire your right fist at Alex's carved, sculpted eight-pack and the doofus doesn't even try to block! In a fraction of a second your clenched hand slams into its target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYYYEEEEAAAAHHHH! Oh, geez, that hurts! It feels like you punched solid stone! How on Earth can Alex's abs be so hard? His infuriating smile didn't even waver when you hit him! Now, though, it does seem to have a sly tilt to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot, didn't you?\" he teases. \"All of my cells are sixteen times denser than a normal human's; that's part of what makes my muscles so strong. Want to see exactly how strong they are?\" he asks threateningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have a chance to answer before Alex winds up and punches you in the stomach in return. What feels like a miniature sledgehammer impacts directly on your torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought your hand hurt, but that's nothing compared to the supernova of pain that explodes through you now. You collapse instantly, hugging your midsection, and vomit. You actually wonder if you might have thrown up any of your internal organs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you simply writhe there, head twisted away and trying not to cry. Then a shower of sands sprays across your face. Blinking away the stinging particles that landed in your eye, you look up to see Alex's tanned right foot kick some more sand toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, wuss!\" the dark-haired, muscle-bound preteen taunts. \"Is that all you got? I only used about a quarter of my power on that punch!\" he brags, flexing a rippling, softball-sized bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant pure rage overwhelms your pain. You're lying here while your little brother trash-talks you and kicks sand in your face, as if he's some buff beach bully and you're the ninety-eight pound weakling he's picking on. That's not how things are, damn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Alex's cells are so dense, then you just need to hit him in a more sensitive place. You bet a punch to the eye would work. It would also show up pretty clearly, but you're past caring about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, plainfully, you rise up and without a word strike at Alex's face. Like lightning he ducks your punch. You swing with your left hand and he dodges once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe retreats before you, exceptionally lithe and sure-footed in the shifting sand, while you miss him again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My speed and reflexes were improved too,\" Alex observes lightly, still wearing that maddeningly arrogant smirk. Frustrated you throw yet another punch at him and this time Alex catches your fist in his left hand, stopping it effortlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pull your hand back, but you can't come close to breaking Alex's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your still don't get it, do you?\" Alex asks, shaking his head in seeming disappointment. \"Project Gilgamesh was a MILITARY project, moron! The attribute enhancement procedure was designed to create the ultimate super-soldier. You know, like Captain America in the comics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cease struggling as the terrifying implications of that statement sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The formula was a total failure with you, but with me they succeeded way beyond their wildest dreams. You're looking at a real life superboy, bro! I can bench press over two tons, run the mile in three minutes and seven seconds, and hold my breath for fifteen minutes. My vision is better than twenty-twenty and I've taken a baseball-bat-hit across the chest without it even leaving a mark.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen to Alex boast in stunned silence, praying that he's lying. Except . . . you don't think he is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of pain from your trapped hand brings you back to reality; Alex has begun to squeeze. Frantically you work to win free, ineffectually prying at Alex's iron fingers with your free hand. Soon the pain gets so bad that you drop to your knees before him, bringing you below his eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, don't! Please!\" you beg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he stops squeezing, though he doesn't lessen the pressure on your trapped hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better, bro,\" Alex says condescendingly. \"This isn't the first time you've ended up kneeling before me, if you could only remember. Once I started changing I stopped taking your crap. You might be older and taller than me, but I'm definitely the big brother now! So who's your boss, weakling?\" your kid brother asks you with a sneer.</span></div></div>",

Taking deep breaths seems to help, as you try to think a way to turn things around. But almost instantly you realize there is no way you can fight Alex or escape from him, not anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, and hesitantly lift your head, ready to do what you never thought you would do. As you do so, you look at Alex's body, starting with his legs. Just his legs were easily thicker than your arms, and were covered in veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at his thighs, which were even bigger and also covered in veins. The muscles seemed to compete for space with each other, and you could tell that Alex's thighs were probably rubbing constantly against each other whenever he walked, because of their massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then looked at your brother's swimming trunks, gazing at the shape of something huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up, you look at his abs. He has eight, and you can see that soon it will be ten. There is a narrow valley between them, around one or two inches deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest was also very impressive. Two massive slabs of muscle, each of them at least twice as thick as your own. His shoulders looked like cannonballs and his arms were at least as thick as your thighs, if not more. His back was wider than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, his whole body, now that you looked at it a second time and more attentively, was incredibly ripped and muscular, and if Alex suddenly became as tall as you, while keeping the same proportions, you had no doubt that every muscle would be three times bigger than yours, and a few dozen times stronger, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour observations are cut short by your brother's voice. \"Well? Don't you have something to say yet?\" Alex asks, as he lifts you up, so that you're eye level with him. The smile on his face was almost innocent, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the side, and sigh. \"You,\" is the almost silent answer you give, while trying to focus on anything away from Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me what?\" He asks, waiting for clarification, and putting his ear almost in front of you, his free hand cupping it, mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my boss,\" you mutter, not wanting to admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that wasn't so hard, now was it?\" He says cheerfully, while letting you free and dropping you to the ground. You rub your hands, the pain almost gone. Although it hurt a lot just a minute ago, now you could almost ignore it. Your lower chest area and your upper row of abs still hurt quite a bit, though, but you bear it, feeling humiliated enough and not wanting to show more weakness than you already have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, a bit unsteadily. Your brother looks at you, before...</span></div></div>",

Alex looked at you for a moment before smirking and picking you up in his arms. \"Hey!\" you protest, powerless. Alex just keeps smirking and says \"You looked a little worse for the wear, so I think we could just go back. I'll take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Let me go, Alex!\" You struggle, but your efforts are futile. Soon, you feel one of his arms wrapping around your legs, stopping them. The other arm wraps around your back and grabs one of your arms, stopping it. Your other arm is trapped between your own body and Alex's strong chest, unable to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! And I'll carry you all the way! So get used to it. Or do I have to make you?\" He says, nonchalant. You gulp, and anything you were going to say dies in your throat. Closing your eyes, you remain still, cold fear running through your spine. \"Thought so\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts walking, and you ask \"I-I thought you wanted to go to the snack bar.\" You want to hit your head against a wall for stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but since someone decided to get hurt, we're going back to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember that either? We're staying on a really nice house, just a couple yards away from the beach. We're alone, but we've got food and everything else, so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mom and Dad are not here, and no one else is around? What about the snack bar?\" You didn't like the idea of being alone with Alex, considering he could easily beat you up all day if he wanted payback for anything else you may have done to him. Alex was normally a very sweet and kind boy, a bit annoying perhaps, like most kids his age, but having all that strength and power over you could end up making him... well, not so sweet. You shiver a bit at the idea of Alex being a total jerk to you. That felt horribly wrong, even without the fact that Alex was now strong enough to lift a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you scared of being alone with your little brother?\" Alex giggles at his own question, before answering \"Nobody else is around, and the snack bar is a bit far from here.\" He stops and you look at the house in front of you both. It was really big, at least five hundred square yards. It looked more like a beach resort than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is.\" Alex resumes walking and enters the place through a glass panel door, opening with his foot. Inside it was really spacious, since there wasn't a lot of furniture, so it didn't feel cluttered. The walls were painted a slightly beige color. There were a couple couches around a coffee table on one side of the room, a dining table on the other. You didn't get to see anything else as Alex kept walking, entering a hallway and then one of the rooms on the right. There was a single king sized bed at the end of the room, near a large glass door that lead to a garden, a nightstand on each side of the bed, a walk-in closet, and a desk with a chair opposite of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I remember all this?\" You can't help but ask yourself. Before Alex says anything, you point a finger at him and say \"Don't answer.\" He just pouts, going straight to the bed, and lays you there. You decide to ignore the fact that Alex just treated you like a little kid and start thinking about everything that happened in the last few minutes, feeling mind-blown. You don't even bother with your brother sitting besides you, his heavy, muscular body making the mattress groan a bit, until he starts poking your cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask, feeling a bit annoyed by the poking, but not showing it, just in case Alex decided to punish you for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" He asks, a little worried. That surprises you a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt still?\" He must be talking about the punch he gave you earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as much anymore\" you say before touching your chest, and feeling the area flare up in pain. \"Ow!\" You yelp and stop paying attention to Alex, who feels a little guilty, \"I guess it still does.\" You mutter to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Surprised, you look at Alex, who looks a little ashamed. You can tell that he's still a really kind and sweet kid, and you feel a bit stupid for thinking that he would ever change just for having giant muscles harder than steel and much more strength than any other man on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. I was kinda being an idiot.\" You tell him, your eyes looking anywhere but where your brother is. It was true, and all because you couldn't accept the fact that now your younger brother was physically superior to you in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel his powerful arms wrap around you, an inescapable grip that feels oddly comforting, while avoiding any contact where he hit you before. \"I'll try to be more gentle with you from now on. I just forgot that now you're really fragile compared to me,\" he says. You looked at him with annoyance this time. \"I'm not made of glass, bro.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles at you playfully, says \"I don't think so!\" and gives you a noogie. You try to escape, but you can't. \"Okay, stop, stop, stop!\" You plead, laughing a bit. He does as you ask, laughing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the laugh subsides, you look at him, serious. \"I know that I can't ever compare to you in anything physical, not anymore, but you are still my brother. If you ever need anything from me, I'm here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you, then hugs you, carefully. Still, you can tell how easily he could crush your body to paste, if he ever wanted. You put your arms around him, and pat his back. He releases you and stands up. \"Thanks, Justin.\" He rubs his neck, feeling a little awkward. You watch the huge mound of muscle your brother calls a bicep and you can't help but gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... since we are not going to the snack bar, wanna make some food? Gotta feed those muscles of yours,\" you say, trying to take your eyes off your brother's arm, only to look at the rest of his godlike body. Alex, though, just happily drags you to the kitchen, his iron grip on your wrist gentle but firm and unbreakable.</span></div></div>",

You just watched your younger brother eat (if it could be called that) more food in one hour than you could handle in a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother looks at you, smiling. \u201cThat was so tasty! You really are the best, bro!\u201d He says, rubbing his abs. Since he was not wearing anything besides his swimming trunks, you could see that his stomach, full of so much food, barely changed the shape of his belly, looking almost as ripped and muscular as earlier in the day, as if he hadn\u2019t eaten as much as he did. You can\u2019t help but voice your thoughts aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother smirks. \u201cThat\u2019s cuz all of my muscles are much stronger and harder, and same with my organs. If I wanted, I could swallow bones, and they\u2019d be crushed to pieces. So, I can eat a lot and the food just gets compressed while it\u2019s being digested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s insane\u201d is the only thing that comes out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat both of you didn\u2019t know was that Alex\u2019s gastric acids were now so strong that they could dissolve metal, and the only thing strong enough to handle them was Alex\u2019s own flesh. In addition, he absorbed a lot more stuff from what he ate and his digestive system worked a lot faster, so it was easier for him to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just chuckles and stands up. The top of his head still doesn\u2019t reach above your chest, but knowing he\u2019s still a lot stronger than you makes you feel slightly intimidated when he approaches you. He looks at your chest and touches it, making you feel a bit of pain, but nowhere near what you felt a couple hours ago. Still, you <br>\r\nwince a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly retracts his hand, muttering \u201csorry\u201d and looking guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d you say. He still looks at your chest with worry, and you can\u2019t help but smile, feeling happy that your brother really cares about you, even if he was a little too rough with you. \u201cI\u2019m feeling tired so I\u2019m going to sleep in a bit, you want to stay up?\u201d You ask. You didn\u2019t feel really tired, not physically, but you wanted to go to bed and let your mind process everything that happened. Maybe try to jog your memory too, see if you could remember anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m going to sleep too.\u201d He says, letting out a yawn, while you stand up and take the dishes to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK. I\u2019ll take care of this, you go to- wait, where do you sleep?\u201d You ask, since you have only seen one bedroom, and while the bed in your room is big enough, you don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to share it. Alex tends to be a bit... clingy, during his sleep. He grabs his pillow, his blankets, anything within reach while he sleeps. Before, that wasn\u2019t a problem. You even had thought it was cute the few times he had nightmares and came to your bedroom asking if he could sleep with you and ended up burying his head in your chest. Now, his bare hands were stronger than your whole body. You are not going to risk being crushed in Alex\u2019s arms during your sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there is another bedroom, right in front of yours. That\u2019s where I sleep.\u201d He answers, while you wash the dishes. Your parents both worked all day since Alex entered elementary school, so you learned early on how to do some basic house chores and didn\u2019t feel any kind of shame for doing them, unlike some of your school friends, who thought they were \u2018a woman\u2019s job\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll see you in the morning, then.\u201d You wish him good night as Alex leaves, a slightly muffled yawn escaping him as he goes to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you\u2019re left alone, you think back to everything that happened since morning. Still hard to believe, yet very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as you try to focus on your chores, the memory of Alex\u2019s muscles pressed against your body, their impossible size and definition, and the ridiculous strength he had, has you growing a boner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last plate is clean and immediately you go to your room and close the door. Thankful that Alex had already gone to asleep, you can\u2019t help but look down at the tent that had built. Just about to take care of the problem, you stop immediately and remind yourself that Alex is your brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you slip into the hallway, looking for the bathroom. Taking a cold shower seems like a good idea to get rid of your troubles. You stop, looking into Alex\u2019s room and see\u2026</span></div></div>",

It sends a feeling of dread so deep down your body that you feel like you want to melt into the sands of the beach and never come back out ever again. He walks behind you and lifts you up with one hand, then wraps his other arm around your neck, squeezing and flexing his muscles in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to say this one last time.\" he emphasizes with more of a squeeze around your neck. \"I've been patient. I've been playing it nice. But this...this jealousy bullshit you keep spouting, is gonna stop one way or the other today. I get it, you hate that I have all the power between us and you have nothing.

There's no emotion in his voice, no giveaways that might make him look like he's joking. He means it...Alex, your brother, will end your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The military will make sure I don't get prosecuted, I'm too valuable. You on the other hand, aren't. Like I said I've been patient, more patient than you probably deserved, 'big' brother. If you don't stop this bullshit, I'll put you down and out of everyone's misery, including your own, because I've heard nothing but whining and bitching from you since this all started, and everyone's sick of it, especially me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he said all of this, you were barely conscious, he was squeezing 'just' hard enough to not make you pass out or hurt you, but it was hard keeping your mind aware enough to really do much of anything, and he knew it too, it was clear he was used to putting you in such a position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is your last chance, I won't do it now, but if you do this shit one more time, that's it, you're dead meat, so I recommend you take some time to cool down, sort your crap out, and get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally drops you at this point, but follows it up by knocking you down and pinning you there underfoot for a few minutes, with your coughing and wheezing into the sand from nearly passing out before.

Who\u2019s the big brother now?\u201d he says demanding you to submit.  You close your eyes and clench your teeth but it doesn\u2019t lessen the pain.  You feel you\u2019re either seconds away from finally submitting to your brother\u2019s dominant strength or your arm snapping, when suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Beep Beep</b></font>* You suddenly hear a loud car horn coming from the beach\u2019s edge. Both of you turn your heads towards the noise and thankfully Alex lessens his grip a bit.  A huge car is parked at the beach\u2019s parking lot, and two figures get out. It\u2019s your mom and dad! But you\u2019ve never seen that car before, and why would they even need a car that big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex leave your brother alone and come eat honey!\u201d your mom calls from a few feet away. Alex turns back to you before adding \u201cYou got lucky\u2026I\u2019m starving!\u201d He then heads for the car running at an incredibly fast sprint thanks to his well-toned calves and thighs.  You\u2018re happy that your hand has been released, but it still hurts, and so you nurse your near crushed hand as you walk towards the picnic table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the wooden picnic table where Alex is already chowing down and notice the spread was massive, with enough soda and sub-sandwiches to feed an army, or at least an army\u2019s special project. Alex holds a massive foot long sub in one hand and takes a humongous bight out of it.  He looks confused as you head towards one of the may looking delicious sub sandwiches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUh, son that table is for Alex\u2019s lunch.\u201d Your dad says from behind the new (?) car. He hauls a smaller regular sized cooler from the trunk and sets it on a nearby table where your mom is already sitting. \u201cYou know our lunch is over here\u201d your mom adds, \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...think so\u2026\u201d you say a little distracted. You were amazed that all of that food was for your younger brother, but then again with how fast he was scarfing things down he probably would finish the large lunch in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry bro, but I gotta feed these guns you know?\u201d he explains with a mouthful of deli meat and wheat bread in his full mouth.  He gives you an example of said \u201cguns\u201d by flexing his right arm and making his bicep bounce and making it look unbelievably hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down next to your mom and dad (who still look absolutely astounded by Alex\u2019s physique and appetite) you help yourself to a small sandwich and try to wrap your head around what\u2019s happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, when did we get that car?\u201d you ask both of your parents. They look at towards each other and then back to you. \u201cHoney did you bump your head when you were roughhousing with Alex?\u201d your Mom asks sounding quite concerned. \u201cYou know that we bought that with the project money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and a good thing we did too\u201d your dad adds. \u201cWith an appetite like that we need all the room for his lunch!\u201d  He says only half joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm\u2026that sort of made sense. Maybe you should ask your parents some more about the project you might be able to find out what the new \u201csuperboy\u201d Alex\u2019s kryptonite is\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wears a red soccer jersey with black shorts, has shaggy bright-red hair and freckles. He's holding a soccer ball and has a worried look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach Justin?\" The boy sighs in relief. \"Whew, I'm glad you're alright! I'm sorry for kicking too hard. I hope getting hit in the side of the head with the ball and getting knocked to the ground didn't hurt too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching your head, you ask, \"W-Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boy, slightly taller and skinnier, wearing the same shorts but shirtless and with medium-length black hair and glasses, comes over and chuckles. \"Boy, that ball must have hit you harder than we thought. That's Luke and I'm Jordan. Do you know where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the field and see a total of eight boys, all nine or ten years old and all dressed in the same uniform, half with the jersey on and half shirtless. They all look at you, some with concern on their faces and some amused. Scanning the rest of the field and it's surroundings, you don't see any other person within sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at yourself, you see you're wearing a grey polo shirt with the word \"Coach\" embroidered on it, have a whistle hung around your neck, and are holding a clipboard. As you look back up at the boys, you put two and two together. \"I'm... your coach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" a third boy with short brown hair and a bit stocky, chimes in. \"Okay, guys, he's alright!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so maybe that soccer ball did hit your head a little hard. You definitely didn\u2019t remember these boys, or being their coach, and yet here you were. It made more sense that you were blanking out than that a whole soccer team full of boys would pull such an elaborate prank on a complete stranger. They definitely were acting like they knew you, so it\u2019s probably best just to roll with it. Besides, you can\u2019t help but feel a little bit of pride to know that you\u2019re the coach of these fine young boys. They\u2019re actually very good with quick reflexes and nice muscles for ten year olds, and they\u2019re all playing fairly and with good teamwork skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of minutes are quick and action-packed; you watch the two groups of boys perform some talented maneuvers, blocks, and kicks. Eventually, though, one of the \u201cskins\u201d scored a tight kick, sending the ball past the \u201cshirt\u201d goalie and scoring a goal for his team. Although only one group had won, all of them cheered and congratulated the boy, an older kid with brown hair and bright blue eyes who was apparently named Jake. In fact, he seemed to be the best of the boys, and he was a little more toned than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Wait a minute. Something\u2019s not right. As the boys run around, cheering and moving around the field, they seem to be inching upwards. Their black shorts ride up the growing columns of their legs, covering less and less as the legs expand, pressing against the fabric. After all the cheering is over, the smallest of them is actually a little under five feet tall. Jake, who was the biggest of them, was actually pretty close to your height now, probably only a few inches shy. Their uniforms, or shorts in the case of some of the boys, were stretched tight against bodies that were now a couple of feet bigger. The shirts are now inadequate, only covering the top half or so of their considerably bigger and noticeably more muscular chests. It was almost like looking at huge nude statues that had been given kid\u2019s clothes. An appropriate comparison, really, given how huge they all are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite these changes, however, the boys seem to be treating it quite happily. They\u2019re definitely surprised, but they\u2019re all laughing and roughhousing, which seems even rougher now that they\u2019re two feet taller and even more muscular than before. Their playful actions, faces, and the boy clothes are all but the only reminders that these are a group of ten year old kids. You\u2019re just glad those nylon shorts and jerseys held up the size change, for now, at least...</span></div></div>",

The sheer act of running around and going to kick the ball caused clothes to stretch, rip. and eventually burst off of their ever-increasing bodies. Within five more minutes, one of the boys who had started out as the tallest amongst them became the first to completely lose his clothes, as he hit eight feet tall and his shorts fell off in a pile of shreds on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, William,\" one of the other boys called out as he laughed, \"you're naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am!\" he chuckled back. \"Feels kinda good, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other boys playfully poked him in the stomach, and this inevitably led to another bout of wrestling. The sound of boyish laughter belied the sight before you of the muscled, ever-growing bodies before you. Most of the other boys had now hit the eight foot mark as well and were losing their clothes too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head as you turned around, trying to snap yourself out of ... whatever the hell this was.

An olive-skin Asian boy on the \"skins\" team seems to be the superstar of the group. After a while, you pick up from the other boys' chatter that his name is Lee. He has a more toned body than the rest of the group, making him look a little closer to being a teenager. Lee's all over the field, playing both defense and offense with a passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a particularly well-executed slide-tackle, he passes to a blonde-haired teammate, then rushes up the field. \"Lee's breaking free!\" Jordan yells to the blonde-haired boy, who sees this and kicks the ball in a long, arching pass, right to Lee, who is in the perfect position to knock it towards the goal, past the outstretched fingertips of the other team's goalie and into the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"skins\" team cheers, coming together and high-fiving each other, while the \"shirts\" team looks a little saddened but determined to strike back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter celebrating with his team, Lee says, \"All right, guys, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" they answer in unison, all linking arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the boys, stunned, as they all raise their arms together into the air, stretching their bodies as much as they can. As they do, they all start to inch upwards, growing bigger together right before your eyes. Their bare torsos elongate and widen, while their shorts start exposing more and more leg, getting tighter around their thighs as they do. Finally, they stop, each boy a full foot taller. They smile and laugh at each other, while the other team's faces have an extremely jealous look on them.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what to think as the boys start to bring the ball back to the center of the field, Luke, the redheaded boy, getting ready to kick off. It seems amazing to you that all the boys seem to be treating the sudden growth spurts as normal, even expected. As strange as everything had been so far, it was only getting weirder and weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they can resume play, you rush out onto the field, blowing your whistle to catch the boys' attention. They each stare at you, a little confused. \"What?\" Luke asks as he looks at you, scrunching up his nose and shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that just now?\" you ask, turning your head back and forth between the team of shorter boys and the team of taller boys. \"How did you all just grow like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys all chuckle a bit, and Lee responds, \"Don't you remember? Those were the rules we decided on before the scrimmage started. Whenever a team scores a goal, they grow a foot taller!\" The other boys smile and nod, agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-- How--?\" you sputter, trying to comprehend the situation, but the boys turn their attention back to the game, Luke kicking the ball off and resuming play. You quickly move back to the sidelines to try to avoid the action. What's going on with these boys, you think to yourself. For now, at least, you can only watch them play and see if anything else strange happens.</span></div></div>",

You settle for quietly watching them, and seeing how this affects their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before the goal, you would've assumed that the \"skins\" had an advantage over the \"shirts.\" Lee looks much more in shape than most members of his team, with a fit body that allowed him to sprint lightly and quickly over the field with impressive control over the ball. All the other \"skins\" weren't as impressive in their physical development, but they were apparently close friends with Lee, because their synergy with him was amazing. A firm defense by the \"shirts\" prevented them from a score for the first seven minutes, but through a brilliant couple of passes by Lee and his friends, they managed to evade their blocks and outmaneuver the goalie twice. They whooped a cheer, met in the middle, and extended their hands again as they grew another foot, to a number of jealous stares by the \"shirts\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first two goals, it started turning into a rout. The shirts are clearly losing steam against their more organized counterparts. Furthermore, in addition to a height increase, the growth seems to have given a renewed burst of energy to the \"skins.\" The \"shirts\" try to keep pace with Lee as he passes back and forth with a partner, but soon he outpaces them and shoots for another goal, which the goalie desperately dives for and misses. 3-0, \"skins\" leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the \"skins\" congregate, and again, the \"skins\" extend their arms in the air after a team cheer. You could swear their muscles are growing bigger along with their height, but you aren't sure yet- their shorts ride up again, but despite getting a little tighter, they're not bursting like you'd expect them to. You glance at the \"skins\", now the size of full-grown adults or bigger, and compare them to their competition, all of them red-faced and bent over wheezing for air. This is going to be brutal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is indeed. The \"shirts\" have all but no energy or will left, and when they chase, they barely manage a saunter. They don't even gain hold of the ball for a second during the rest of the match, and every single one of them fuels the yells, chest bumps, and high-fives of the ever-growing spirit of the \"skins.\" It's rather fascinating to watch two supposed ten-year-old kids jump from the ground, high-five each other in the air, and land again a foot taller than they were. The game continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Torture,\" you think to yourself, actually might be a better word. Once the \"skins\" reach twelve feet, it becomes apparent they're not just beating the \"shirts\"- they're teasing them. Lee kicks to another teammate you heard called Ryan, but his foot is so large that it also sweeps his four-foot-something tall coverer and knocks him to the ground. Lee just sneers a brief laugh and runs on ahead. \"Shirts\" are being bodychecked, tripped, and kicked by legs now taller than they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ignore it, but at 11-0, you know something had to stop before someone got seriously hurt. You blow your whistle and wave your arms to indicate a group meeting. The \"skins\" muscular development is obvious at their size, now. Even if they weren't all fifteen-foot tall behemoths, you could tell that their figures are nowhere near the boyish muscles they had at the beginning of the match. Firm, bulging calves stand out behind pulled-up socks underneath massive thighs, tightly covered by high-riding soccer shorts which you can help but notice also press against their... packages. You look up, transfixed, at the ten-year old \"skins\", gazing at toned abs, pecs, and triceps covered in sweat, as they pant heavily but smile broadly and expectantly, waiting for your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...\" You cough to clear your throat and calm your nerves. \"First, I want to say congratulations on your skirmish victory, skins-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are immediately interrupted by a roar of approval from the skins overhead, followed by more chest bumps and clapping. You wait for it to end then continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think it's safe to say that the skins have a definite advantage over the shirts at this point, so something needs to change to fair it up.\"<br>\r\nFollowed by groans from the skins and claps and murmurs of consent by the shirts.<br>\r\n\"Come on, coach, we got this height fair and square! Let the shrimps suffer!\" Lee objects.<br>\r\n\"Your team is the ENTIRE soccer team, I'll have you remember, Lee- if they suffer, then the team suffers. I was thinking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never hear what you're thinking, because you're immediately interrupted- again- as an idea is mentioned and met with unanimous yells of approval from both sides.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, fine,\" one of the skins says, \"if we need to even things out, I guess we could let those little squirts catch up to us height-wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh,\" you stutter. \"That's not exactly--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" The boys on the shirts team all seem to be in agreement. Before you can say anything, they all close their eyes and hold out their arms, grasping each others' wrists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" you call out, but it's too late. The shirts team has already begun to grow, having a lot of work to do to match their bare-chested teammates. Each boy shoots up, their torsos widening and filling out their chests with pound after pound of muscle, and their legs elongating and thickening, turning into massive sculpted columns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes seem to be getting bigger as well, though not at the same rate as their expanding bodies. The fabric and nylon stretch in an attempt to keep up with the bodies of these young boys-becoming-giants. By the time they are able to see eye-to-eye with their larger teammates' waists, their clothing should have been torn to shreds. Instead, though, the shirts and shorts seem to be holding up, though much more strained than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirts are now riding up their well-defined abs, revealing a bit of midriff as the shirts pass ten feet tall. The boys' calves expand to the size of bowling balls, forcing their long socks to go lower and lower, revealing even more toned muscle and firm skin. The shorts seem to have to work the hardest to stay together, as the boys' powerful thigh muscles, tight chiseled butts, and, most troubling of all, clearly-visible bulges are all being showcased by the ever-stretching nylon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stops, each boy more or less the same height as his skins counterpart. You crane your neck upward, looking back and forth between the two teams, unsure of which sight is the more impressive, or the more horrifying. The skins' almost-naked bodies definitely give a clearer view of their impressively large muscles, and as they run back and forth along the grass and stretch their arms and legs to warm up, you could see their skin ripple with each movement of their pectoral and abdominal muscles, their biceps and triceps popping up with each flex of their arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirts team seems equally impressive but in a different way, the skin-tight uniforms sculpting and enhancing the boys' definition, tempting whoever looks at them with the wonder that lies underneath. The six or seven inches between the bottom of their shirts and the top of their shorts serves to show a taste of the incredible physique of these boys, and their shorts only cover the bare minimum, coming just a quarter way down their thighs before revealing skin again. In many ways, the extra clothing on this side, tight as it was, could be considered even more alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly is an amazing sight to see. The boys can no longer be confused with other little kids, but instead resemble mini-titans, or gods. The only things that still remind you of the ten-year-olds they started out as are their boyish, youthful faces, and the playful demeanor and attitude they have. You see a skin with a mischievous smile on his face jump on the back of his newly-grown shirt teammate, his arms wrapped tightly around the other boy's neck. The shirt laughs and claws wildly to try to get the skin off of his back, a wide smile plastered on both faces the whole time. Another two boys roll around in the grass together, reveling in the ticklish feel of the blades against their skin, gleefully aware that they're getting green stains on their otherwise-clean shirts, shorts and socks. You're somewhat surprised that these boys don't seem to be marveling in any significant way at their incredible new physique and height. You almost could swear that they do this kind of thing at every practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you keep turning your head back and forth between each side, you only now become aware of how excited you've become. At first, you're extremely embarrassed and try to hide your arousal; you have a girlfriend and a reputation to uphold, and you shouldn't be getting turned on by other guys, especially those seven years younger than you. But, looking back up to the boys, you notice that some of the boys also seem to have their manhood at a heightened state. Staring into their eyes, you  see that these boys have some sort of fiery emotion in them; passion, lust, you're not sure what. Part of you is afraid of what this could mean, but you shake it off as the rest of the boys gather together, looking like they're ready to resume play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, trembling a little as the boys' restless footsteps pound the ground. \"So this will be the start of a new scrimmage. We're back to square one; it should be fair from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Lee said, nodding. \"So that means we have to make a new rule about scoring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at him, questioningly. \"It does?\" you ask, a slight sense of dread in your voice. The other boys all seem to nod, confirming Lee's statement, causing you to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Luke, the shaggy redhead boy on the shirts team, says, his face lit up in excitement. \"I've got an idea! How about\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

I'm the best player on the team! You're practically handing me a free ticket to grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a strange twinge as he said that, your eyes looking up and down his almost completely revealed body. If he got any bigger whatever clothing was managing to cling to his towering frame would pop off in an instant. The other guys added their voices to the situation, some in favor of a chance to double their heights while others were concerned that Lee would hog it all. Luke ended the discussion by raising his voice and saying, \"HEY! If you REALLY don't have that much confidence in your own skills then fine, maybe Lee will get to keep growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You KNOW I will.\" The cocky young Asian man said, smirking over at his teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that also means he'll eventually get too big to properly handle the ball and when THAT happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE'LL GET A CHANCE!\" The rest of the team cheered, laughing and patting each other on the backs. It was at this point enough was enough. You had been largely keeping silent, largely letting these rambunctious kids have their own way as they played around, but this was just too much! If Lee scored even once, he would surge up to over twenty feet tall! And if he managed to score beyond THAT he'd reach over FORTY feet tall! With just four goals Lee could conceivably reach over one hundred feet tall, not to mention the various levels the other boys might reach. By the end of practice you could have a team of ten year olds wreaking havoc on the whole town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, guys, guys!\" You shout, waving your arms for their attention. \"There's no way I can allow this! It's...it's too much! Things could get seriously out of hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke rolled his eyes and said, \"Come on, that's why it's FUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you didn't seem too worked up about it last week when we had practice.\" Lee said with a grin, his cock stiffening slightly as he remembered...something that seemingly had gone on in the time where your memory is hazy. \"Besides this is great for teamwork! You want us to do good at tomorrows game, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked slowly from face to face, each boy looking back at you with determination, wanting to continue practicing to be the very best they could possibly be! You sighed, rubbing your head. How can you say no to such faces? It wasn't like they needed you to help themselves grow so you should probably feel grateful that they haven't completely run amok yet. Lee and Luke, seemingly the de facto leaders of the group, both stepped forward, standing on either side of you. \"Come on coach.\" Lee said, grinning. \"Let's have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, you guys win.\" You finally agree with a sigh. You blew your whistle once more and shouted, \"All shirts to the left! All skins to the right! We play until ten goals! No time outs, no fouls, no pleas for more time afterwards! Got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Everyone said with a grin, taking up their positions on opposite ends of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make this last round really count guys! I want to see each and every one of you at your absolute best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids were getting fired up from hearing your impassioned words, bouncing slightly from foot to foot, getting into position! You were starting to fall into the role of a coach quite well, actually even enjoying yourself a bit! These kids just tended to grow on you after awhile...er...no pun intended. You picked up the soccer ball and walked into the center of the field, Lee and Luke facing off. You held the ball out in front of you and said, \"On my whistle...three...two...one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long, sustained blast on the silver instrument, you let the ball go, backing away on the double as all the boys rushed together, aiming to get that ball! \"Team work everyone, team work!\" You shouted, clapping your hands, finally back at the sidelines. \"This isn't about the prize it's about WORKING TOGETHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad scramble slowly untangled itself, returning to the more typical formations of a soccer team, each boy playing their position, eager to have the ball passed to him but still passing it themselves when necessary. You watched with excitement, pride, trepidation, and just a bit of lingering confusion yet as you watched the scrimmage progress...</span></div></div>",

You could hear his whisper and he was gonna let all the kids grow up to his height. You couldn't stop this either. They were all bigger and stronger than you.

Luke on the other hand has no such problem and is instead glued to the little soccer ball at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every time Lee seems to think he has it in the bag, Luke is suddenly on top of him ready to steal or foil any attempts at scoring a goal. Time and time again Lee gets within mere feet of the goal only to find one of Luke's massive cleats blocking his shot or swiping the ball away from him. This back and forth seems to go on forever and you quickly discover you're leaning forward in the excitement of the moment. You even consider walking out onto the field to watch the game more closely. However, that idea vanishes when a tree trunk sized thigh suddenly rushes past your head, causing you to stagger and fall. As you stand up, you conclude that each boy must weight over two thousand pounds by now, getting kicked or run over by one would be less than pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally after several minutes of intense back and forth action, Luke finally claims the upper hand and manages to steal the ball just as one of his shirted teammates blocks Lee from giving chase. A roaring chant of \"LUKE! LUKE! LUKE!\" erupts from the shirts side as he weaves his way past the \"skins\" defenders and rockets towards the goal. Then with a \"THUMP!\" you literally feel in your chest, the soccer ball whooshes through the air and into the goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You cover your ears as a deafening cheer explodes from the shirts side of the field and the boys on the shirts side rush over to crowd around Luke. All the excitement puts a smile on your face and you realize that standing out in the sun for so long has made you thirsty. Yelling to the boys that they should get some water, you jog over to the water cooler and pull one of the paper cups out of the attached tube. Filling the cup to its brim, you take in a long sip of water just as the realities of your situation begin to weigh heavily on you. Your team of 5 foot tall 10 year olds has been replaced by a team of miniature titans close to 16 feet tall. Then questions begin to rush through your head, \"Why hasn't anyone seen them yet? Were we just lucky? How can these kids grow, are they magic or something, maybe they're gods?\" But one question weighs the heaviest on you, will they listen to you? Looking down at the little envelope of water you let out a deep sigh and are about to take another sip when you see the water...vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gulping, you suddenly remember the deal the boys made before they restarted the match, something you'd conveniently forgotten in the excitement. Turning around from the cooler you look up just in time to see a 30 foot form blot out the sun. Letting out a gasp, you dive away from the cooler just in time for a 5 foot long soccer cleat to slam into the ground where you were standing. A hand the size of a beach umbrella then reaches down in order to delicately pluck the cooler off the table. Wiping the nervous beads of sweat off your brow, you look up to see Luke spin the lid off the cooler and dump the contents into his mouth like a shot glass. With the care that one might expect from a ten year old, Luke simply lets out a sigh of satisfaction before letting it fall from his fingers (almost dropping it on your head!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen this, you immediately ask in your head, \"Why did Luke do that just now?\"</span></div></div>",

Ryan kicked the ball in sideways, you jump for it and miss.

You look pathetic out here!\u201d Lee gloated as his cock stiffened a little. It would push you back if he wasn\u2019t shoving you into it.

Luke looked like he was about to pass out as he was barely able to focus on the ball. Steadying yourself you licked your lips slowly savoring the salty sweat from Lee\u2019s cock the drenched half of your lips (and face). Staring at Lee, Jordan,Saul and the pale blonde haired goalie \u201cskin\u201d named Craig seemed to take up your entire vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was all of your blood rushing to your dick that strained against your sweatpants but all you wanted was to see just how big these \u201cboys\u201d would get.

Jordan followed beside Lee \u201cdefending\u201d him by swinging his muscular butt into the smaller \u201cshirts\u201d. Your eyes were wide in fear, anticipation, excitement and shameful horniness as Lee, Jordan and Saul barreled towards you. Lee passed to Saul and the brown skinned boy kicked the ball curving it into the goal. The goal you didn\u2019t bother protecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cskins\u201d cheered as you stood slack jawed. Saul this time came running up to you shoving your head between his enormous squishy buttcheeks as they grew around your head. \u201cSniff it up coach! We\u2019re just gonna give you even more of this!\u201d Saul happily said through a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being dropped out of his sweaty stinky ass you were beyond lost in the glory that is the \u201cskins\u201d. You just had to taste and experience more of them. Goal after goal was scored as you barely even moved your arms to seem like you were trying to stop the \u201cskins\u201d onslaught. Each goal brought on another sweaty smothering from the three attacking boys. Each time brought another butthole or cock swelling larger against your face. You couldn\u2019t get enough of it. With barely any though those fives goals blew past you in no time. The \u201cshirts\u201d were telling at you as all four of the \u201cskins\u201d crowded you with their dangling three foot long cocks. Surging up to 23 feet tall all four boys moaned in ecstasy knowing they beat their coach. Lee looked triumphantly down at his coach. \u201cWhat do you think coach? You look like you could go another five rounds.\u201d He smirked as his cockhead surged in size as it harden pushing against you. You could barely think as Lee\u2019s cock began to push out pre-cum and the other boys sweaty cocks hung around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely hear the \u201cshirts\u201d around you yelling something as they tried to push through the \u201cskins\u201d enormous legs.</span></div></div>",

The walls are grey and metallic, with various flashing lights adorning them. The ceilings stretch high above, perhaps some twenty feet up. A set of metal table and chairs are in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is large and stretches about 100 feet down. At the opposite end, you notice a television set is blaring, with somebody sitting on a couch in front of it. As you walk closer, you see that it appears to be a young boy, not more than five feet tall. He has shaggy dark hair and an olive complexion, looking to be Asian In origin. He's wearing a black basketball jersey that reads \"Tigers\" across the front and black mesh shorts reaching below his knees. You notice the show he is watching appears to be some sort of anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are within a dozen feet of him, he turns to look at you and his face lights up. \"Oh, good! You're up! I was beginning to get worried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBewildered, you stop in front of him. \"What is this place? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jumps off the couch and sticks his hand out. \"My name is Ken. I don't know where we are. I just woke up about thirty minutes ago on the floor wearing these weird clothes, saw you were asleep, and sat down on the couch here where the TV was. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin,\" you say, looking away. You examine the rest of the room, and notice something weird: there appears to be no windows and no doors, nor even any seams in the wall where a hidden door could be. It looks like you're in sone strange box that was constructed around you, and, for now at least, appears impossible to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen turns back to the TV. \"I'm just glad that you speak Japanese, Justin. When I saw what you were wearing, I figured you were American and wouldn't know how to speak it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself and notice that you are wearing a blue football uniform, minus the pads, that reads \"Bulldogs\" across the jersey, clothing that you had never seen before. \"I am American and I don't speak Japanese,\" you say, confused. \"You're speaking English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ken ask, scrunching up his nose. \"I haven't learned English yet in school. I only speak Japanese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird, you think to yourself, but you have no time to contemplate that thought as a loud siren suddenly starts bleating and the lights on the walls begin to flash. \"What the he'll is that?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen covers his ears, wincing. \"I have no idea! I've never seen it before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to make sense of it all, a beam of orange light shoots down from the ceiling, completely engulfing Ken. He seems a little stunned and frightened, and starts to moan, closing his eyes. You stare at him, not believing what you're seeing. As he is bathed in the light, he appears to be growing in front of your eyes, inching up slowly but surely. You notice his shorts beginning to tent, realizing he must be getting some sort of pleasure from this experience. You start to back away but about twenty seconds after it started it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is noticeably taller, probably about 5' 6\" now, and his clothes appear tighter too, his basketball jersey now revealing a bit of midriff and his shorts now showing some thigh. Ken opens his eyes and looks at you with concern in his face. \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You- you grew!\" you stammer, unsure of how to put it in words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looks down at his body, trying to comprehend what you said, then finally looks back up to you and responds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, all you could do was stand back, sweat dripping from your face and body, as Ken looked up towards the source of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man, you wouldn't believe how good this feels.\" The boy began to moan again, his eyes closed as he spread his arms like he was enjoying a warm shower. As his chest slowly rose and fell with his breath, his whole body swelled again, his skin stretching and expanding as the kid grew taller. The shirt seemed to slide up his chest, but really, his torso was just getting bigger as the hem slid up above his belly button. His little shorts rode further up his legs as they grew and thickened, exposing more supple tan flesh. You couldn't help but notice the front of Ken's shorts bulging outwards, partly because of the slow growth of his body and partly because of the incredible pleasure welling through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light stopped, he had to be at least seven feet tall. No, he was definitely eight feet. God, he must have weighed at least five or six hundred pounds easily, and he had enough bulk to show it. At six feet, four inches, you were now the smaller one, and you were barely eye level with his chest. His clothes were torn, mostly a few rips in his too-tight shirt and a small tear on his ass. The clothes he was wearing were for someone three feet smaller, and it was a miracle he still had anything on. If that orange light came again, though, that shirt and those shorts were going to be shredded, along with the white briefs that were visible through the tears in his stretched shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least the light was gone.

He slowly gained an inch, then two, the seams of his remaining clothing creaking audibly under the strain.

Ken's pocket rocket threatened to break free from it's thin cotton prison any moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken?\" you ask hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his gaze swept down and focused on you, a huge grin broke out across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\", he shouted, \"I'm taller than you now! This keeps getting better and better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, better and better... \" you mutter to yourself as you look straight ahead at his heaving chest... </span></div></div>",

That orange light must have made you grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen laughs. \"Well, maybe you need to get your eyes checked. I've always been a little tall since I can remember. In fact, I'm the tallest kid in my class.\" He smiles proudly, posing a little. \"And that orange light only tickled a little. It didn't really do anything to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say, \"What about your clothes, then? Don't they seem a little tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at his exposed belly and legs and shrugs. \"Beats me, I didn't pick out these clothes. I guess whoever gave them to us didn't know what size I should wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have a response to this, so Ken turns back to the TV. It has seemingly changed from the anime it was displaying before to what looks to be some sort of sports game that you don't recognize. Young shirtless men on the TV are throwing a large red cube around, running up and down a field and trying to tackle each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Ken asks. \"Do you recognize it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"Nope.\" You don't speak much more as you try to make sense of what is going on. You watch Ken as he begins to stretch his arms and then scratches his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you from?\" he asks. \"You are American, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Florida,\" you say. \"Miami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen chuckles. \"So we're both from areas with beaches! I'm from Okinawa. Have you ever seen pictures of there? I really think it's beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sirens begin to wail again, and both you and Ken look around. \"Another one?\" Ken asks, puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, just like before, the orange light shines down from above on Ken, and he begins to moan. As he does so, you watch him intently, making sure that you notice his growth. And indeed, his body does begin to get bigger right in front of you, at the rate of about an inch every five seconds. You can hear the sound of fabric ripping as his shorts begin to bulge outward, seemingly not able to contain his swelling member underneath. The jersey become skin tight, revealing even more of his stomach. This time, the light lasts for about a minute, and when it is done, you are stunned to see Ken standing a couple of inches taller than you - making him at least 6' 4\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you with curious dark eyes, and you know your jaw is dropped. \"No way,\" you say. \"You had to have noticed that! You're bigger than me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" Ken says, smiling. \"I was bigger than you when I first saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eleven,\" Ken says as he tilts his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how tall are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six foot five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him in amazement. \"And don't you think that's a little weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen shrugs. \"I dunno. The doctor's have examined me and says everything's normal. I just must have a healthy pituitary gland or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it doesn't seem odd that your clothing is now much tighter than it was before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Ken says, \"my clothing is always tight. Its hard to fine kids clothes in my size, in Japan at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from him, trying to make sense of it all. \"How can this be?\" you mutter to yourself. \"A kid grows 17 inches in less than ten minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to figure out what the hell is going on...</span></div></div>",

The boy began to moan as his growth started up again. His clothes (or what was left of them) had been barely clinging on to him before, but now against this new wave of growth it didn't have a chance. The stitches in the jersey popped open and tore apart as Ken grew bigger and bigger by the second. His shorts also getting tighter and tighter as tears also formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched helplessly as the formerly smaller kid grew bigger and bigger before your eyes, inching up higher and higher. You had to strain your neck back as he past 6 and a half feet tall, 6'7\", 6'8\", 6'10\", 7 feet tall! Bigger and taller the kid grew until finally he was what you could guess was 7'4\" tall. Right when the growth ended, his jersey finally had enough and tore completely apart, fluttering to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, and that was my favorite jersey.\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you grew!\" You said. \"You grew so big that your jersey ripped off you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it ripped off me, I'm surprised it lasted all these years.\" Ken said, not surprised at all. \"It should have ripped off when I broke 7 feet tall last year, but if I didn't take too deep of a breath it managed to stay on before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable. Even though Ken had grown past what was considered normal height, he still didn't see anything weird about it! \"Just how tall are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looked at you funny. \"Didn't I already tell you a minute ago? I'm 7'5\" the last time I measured it. I'm the world's tallest 11 year old, and I'm still growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is completely boggled. Just how big was Ken going to grow?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You try to wrap your mind around everything that you're seeing. It doesn't make sense. Why doesn't Ken realize that he's now ridiculously big for his age? Why is he growing? Whey are you two here in the first place? Obviously, something's happening when the light shines down on him\u2026 but so far, that all seems completely random and uncontrollable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to think, another sound starts filling the room, but this one is different. As opposed to a high-pitched siren, this time it's more of an \"AHOOOGA\", like a submarine submerging. You look up and notice different lights now flashing, and then a green beam shining down from the ceiling, at a slightly different angle then from where the orange light had come from. You wince, expecting Ken to start shooting up again, but something different happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Ken stays the same height, and at first you don't notice any difference. He still moans like before, and he runs his hand up and down his chest and stomach, feeling his well-pronounced abs. Wait a second. You look closer, and notice that his body, formerly lean and skinny, is now starting to become much more defined, muscles sprouting up all over the place. His chest starts to protrude slightly, his biceps become more rounded, and his thighs and calves start to swell. His shorts, already nearly torn to shreds, finally rip up the sides, though the waistband stays on, and they start to look more like a loincloth than shorts. Ken is becoming not just a giant, but a muscle god as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the green light stops, and Ken's body ceases changing. It hadn't gone crazy with the muscle growth, but he definitely looks more like a teenage swimmer or wrestler than the skinny kid he had previously appeared to be. He opens his eyes and looks down at you. He must notice the shock in your eyes, because he asks, \"Okay, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please tell me that you noticed that? Your body just exploded with muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looks down at himself, then scrunches his nose and looks back at you. \"Look, Justin, I don't know what you're talking about. I think you need to lie down or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you have the body of a teenager! You're only eleven, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" Ken shrugs. \"I work out a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you finally say, \"I give up. You're a seven-and-a-half foot tall muscle boy, or maybe you'll soon be eight, or ten, or twenty feet tall! And you will always have been that way. I get it. I mean, I don't have any clue what the hell is going on, but I give up! But besides all that, besides everything weird and fucked up that has happened, we still need to figure out where we are, and how we get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen looks at you and nods. \"Okay,\" he says, \"let's explore the room and look for anything that can help us. You take this side and I'll take the far end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you say. \"Yell at me if you see anything. Or if anything weird-- well, weirder-- starts to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen walks over to the other end of the room and you start to look around the end with the TV and the couch. You run your hands along the wall, noticing nothing to interrupt their smooth uniformity. The floor likewise is very plain and empty of answers. Looking underneath the couch turns up nothing, nor does looking behind the TV. You feel around for buttons, but there are none. It's just a monitor, stuck on playing whatever it currently is playing, only changing when it wants to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to find, you are just about to give up when\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you turn around back towards Ken, you hear a voice call out from behind you. \"Justin!\" it says in a loud whisper, sending a chill down your spine. Spinning back around, you see a shadowy figure on the TV screen that was not there a few seconds ago. You can't make out any details of the figure other than it appears to be approximately human in shape and size. You look side-to-side, unsure of what to do. Again, it repeats, \"Justin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" you stammer. You then turn your head towards the other end of the room. \"Ken!\" you call out, hoping to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother calling for the other boy,\" the voice from the TV says. \"He can't hear you or me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask, your body starting to shake in fear and frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't answer any of your questions at the present time,\" the figure says, \"but they will become clear eventually. I only have something to inform you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have seen the results of both of our \u2026 let's just call them tests, for now. We need to continue them, indefinitely for now. However, a side effect of these tests is an increase in sexual desire. The other boy will more than likely try to force himself upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are wide open as you try to comprehend what you're being told. \"Y-you mean, he's gonna try to fuck me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever he does,\" the figure continues, \"We need you to resist him however you can. It is absolutely imperative that the other boy is not allowed to give in to his desires, otherwise, well\u2026 let's just say we can't predict the outcome. Good-bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as the figure had come on the screen, it vanishes, and a test pattern appears in its place. You turn back towards Ken, who still is examining the other side of the room. You struggle to get everything straightened out in your head. Ken forcing himself on you is a horrible thought, but you're not sure how you would be able to resist him, especially if he continues to grow like the figure implied. Then again, if the figure was one of the ones who had trapped the two of you here, and he didn't want Ken to get off\u2026 maybe if you did the opposite, then you'd be able to escape. It's a crazy idea, but this whole night has been full of crazy shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ken starts walking back towards you. \"Find anything?\" he asks. You shake your head. \"Figures. Neither did I. So what're we gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start examining Ken's body, looking for signs of this increased arousal that the figure was referenced. Other than his nipples being especially perky, you don't notice anything unusual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the sirens start again. You back away from Ken as he is again bathed in orange light, and he begins to expand once more. Everything happens as before, except that this time the orange light seems to be focused on Ken for longer, and his growth is much more pronounced. By the time it has finished, Ken's shorts have completely gone away, and he is standing naked before you, nearly ten feet tall. You look up, thankful that he still had plenty of room to grow, as the room's ceilings were at least twenty feet in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opens his eyes, he looks down at you, smiling. \"Ya know,\" he says, \"I've been nearly ten feet tall for a while now, but I've never actually felt it was anything special. Until now. I like that you think it's something worth getting ... well, excited about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile starts to form on his lips, and you look down from his face, noticing that his cock, almost at eye-level with you, is now starting to grow in arousal. As your options start to become fewer, you need to make a decision on which way to go on this. Finally, you decide ...</span></div></div>",

After a minute, it's still spraying, and you watch Ken drop to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not STOPPING!\" he moans letting you go in order to wrap both hands around his massive cock \"What's happening to me?\"  </span></div></div>",

Not only does it appear to be going on much too long, but with every throb and pump of his cock, his body swells and surges with growth. This has to be what the guy on the TV was talking about, you think, but it's too late to do anything about it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's body quickly shoots up in height, adding three or four feet with every cum shot. You're not sure if the boy is still unaware of his body getting so much bigger, as he's laser-focused on the pleasure he's feeling for the first time, and on making sure it continued for as long as possible.  \"Oh, YES!\" he cries out. \"This is the best thing that's EVER happened to me! I--OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sentence was cut short by his head hits the ceiling you earlier thought was so far away. He moves from being on his knees to sitting down, sticking his feet out and continuing to stroke away. His left right foot comes very close to you, and as he is still growing, you have to dodge out of the way to avoid being pinned to the wall by the side of his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the boy's cock twitches and his cumshots become shorter, finally stopping. He still moans, but his body's growth has slowed. He's leaning back, his head resting against the far wall, able to reach up and touch the ceiling if he wanted to, and his body fills up nearly two-thirds of the room now. His heavy breathing slows, and he starts to glisten, basking in his first post-orgasm glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou timidly approach his upper body, his torso now as thick as you are tall. You try  your best to avoid stepping in the hot sticky mess that's all over the room and his body. Placing your hand on the side of his firm stomach, you say, with a bit of trepidation in your voice, \"Ken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at you and smiles. \"That was great, Justin,\" he says. \"Thanks for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen nods vigorously. \"Now I see what all the fuss is about. I can't wait to do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, waiting to see if he notices how much space he now occupies. He doesn't seem to take any notice of it, sighing and saying, \"Okay, now what were we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, heavily disappointed but having resigned yourself to the situation. \"So you don't notice anything unusual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Ken says. \"Why? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you ponder if you should even try to find out his justification for being seventy feet tall now, but you decide it's a pointless road to go down. \"I guess we should be looking for a way out,\" you finally say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" He starts to sit up, but he can't straighten out all the way without his head hitting the ceiling. \"Stupid small rooms,\" he said, \"why can't we be outside? There'd be plenty of room for me out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you say, \"that's what we've been trying to do, I guess. Get out of here.

You're terrified of what might happen if you let Ken get off, considering the results are unpredictable, but unpredictable results are better than no results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You're getting excited?\" You ask, eyeing Ken's hardening cock, which is bobbing eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Looking down at you and realizing how much bigger than you I am is really... exciting.\" Ken said, with seduction in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... Maybe I can do something to help you with that excitement.\" You suggest, reaching out to touch the head of his cock. Ken shudders at the sensation. The head is bigger around that you can fit in your hand, and it's eagerly spurting precum out of his slit. Taking advantage of this, you step forward and press your lips against the head of his enormous dick and start kissing the precum slick skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing...\" Ken moans, his eyes fluttering at the electric feelings of pleasure coursing through his ten foot body. You take it as a sign to shove your tongue as deep into the slit of his cock as you can, causing the large boy standing over you to let out a moan that can be heard through the entire room .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, keep doing that.\" Ken grunts, grabbing the back of your head with his enormous hand. He presses your face harder against his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boy's dick is too large for you to really pleasure without breaking your jaw, but apparently what you're doing now is just enough for him to be getting off. It's obvious that Ken has never had anything like this happen before, considering how inexperienced each thrust of his powerful hips is. Your hands reach and begin stroking his huge length, requiring both hands to even actually reach around his entire dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so good at this.\" Ken moans happily. \"I should have done this a long time ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell Ken is close to cumming when he starts grunting loudly and frequently, and pressing your face even harder against his dick. Your tongue is still thrusting in and out of his slit, drinking in all the precum he has to offer. It's filling your mouth, coating your face, and even dripping down your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, something's happening.\" Ken shouts, pulling his dick out of your grasp. He closes his eyes and starts stroking his cock in front of you with both of his hands. Even using both of his large hands, a generous portion of his dick is still exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but stare in awe as Ken's muscles bunch and flex as he brings himself over the edge. It's a good thing that his cock spews generous precum, otherwise his powerful grip would be hurting him as he angrily stroked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final cry of pleasure, Ken's slit opens wider than you thought possible, and the first shot of cum hits you square in the face. You take a few steps back and wipe your eyes. You look back up at the godly boy as he cums, only to notice...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the young Japanese boy continues to cum and he lets out a loud moan of pleasure, you start to notice that his body again is changing. At first, you think it's the same change that the green light had brought before, as his shoulders are getting wider, and you begin to worry that you're going to be dealing with a horny junior Hercules. But what ends up happening is much more troubling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each white, ropey cumshot, Ken's chest gets wider, as does the rest of his torso. After the fourth one, you notice that his head seems to stretch apart too, as if someone is pulling on either end of his body like it's a piece of taffy. A few seconds later, his head suddenly splits in two, but instead of seeing the gruesome inside, somehow two identical heads form on his wide shoulders, both still with their eyes closed and mouth open, lost in the pleasure of climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs crazy as it is seeing a new head suddenly appear from the old one, you almost fail to realize that his shoulders and legs are also beginning to split apart . His hands, still both stroking his shaft, seem to come separate from each other, but each one still has a rock-hard cock in it, both of which are pointed directly at you and are both still spurting shot after shot. Soon after they separate, a new thin appendage appears in between them, which soon becomes evident as a leg. The new limb quickly fills out and begins splitting apart as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so stunned by the incredible sight before you that you fail to notice that your body is bearing the brunt of the young boy's ejaculation; your clothes, hair, and most of your skin get drenched in his seed. You wipe your eyes, partially to remove the gunk from your eyes and partially in disbelief. When your vision clears, the transformation seems to be completed, as well as the orgasm, and you nearly choke at what you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you now stands two identical-looking eleven-year old Japanese boys, each naked and panting in afterglow. The incredible duplication has taken a few inches away from Ken's (or at least what used to be Ken's) height and build, leaving a pair of nine-and-a-half feet tall boys with bodies closer to swimmers than the bodybuilder from before, but considering the circumstances it was no less impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach boy now seemed to be acting independent of each other, as the one on the left looked down at his softening cock and wiped the dribble of cum off of its head, while the one on the right stretched his hands up above his head and let out a soft moan. \"That was so amazing,\" he says. \"I can't believe we've never done that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you break out of your stupor, take a step back, and point at the two boys. \"Okay, you <i>have</i> to have noticed that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys look at each other with a quizzical expression on their faces before turning their heads back at you. \"Noticed what, Justin?\" the one on the left asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot again, you think. \"You're kidding me, right? You just split apart or cloned yourself or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy on the left blinks in confusion for a few seconds before breaking into a laugh. \"Have you ever heard anyone say anything like that before, Ken?\" he asks, turning to his copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy on the right shakes his head. \"No, Sho,\" he says, then turns to you. \"Have you never seen identical twins before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but\u2014but\u2014\" you stop, realizing that despite the changes having become even crazier than before, the boy\u2014 or boys, now, you guess\u2014 are still oblivious to them. Trying to explain it them would be just as fruitless as it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare wordlessly at the boys, trying to think of just what you could possibly say in response to what you just saw, the boy on the left\u2014 Sho, you guess, based on how they had just addressed each other\u2014 takes a step over to the other one\u2014 who must be the original Ken\u2014 and places his hand on his shoulder. \"It's not too surprising, I guess,\" he says, smiling. \"I don't think a lot of twins do what we just did to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Ken moans softly in agreement. \"Maybe they should.\" His cock, just below eye-level with you and having grown haft-soft in the aftermath of his orgasm, twitches in response to his twin's touch on his shoulders, and begins to jump back up to attention. He places his hand on Sho's chest, whose boyhood responds in a similar fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait,\" you interrupt, realizing that if you let things go on like this you might soon be faced with a football team's worth of horny giant Japanese boys, \"shouldn't we try and focus on figuring out where we are and how to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho's face drops slightly in disappointment, but Ken seems to nod in agreement. \"Alright,\" Ken says, \"what ideas do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to think of a response, suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Your eyes still on the boy as you can hear him say, \"Yeah... I get it!\" He grins cutely, still having to look up at you, but if another of those beams came along, there was no telling just how much longer he would be the one looking up! \"Of course! It all makes sense now!\" Ken chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah? Well, what is it?\" You finally managed to ask once you got over the shock of the kid growing before your very eyes! It seems he knew why all this was happening, and damn it all, you wanted to know too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be some kind of... Experiment! Yeah! They're gonna test these lights on me, and you're a... Uhm...\" Ken stopped his brilliance for a moment to stop and think of what the word was. As he did, you couldn't help noticing he still had a bit of a semi in his pants... It looked like it was wearing down, for now. \"Variable!\" Ken said suddenly, snapping you from your trance! \"Yeah! You're a variable to see how I act when I have someone bigger than me to play with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" You reply in disbelief. \"Experiment? I never agreed to any of this!\" Ken just looks back at you with a slight frown, but you couldn't quite tell if it was because he was sad or if he was upset that you weren't being helpful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're stuck here, so we better make the most of it!\" Ken snapped, folding his arms over his chest and turning to head back to the TV. You just sigh and rub your head, wondering how you're going to get out of this mess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the sirens going off again! Your start glancing around the room, your head whipping around like a lawn sprinkler in overdrive! You could hear a rumble, as another light suddenly engulfed Ken, this one red in color! You started to run over to him to make sure it wasn't hurting him, but as you soon found out, it was doing something even better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen's back, which was still turned to you, started stretching out farther and farther, his once lithe frame suddenly putting on some muscle! He was growing wider by the second, his shoulders looking broad and powerful, each of them already nearly the size of softballs! His little tanktop was stretching even higher now, showing off the bottom of a set of abs! Each of them like smoothed out rocks that were slowly being carved into his body and pushing out further! You could hear a soft moan escaping his lips, his whole body starting to throb as his pecs were surging with power, each of them developing into a meaty slab that dragged down the collar of his shirt. Getting so massive that they poked out from either ends of the cloth! Ken couldn't resist giving them a squeeze, which only made him moan even louder! His thighs got closer together as they expanded too, driving his shorts up a little higher and filling them out, high thighs tightly stuffed inside. There was hardly enough room to even fit a penny in! His calves balled up as well, pushing out huger until they were like melons on his still growing body! His bare feet stretched farther across the cold floor, each big, fat toe wriggling as it was moved along. As you rounded around him, you spotted possibly most embarrassing of all was that the bulge in his pants was getting bigger too! It started to tent out again, and grew in quick, sudden surges! You gulped, a bit jealous as you saw that he was practically as \"big\" as you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light finally went out, you could hear Ken panting heavily, his whole body a little red as blood rushed all over, feeding his pulsating muscles. Sweat was beading down his body like bullets. Your jaw had dropped as this kid, who was once smaller and scrawnier than you, was now about chin-high, and had muscles of a pro bodybuilder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound echoed in the room, from one source! You gazed to look at the TV, but it wasn't coming from there... No, that voice, that deepened, cocky tone of voice was coming from Ken! Your head snapped forward as you looked at him, only to see him looking up at you with a devilish little grin on his face! You didn't know if it was the muscles or that beam, but his whole demeanor seemed to change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen decided that...</span></div></div>",

And where's this toy coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room, trying to figure out where the sounds of kids playing are coming from. You soon find out, seeing on the other side of the couch not one, not two, but three eight-year-old boys on the floor playing with their toys. The boys seem to be a little familiar, all three with dark brown hair that contrasts with their fair skin, but you can't quite place their names or recall where you know them from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry, Justin!\" one of the boys calls out, smiling and waving for you to toss him the toy car back. You do so softly, still confused. Quickly heading into the kitchen, you look at the calendar by the refrigerator, which has the words \"Babysitting the Jackson triplets\" written on today's date with red ink, circled twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man! I'm babysitting triplets for four hours today?\" Dropping your head down, you feel a sense of disappointment set in. \"You've got to be kidding me! That's even worse than dealing with my stupid brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make the best out of a bad situation, making sure the triplets are having a good time. You ask them if they wanted any food (\"Not right now, thank you,\" they reply), attempt to play with them and their toys (only for you to get hit in the face again with a wayward car), and eventually turn on the television to watch a movie with them. Babysitting one child is work enough, but watching over three brothers all the same age definitely is taking its toll on you. At least you're getting paid for this, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you're already exhausted and you start feeling like you need to lie down. Glancing hopefully at the clock, you realize that you've still got a little less than three more hours to go before the boys' parents come in from their night on the town. Looking down, you smile when you see that the boys have all dozed off right there on the carpet. Asleep they almost look like the little angels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something strange starts to happen. At first, you think your vision is just off because of the sleep deprivation, so you rub your eyes very hard. Looking back and focusing on them more clearly, you're stunned to see the boys' bodies start to get bigger. \"What the hell?!\" you say to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You rack your brains trying to come up with this one's name, finally realizing it's Scott, the oldest of the three (by a few minutes). His eyes still droop a little with sleep, but he is quickly getting his energy back. You look at him for a few seconds, trying to make up your mind if whether or not he actually did grow in his sleep like you thought you were seeing. You decide that, sure enough, he's at least three or four inches bigger than he was before. \"Uh, nothing,\" you finally mumble, turning your attention to the other two, who are also starting to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah sits up next, the youngest triplet and the only one of the three who wears glasses,Micah which he had taken off while asleep but now puts back on. \"Hey, he says, looking at Scott, \"what's going on? What happened while we were asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think we grew!\" Scott looks down at his shirt, which, like Micah's, is now tighter than before, revealing an inch's width of bare stomach underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Micah seems to get really excited at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errggh!\" Daniel, the third boy is now finally awake. \"That wasn't very comfortable.\" You look at him and see the imprints of the carpet are still on the side of his face where he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stand up!\" Scott tells his other two brothers. They follow his lead, and they all measure themselves to each other, still virtually equal in height. \"You come here too, Justin!\" Scott motions. Shrugging, you step over to them, and notice that their heads now come up to your chest, whereas before they were closer to your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ARE bigger!\" Micah beams. \"I wonder how that happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're wondering that yourself. Three or four inches isn't a huge deal, you figure, but you bet their parents will be asking--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WhoooOOOAA!\" Scott yells as he sticks out his arms, looking like he's about to fall over. \"I feel WEIRD!\" You look at him with concern, stepping closer to make sure he doesn't pass out or anything. After a second, though, you realize that he's actually getting bigger again! His body is inching upwards, coming closer to your height, as his clothes become tighter and tighter, the cuff of his pants now high above his ankles and his shirt starting to split at the seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stops growing, now only a few inches shorter than you, he looks around the room in amazement. \"I don't know what's happening,\" he says, \"but it's AWESOME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back from him. \"I'm not so sure about that, Scott,\" you say. \"I mean, your clothes are about to burst, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HeeeeEEEYY!\" Daniel yells now. \"I feel all tingly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I felt too!\" Scott beams with pride. \"You're about to get bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words leave Scott's lips, Daniel begins to shoot up, seemingly at a quicker pace than Scott. Within a few seconds, he's overtaken him as the biggest triplet, and you hear the sound of a loud RIIIIPPPPP. Turning around, Daniel notices that his shorts have ripped down the back, revealing red underwear beneath them. He blushes, partially embarrassed. His t-shirt also is starting to tear, and it's showing his entire lean, fit stomach, only coming halfway down his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he's done growing, Daniel's a few inches taller than you are! \"All right!\" He pumps his fists in excitement. \"Now I'm the biggest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops. An eight-year-old kid over six feet tall?! Impossible. Shaking your head, you try to convince yourself you're in a dream, and all you have to do is to wake up from it. You quickly find that this isn't a dream, though, and there's no way for you to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair!\" Micah whines as his brothers are comparing their new large sizes. \"When am I going to get my turn? Why do I have to be the shor-- URK!\" He gulps, and you turn and see his body starting to vibrate. \"Here it comes!\" he cries out. \"It's about time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body nearly explodes with growth, as his clothes quickly get to the point of shredding, and more and more of him come into existence. He leaves Scott in the dust, quickly approaching and then passing your height, and then Daniel's. His shirt and pants loudly rip apart, falling to the floor at his feet, leaving him in a tight-looking pair of boxers, which are strained but seem to be growing at least a little with him, barely keeping the boy clothed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passes seven feet, but his growth shows no signs of stopping there. What's more, in addition to getting taller and bigger proportionally, his body seems to be developing muscle in places no eight-year-old boy should have. His chest and abs firm up slightly, and his arms and legs become thicker, with rounded biceps and thigh muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he's stops growing, he's over eight feet tall, and he has a stunning swimmer's build. His boxers somehow have survived, but they are straining to keep all of the growing boy inside of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" both Scott and Daniel say in unison, whistling at their bigger brother's amazing transformation. They don't look jealous, exactly, but they're definitely impressed by what they see, and now look up to Micah as the obvious leader of the group. For his part, Micah is beaming with pride, posing and flexing to show off his amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys continue to ooo and ahhh over themselves, you quietly begin to step out of the room, heading towards the door. You don't know what to think about what happened, other than it's completely crazy and insane, but you have to do something, call somebody-- but who? Their parents? The police?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get to the phone, though, Micah notices you trying to sneak away. \"Wait, Justin!\" He calls out with a grin. \"You can't go just yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" you gulp, afraid of exactly what he means by that. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" he says as the other boys stand beside him in support...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I feel ANOTHER growth spurt coming on!\" Micah announces, his chest rising and falling rapidly as his breathing got faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blanched at hearing this news. What? Growth? What? Bigger? Bigger than he was now? Not good...Not good! Your thoughts are a chaotic whirl. Everything seems to spin as you try and make sense of this madness! You're forced to give up for now as Micah lets out a bit of a moan, his smile getting wider. \"Ooooh yeah! This feels so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Daniel both stepped back slightly as their youngest brother began to grow again, his head inching up closer and closer to the nine foot ceiling. His boxers were becoming even more strained, but miraculously held out, even with all the pressure being put on them. The button, however, did pop, though nothing could be seen just yet. Micah chuckled as more of his body came into being, his arms stretching out, his legs lengthening, his slightly muscled physique swelling just a bit larger, going from a swimmer's build to a football player's. Daniel whooped and cheered while Scott jumped up shouting, \"Go Micah go!\" They seemed to be enjoying this just as much as he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah's head quickly pressed up against the ceiling, cracks radiating out from the point it touched. You ran forward at this point and shouted, \"Micah! Sit down! Sit down! You're going to go through the roof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah grinned down at you and replied, \"You think? That would be so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it! Do it! Do it!\" Scott and Daniel chanted, eager to see their brother destroy their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please! Your parents will kill me! Just...sit down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah rolled his eyes but, whether it was out of some vestige of respect you still wielded thanks to your age or because you just liked you and didn't want to see you get in trouble, sat down. His growth wasn't done however. He playfully stretched his feet out in front of him, his big feet growing towards he, his head continuing its trip up to the ceiling while his arms encroached on Daniel and Scott. With a smile on his face he reached up and pressed his palms against his brother's chests, able to cover the entire area easily. His brothers gripped the giant fingers pressed against them and started to wrestle, a game Micah always lost before, but was now finding it effortlessly easy to compete. You continued to back slowly away until, finally, Micah's growth came to an end, his head nearly pressed up against the ceiling again. He shifted uncomfortably, shaking the whole house, his right hip crushing the recliner without him realizing it. \"Man...these boxers are way too tight now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, he tore them off his body, tossing them aside.  \"Ah~ Much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and immediately trained your eyes on the floor. It was no big deal for the triplets. They had seen each other naked hundreds of times over their lives. But you didn't feel comfortable in the slightest staring at his exposed crotch. Micah snickered at this and said, \"What's wrong Justin? Afraid you're going to like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately snap your head back up, glaring at Micah. \"No way! It's just gross seeing you naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah bounced his pecs, first one, then the other, and said, \"Heh, yeah right! Like any part of this is gross!\" He flexed his biceps next, each muscle clearly bigger than yours, even if you had been on equal footing. Talk about unfair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget Justin, Micah!\" Daniel said, patting his brother on the side. \"Just enjoy being the biggest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stretched and put his arms behind his head. \"Yeah! Enjoy it while it lasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicah's grin quickly faded as he said, \"Aw...are you guys feeling tingly already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" The answer came from both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap...</span></div></div>",

His growth is even faster now, and to make things worse the heads of Daniel and Scott come into view a second later. \"Sorry, we kept growing,\" Micah laughs.

If it was anything like what had happened with Micah, it probably wouldn't be good for you (or for the integrity of the house). The three boys waited with eager anticipation. \u201dI bet we\u2019ll be even bigger than you, Micah!\u201d Scott said as he elbowed his bigger brother in the thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOh yeah?\u201d Micah smirked. \u201dWell, if so, it won't be for long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Daniel began to inch higher, but as they did, you heard a loud scream coming from outside. Turning towards the window, you saw your friend Brian running out of his house across the street, a look of utter terror on his face. Running towards the window, you flung it open and called out, \u201dBrian! Brian! Over here!\u201d He turned and looked in your direction as you waved your arms to beckon him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you, he sprinted across the street in your direction. As he stopped next to the window, he collapsed to his knees, breathing heavily. \u201dJustin! We\u2019ve got to get out of here. Something horrible--\u201d He stopped, trying to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, afraid that you already knew what the answer was going to be. \"Did something happen to Lee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian looked up at you with a stunned look. \"Yes! He was taking a bath when-- when he started-- started to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his sentence, you felt the ground rumble and the windows in the house start to rattle. From across the street, an awful splintering and cracking sound came from Brian's house, as the roof started to bulge, and you gasped as the walls collapsed outward, revealing two smooth brown-skinned feet that had to be nearly eight feet long! From the hole that had formed in the roof, you saw a very large head covered in messy black hair force its way through, and a loud, ominous giggling filled the air, one that you recognized all too easily as the voice of Brian\u2019s eleven year old brother Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few more seconds, the titanic boy\u2019s seated body had gotten big enough to completely fill the space where a house had once stood, the roofline of the neighboring houses only coming up to his chest level while sitting. He looked around at his surroundings with the widest grin you had ever seen. As your eyes trabeled back down at ground level, you saw that Lee\u2019s cock seemed to be large even for his size, sprawled across the (formerly) front lawn and oozing a steady stream of pre. As he stood up, the ground shook once more, and a car alarm started going off two houses over. \"Now that's more like it!\" Lee's voice boomed across the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were getting way too weird way too fast, and you weren't sure what you could do to stop them. If Lee was this big already, was there a possibility the triplets could grow that huge as well? And was there anything you could do to stop this growth, or even reverse it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned back around to check on the triplets, you saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud collective cheer behind you as Scott and Daniel noticed their growing stature caught your attention at the very moment their cheers became a duet of moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already tall boys were beaming with pride and joy as they rubbed their hands over their bodies as muscles started to show on their young frames, much as they had on the positively huge form of Micah between them. Your gaze follows up Micah\u2019s beautifully carved stomach to his head pressed up against the ceiling, making him bend over. His stature and expression made your shoulders sag and hope vanish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pouting playfully as he looked over at you \u201cAwwr, poor lil guy\u2026 All age and no body to show for it!\u201d He inhaled deeply and puffed out his muscled chest, teasing you to a choir of giggles coming from Scott and Daniel. The two smaller 8 year old twins, had stopped developing their physique - now equally muscular to their giant sibling between them, but they were surely and quickly continuing to inch upwards and outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel, who was the taller of the two starting at over 6 feet, already past your height and barely covered by much other than his wince-worthily snug red briefs, was quickly beginning to outgrow his remaining clothes. His already torn shirt, now wrinkled and folded into the crevices of his newly acquired muscular physique, snapped off his smooth skin followed by a loud childish laugh and exclamation of \u201cYES! Finally grew out of my shirt! And mom said it would take at least a year; I guess she didn\u2019t know I was made to grow!\u201d Scott was not far behind and in fact seemed to catch up to Daniel\u2019s height when his body rapidly pushed up past your eye-level as inch after delightful inch was added onto his body. His shirt almost blew off of his tanned upper body, landing on your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start wondering if you should just keep the shirt covering your face. If that would make the entire \u2018situation\u2019 just \u2026 go away. Like the bad dream it was starting to resemble. But the continuing boyish moans of deep prepubescent voices was telling you, that wasn\u2019t likely to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled the tattered shirt off your face just to stare directly into two unbelievably well-defined pecs, especially for 8-year-olds, surrounding you. With a long ominous ripping sound another piece of garment let you know that it was going beyond capacity. You stare down to the boys\u2019 groins to find the clear outline of their impressive packages about to break through the thinly stretched cloth. Each thread of fabric already pulled so far apart that they were nearly invisible, but whatever \u2018decency\u2019 that they still provided was about to snap off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly ashamed, you turn your gaze away from the display in front of you before you feel a strong hand grasp your chin and guide your vision back \u201cNow now, Justin. You don\u2019t want to miss this! It feels soooo great!\u201d Daniel cheered and bit his lower lip, already reaching 9 feet in height and continuing to grow bigger and taller, getting close to the high ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir red and green briefs exploded off the two boys almost in unison and bounced softly off your tummy before fluttering to the ground. \u201cAnd pop goes the world!\u201d They grinned down at you as their almost foot long and still flaccid members fell audibly against their thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wet fapping sound and rising musk suddenly started to fill the living room, and when Scott and Daniel turned to find the source, you got an eye-full of Micah in all his huge glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had cradled his leg around the couch, cracking the otherwise sturdy furniture into a v-shape and his other leg sprawled sporadically up against the windows in the living room. But what caught your eye was his hand \u2013 Or more specifically what his hand was doing! His young fingers were delicately exploring his eager member, rolling up and down the softly veined surface. His eyes were closed and his face was displaying feelings far beyond his age, his mouth open and panting heavily, making his impressive chest rise and fall. And from his crouched position you notice \u2013 with a bit of fear and admittedly quite a bit of admiration and jealousy \u2013 that his shaft was long enough that on his inhales the head of his cock was nestled comfortably in the strong crevice between the young boys pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Micah? What are you doing?\u201d Came the innocent voices of Scott and Daniel \u201cyou\u2019re not going to pee or anything are you?\u201d They asked, as they continued to surge in height, growing quickly past 12 feet, the ceiling pressing them down to a seated position, one boy on either side of you. They had once again come down to your eye level, but that is poor comfort when you know they\u2019re seated and clearly still growing. That these boys had quickly outgrown you and soon seemed to outgrow the entire house much like the neighbour\u2019s kid-brother Lee had, but still remained childish and ignorant, was very scary to say the least! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott and Daniel began rubbing their hands over their expansive bodies and fondle themselves between their thighs following Micah\u2019s example. They did not want to miss out on anything their slightly younger brother was experiencing, and from the looks of it, he was experiencing quite a lot! Random muscles flex powerfully as all three young boys stroke and fondle themselves, and you feel the room heat up around you as male scents assault your nose. You sighed but couldn\u2019t help but grin a bit at their inexperience with the subject of masturbation. But by the looks of it, Micah, who was the youngest of the three, was the first to truly realize what it meant. <i> This can only be bad.. </i> you manage to think to yourself as a huge spurt of pre flew from Micah\u2019s tip and splattered all over your chest, soaking your shirt completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d You gasp and stumble backwards against a wall, looking down in amazement at the amount of pre sticking to your chest. You look up at three young pleasure-ridden faces staring right back at you. All three boys had reached the same height now, all sitting on the floor with their heads just inches from the ceiling. And as if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, they all sported huge boners and seemed very interested in you now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>very very bad\u2026 </i></span></div></div>",

I'm trying to get to it, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're too short.\"  Alex snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled lowly.  Sure, you got the irony, but the little shrimp was <i>not</i> about to make fun of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it, squirt!  Now get over here.\"  You ordered, bracing yourself on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Alex walked up to you, you quickly crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up.  We really need that key.  So I want you to stand on my shoulders and grab it.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex hesitantly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Hop up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute, but after a few bad starts you managed to stand up with your kid brother on your shoulders.  You winced as the pressure from his weight moved from your whole shoulder to a tiny point on each side.  Great...Alex had to use tippy-toes.  Stupid midget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get it?\"  You ask, grimacing in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think s-OW!\"  Alex suddenly shouted in surprise and pain, falling backward off your shoulders onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  You demand, rounding on him and picking him up by the arm.  \"Did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stupid key <i>shocked</i> me!\"  Alex exclaimed, rubbing his arm where you grabbed him.  \"I barely touched it; it's too high up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's hair was standing on end.  Not hard; he had short spiky hair anyway.  But you could actually smell ozone, like lightning had just struck.  Wincing, your kid brother rubbed his back where he hit the ground, and wiggled in his clothes, trying to pull them back into place around his body after his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was his own fault.  Everyone knew you only wore baggy clothes to bed, or nothing.  Why was Alex wearing such tight clothes for pajamas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.  You blinked, and looked down at your kid brother.  Did he look different?  You could swear that his head didn't reach your chest before.  Nah.  It was probably because his hair was sticking straight up or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's look around.\" you order.  \"Maybe we can find some tongs or something, so we don't have to touch the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to right now?\"  Alex whined.  \"I feel weird.  All tingly, and sore.  Can I rest for a minute?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No!\" You shouted, grabbing Alex by the arm and shoving him towards the door that would lead to the living room. \"Get looking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Okay, okay!\" He shouted back, looking equal parts annoyed and hurt. He rubbed his arm and slowly made his way across the kitchen, shoulders hunched a little. You just rolled your eyes and went in the opposite direction. Your house was nothing super huge or special. It was two stories with the kitchen being the first room you enter as soon as you step through the front door, after moving down a small entrance way, with the laundry room to the immediate left of that and the basement to the immediate right. Passed the kitchen was the dining room which led into the living room on the right. Down the hall adjacent to the living room was your parent's room, the downstairs bathroom, and the staircase leading up to the second floor. The second floor consisted mostly of a hallway that led to your brother's room and your room, which was at the end of the hall, along with the upstairs bathroom and a closet. You weren't sure where you would be able to find anything to use to grab the key, but you decided to stick to the kitchen for now. Maybe you could find a pair of rubber gloves or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran to the sink, Alex dragged himself into the living room, looking around at all the massive furniture and appliances. The TV especially held his interest. He had always been jealous of his friend's big screen TV and he had begged his parents to get one but they had always refused, saying it was far too expensive for them. Here, however, the TV was at least twice the size than the one they had at home! He grinned and began hunting around for the remote, totally forgetting about the original plan of finding something to touch the key with. Touching the key would mean one thing: Leaving. And why would he want to leave? This was still his house right? It's not like they were in any immediate danger. Eventually he found the remote sitting on the coffee table. He put his hands on his hips as he looked up at it, sitting there out of his reach, taunting him. He looked around for something, anything to stand on, but couldn't see anything suitable. The closest thing was the couch and it was far too big for him to climb up on. He idly pulled at his collar which had begun to feel overly tight on him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had reached the sink and were pulling open the cupboard door underneath it. Dish soap, sponges, various household cleaners, paper towels...you shifted all of this aside in your search for a pair of rubber gloves. Just when you were about to lose hope, you shoved a particularly hefty box of soap flakes aside and found a pair of blue rubber gloves stacked on top of each other underneath. You grabbed one of them and ran back towards the door, calling out your brother's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Alex where are you? I got something to help!\" You looked around, but he was nowhere in sight. \"Now where did he go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you set the rubber glove down next to the door and headed into the living room, looking around for your brother. You saw him standing with his arms crossed in front of the coffee table, his head tilted. Getting frustrated, you ran up to him and grabbed him by the arm, turning him around. \"Hey! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about how I could get the remote...\" He said, not looking up into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! I thought I told you to look for something to grab the key with! Don't you want to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, a sullen look coming into his eyes, merely shrugged and said, \"I don't know. Why should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around! Something is definitely wrong about this place! Don't you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just shrugged again and tugged his arm free, taking a few steps back from his brother. \"It's still our house. And that isn't going anywhere anyway. Why can't we just hang out here for a little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in exasperation. Fighting wasn't going to get you anywhere. You took a deep breath and said, \"Why don't we get the key first and then we can hang out for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked surprised at this compromise. \"Really? You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" You said, fingers crossed behind your back. \"Just help me get the key first okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smile on his face, Alex eagerly made his way back to the door. You felt a little bit bad about lying to him, but desperate times called for desperate measures! When you both were back at the door, Alex looked around confused. \"What are we going to use to reach it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The glove!\" You said, crouching down so Alex could get on your shoulders. \"It's right by the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no it's not.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" He said, getting back up and looking over towards your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" He pointed at the door. Sure enough, there was not a rubber glove in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Did someone move it? As far as you knew, you two were the only ones in here... \"Stay here for a second. I'll go get the other one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sighed and sat down, looking bored with the proceedings. You sprinted back to the cupboard and threw the door open again...only to see that everything that had once been in there was now gone! Not a single thing remained! What the hell was going on here? You decided to sprint back to Alex and come up with a new plan. When you got back to where Alex was sitting...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What's the matter, Justin?\" Alex said, as he gave you a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you were, seventeen years old and almost six feet tall, locked up in your gigantic house behind all the closed doors and windows and your parents weren't home. To make matters even worse, you were looking your little, twelve-year-old brother Alex straight in the face! Even though he was supposed to be five years younger than you, he was exactly your height! What the heck was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! You... You're huge!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Justin?\" he replied calmly, like there wasn't anything unusual about him being the same height as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at yourself! You're just as tall as I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'So?'\" you said angrily. \"You're freaking five years younger than me, dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I've always been kinda on the big side! Jeez Justin, chill out!\" Alex said as he rolled his eyes. \"I'm gonna watch some TV man, you're freaking me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Help me get the key! Don't you wanna get outta here?\" you shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? This is our house! I'm comfortable here! I want to watch TV! Why don't you just go to your room and chillax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there with your jaw open wide. You shook your head and marched off to your bedroom, where everything looked the same except for the fact that everything was indeed twice as big as it was before: your desk was higher and bigger and wider than before; your bed was much bigger than it was earlier, your dresser was huge and your closet was much taller and wider. Luckily, however, when you opened the closet, all your clothes were still there and your shoes were still on the floor. Strangely enough, all your clothes were still made to fit your size. So, why did it seem like everything else had gotten bigger? Something didn't seem right. The house truly was the same house as yours, but everything had grown except you. However, something weird appeared to be going on with your little brother, and he didn't seem to think it was weird that he was becoming bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just crawled on your big bed and lay down for awhile. For some strange reason, Alex was in no hurry at all to get out of the house and he seemed to be perfectly happy to stay here. Not only that, he seemed to just fall in love with the giant flatscreen TV set in the living room, which you never had before. Where did that come from and how did it get in the house? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you just dozed off and took a short nap. When you woke up, your throat was dry and your stomach was growling. You got up and realized that everything was still big in your room, so you quietly walked back to the living room where Alex was still watching the giant flatscreen TV. He lay on the couch and he had covered himself with a blanket, so you couldn't notice anything different about him at first. When you walked to the kitchen, you opened the giant fridge and you got out the carton of milk and you grabbed a glass out of the cupboard that you were barely able to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Do you want something to eat or to drink?\" you asked your little bro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm starving!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex got up and walked over to you. You didn't see him at first because he was standing behind you. When you turned around, you were startled when you were looking him straight in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOOAA!!\" you screamed, as you looked at his pectorals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it Justin! It's only ME!\" Alex yelled back, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, looking UP at Alex, your twelve-year-old brother, who was now at least eight inches taller than you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALEX! What the heck! What.... You... You GREW!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just let out a deep sigh as he rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go again...\" he groaned. \"Can you pass me the milk, Justin? I'm REALLY thirsty over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed him the glass, practically trembling with fear as you looked up to your giant brother. Goodness, he was BIG. He was at least 6 foot 8 inches tall, but he still looked exactly the same as before. He still looked like a twelve year-old boy, but much BIGGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find something to eat, okay?\" he said. \"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared at him, looking up, with your jaw open wide. You could just imagine how much food he could consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-sure, Alex...\" you replied, as you turned around and opened the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to make the both of you some sandwiches. Dinner with your new, giant-size brother would be very interesting, to say the least...</span></div></div>",

Hey Alex exclaimed stop staring at me and make my sandwiches he yelled. Justin startled said okay (gulp) take it easy bro. So Justin made two more sandwiches and poured Alex another glass of milk. He handed Alex the sandwiches and milk. Thanks Alex spoke and then he patted Justin's head messing his hair up. Your wel-come. So finally after four sandwiches and two full glasses of milk Alex got up. Hey shrimp why don't put my dishes away for me. I'm going to take a shower and then we can play a game before we go to bed. Sure go ahead you say nervously not wanting to annoy your now bigger little brother. Wow you think to yourself he sure has a big appetite. You put the dishes in the dishwasher and then you head upstairs and as you pass the bathroom you tell your brother that your waiting for him in your room. Alright he says I'll be out soon. So you wait for about ten minutes laying on your bed. Then you hear what sounds like really heavy thuds and when your brother stopped and stood in your doorway Justin's mouth dropped open in shock. What's wrong with you, Alex said. Justin got up slowly and stood in front of his brother. You grew again, don't you notice it? Justin now only comes up to Alex's belly button. about 12ft.<br>\r\nAlex just shrugged his shoulders and he picked Justin up with both arms and carried him to his room. Justin whined please put me down. Alex dropped him on his bed and he then shut the door now its time for our game. </span></div></div>",

Then Alex went ding ding and began to charge toward Justin. Alex what are you doing? Justin asked. Um Duh, Justin we are having a wrestling match. Alex then lunged towards his little bro. Justin ducked and jumped out of the wayof his brothers gorilla like arms. Justin then ran towards the door and when he did Alex tripped him and fell hard with a thud. Justin was stunned and when he started to stand up Alex grabbed him from behind and picked him up like he was a child. He then slammed Justin down on his bed. Justin cried in pain and was winded. Alex then proceeded to pummel his midget little brother. Justin tried to fight back but Alex was way too big and strong for him to handle. After about an hour went by Justin was exhausted and that when Alex finished him with a devastating huge splash that nearly crushed Justin. Alex then couted to three and the match was over. Yeah Alex raised his hands in victory and announced the winner of the match as Alex the mighty prevails. Justin just layed there tired and in a lot of pain. Alex then walked and helped Justin up. Woh! That was fun! Alex stated. Justin still soar stood looking up at Alex. Awww! Don't look at me like that Alex teased, You are such a little wimp bro. Justin started to walk away and went to his room and collapsed on to his bed. He layed there for about 5 minutes and then he drifted off to sleep. Meanwhile Alex layed on his bed smiling that he had conquered his Big brother. Boy I can't for tomorrow for I have more plans to torture Justin. Alex then rolled on to his side and went fast asleep.

Alex spoke Now there's no need to that \" little\" brother. You had hard time breathing as Alex's hand was bigger than your whole head. He was kind enough to let you see at least. Wow! Justin thought to himself he grew at three feet over night making him around 15ft tall. Alright runt he spoke I have a friend coming over to spend the night and I need you to clean my room. Think you can that.  He then removed his hand and picked you up with one hand and carried you under his arm. You yell put me down Alex, but since he outsizes you, he ignores you. Justin began to wonder why is my 12 year old brother growing? You both arrive at his room and you were told to start cleaning or else. Thats when you notice that not only is he growing but everything in room was bigger too. His clothes, shoes, bed, dresser, everything was bigger. You started by picking up his clothes, his jeans were about the same size as you were and his skateshoes were so heavy you could only carry one at a time and they were about four feet long. As you were cleaning Alex was taking a shower. After you picked his belongings, you make his bed. It was like small mountain as you had to climb it to make it. So as you were finishing you hear Alex heading back. He entered the room and walked over to his dresser. When he turned around, he looks over at Justin and asks what are you staring at? Justin replied um sorry! Alex then walks over and shoves Justin down on his bed. He then takes his foot and places it on Justin's mid-section. Now Alex stated stop staring at me if you know whats good for you. Justin gasped and said he was sorry. Alex then lifted his foot off and said it was ok after all he didn't blame Justin for wanting to stare, after all he was taller and better looking then he was as well as the fact he was supposed to be younger than Justin. Now Alex stated I need you to............<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You can fix us some eggs with bacon and toast. You better not burn it either or you'll get my size 22 sneakers up your butt. Alright calm down Big Guy I won't burn them. Justin quickly ran to the kitchen and grabbed 4 eggs huge eggs from the fridge and bacon which was as long as a bed sheet and the eggs were as big as small boulders. Man even the food was bigger now and heavier. But somehow Justin managed to get the four eggs in a frying pan and cooked scrambled eggs. In another he cooked the strips of bacon. He took about ten minutes to cook everything and finally he grabbed four slices of bread and carried them over to the toaster. Wooh! That was tough but I managed to get it done in time. Alex came walking into the kitchen and he smiled at Justin. He placed a large hand on his \"little brothers\" shoulder, nice work runt you deserve a reward. Thanks Master Alex, Justin said with relief. But first go answer the door would you then you can eat with us bro. Justin walked to the door as Jacob was Knocking on it with a heavy thud. Justin opened the door and said come in Jacob. To Justin's surprise Jacob was about as tall (around 16ft) as Alex. Hey Justin! Jacob stated, where's Alex? Um he's in the kitchen waiting for you. Jacob stepped past Justin and walked to the kitchen and greeted his best friend. Justin soon followed behind him. Alex noticed the confused look on Justin's face. What's the matter now? How did you both get so tall, I mean day before yesterday you were around 5ft and now you and him both are twice as tall as I am. Oh be quiet Justin I told you to stop that. We have always been taller than you, now come and sit with us. I made you a bowl of cereal. Justin did as he was asked and sat between the two towering 12 year olds and they all enjoyed their breakfast.

Justin was humiliated being carried like a football by his not little brother. Jacob and Alex rode a shuttle bus to the mall. Alex made Justin sit between him and Jacob, and said you better behave or else runt. After 30 minutes or so they arrived and were dropped off at the main entrance to the mall. Alex and Jacob walked with Justin right in front of them. They walked towards the shoe store which was about 10 minutes. The boys were checking out different brands and styles. A clerk approached them and he asked if they needed help. Justin looked at this clerk who was a young man around his age but he was his size. Alex looked down at this clerk you got anything like this in my size. It was a pair of hightops, black and blue with white trimmings. Yes I do have one in your size be right back, Justin looked at the clerk didn't he realize Alex  and Jacob were not your average sized pre teens. But then Justin looked around the store and out into the mall. All the boys around the same age were giants compared to others. Hey get over here! Alex ordered. The boys were both sitting on benches trying on their new sneakers. Justin hurried and as he did he was bumped into by another boy who was around 10 years old. Oof! Sorry little fella didn't see you. The boy pulled Justin up. Justin stared up at the boy. He had to be around 10 ft. That that's okay! Justin stuttered. The boy walked away.  Alex and Jacob had already picked out their sneakers when Justin got to them. Where were you? Alex asked. I thought I told you to stay with us! Now you will be sorry you disobeyed us. Justin was sweating a little, he tried to explain but his brother didn't want to hear it. They stopped at the food court and had lunch but the boys told Justin he had to go without. After they got done they headed back home and when they got back they punished Justin some more by making him? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Justin was nervous for he had angered Alex and his friend by not staying with them while they shopped. After lunch they rode back on the bus in which he was forced to sit between the two boys. Alex for the entire trip kept looking down at Justin and every once in awhile he would make a face that made Justin nervous. Then when the bus go to their home Alex made Justin walk in back of him while Jacob walked behind him like he was going to prison or something. Not only that Alex made Justin carry his heavy new sneaks he bought.  When they entered the house Alex grabbed the sneakers from Justin and set them down by the stairway. Justin was then picked up and carried upstairs like he was a toddler. Justin was scared at this point for he knew a punishment was coming but also it seemed like once again Alex had grown again like another 5ft. Alex took Justin into his massive boy cave and set him on his bed. His bed was huge and so was everything else in his room. It was a typical messy room fit for growing 12 year old boy. Please Alex, Justin spoke, I'm sorry for not staying with you like you asked. Alex then took his hand and covered Justin's mouth, SHHHH!. You see my room runt! You will clean it for me! Justin's jaw dropped. Justin tried to protest, but Alex threatened that if he didn't do it, he would be punished far worse. So Justin had no choice but take the less severe punishment. You will make my bed, pick up my dirty clothes, and put away my stuff and if you do that you will get something for all your hardwork. Know get to work he ordered. He then left Justin to himself while he went downstairs to play video games with Jacob. Justin started with making Alex's enormous bed and it wasn't easy he used all his strength to lift his brother's pillows and slide the sheet under them. Ugh! these are heavy, he then had the hardest time getting the comforter up over the pillows. Wow good thing he brother had a single bed and not anything bigger or would've taken longer. He then stopped and rested for a few minutes he wiped the sweat off his face, now what should I do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Next Justin decided to put away his brothers toys and sports equipment for two reasons there was not as much and he dreaded picking up Alex's dirty, smelly clothes like his socks and underpants. So jumped off his brother's bed landing on a pair of shorts that were as big as a circus tent. He started with Alex's soccer ball which took some effort to push, but he got into the closet and then came Alex's knee pads and cleats. The cleats were heavy and dirty but he somehow got the strength to get them under his big little brother's bed. He rested and then he started with Alex's baseball glove and ball, think goodness Alex put his bat where it belongs, there was no way Justin could put that away and then finally he put his toys away like some action figures, some legos and his I pod. As he was finishing up Alex opened the door and stared down at Justin and then he looked around, Just checking! He said. Nice job so far \"little\" brother! Alex reached down and patted Justin's head like he was a dog or something. Thanks! Justin responded back. Now finish up little one and then you'll get a reward. Where's Jacob? Justin asked. He's using the bathroom and then him and I are going to the backyard so we can ride our skateboards for about an hour. You should be finished by then right? as he looked down at Justin and standing over him. (gulp) Justin swallowed, yes I will be done by then. So Alex left and Justin got back to his chore. Picking up the trash and dirty clothes he first started with the wadded up pieces of paper and he lifted up and dropped them into Alex's wastebasket. That took about 20 minutes and then he got to what he dreaded most. Alex's clothes he started with the three t-shirts which he dragged to his laundry basket and one at a time dropped them in. Whew! Justin wiped the sweat off his forehead, then he went for the 2 pairs of shorts and then the 4 pairs of underpants which smelled of sweat and urine. Then came the 4 pairs of socks which were the worst smelling of all. He had done it. He smiled as he looked around Alex's room and just in time as he heard Alex and Jacob climbing up the stairs headed for the bedroom. Justin sat down on Alex's rug in front of his bed and waited. The door opened and in stepped the 2 boys. Jacob sat down at Alex's desk and Alex kneeled down and he smiled at Justin. I knew you would do it. Put it there little bro, he reached his fist out and Justin bumped it with his. Now here is your reward. </span></div></div>",

It was almost as long as his whole arm, reaching from his palms up to the hems of his oddly short sleeves.  The buttons looked huge against his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just turned around and it was there on the floor, where you said the glove was!\"  He frowned, tugging on the shoulders of his shirt.  \"It was on the coffee table, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird.\"  You muttered, pulling the controller from his hands.  You ignored his brief protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First the gloves disappear, and now the remote moved on its own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we do about it?\"  Alex asked, snatching the remote back from you with a scowl and standing up in the doorway.  \"I mean, <i>I'm</i> not getting shocked again, and watching a giant TV sounds kinda fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, your little brother promptly turned on his heel and marched back toward the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it,\" you growled, walking quickly to catch up with the little creep.  \"We had a deal, and if you think I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping mid-rant, you quickly traced along your brother's finger and up to the coffee table.  From below, you could easily look through it's glass top to see the gloves sitting right in the middle.  You blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" you whispered seriously, \"I think something very, very weird is going on.  And not just giant house weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is someone <i>messing</i> with us?\"  Your brother asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden, sharp 'pop' sound startled both of you.  Alex looked down, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're doing something to my clothes, too.\"  He said hesitantly, staring at the popped button of his jeans, which rested below a bare sliver of skin showing under the hem of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked him up and down.  It <i>did</i> look like something was shrinking his clothes; his shirt was too short and tight, his pants were showing an inch or so of bare ankle, and now his pants had popped open.  You quickly checked yourself out; no, you seemed fine.  But then, you liked wearing baggy clothes; maybe you just couldn't tell yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen pranks like that,\" you nodded, but looked up sharply at the remote, \"but not like <i>that</i>.  And we haven't seen anybody!  Are they invisible or something?  And how are we supposed to get out of here without the gloves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy.\"  Alex brightened, and firmly pushed down on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were in a crouch, your brother simply repeated what you'd tried on the door.  You grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh.  And the table's way lower, this'll be a piece of cake.\"  You quickly winced as Alex shifted his weight.  \"Oof.  Seriously, kid, after this you are laying off the cake.  I think my shoulders are still bruised from last time; you're the heaviest midget ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"  Alex grumbled as he stretched his arms out above the table.  At least he didn't need tiptoes this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stifled a yelp as he raised up one foot - putting all his weight on the other one! - and tried to swing it up over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't...reach!\"  Your brother groaned, frustrated.  Even if the tabletop was within easy reach, your brother couldn't get enough of a grip on the slippery glass to pull himself up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we do?\"  He asked morosely as the two of you flopped down on the carpet below the table in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged.  You were officially out of ideas.  Shooting a glance over, you offered your brother a weak grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch some awesome big screen TV?\"  You suggested idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes lit up like christmas.  You couldn't help smiling too, thought that might have been because he accidentally ripped the sleeve of his favorite shirt when he pumped his arm in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the remote, you checked to see if the power button was in the right place.  You frowned.  Alex, waiting impatiently for you to do something, looked over to see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the same big red button in the corner like always, but it didn't say power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex turned to look you in they eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is 'Click Me' supposed to mean?\"</span></div></div>",

You just groaned, running your hand down your face. \"It's gonna be a long day, I just know it...\" You grumbled to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the time being, it was probably best to let Alex get a little rest. You would just have to be sure to work him even harder when he woke up! Now, however, with the rubber glove gone, you had to think of something else that he could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubber would probably work best...\" You thought, stroking your chin, \"Wood doesn't conduct electricity either... But it does burn... And then there's also plastic... I think...\" You began to walk on, leaving your brother behind as you tried to find what you could use next. After all, using the wrong thing could result in one of you getting an even worse shock than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you moved about, you couldn't quite shake the feeling of being watched. This was a big house after all, someone had to live in it! The feeling gave you goosebumps, but you'd do your best to bravely face whatever came your way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, not too far away, a large boy was watching as you wandered through the house. \"Whoa...\" he mumbled to himself, \"I don't remember a toy like that... I wonder if he's that new action figure mom bought me...?\" he whispered to himself. Just as you were about to whip around, the boy hid back behind the corner. He waited a good few seconds before peering around once more. You had continued to wander onwards. As you did, the giant boy held up the rubber glove. \"If he's my action figure, then why's this accessory so huge?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to wander, soon making it into what appeared to be someone's bedroom. Looking around the room, you spotted a toy gun that shot little discs. It would take a careful hand, but surely you could use that! You ran over near a toy box, where you picked up the gun. It was perfect for someone your size! Just as things were looking up, you heard a slam from behind. Turning around, you saw that the door was closed! And standing in the doorway was some colossal boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" you said under your breath, still holding the gun as your neck slowly craned up, looking up at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as appearances, he must have been at least twice your height! He even looked big considering the rest of the house; if you had somehow been on scale with everything else ithe room, he'd still be over six and a half feet tall, much too big for a boy his age. His hair was messy and milky brown, while his eyes stuck out like two green emeralds. He wore a blue tanktop, and black khaki shorts. He was barefoot, but that was a given after all; he was in his own house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here new toy...\" He said softly, making his way toward you. Each footstep created a loud thud that only grew louder with each passing second! Soon, it shook the ground where you stood! You dropped the toy gun and tried to make a run for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not a toy!\" you shouted out as you fled, but the boy couldn't hear. The giant's eyes sparkled with anticipation as he closed in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCornered, you had nowhere to run! Like a rat with its back to the wall, you turned and looked all the way up, only to see a large hand scoop you up! The boy grinned at you as you were lifted to the boy's face, which left you a bit dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what you do...?\" The boy said quietly to himself as he was looking at you.</span></div></div>",

Looking down at his pants -- well, now, shorts -- he saw that they had split along the sides as he stretched, revealing his blue boxer-briefs. \"Darn clothes,\" he thought. \"That's the last time I let Justin throw my stuff in with his laundry; it always ends up shrunk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up and looked around the kitchen, though, he realized something was different. \"Hey,\" he thought to himself, \"did I get taller since I went to sleep?\" He seemed to be more level with the tops of the kitchen table, able to And where did that key we were trying to get go?\" he wondered as he looked up at the empty peg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed again, and this time, fortunately, Alex heard you. \"Justin?\" he yelled, starting to panic. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm upstairs! Please help! I've been--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour large captor had decided that he had enough of you screaming, and took some duct tape from his drawer and wrapped a large (to you at least) piece around your mouth. You tried to scream, but it was too muffled to make out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what kind of fun should I have with you?\" the boy asked aloud as he sat you on the top of his desk, what looked to be about eight feet off of the ground. He kept his hand against your body, pinning you to the desk, his grip vice-like, leaving you unable to resist or flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a mischievous, if not evil, smile cross his face. \"How would you like to feel the bottom of my foot for a while?\" he asked. You struggled in vain to wriggle free as he picked you up again, bending down and sitting you on the floor. Before he let go, he moved his foot on top of you, which had a bit of a smell and seemed to be huge even considering everything else large about this boy, nearly covering your entire torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe inched up his toes towards your face, but right before he was about to cover your mouth with his big toe, you heard the door open, and he spun around to see your brother come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" the boy's eyes lit up. \"What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Alex asked as he looked up at the giant. \"What do you mean, Hunter? Why are you in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Alex?\" Hunter said, grinning. \"this is my house and my room. Remember? We were having a sleepover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were?\" Alex scratched his head, looking around. \"Since when is your house -- and you, for that matter -- so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed, causing him to finally lift his foot from your body, freeing you. You scampered over as fast as you could towards your brother, ripping the duct tape from your mouth. \"You know this kid?\" you said to Alex. \"He's crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant started to move towards you, you started to cower. Looking over at your brother, you had another bit of shock to see that he was now a good three or four inches taller than you! His clothes had become skin-tight and were starting to tear at the seams. \"What happened to you?\" you whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just woke up like this!\" he hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Hunter said as he sat down on the bed near the two of you, his face looming over, \"I think I'd rather show you how I got so big. Watch this!\" He reached into his drawer and pulled out a key-- wait, not just a key. THE Key! The same one you and Alex had been trying to get downstairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How-- where did you--?\" your voice stuttered as you tried to make sense of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's best to not ask questions, little toy,\" Hunter said as he held the key in his hands, and you saw the hairs on his skin and on the top of his head begin to stand on their ends. He seemed to be a little in pain, obviously getting some sort of electrical shock that got worse over time, but he held on to the key for a full ten seconds until he finally had to drop it on the bed. \"Wheeew,\" Hunter said, wiping his brow. \"That hurt like crazy! But it was worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean,\" you asked, \"worth it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout answering, or perhaps IN answer, Hunter stood up and posed with his hands on his hips. As soon as he did this, you could tell his already-large body was beginning to increase in size! His toes were pushing towards you as his head got closer and closer to the ceiling. He went from looming to towering over you, as you went from being eye-level with his waist, to his crotch, then to his knees. The tank top and shorts he was wearing seemed to grow with him, but couldn't quite keep up to his growth rate, ending up snug on the boy and revealing his fit, lean belly as the shirt rode up on it. Finally, he seemed to stop growing for a while when his head touched the ceiling, and he stood there, excited as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Alex?\" he asked. \"Wanna try it with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in horror at your little brother as Hunter bent down, holding out the key to Alex and then dropping it on the ground. You knew your brother had resented you a little, even for telling him what to do while the two of you were searching for a way out of this place, but you wouldn't think he was crazy enough to -- </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex looked up at Hunter and then down at you, biting his lower lip slightly. It seemed like he was thinking hard about his decision. Hunter had a knowing smirk on his face, as though there was no possible way Alex wouldn't immediately do as he said. You had nothing but ill feelings toward this massive kid. He weren't even sure who he was! You'd certainly never seen him before. Alex seemed to be on familiar terms with him so it was a safe bet that they were friends. There was still too many questions though. Why did this kid think that this was his room in his house? It was clearly yours and Alex's! The pictures on the fridge, the layout, and all the items in the house being in their proper place confirmed that. That was all without factoring in the size of the house, Hunter's size, and the strange key that seemed to be the cause of all this. Just what was this place? Were you dreaming? You pinched yourself on the arm to test it, a sharp pain indicating that, no, this wasn't a dream. Or at least not your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you recalled a scene from Alice Through the Looking Glass. She was having a conversation with Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee when she noticed a terribly loud sound. It was from the Red King who was sleeping nearby. The Tweedle's both put forth the idea that the entire world, including Alice, was a dream and that if the Red King should ever wake up she would cease to exist. At the end of the story, Alice herself wakes up and wonders what that would mean for all the people and things she had met during her adventure. Did they cease to exist? Or did they never exist in the first place? Did they only exist long enough to provide Alice with her dream? It was a question that had always caught your attention, even after the rest of the story faded to obscurity (there was a unicorn and a goat or...something, you could never remember. Books weren't your thing anyway). What if that was what was happening right now? Was Alex or even Hunter dreaming and this entire house and everyone in it nothing more than a fabrication? Dream logic would go a long way to explaining the oddities here...you shook your head and pushed away these thoughts. No way! You were not just some fantasy cooked up by some dumb kid! That key was your only hope of escape and you weren't about to let it pass you by! You ran over to where the key was and reached your hand out for it...just as Alex snatched it up in his own hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'll join y-y-YEOUCH!\" He yelled, the electric shock making him flinch, dropping the key...right on your head! The key was surprisingly dense for such an average looking thing, causing you to see stars. You stumbled a bit, looking up at Alex in a daze. He was frowning at his hand, flexing his fingers as the last of the pain from the shock left him...before starting to grow! You could only watch helplessly as your formerly little brother began to stretch up, taller and wider, his already torn shorts ripping apart entirely, leaving him only in a pair of tight boxer briefs which looked like they wouldn't be surviving much longer. His shirt, which had already grown too small for him, barely covering his chest, quickly ripped apart as well, his shoulders and arms too much for the sleeves to handle while a long tear ran down the center of it, the scraps falling to the floor around you. Suddenly, his head bumped against the ceiling eliciting a little yelp from Alex. \"Wow....\" he said, looking around in amazement. \"Everything looks so...small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter laughed and shoved his foot against your back, sending you falling face down to the floor. \"Especially this little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed and crouched down, roughly grabbing the back of your shirt and forcing you back on your feet. \"Hey there little brother! How do you like being the small one huh?\" He poked you rather hard in the chest, forcing you to step back. \"Not so tough now are you? Now you can't boss me around anymore and be mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Alex! I was just messing around! It's what brothers do right? Have some fun?\" You knew perfectly well that nothing you ever did with him had been \"fun\", at least not in his eyes. But you were hoping he would have mercy on you. His smile just widened at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's true! And now it's MY turn to have fun with YOU!\" His smile was a full blown grin at this point. You gulped and decided to throw caution to the winds. You turned on your heels, snatched the key and made a run for the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had barely taken five steps before Hunter grabbed you by the back of your shirt and hoisted you into the air, his other arm snaking around your chest and pulling you close against his body. \"Oh no you don't! You're not getting away THAT easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately tried to struggle, the key heating up in your hand. Unfortunately for you, Hunter's grip was too strong. He may have only been a little kid, but at his height and with his proportions he was far heavier and stronger than he had any right to be. You might as well have been a toddler in the arms of an adult! Suddenly, an electric shock coursed through your body, causing you to instinctively drop the key. Alex groaned and said, \"Hunter! You let him use the key!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter merely grinned and said, \"Don't worry about it! That key won't work for him! At least, not the way he thinks it will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt light headed. What did Hunter mean? Was his grip getting tighter? You looked down at his arm and were shocked to see it looked bigger! Was he growing again? You looked down to see if you were getting further away from the ground, but instead caught sight of your shoes, socks, and pants seemingly growing larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool! He's getting smaller!\" Alex said happily, moving in closer for a better look, his foot resting on top of the key. Alex yelped as the key shocked him yet again, his body expanding a few inches taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, careful!\" Hunter said, picking up the key and sticking it back in the drawer. \"We gotta be careful with that key!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gently pushed Hunter and said, \"You're just jealous I'm taller now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter pushed back and laughed. \"Am not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You totally are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, keep talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two giant kids kept shoving each other you were caught in the middle, getting crushed between their bodies. You pushed desperately against your brother's bare torso with both hands and feet but he didn't even notice you! It didn't help that you were now several inches shorter than your normal height, your now too large clothes draping awkwardly on your body. This whole situation was getting worse by the minute!</span></div></div>",

Without warning, Hunter suddenly jumped down on Alex, and the two boys began to have a playful wrestling match. There was laughing and grunts, as you were pinned tight to your brother's, surprisingly soft, chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued to rumble, dominance constantly shifting between the two. Just when it seemed like a perfect chance to escape, the boys maneuvered so you were pinned down by one of them again! The cycle never seemed to end, but at this point, you were grateful just to still be alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex got Hunter in a leg lock. Then Hunter had Alex in a half nelson. Alex, with his new strength, lifted Hunter in the air. Hunter later got Alex in a grapple, but Alex turned it around, and soon he had pinned Hunter down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One! Two!\" Alex began to count. Hunter was really starting to struggle, but to no avail. \"Three!\" With that, Alex popped up, beating on his chest like an ape. \"I win! I win!\" He cheered happily. Hunter just grinned. He didn't even notice as you were on his groin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" He chuckled. He may have lost, but at least he was a good sport about it. Alex soon sat down, and the two boys were breathing heavily, taking a break after such an intense match. The two just smiled at each other happily, before their worn expressions returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... fun...\" Alex panted, his whole body a slight shade of red. Hunter, who was slightly more tanned than Alex, was sweating like crazy! Even on his crotch, you could smell a strong boy musk permeating the air. It carried a scent that was almost addicting, as you couldn't stop your nose from sniffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait... Where's my brother...?\" Alex said, looking around. \"Aw man! Did we let him escape!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked around for a bit, as you were too enticed by Hunter's boy musk to notice. Hunter soon noticed you and smiled. \"There he is!\" He said, pointing below his waist. Alex looked and saw you, a faint smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good... If I lost him, my mom would kill me...\" Alex said softly, as he finally started to get his second wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Alex...\" Hunter began, \"That was a great match... But now I'm tired... You wanna...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah! Let's do it!\" Alex exclaimed, looking down at Hunter's groin (which, you assumed, meant he was looking at you\u2026 though you weren't sure by the way he licked his lips). Hunter had to scoot up against the wall to get his feet up on the bed, being too big to lie down on it. This meant there wasn't enough room for Alex, so he knelt down at the end by Hunter's feet to watch. Hunter peeled you off of his groin and placed you on the bed, right in between his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of giving these two massive preteen boys a foot massage seemed abhorrent to your brain, especially since one of them was your annoying (formerly) little brother. But something was going on inside of you, possibly from the scent in the air, possibly from something else. As much as you hated to admit it, part of you had started to actually feel like you wanted to help them, to please them in any way possible. The thought of it even started stirring certain feelings that were usually only meant for your girlfriend (or, really, any other modestly attractive girl you happened to see in person or anywhere else). You tried to shake them off, but that just made them more powerful. If this was a dream, you hoped you woke up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't really dawned on you yet just how big the two boys actually were until this point. His feet were almost as tall as you were! You were expecting their stench to be overpowering, but actually the odor was pleasant and oddly intoxicating. Stretching out along the bed were two long, smooth legs leading to his shorts, his torso covered by the stretched-out tank-top, and the smiling face rising above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Justin,\" Alex said, with a playful smile, as he pulled your loose shirt off with one motion, leaving your muscled chest uncovered. He then shoved you towards his friend's feet, his large fingers pressing into your back. \"Get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unable to resist and did as your brother commanded. Hunter started to wiggle his toes as you began rubbing your hands up and down them. The undersides of his feet were rough and course, like someone who had gone barefoot outside a lot. You found a couple of spots that, when you hit them, caused Hunter to moan a bit. Wanting to do a good job and not piss off the giant, you focused more on those areas, causing Hunter to squirm as you did so. The movement of his legs and feet nearly sent you flying off of the bed at one point, but you were able to grab on to his toes and keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm,\" Hunter said after a few minutes, \"that was great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" Alex said as he playfully tugged at Hunter's arm. Grinning in agreement, Hunter swung his feet around on the floor and got off the bed, making room. Alex jumped up and landed on the bed with a big PLOP, sending you flying into the air. Luckily, you landed back on the bed, the mattress and blankets cushioning your fall. As he got into position, you noticed that his underwear, snug as it was, now seemed to be riding down his hips a bit. You saw a small sliver of the area below his waist, and soft and smooth as it looked, you fought the urge to see any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alex was ready, and you started massaging his feet for him. His were even bigger than Hunter's, a little longer than you were tall, and you could only concentrate on one at a time. This didn't seem to bother Alex any, though, as he seemed to be enjoying it even more than Hunter had. You tried to work the toes with one hand, using the other to push into the soles, which were much softer and smoother than Hunter's had been. He moved around even more, almost kicking outwards at some point, but you had become quick and agile and could time your movements to avoid your brother's pleasure-spasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started to switch from his right foot to his left, you realized you had been focusing so much on Alex, you had lost track of Hunter. Looking behind you quickly, you noticed he was no longer there. You wondered where he went. Shrugging, you guessed he went downstairs for a sandwich or something. Anyways, it couldn't be important, so you started to turn back to Alex's feet, when something interrupted your thoughts. The key! You turned your head to the drawer Hunter had placed the key in, horrified to see that it was opened and empty. You started to panic as you tried to figure out where the key could've gone to, but it only took a moment to get your answer.</span></div></div>",

To your dismay, the scene was that of your colossal brother, seven times your height, waving a (comparatively) miniscule key pinched between his thumb and index finger with a grin spread out on his face. He began talking as steam seemed to erupt from the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, little guy, but this thing is mine. Hey, bro, how- ow!- how big do- ah!- do you think I'll aah, AAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe key let out several bolts of energy while Alex was talking, each larger than the last, until Alex was finally forced to drop the key- onto his stomach. He let out a yowl of pain as you saw the key begin to glow red, then brushed it off reflexively- in your direction. You tried not to make too much motion as he went about blowing on the burns on his fingers, but when you started seeing his feet expand and the bed started creaking in complaint, you knew it was time to go. You don't know what's going on here at all, but you do know that that key is part of it, and that every second it remains in your gigantic brother's possession, things were going to get worse. You grab the key with both hands lying next to your brother's swelling calf muscles and run for it, out of the room and down the corridor. You hear a bellowing \"HEY!\" in the background, along with a THUMP. It sounds like Alex has realized the flaw in growing inside- he's pinned himself inside Alex/Hunter's room! You can already feel the key getting warm in your arms, but it doesn't matter- all that's important is finding a hiding place before it's too late. Various other WHAMS fill the air as more of Alex's appendages forcibly make space in the cramped room. You juggle briefly whether to hide in the closet, go downstairs, or hide in your room when your decision is interrupted.</span></div></div>",

Alex sat up and looked around with a surprised look on his face. \"What the heck is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head as the room started to shake even more violently. You stumbled a bit as you tried to keep your balance. Something was definitely going on downstairs! You were about to rush out the door when you realized that it was closed and you were now far too small to reach the knob. Frustration built up inside you until you felt like screaming! Being so short sucked more than you ever thought it could! You rushed over to Alex and slapped his stomach, hard with your tiny palm. Alex winced and yelped a little, glaring down at you. \"Get downstairs and find out what that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's glare got darker as his fist closed around your body. \"Shut up! You're not ordering me around any more remember?\" He squeezed you rather hard, your ribs compressing painfully. However, even though his grip was quite crushing, you were perfectly fine. Your tiny body was quite resilient. Suddenly Alex held you close to his chest. \"Wow...look at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked as he pointed at the center of the room. It seemed like it was...bulging up! With a loud CRACK sound, more of the floor started bulging up, before the carpet split open like a rotten fruit. The room was now shaking violently, the furniture jumping and rattling around, posters peeling from the walls while the various items on the dresser clattered to the floor. Finally, the floor blew upward, wood, plaster, and cement firing in all directions. Alex actually shielded you with his body, turning his back to the flying debris. He shakily turned around and you were finally able to see what had caused this damage. Hunter's massive face was grinning at you, his head nearly filling the whole room, his head pressed tightly against the roof of his room. More pieces of the floor fell as Hunter shifted around a little, getting more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining a little courage, you managed to break free of Alex's grasp and look down through the floor. Hunter's feet had wreaked havoc in the living room down below. The couch was crushed under his right foot while the TV had been smashed by his left big toe. His shorts were shorter than ever on his athletic body, his tank top now skin tight and barely covering his chest. His shoulders were pressed up against the ceiling of the first floor. He carelessly blew a strand of hair out of his face and said, \"That worked better than I thought it would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blinked and looked annoyed. \"No fair! I want to get bigger too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter shook his finger a little condescendingly at Alex. \"No way! Someone needs to regulate how we use the key! That person is me! This IS my house after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the key?\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter patted his chest as an answer. You looked and saw the outline of the key inside a stretched pocket. The cotton of the shirt seemed to be muffling the power of the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Hunter crossed his arms and looked dangerously down at you and Alex. \"What to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Pass me the toy!\" Hunter said with a grin. Alex then picked you up, and began walking tword Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alex!? What are you doing! Don't bring me to him!\" You pleaded, \"I'm your big brother! Who knows what he'll do to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex made no reply as he soon walked up to Hunter's chest. It was almost as if Hunter was some kind of god or idol, and Alex was about to put up an offering. Just as it seemed that you were going to be tortured, Alex tossed you behind him! You just barely landed on the edge of the bed, grasping the polyester sheets so you wouldn't fall off! As you pulled yourself up and looked over, you just managed to see Alex spring up and bop Hunter in the nose! Hunter flinched, pulling back a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He groaned as he was hit. He may have been huge, sure, but Alex was by no means small either! He at least managed to do a little damage. As Hunter's eyes re-opened, you immediately noticed how they turned from fun-loving to a dark, unhappy expression. This would not end well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex kept up his assult. He couldn't exactly wrestle Hunter at this size, but he sure was doing all he could! He rammed into Hunter's chest, doing his best to claw and tear open the pocket; reaching inside from above was impossible. The shirt was so tight, the pocket's opening was sealed like an envelope, only a hundred times tighter! As Alex kept up his assult, he managed to get a small enough tear that would allow him to at least <i>touch</i> the key!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you were able to feel a rumble... Which soon grew more vigorous! It was like an earthquake! Suddenly, Hunter's powerful arm rose up from below, leaving nothing but destruction in it's wake. It immediately pinned Alex down where he stood, leaving him helpless before the bigger child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever hit me again!\" Hunter threatened, \"I don't even trust you now, stupid!\" He added, in quite the childish manner. \"Now I'm gonna punish you!\"</span></div></div>",

The interior walls had been mostly demolished by Hunter's most recent growth spurt, and Alex tackling him didn't help matters. You could hear the frame of the house groan as the huge boys crashed into the walls, and knew that you had to get out of there before things got worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOWWW!\" Both Hunter and Alex cried out in pain. Alex fell back onto the bed, nearly crushing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just do, Alex?\" Hunter cried out in anger. \"That hurt like hell!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Alex spat back in reply. \"My hand just brushed against your stupid key while we were fighting, and it burned me! Like really badly!\" He was still wincing in discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It burned me too,\" Hunter said, shaking his hand in an effort to relieve the pain. His anger began to transition into curiosity. \"It's never done that before; it's always been a shock. I wonder what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what was going on, but you knew you sure didn't want to stick around to find out. Tugging at your brother's ear, you begged him, \"Alex, PLEASE! Let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded, picking you up and turning around, glaring at Hunter. \"See ya later, 'Buddy',\" he said to the taller boy, his voice dripping with sarcasm. In a flash, Alex burst forth with energy, heading straight to the wall while yelling, \"AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\" You closed your eyes as Alex shielded you with his hands, pressed you close to his chest, and crashed through the wall, sending wood, glass, and insulation flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tucked and landed, rolling twice on the ground outside, then jumped up to his feet. Once he was a good 100 feet or so from the house, he turned around so the two of you could look at it and see the place that had been your prison for the past crazy night. Alex still held you close to his chest, and you could feel his heart beating rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside you realized that the house looked nothing like yours or any one you had remembered seeing. It was painted a bright salmon pink color, the windows were all made of some weird opaque glass, and the walls seemed to intersect at all sorts of improper angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that last part was now mostly due to the house collapsing, as Hunter stretched his body up to its full height. His tank top and shorts had finally given up and ripped apart, leaving the giant boy naked, every inch of his thirty-foot-tall athletic-looking body completely visible for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the giant close his eyes and cough as he tried to wave away the dust from the destruction of the house. Knowing you had to make the most of this chance, you pressed your hand into the skin of Alex's chest. \"C'mon, bro, we've got to get out of here!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Alex said, turning to run down the street. Whatever neighborhood the two of you were now in seemed deserted, no one else anywhere in eyesight. Judging by the dark blue hue of the sky, though, it was probably very early morning, so that might explain the absence of other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex got to the end of the block, he turned to look down both directions of the cross-street, trying to decide where to head towards now. From behind, you could see Hunter's massive figure begin to stomp down the street, pursuing the two of you in a slow but determined manner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother seemed to be taking an awfully long time to make up his mind on which way to go. \"Alex! What's taking so long?\" He didn't seek to hear you, his eyes almost glassy, looking like he was lost in a daze. Suddenly, his skin began to glow, and you could feel a strange heat begin to radiate from his body. His eyes opened up wide and his hand that was holding you began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHHHHH, JUSTIN!\" he cried out. \"What's happening?! This feels so WEIRD!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" you answered, trying to hang on to Alex's thumb as best you could. \"But I bet whatever it is has something to do with you being burnt by the key. Which means Hunter is probably going through the same thing.\" Looking back, you noticed that Hunter, too, seemed to be paused, and his body was glowing head to foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea of what to make of this incredibly odd turn of events, but decided to brace yourself for the worst. Nothing you could imagine, though, would be able to prepare you for what happened next.</span></div></div>",

His massive chest stretched out in front of you like an insurmountable wall, heaving as Alex breathed heavily at the sudden changes. The arm your current perch was attached to seemed more like an ancient tree, thick and powerful. Even his face seemed more intimidating, despite being the visage clearly belonging to your brother. You couldn't see the rest of his body without moving to the edge of the palm and you weren't about to do that, now that you were sure you were much higher up than you had previously been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Alex's breathing returned to normal, his eyelids fluttering slightly before the orbs themselves focused in on you. They still looked a little glazed over after his growth spurt so you quickly got to your feet and waved your arms shouting, \"Alex! I'm right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice no doubt barely reached his ears, but regardless, his eyes focused in on you. \"J-Justin? That you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Bring me up to your ear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, somewhat shakily, did as you told him. Once his cave-like ear was near enough, you said, \"This is insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Alex replied, rolling his eyes. \"This whole thing has been insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...whatever!\" you said. \"Look, we've got to keep moving! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex giggled and said, \"Why? I'm way bigger than Hunter now! Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his hand, lowering his fingers so you could see Hunter, still at the same height, but also still glowing and shaking. \"See? He's no problem now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did some quick math in your head. That burn from the key seemed to have made Alex about four times bigger than his previous eleven feet, making him about forty-four feet tall, give or take a few feet. If the same held true for Hunter, who had previously been thirty feet tall then...Oh crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALEX!\" you shouted desperately, waving your arms at him again. \"WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted as Hunter suddenly surged upward in height, matching Alex's size in a few spurts before rocketing upward at an even greater speed, his naked body rearing into the sky like some kind of god. Alex's mouth dropped open as the gap in their size was suddenly widened again, dramatically. Falling back, your brother began to run away, stumbling slightly as the ground rumbled from Hunter's growth. Clocking in at one hundred and twenty feet tall, Hunter was now truly a force to be reckoned with, unlike any you had ever seen before. Judging by the grin on his face, he knew it too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...this key is AWESOME!\" He thundered, his voice incredibly loud to your tiny ears. \"I wonder if it has any other effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the now truly tiny key in his palm, poking at it with his finger. For some odd reason, it wasn't giving him a shock of any kind like it had before. \"Hmm... I wonder if it's stuck on burn now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter fiddled with the key, Alex desperately searched for a place to hide. All the houses in this neighborhood appeared to be the same, all pink colored two story houses set in little groups, connected by streets that didn't seem to have a definite beginning or end. It was almost like being caught in something akin to an M.C. Escher painting, an impossible landscape that only led in circles. Luckily for you, you weren't truly going around in circles, and Hunter wasn't attempting to come after you...yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro... what are we going to do?\" Alex asked, looking a bit worried. His animosity toward you had apparently been set aside for now. That was one lucky break for you, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...we've got to find a place to hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Hide...Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, Alex skidded to a halt in front of one of the houses. You were about to question him on this when he merely pointed. Looking down, getting a slight sense of vertigo, you noticed that the door to the house was open. You noticed at every other house you had passed that the doors were all closed. Why was this one in particular open?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex suddenly set you down as carefully as he could onto the door step of the house. You looked up at him with a confused look on your face. \"Go in! Maybe there's something in there to help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and looked at the door. Oddly enough, the door frame was half your size! The house had more in common with a playhouse than an actual house. The oddities of this world never ceased, it seemed. Getting down on your hands and knees, you barely manage to squeeze into the tiny house which was, once again, a replica of your own, just in miniature now. Hoping against hope, you began to search as best you could, looking for something, ANYTHING that could help you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a tight squeeze. At this moment, you couldn't help but think another zap from that key would make navigating this tiny place a little easier, but that thought was knocked out of you as you realized how stupid you were. The smaller you got, the more danger you'd be in, and the more likely it was that you'd get crushed! And dying wasn't exactly on your list of \"to-do's.\" As fast as you could, you dashed up to your room to see if something could help. You figured it was probably just as you had left it, but in this bizarre world, maybe there was something that could help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alex was waiting outside, focused on you and the tiny house, he hadn't even noticed that Hunter had snuck up behind him! \"There you are, you stupid punk!\" he said, using the bottom of his foot to push Alex over. Your brother fell down with a thud, shaking the house as you were in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" Alex barked at him, \"I don't want to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I'm bigger than you, and I can do whatever I want!\" Hunter replied. He stomped his foot down on Alex's chest, grinning all the while. \"You're just a little runt now!\" Hunter's body had developed into that of an athletic teen, his chest laying comfortably above a set of six-pack abs. His legs were strong and taut, with powerful arms that could no doubt crush a house (or several)! Alex let out a whimper, but he wasn't about to take it lying down! He tried to swipe at Hunter's ankle, but only ended up hurting himself! Alex let out a pained groan as he held his foot, all while Hunter just let out a triumphant laugh. \"You can't hurt me! I'm at least three times your size!\" he boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, you could hear their conversation from inside the tiny house. Your room was useless. Nothing there could help you. You tried searching your parents' room, the bathroom, the living room-- nothing! Everywhere you went lit a spark of hope only to have it extinguished when you found out nothing was there! Everything seemed to be exactly as you remember it. Your shoulders began to chafe as they kept getting rubbed up against the walls. The sensation just reminded you of how badly you wanted to hurry up and get out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the kitchen, the last room left to search, you immediately noticed something strange on the counter, almost as if someone WANTED you to find it. Walking over, you realized it was a ray gun! It appeared to have a knob with two settings, one with an icon of a large person, and another of a small person. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what they meant! Realizing this was just the thing that could help, you reached out and grabbed it. However, as soon as you touched the gun, it expanded! It went from being a pistol size to almost the size of a bazooka! This could complicate things a bit, you thought. However, at this point, there wasn't much of a choice! With the gun in tow, you did your best to get out of the house as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust making it out of the door, glad to finally be out of that cramped space, you immediately saw Hunter picking on Alex! He had him pinned down, and a loogie dangled from his lips, right above Alex's face! Hunter slurped it up a little, only to then let it drop a little closer! It upset you to the point of being borderline furious! No one, not even you, treated Alex that bad! Some sort of protective brotherly instinct kicked in as you turned set the gun to enlarge, and aimed it at Alex...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lined up the sights, Alex in the crosshairs of the bazooka. He was squirming around, trying to get Hunter off of him, but the boy was three times your brother's size; he didn't stand a chance. \"Not without my help,\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you squeezed the trigger, a bolt of electricity shot out of the barrel of the gun, making a loud cracking noise and zipping through the air. The kickback from the gun sent you flying back into the miniature house, your back slamming against its wall. You managed to keep your eyes open, seeing the bolt hit your brother on the side of his face and immediately dissolve into his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWWWW!\" Alex yelled in pain. \"Where the heck did that lightning come from? It's not cloudy at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, shrimp?\" Hunter asked, not having noticed the ray hit Alex. \"I can't hear you from all the way down there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood up and brushed yourself off, though, you noticed that Hunter had suddenly started to look around frantically. \"Where is it?!\" he cried out. His brow furrowed as he looked down at Alex. \"What did you do with it, punk? Did you take it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take what?\" your brother asked. By the look on his face he honestly had no idea what Hunter was asking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, dumb ass! The key!\" You felt a sense of hope inside as you realize that somehow Hunter had lost track of the thing that had made him grow. Maybe he dropped it; maybe it disappeared somehow when the gun got fired. Either way, the tables were beginning to turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" you called out to your brother, wondering why the blast of the ray hadn't started to change him yet. \"How do you feel? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment. \"You mean except for having my former friend now crushing me and trying to humiliate me? I'm just great. In fact--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother stopped talking as his entire body started to shake. He felt it. On top of him, Hunter felt it. Even you felt it, standing a ways back from him. \"OHHHHh...\" he moaned, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap,\" Hunter exclaimed as he quickly stood up, starting to back away. He couldn't move very far though before Alex's body began to surge with growth, every part of him becoming larger and more powerful. His feet pushed against the side of the house you stood in front of, and you jumped out of the way to avoid it's destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin, this feels GREAT!\" Alex exclaimed. With Hunter no longer on top of him, he sat up, and you quickly realized just how big your brother was getting. Even without standing, his head towered high above the houses in the neighborhood, becoming much bigger than Hunter and still going. He seemed to be enjoying it, and you noticed his uncovered cock happened to be completely erect and sticking straight out, very impressive even compared to the rest of his body. And while Hunter's muscles looked like those of a very athletic older teen, Alex's swelled out even further, giving him the appearance of a professional bodybuilder. Hills of rock-hard muscle sprung up along his chest and abs, and valleys formed in between his pecs. He had already been a giant; now he was becoming a true titan. You made a mental note to stay on his good side from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that's better!\" Alex said as his growth slowed to a stop. He leaned back, his massive backside crushing a pair of houses next to each other, and his legs stretching across the street. With a mischievous smile on his face, he powered his foot entirely through a large house, demolishing it with a single powerful kick. \"Let's see anyone try to get the best of me now!\" It would be an impressive accomplishment; the next biggest thing out there, Hunter, was now less than a third of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled with cautious optimism as you watched your brother get used to his new size. As you did, however, you felt long fingers wrap around you, and your body was being lifted into the air. Looking up, you saw that Hunter had grasped you in his hand, and was running as far away as he could get from Alex. Shocked, you screamed out, hoping your brother could hear you. \"Wait-- Alex! HELP! HELP ME!!!\"</span></div></div>",

Alex!\" You scream out as you start your fall towards the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your giant brother quickly holds out his palm to catch you and brings you up to his shoulder. \"Don't worry Justin you're safe with me.\" He pats your head as you catch your breath from almost dieing yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter is near crying and pleads with the gargantuan boy. \"P-please let me go Alex. You have him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I think I'll keep you. I've got something for you to do for me.\" Your brother grins devilishly which scares even you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Hunter asks scared to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex sets Hunter down but still maintains a firm hold on the boy then pushes Hunter's head against his massive tool and moans as he does so. \"I dunno why but its really liking how big I am and\" He grins wider \"that felt really good just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter blushes and tries to get away but his struggles only serve to pleasure Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh OOooh OOOOOH don't stop little boy mmmmmm!\" Alex holds onto Hunter as the boy keeps trying to get away while you watch in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minutes of trying Hunter stops struggling and Alex smirks, \"Ready now huh? Then suck it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter glares at Alex then nods and leans forward taking the huge cockhead into his mouth causing Alex to moan in higher tones and his legs to shake some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes good boy.\" He pats Hunter's head as the inexperienced boy does his best to appease the colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you are still on Alex's shoulder watching this unfold and can't resist stroking yourself. \"It is pretty hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grips Hunter harder as he nears climax. \"MMm what's ah happening? It feels like I'm gonna pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes go wide. (Eeeeew I don't wanna swallow his pee!) He then tries to get out of Alex's grasp again but is too late as Alex groans loudly and his cock fills Hunter's mouth with his hot seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex lays back on his expansive ass panting as Hunter falls forward into his lap. \"Haa hehe what was that?\" He's looking at the white goo leaking out of Hunter's mouth. \"Weird its not yellow.\" He laughs and pets Hunter's head during his blissful moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter's hand squeezed you rather hard, cutting off your calls mid breath. You watched peevishly as Alex didn't even think of you! He was too busy flexing his biceps, running his hand down the cobblestones of his abs and bouncing his thick pecs. Sure, it was probably <i>amazing</i> to have a body like that and you knew that if it was you in his position you'd probably do the same thing...But that didn't mean you were going to be happy about it or forgive him for it either! It didn't help that you were starting to feel more and more bug like in comparison to these gargantuan youngsters. Alex was enough of a pain when he was half your size and whiny now that he was over fifty times your size and built like a bodybuilder he was sure to be an even bigger pain! Of course, all of that was secondary to your main problem, this Hunter guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter...the name rang zero bells. You couldn't remember a single time when Alex ever talked about him or saw him hanging around in his little group of friends. Was he a new kid or something? Did he even actually exist? Or was he just a product of this crazy situation? There was no way of knowing! It was almost as frustrating as trying to figure out how these two were growing or why the houses in your neighborhood not only all looked the same, but were of varying sizes and spread out as far as the eye could see. You groaned and closed your eyes. The more you thought about the less sense it made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd be groaning too!\" Hunter suddenly said, squeezing you again. \"When I'm done with you and Alex you're going to wish you never met me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that already you snot nosed little punk.\" You muttered to yourself, too quietly for him to hear. You were pissed off at him, not suicidal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...this is a good hiding spot!\" Hunter said, hiding behind a house that was big enough for him to crouch behind and still be hidden. \"Now I can focus on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers uncurled and you were suddenly sitting on his massive palm. You gulped as you gazed up at his face, a rather evil grin filling your vision. Being in Alex's hand when he was only about ten or so feet tall had been scary. Being in Hunter's hand at his size, with his intentions, made the experience downright terrifying! You were so fixated on his face you didn't even notice as he gripped the gun in between his fingers, holding it up out of your reach. \"You used this little thing to make Alex grow didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Hey! That was mine!\" You shouted somewhat childishly. You were too internally petrified by what Hunter could do with such a weapon to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter merely chuckled and said, \"Yeah? Too bad! It's mine now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this, the gun suddenly expanded rapidly, reaching a size that Hunter could comfortably use. His eyes widened in shock as he saw this before his evil smile returned. \"Oh yeah! Now that's service!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carelessly dropped you to the ground next to another house that fit your shrunken statue perfectly before he pointed the gun at himself and pulled the trigger, his body becoming bathed in the energy from the gun. You had barely managed to keep the trigger pressed for a few seconds and Alex still got huge. Hunter held the trigger for a good minute or so before he was done, a wicked gleam in his eye. \"There!\" He said triumphantly. \"When I'm done growing, no one will be able to stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran off, the ground quaking under his enormous feet, obviously heading back to challenge Alex. You barely had time to process these events before a voice suddenly called out to you. \"Hey! You! Come in here! Quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around but couldn't see anyone in sight. You could, however, tell that it was coming from inside the house. You sighed, closed your eyes and whispered, \"Well, what have I got to lose?\" before opening the door and stepping inside. It was very surreal. Once again you were in an exact copy of your house. It was tempting to think that this whole thing had merely been a dream and you were now back in reality, everything completely normal again. You half expected Alex to come running downstairs with a big smile on his face to ask you to play a game with him. Unfortunately you knew this wasn't true and the only way Alex was going to be running down in here would be through the roof! You begin to hunt around the house, looking for whoever called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here! The TV screen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the sound of the voice into the living room where the television is located. Instead of a blank screen, however, there's a peculiar pattern of colors, swirling and eddying like a kaleidoscope. It almost made you dizzy to look at it and yet you felt a compulsion to keep staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now that I have your attention I can help you. There's a lot going on here you don't know about. Forces are at work here that you can't understand. I'm sorry that you've been pulled into this but now, if you want things to go back to how they were, you're going to need to be smart and willing to work hard. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? What is this place? Who are you? None of this makes any sense!\" You shout, ignoring the voice's question. \"I need some answers dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colors all suddenly turned various shades of red and started to spike as though in agitation. \"Please! I don't have time to explain! I just need to know that you're determined to fight! If not, then nothing will change and you will just have to deal with your new reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah I'm going to fight! I'll fight whoever I have to, to get out of this crap!\" You shouted back, your face only a few inches from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Then I can help you! This experience of yours will not end in time. You need to accomplish a task in every reality. There is only two things that will stay in common: You, Alex, and Hunter will be a part of it and only those two can grow when subjected to the proper stimuli while you can only shrink when subjected to the same stimuli. It's already too late for you to accomplish the task you were assigned in this reality. You are going to have to reset reality. I can give you the means to do that but it will only work this once in this reality. I'm running out of time. Here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was pushed out of the screen, smacking you in the face. With a yelp you fell back onto your butt, rubbing your sore nose. On the ground in front of you was a small, thin metal tube with a big red button on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Press the button and your reality will reset! I'm afraid your memories and the memories of your brother and Hunter will also be reset...to an extent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" You asked, picking the button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are...certain things you will remember and certain things that you will forget. Exactly what those things are is completely random. You might very well forget everything I tell you. You might forget that Alex was ever smaller than you if he should start out in the next reality already above his base size. You might forget that Hunter is really your younger adopted brother. Anything is possible. Your entire world could be turned upside down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeesh. You didn't like the sound of that at all! Resetting reality might actually make things worse! \"What's my other option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Other option? I'm not sure I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?! What else can I do besides resetting reality?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already told you it's too late! Completing the assigned task in this reality would be far too difficult for you the way things are now. Your best bet is to start over and try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's my task in this reality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say. I'm physically prevented from divulging that information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...fine! I get it! Maybe I will reset reality or whatever and maybe I won't. I haven't decided yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are running out of time I'm afraid. If you don't press it soon, you may not have the chance to ever press it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colors changed again, this time to a panicked pattern of yellow. \"I must go! Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen blinked off, like the power had been cut, leaving you alone in silence. You gripped the button in your hand and weighed your choices. The voice had said that it would be <i>hard</i> to complete the task in this reality (Oh God, even when things were explained to you they didn't make any damn sense!) but not impossible. For all you knew about this place, that might allow you to keep your memories! Hell, it might immediately free you! Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, somewhat safer, option was to reset everything and start over, hoping that no significant memory loss would occur. Was it worth the risk?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought this decision over long and carefully. Go to a new reality, but you don't know what it's like. What if it's worse than now? Is it even possible it could be worse than now? But then you weighed in the positives of this reality. You have your brother, Alex, on your side, and Alex is bigger than Hunter, at least that's what you think. You set the button down on a counter and wandered around the house, weighing your options. You thought to yourself about how nice it is to finally have some peace and quiet to think on your own for once. It's been craziness since you've popped into this reality. Unfortunately, that silence was broken by a deep, thundering laugh from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same voice that delivered the laugh bellowed the words, \"Where's my toy at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" you thought, knowing it was Hunter. Was he already done with Alex, and you were the only one left. Had Alex left, or possibly hidden? The only way to find out would be to go outside, but you didn't want to meet the wrath of Hunter again. But you knew you couldn't just stay in the house, Hunter would start demolishing houses one-by-one trying to find you, and you would be caught in the debris when he decided to crush this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the voice overhead grew more agitated. \"I'm waiting for my toy to come out of the house.\" he said, practically toying with you now. If you didn't leave the house, he would find his own means in, and it would probably be worse for you. You finally made the decision to open the door, and leave the house. You couldn't believe your eyes. Outside the door was a huge foot, one that could probably crush at least 5 houses at once. As you slowly panned up this massive body you saw your brother, Alex, being held by a gigantic hand. You gulped as the figure looked down at you, grinning. Hunter was now towering over your brother, and had him in a firm steel grip. To make matters worse, he had the gun pointed at Alex, but in the shrink position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was satisfied to see you out of the house, and in one step, completely destroyed the house you had been in. \"So much for the button,\" you thought to yourself. You were in this reality for real, and you HAD to accomplish your mission now. There was no way out besides doing that. But, things were looking grim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really wanted you out here so you could see your brother go down to your level!\" Hunter said, while laughing evilly. Alex was trying to escape the grasp of the giant, but it was too much to break free from. You thought back to how tall your brother had been when you shot him. He had shot up to at least 400 feet tall, and now Hunter had his hand wrapped around him as if it was nothing. You remembered to Hunter shooting himself with the gun for a good minute, and estimated he had probably grown 10x taller than he was before. That would put him over 1000 feet tall! You were actually so scared you wanted to cry. There was no way out of this. Your only weapon, your brother, was about to join you as a normal sized human being while Hunter could grow as much as he wanted with his gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed, and fired. The trigger was held in for at least 30 seconds, and then he placed Alex on the ground next to you. Hunter smirked down at you two. Alex was so much bigger than you, you only were the size of his ankles, yet Alex was only the size of Hunter's knees. Next to Hunter's foot you were like a little ant, not even taller than his toes. Just like that, Alex started shrinking. Overhead, Hunter laughed with delight and victory, knowing he now had no competition. In a matter of seconds, Alex went from being 400 feet tall to 50 feet tall, to 10 feet tall, down to a measly 5 feet tall. You looked up, and gulped when you saw Hunter. He had the gun pointed towards him, and his hand on the trigger. Then....</span></div></div>",

This gizmo looks like your only possilbe escape and you've gotta take it while you still can.  Without heistation you mash your thumb down on the button.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoa!  All of a sudden your head is spinning!  You'd sit down if you could, but your balance is so shaky that you're fighting just to keep from falling over.  It's a battle you ultimately lose and you stumble forward, falling into what feels like a bumpy. cloth-covered wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me, spaz!\" a disgusted young voice calls out and the next thing you know you've been shoved backward, hard.  You wind up flat on your back, staring up at the angry face of your adopted younger brother, Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, wimp?  Can't even walk right now?\" Hunter taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurious you try to jump up, but you're hit with another wave of dizziness.  You shut your eyes tight and when you open them everything has settled down.  You slowly stand and glare at your younger sibling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life sucked enough already, but Hunter's inclusion in the family made things worse.  Even though he's only twelve Hunter is a mere two inches shorter than you, and he's way better built.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's defined, magnificent chest strains the tight black tantop he's wearing to the breaking point and leaves bare his bronzed, extremely muscular arms.  His abs are a perfect, washboard six-pack and his legs are considerably thicker and more powerful than yours.  His sculpted phsysique is that of a teenage bodybuilding champion, but the face underneath that wavy brown hair is indisputably that of a twelve year old.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet Hunter's confident, green-eyed gaze for a few seconds, then look away.  You'd love to pound Hunter for his smart mouth, but the truth is that whenever the two of you fight it's always Hunter who does the pounding.  He's even stronger than he looks, and he's been taking karate at the orphanage since he was since he was six.  You're just no match for the tall, He-Boy brown belt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hunter made sure you knew that the first day he arrived.  When the two of your retired to the room you were sharing you tried to lay down the law and let your new little bro know who was in charge.  Unfortunately he thought he should be, and he beat the crap out of you.  Ever since Hunter hasn't hesitated to bully you and push you around.  It got bad enough that you even swallowed your pride and went to your parents, but they refused to believe that their precious new son and star athlete was doing anything wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smirks as he successfully stares you down, then walks foward and deliberately bumps you with his iron-hard shoulder, nearly knocking you down again as he walks past you.  Having to put up with this crap at home is bad enough, but you can't believe Hunter is treating you like this in public too!  You can't let him get away with bullying you at  . . .          </span></div></div>",

Despite being only twelve years old, Hunter was a genius with an IQ of 180 (or at least that's what his official score was, Hunter wasn't even trying to get a high score when he took the test.) Although Hunter could have easily skipped straight to college, he chose instead to go to high school so he could throw around his superiority on all of the other smaller, weaker and dumber ordinary people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait for me!\u201d You say, trying to catch up with Hunter. \u201cStop walking so fast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me what to do?\u201d Hunter turned around and took a step towards you, and you involuntarily took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not walking too fast; your legs are just too short to keep up with me.<br>\r\nIf I slowed down, we\u2019d be both late just because you\u2019re too short to keep up. I guess there\u2019s only one solution.\u201d Before you can protest he suddenly grabbed you and lifted you off the ground, his young muscles bulging as he effortlessly held you in the air, then threw you on top his broad shoulder like a sack of old laundry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Put me down!\u201d You protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you gonna do about it?\u201d Hunter started walking. You tried to get off, but Hunter\u2019s grip was too strong. \u201cStop struggling, you know you\u2019re too weak to fight me. We\u2019ll get to school a lot faster if I carry you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything, you just hung helplessly as he carried you all the way to school. Everyone was looking at the two of you, pointing and giggling at the sight of a giant twelve year old carrying his \u201cbig\u201d brother around like he weighed nothing.. You felt so embarrassed you thought you could die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look, there\u2019s Alex up ahead.\u201d Hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a cold pit in your stomach. The last person you wanted to see right now was your other \u201clittle\u201d brother Alex. You wanted to run, but Hunter\u2019s grip was unyielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Hunter stopped moving and set you back on the ground, but hanging on his shoulder in that awkward position so long had made your legs jello, causing you to wobble. Automatically your hand shot out to grab something to help you balance, and what your hand grabbed as very big and hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted to feel my muscles, all you had to do was ask.\u201d A familiar voice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you looked up to find your \u201clittle\u201d brother Alex, who was\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You snatch your hand back as thought it had been burned while your tall, ultra-buff younger brothers share a hearty laugh at your expense.  The fricking last thing you need is to feel how large and hard Alex's muscles are; you already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even remember a time when Alex wasn't stronger and more ripped than you were.  Even though you're the older brother, he's always been the dominant one in your relationship because you could never hope to match his superior strength.  You've lost count of the number of times you've been forced to submit to the much more powerful preteen.  When your parents started talking about adopting another kid you harbored the secret hope that you'd finally get a <i>real</i> little brother, somebody you could push around and give orders to the way Alex does to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hope began to die the instant you laid eyes on the overgrown monster of muscle that was Hunter.  It expired for good when the twelve year-old titan kicked your butt in your own bedroom.  You prayed he and Alex would fight, but they soon become best friends.  They're much closer than you and Alex ever were and frequently team-bully you, so much that you actually prefer school now!  At least there you're mostly safe and only have Hunter to deal with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what is Alex doing here?!?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to feel my arm too, bro?\" Alex taunts, flexing up his striated, softball-sized bicep right in your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" you demand.  \"You're supposed to be in middle school!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch the attitude, wimp!\" Alex warns.  \"I've got plenty of time to make it to my school before the first bell.  I just wanted to remind you what's we're going to do to you if you try to skip karate club again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?  What's he talking about?  You don't take karate!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't,\" Hunter reassures his brother.  \"I'll make sure of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't take karate!\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, you do, and you're not getting out of it.  Try to quit again and Alex and I are gonna start using you instead of the punching bag in the basement when we practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to protest again when Hunter leg-sweeps you with his left leg, sending you falling backward onto the pavement.  The next thing you know Hunter's brand-new, hundred and fifty dollar left sneaker is pressing against your throat so hard it's cutting off your air supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this, Alex,\" you hear Hunter calmly assure your biological brother.  \"See you after school, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking you frantically seize Hunter's leg, but trying to move it is like trying to shift an iron rod.  The pressure actually increases and the tremendously strong twelve year-old genuis warns you, \"Stop struggling, or I'll crush your windpipe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release him as black spots start to dance in front of your eyes.  Thankfully Hunter removes his foot from your throat before you pass out, allowing you to frantically gulp in air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be at the gym after shool, Justin,\" Hunter commands, \"or Alex and I really will stomp you like a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you lying there Hunter steps over you and heads up the steps, immediately being greeted by half a dozen people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to cough you roll over onto your front and slowly stand up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Justin, you okay?\" a voice asks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning you see it's Tim Williams, one of your friends.  Tim is a couple of inches shorter than you, about the height of Hunter and Alex, though of course he's not nearly as broad or well-muscled as either of your little brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter?\" he asks you sympatheically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you confirm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, man.  What was it this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He and Alex tried to tell me not to miss today's karate lesson.  I don't even take karate!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looks at you strangely.  \"Yeah, you do.  Monday, Wednesday and Friday after school in the gym with Mr. Kursowa, remember?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the-?  Mr. Kursowa is the trig teacher; since when did he start doing an after-school martial arts class too?  And you certainly didn't sign up for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had a martial arts lesson in my life!\" you insist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Hunter hit you in the head this time? You want me to take you to the nurse?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I mean, yes, I hit my head on the pavement, but no, I don't need to go to the nurse!  I need to know why everyone is telling me I take karate!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim stares at you for a moment, then abruptly bursts out laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it now!  You're practicing for what you're gonna tell Hunter and Alex when you cut, right?  Gonna pretend you got amnesia from that knock on the head you took?  Clever, man, but your bros ain't gonna buy it.  That Hunter, he's got a mind like a freaking super-computer!  Just go to class; it's only an hour.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings and Tim swears.  \"Gotta go!  Later, man!\" he tells you and hurries into the building.  You follow slowly, utterly confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realize that this \"martial arts class\" isn't the only thing you've forgotten.  You're completely lost in all of your subjects.  The last World History class you remember was about the French Revolution; now you're into World War I!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Tim be right?  Did hitting your head really give you some kind of partial amnesia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that can't be; Alex and Hunter were talking about karate class BEFORE you hit the pavement.  So what's the answer then?  You think back over the day and with a start realize that you don't even remember getting up this morning!  Your first memory is stumbling against Hunter on the sidewalk.  The only thing before that is a crazy dream where Hunter and Alex had grown to be giants and a voice from the television set offered to let you switch realities . . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the last thing you remember; then you were on the sidewalk with Hunter, right after you pushed the button in the dream.  Or maybe. . . maybe it wasn't a dream at all . . .  No, that can't be!  Can it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of the day frantically going over what you remember of the dream in your mind.  The voice said things would be different in the new reality and that what you remembered would be completely random.  He told you that there was a task you had to accomplish and you couldn't hope to do it in this reality.  He warned you that there was a stimuli which would make you shrink, but would make Alex and Hunter grow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the final bell rings you're more than halfway convinced that the \"dream\" was nothing of the kind.  You'd sound crazy if you tried to tell this to anyone, but to you it makes sense; it explains everything you're going through.  And if it's real, there's something you have to do to fix things, but you haven't got a clue what that is!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seriously consider skipping the karate class to think more about this, but in the end you decide it's better to go rather than risk the wrath of your Herculean, super-stud siblings.  In your gym locker you find a white gi and white belt.  Changing you enter the gym, only to find you're the last to arrive.  Mr. Kursowa is dressed in a white gi with a black belt.  There are half a dozen  high school students with green, orange and purple belts.  Hunter stands slightly apart from them, his brown belt knotted securely around his lean, extremely well-muscled torso.  Next to him is Alex, wearing a brown belt of his own!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this is wrong!  Alex NEVER took karate, only Hunter did!  You stare wide-eyed at them, noticing how the gis are pratically skin-tight across their fantastic physiques, with slivers of their broad, deep chests clearly visible in the V-gap of the uniforms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even have time to process this Mr. Kursowa calls the class to attention.  \"First today we have our promotions.  Alex, Hunter, if you'll please come up here,\" the teacher asks in a rather timid tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Alex swagger toward their sensai, muscles rippling under thir gis,  and you are suprised again, this time at the flowing grace of their movements.  They're like a pair of tigers, supremely self-assured and utterly deadly.  As you and the rest of the class watch Mr. Kursowa officially promotes them both to black belts.  After their new symbols of rank are in place they turn back to face the class and everyone else starts to cheer!  You can't tell whether it's out of fear or admiration, but either way the two obvious alpha males smugly accept the praise as their due.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Hunter and Alex will be the first to spar today.  Begin!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brothers bow to each other, and then launch into a display like nothing you've ever seen before.  In spite of their great muscle mass they're quick as lightning and even more limber and fexible than you are.  They exchange punches and kicks so fast you have trouble following and you soon realize that neither one is bothering to pull his blows.  Only their expert blocking and dodging keeps these iron fists and feet from landing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not pulling their blows!\" you whisper to Todd Michaels, the purple belt next to you.  Todd seems entranced by the kid karate jock conflict, but manges to tear his gaze away to stare at you in disbelief.  \"Hunter and Alex said all sparring would be full-contact, remember?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you don't.  You also miss the match's conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Justin will spar with-\"                    <br>\r\n              </span></div></div>",

How's this going to help either of us learn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Kursowa glances nervously toward Hunter, who glares back at him, and it suddenly dawns on you that this match-up isn't luck; it's Hunter getting his way again.  With his size, strength, intellect, and attitude Hunter seriously intimidates almost everyone he meets.  No one wants to risk angering the awesome twelve year-old paragon, so people usually end up doing whatever Hunter wants them to.  It's clear now that he, and not Mr. Kursowa, is the one who's in charge of this class.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up here, Justin,\" he orders, and you reluctantly obey, walking over to the mat to face your young Atlas of an adopted brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder he and Alex wanted you here; not only to see their promotions, but also for the enjoyment of being able to beat you up in front of the rest of the class.              <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is certainly what's going to happen; you know that from bitter experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\" Mr. Kursowa intones and Hunter stalks menacingly toward you.  You throw a right hook at him, which he deflects with his left forearm, at the same time palm-striking your face with his right hand.  To your surprise, though, the painful impact isn't even enough to bloody your nose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point, Hunter!\" Mr. Kursowa announces, to the cheers of Alex and the other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter steps back, then delivers a devastating, blindingly fast triple-kick to your stomach, chest and face with his right foot.  Again, though, this lacks the force you know Hunter is more than capable of exerting.  Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you get it.  If Hunter unleashed his full muscular strength against you, as he did against Alex, the match would be over much too quickly.  At the least, you'd be too battered to continue, and Hunter doesn't want that.  He wants to draw things out, to spend as much time as he can showing off his far greater physical prowess.  It's never been enough for Hunter to simply win; no, he has a deep-seated need to crush anyone who dares to challenge him, to humiliate them as much as possible.  The only exception you've ever seen to this behavior is when he competes against Alex; otherwise Hunter is absolutely merciless and frighteningly cruel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to guess you'd say this tendency stems from his years in the orphanage.  All that time staying there, unwanted . . . now he seems driven to prove how much better he is than everyone else, how far above ordinary people he towers, both mentally and physically.  Behavior like that's gotta be the result of low self-esteem and overcompensation, right?  Otherewise why would he have to rub it in so much?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that instant the martial arts prodigy leaps up in a textbook perfect spin-kick, his bare foot slamming against your jaw.  You sprawl gracelessy before him, as Mr. Kursowa monotonously calls out yet another point for Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl you stand up and suddenly kick out at your oponent's groin, a move Hunter easily blocks with one hand.  He ducks your first punch, sideslips a second, and seizes your wrist in a grip of iron.  Before you know what's happening Hunter has spun around and flipped you over his broad shoulders.  Once again you find yourself flat on your back, staring up at your younger brother's smirking, brutally handsome face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your arm again Hunter almost effortlessly hauls you to your feet before smoothly slipping back into his stance.  This time the unstoppable karate kid launches a rock-hard fist into your solar plexus and, after you've doubled over, downs you with an expert axe kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally and mercifully Mr. Kursowa calls an end to the match.  You slink off the mat, nursing your bruises and wondering sourly if there is really that much difference between this reality and the one where Hunter was a giant.  You can at least be thankful that he and Alex haven't discovered whatever will make them grow and you shrink here.  That must mean you still have a chance, right?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice said that you, Alex, and Hunter would be a part of whatever task needed to be accomplished; does that mean you need their help to do what you must?  Or is it their job to try to stop you from doing whatever you need to do?  Or could it go either way?  Alex was on your side in the end in the last reality; in fact it was only after Hunter got gargantuan that the voice started speaking to you.

As you stripped down and began to shower the sweat off your body, the impact that the fight had on your bones and muscles suddenly starts to feel much more pronounced. Something about the aching and the dull pain seems almost familiar, as if this isn't the first time your body has gone through this sort of abuse at the hands (or, more likely, fists) of one of your brothers. But with the memories of the previous reality and the realization that you're being put through some sort of strange test, you're not sure which of your memories are real and which are illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish the shower up and towel off, heading back over to your locker. Opening it up, you slip your jeans and shirt back on, and crumple the gi into a ball, throwing it to the bottom of the locker, hoping that you'll never have to use it again. As you slam the locker door shut, you begin to feel a steady buzzing in your pocket. You stick your hand in and realize it's your cell phone, but when you bring it out, you're disappointed to see that the caller ID is being blocked: \"Unknown Name, Unknown Number\". You hit the button twice to send it to voicemail, but before you can slip it back in your pocket, it starts buzzing again, the screen the same as before: \"Unknown Name, Unknown Number\". It would be nearly impossible for someone to call back that fast, you think. Something weird is going on. You think back to when the voice in the previous reality contacted you through the TV. Could this be the same kind of thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, you hit the button to answer the call and bring it up to your ear, your hand trembling slightly both from a sense of nervousness as well as weakness from the pummeling Hunter had given you. \"H-hello?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time you've answered.\" The familiar voice seems a bit agitated, but at the same time relieved. \"I've been trying to talk to you for an hour now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around to the left and right. The locker room is fairly empty, though you can still hear a couple of showers running behind you. Luckily, there seems to be no sign of either of your brothers. You sit down on the wooden bench between the lockers, trying to keep your voice low. \"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I've been busy getting beat up by my hulk of a brother, since I apparently do Karate now. My phone was here in the locker room the whole time.\" You hope that your agitation and frustration is coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well,\" the voice continued, \"now that we're finally getting the chance to talk, I have to say that you don't seem to be doing that much better in this reality than in the last one. But at least you still should be able to accomplish your task if you play your cards right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What task?\" you ask, your voice getting louder as your blood begins to boil over with rage after all that has happened today. \"What the hell am I supposed to be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before,\" the voice sighs, \"I am physically prevented from divulging--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a fuck what you are prevented from doing or not doing,\" you yell into the phone, not caring anymore if anyone else hears you. \"I just want to get home! Back to the 'real' reality! Where Alex and Hunter are smaller than me and everything is normal again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful!\" the voice hisses back at you. \"You can't let your brothers hear that! If either of them realize that this is not the 'real' reality, as you put it, then they might become even more powerful than they are now! If that were to happen, who knows how bad things will get for you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you think about ending the call right then and there, but you know that you still need more information out of this disembodied voice. \"Fine. I'll be quiet. But is there anything you can tell me? Anything that will help me at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Justin. I can tell you two things. The first is that you are very close to coming across the stimulus that will make you shrink and your brothers grow. Be careful and be aware, because the smaller you get, the harder it will be for you to accomplish your task. And this stimulus will also have an effect on other people you're coming across in your reality, though what effect that is I cannot know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait,\" you interrupt, \"are you saying that whatever this stimulus is, it'll affect everyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Perhaps it won't be an obvious effect, depending on the person, but this reality is designed in such a way that if you, your brothers, or anyone or anything else changes, then those who are aware of the nature of this reality will be the only ones who are aware of the changes. Right now, that should only be you. Everyone else will perceive the changes as normal, as if things had always been that way. That's why Hunter and Alex were already so muscular even when you first met them, since they have already come across the stimulus without being aware of it's nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this information is overwhelming you, a sensation that seems all too common by this point. \"All right, I guess,\" you sigh. \"What's the second thing you can tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" The voice continues, \"and this is important. While I can't tell you <i>what</i> your test is going to be, I <i>can</i> tell you that you will know it when you see it. It's going to be a big, noticeable event that will effect everything in that reality. And you won't be able to pass the test on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask in disbelief. \"If I can't pass it on my own, then who--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're interrupted when the phone suddenly gets yanked out of your hand. Your gut begins to twist as you realize that someone had been standing behind you, hearing most if not all of your conversation. Turning around, you see the phone is being held by\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sorry about that, I guess I don't know my own strength!\" He chortles and push you down on the benches with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Watch it A--..\" You start but quickly remember that in these cases silence is what brings you the least physical damage.

But I'm not buying that!\" His face lit up suddenly \"But if I HAD been, there would also be a way to make this body -\" He posed in front of you for emphasis as he spoke, muscles rippling and expanding \"Even more impressive, then that would be worth looking into!\" Alex threw the crushed up phone at your feet and rushed out the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And now I'm running against the clock</i> you think to yourself as you sigh heavily. <i>What was it the strange voice said?

What have I done to them to deserve this torture? </i> You think quietly to yourself, looking over your shoulder the entire way to your house, constantly fearing to see their perfect young bodies come running at you for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And why haven't I gotten any different in this reality?</i> You look down at yourself, feeling a guilty envy rolling up in you as you imagine what it would be like to have what your younger brothers have. You stop yourself as you feel your groin start to tickle and stir, and you feel sickened that even with all the pain those two put you through recently, the image of what they are could arouse your broken body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the front door without any further issues, and enter your house. It was shockingly as resembling of your old house as every single house you could remember being in recently had been. You sigh and start making the ascent to the room you shared with your two brothers, hoping that they wouldn't have made it home yet. Luckily the house sounded quiet, but you knew that that was no guarantee. You had plenty experience with the pair of them just lying in wait to ambush you, laughing as they pinned you down. That was not what you needed today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door to your room slowly, and looked inside to find... Nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last a moment of luck for you. You flop yourself down on one of the two larger beds in the room. Your brothers had had a big laugh out of making you sleep in a small bed right in the middle of their two larger beds. Sure they were larger than you, but you thought that being the older of the bunch you ought to have at least the same size bed. This was just another way for them to flaunt their dominance over you even into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there on the bed you start to contemplate once more what the voice on the phone said. You needed to find that something that made those two pests grow, and before they did! That was the only way you could stop them and return to your normal life again - even if that now seemed a distant dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't been growing much, you thought, so it had to be something they wouldn't have come across too often. So nothing in this room or even in this house seemed a likely candidate just by that simple fact. Of course you could be wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind starts to wonder what it would be like to grow bigger and bigger like your brothers had and might do again. You remember guilty thoughts from your walk home of being big and muscular, and now your pants start to bulge out again with your hardening erection. You swallow hard as you hate yourself for being so jealous of those two, but you cannot deny it.. They do spark some deep desire in you, some unspoken macrophilia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you move you hand into your pants and start to rub over your hardening moderately sized member, and rub over it. With images flashing through your head of various muscular poses and hulking bodies towering above you it didn't take long for rubbing to become full on stroking in your pants. If they hadn't been so abusive it might even have been thrilling to have them as brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a tear fall down your cheek as you give in to the guilty pleasure, sad that your brothers both repulsed and attracted you so. And with a lowly cry of pleasure and frustration in your voice you come inside your pants. Removing a sticky hand you start to once more wonder if you should try to look for the catalyst, in the off chance that it might be something in here that they just wouldn't normally come in contact with. Something they perhaps wasn't old enough to... You gulp and look over at your moist and sticky hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething an early teen wouldn't have come in contact with more than perhaps once... And that was close to you in the locker room. Could it be that the catalyst is.. Cum?</span></div></div>",

As you feel a slight twinge running down your spine, you gradually become aware of the world getting bigger around you. Of course, the truth is that you're shrinking, though somewhat slower than you had in the previous reality, only having lost a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast, you rush to the bathroom and quickly wash your hands, making sure to get rid of every last trace of cum from them. As you rub them against a handtowell, drying them off, you notice the shrinking hasn't stopped - you're already getting closer to five feet even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at your crotch, you realize that, having cum in your pants, there's still some on your clothes and cock. You rip off your pants and throw them into the trash can just to be safe, then strip naked the rest of the way and quickly jump in the shower, not waiting for the water to warm up. A quick yelp escapes your lips, shocked by the cold water, but you know that you need to clean yourself off as quick as you can. Grabbing a washcloth, you lather it up and rub your crotch, making sure every last inch is clean. The physical stimulus causes your cock to start to get hard again, and you feel a quick impulse to beat off again, but you push that thought out of your mind, knowing that you can't risk losing any more height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you decide you're as clean as you can make yourself. Luckily, you notice that you've stopped shrinking, though you're a good deal shorter than you were before, standing about 4' 10\" tall. It feels unusual being this height, though with everything that's happened so far, both in this reality and the last one, you\u2019d have expected to have gotten used to feeling unusual. You shake your head, laughing to yourself, more out of frustration than anything else. At least you've solved one of the mysteries presented to you. But now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you hear a thumping sound coming from downstairs. Grabbing a clean towel, you wrap it around your waist and head out to the hall, keeping an ear out for any more sounds. You hear what sounds like a lot of heavy breathing and panting, and occasional shouts and grunts from two voices that sound a hell of a lot like Alex and Hunter. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to the stairs, you begin to get worried. All the thumping, and grunting, and breathing - it sounded an awful lot like, well... No, it couldn\u2019t be. They were too young, they couldn't know about it... But still, if they did... boy, that would mean trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your breath and crossing your fingers, you try to make your way down the steps as quietly as possible. Luckily, your smaller stature means that your footsteps are much lighter, and it's easy to be stealthy. As you come to the landing in the staircase, you turn and can see into the living room. Sure enough, Alex and Hunter are there. You notice that they\u2019ve both removed their shirts and pants, wearing only boxers. Oh crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling a little, you step a few more steps down, bracing yourself. As you look closer, you finally realize what Alex and Hunter are actually doing.</span></div></div>",

Alex is on his back, and Hunter is on top of him. Both of the teen studs are aggressively making out with each other. The scariest detail is that they're both half naked, and their thick boners are on display in the tight fabric. Neither one of the boys are saying anything, being too busy already using their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter obviously can't hold himself back anymore before he breaks their make out session and throws his boxers off. Out springs the biggest dick you've ever seen in your life. Not only is it at least 10 inches long, but incredibly thick too. It swings up and slaps his ripped abs with a loud \"thwack\" before bobbing back down into place, throbbing in time with his heartbeat. He positions himself on his knees over Alex's thick chest and forces his length into Alex's face. It presses against your brother's lips for a moment before he opens his mouth eagerly and begins sucking on the incredible cock attached to the other young god's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Alex. It feels so good...\" Hunter groans, his eyes rolling back in pleasure. He rests his weight down on Alex's thick pecs and proceeds to feel up his own body while Alex sucks him off. His hands travel across his tight abs and up his incredible pecs before he starts to play with his large nipples. The extra stimulation makes him groan even louder, encouraging Alex to keep up his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is swirling his tongue happily over the head of Hunter's cock, swallowing every drop of salty precum that rolls onto his superhuman tongue. Unbeknownst to both of the boys, even the precum was having an effect on Alex's body. Though it was minimal, it was not lost on you while you watched them. Alex's shoulder gained new definition, and you could tell that his pecs were a little larger, considering Hunter was sitting slightly higher than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, before either one of them figured it out, Hunter pulled his cock out of Alex's mouth and pulled down Alex's boxers. His cock leaped out and slapped against his abs just like Hunter's did. You couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy as you watched Hunter stroke your brother's dick. Not only was he tall, and incredibly muscled, he was ridiculously hung. Your dick was certainly nothing to be ashamed about, but what Alex was swinging between his legs was certainly much more than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right, Hunter. This feels amazing.\" Alex moaned, his deep voice wavering in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lay back and let me take care of you.\" Hunter said in a tone that was much more seductive than you thought possible from such a young boy. Maybe Hunter knew exactly what he was doing after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Hunter know about the stimulus? Did he know that if he made Alex cum, it would make him even more of a god? You didn't think it was possible, but you don't know what to expect anymore. Your life is already thrown into an unending spiral of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, use your mouth like I did.\" Alex demanded, prompting Hunter to grin and slowly insert Alex's cock into his mouth. Your brother moans even louder at the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't do something to stop them, they're eventually going to figure out that their own bodies produce the very stimulus you have to keep them away from, but what can you even do to stop these two powerful teens? They're much larger and stronger than you, and nothing's going to stop their horny bodies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or are they simply enjoying going all out against their only worthy opponent: each other?  They'd break your bones if they used that kind of force on you!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStaring down at the writhing mass of all that ripped, big brother-pounding <b>MUSCLE</b>, you start to harden again and in response quickly close your eyes.  Consequently, you miss the end of the match, staying like that until you hear Alex exclaim, \"Shit!  He really did shrink!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see both of your titanic younger brothers looming above you, still wearing only their boxers.  At your new height, the top of your head barely reaches their collarbones.  For the first time since coming to this reality the two are almost completely unclothed and, to your sad self-disgust, the mere sight of the twelve and thirteen year-olds\u2019 chiseled, impossibly fantastic physiques causes a marked resurgence of your \"problem\".  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What do you mean about him shrinking?\" Hunter asks curiously, and your blood freezes as you realize Alex has noticed what happened to you!   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I heard him talking to someone on the phone after karate practice,\" Alex explains.  \"They were talking about a stimulus that would make us grow and him shrink and now look: he's down to four feet ten inches!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"He's been that height for months,\" Hunter protests, puzzled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou edge away, intending to flee back to your room, but unfortunately your motion catches Hunter's attention.  A sadistic smile crosses his flawless face and you freeze.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour younger siblings share the same incredibly muscular builds, the same unbelievable strength, and the same attitude of casual cruelty towards you.  Hunter, however, has always been far more creative in tormenting you, doubtless a product of his unsurpassed intellect.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, there's one place I see he hasn't shrunk.  Like what you see, Justin?\" Hunter snarks, with a meaningful glance downward.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo your mortification you realize the front of the towel is being pushed out by your erection.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTaking a step forward Hunter deliberately bounces his sculpted, paving slab pecs in your face, a maneuver which sends the front end of your towel rising higher, much to your shame. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill smirking Hunter raises his fearfully imposing arms and slowly shifts into a devastating double bicep pose!         <br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo your horror you realize what he\u2019s doing: Hunter is deliberately fueling your arousal, knowingly pushing you to the point of orgasm!  Your mega-buff, uber-intelligent adopted sibling intends to make you climax without even touching you!  To him it's merely a fun new way of asserting his complete dominance over you, by demonstrating that you can't even control your own <i>body</i> around him!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTo you, however, this comparatively mild torment is something far more serious.  If you come into contact with the stimulus, you'll shrink <i>while Alex is there to see it</i>!!!  They'll figure out everything!  You can't let that happen!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou're going to have a heck of a time stopping it, though!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUnless Hunter's been hiding a secret career as a porn star, this has to be the first time he's ever done something like this, so you can't help wondering how on Earth he can possibly be so freaking good at it!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEach proud pose he assumes accentuates a different feature: the steely bricks of his six pack abs, the marble pillars of his quads, the watermelon-sized, Herculean hemispheres of his chest, and his bulging, cannonball-sized biceps.  The only thing missing is music, but then Hunter\u2019s routine doesn\u2019t require any audio enhancement.  Even Alex seems entranced by the raw, He-Boy eroticism of his favorite brother!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most alluring aspect is Hunter's complete self-confidence!  If he would only show the least hint of uncertainty or shame, his impromptu performance wouldn't be nearly as effective!  Instead his arrogantly self-assured exhibitionism makes the bronzed muscleboy appear the ideal model of masculine physical perfection!      <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis shouldn't be affecting you like this, you try to tell yourself frantically!  You like girls!  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYet not an hour earlier you brought yourself to envious orgasm over your hulking \"little\" brothers' very <b>BIG</b> muscles!  That streak of marcrophilia you earlier identified in yourself can't help responding to a towering, gorgeous superhunk like Hunter deliberately posing and flexing for you!    <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou remind yourself how often Hunter has abused you, how badly he battered you in karate practice just today!  Strangely, however, thinking of what a bad boy bully Hunter is doesn't seem to be helping your situation one bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to look away, but try as you might, you can\u2019t take your eyes off the chestnut-haired, emerald-eyed Adonis flaunting himself before you.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knowing smirk Hunter\u2019s wearing makes it clear how much he\u2019s enjoying himself, smugly secure in his belief that, at the tender age of twelve, he\u2019s still the hottest muscle-stud you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on in your life.  And, as he is about virtually everything else, Hunter is of course absolutely right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, you consider bolting from the room even if it means losing your towel in your flight, but your situation is so precarious you don\u2019t dare risk any additional . . . friction.  Besides, you doubt Hunter would let you escape so easily, not before he\u2019s finished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of frustration momentarily and thankfully blot out your vision, but you instinctively blink them away.  You lock gazes with your gorgeous, colossally muscular kid brother and in Hunter\u2019s endless green eyes you see his utter certitude of victory, his sadistic pleasure at torturing you with his own obscenely irresistible attractiveness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your own body about to joyfully betray you to the awesome, ultimate alpha male who is your adopted younger brother, and in that single instant you have a monumental decision to make.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you blurt out everything you know about the voice and what it\u2019s told you?  They\u2019re on the verge of learning what the stimulus is in any case; maybe if you tell them everything while you can your bullying, superboy younger brothers will go easy on you.  Who knows, they might even agree to help you perform whatever mysterious task you have to accomplish; the voice <u>did</u> say you\u2019d need help to complete it.  And the truth is you\u2019re sick to death of trying to understand this inexplicably bizarre situation on your own; why not let Hunter\u2019s beyond brilliant brain take a crack at figuring things out instead?      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you trust them with the truth, though?  Hunter and Alex use you as their own personal punching bag!  Now that the two terrifyingly tall, tremendously muscular Greek godlings are about to discover how to get even larger and more powerful, shouldn\u2019t you keep your knowledge of what\u2019s going on as your final trump card?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weighing your options, you figured the safest choice would be to not describe the stimulus at all. You figure that maybe they won't notice what happens, or maybe somehow won't catch on. You knew that any minute now you would have to give in to Hunter, your body just couldn't hold it in. Hunter only sped this process up by removing the towel from your body with his giant hand, making you even closer to orgasm. Hunter simply smirked down at you, flexing in every way possible. Your body finally gave in. A bit of cum rolled down your cock, and you began to shrink. At first, it wasn't noticeable to Hunter. But, after about half a minute, you were noticeably smaller than you just were, standing at about 4 and a half feet tall. Hunter looked astonished as you kept inching downwards, every passing second having to crane your neck more to look him in his face. You noticed the smaller you got, the more you couldn't hold it in. And there was gonna be no way to leave and wash it off any time soon. For all you knew, you would be 5 inches tall when you were done shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now an even 4 feet tall, the shrinking had slowed a little bit, but you still felt the impulse to grab your cock and go to town. Unfortunately, for a split second, your cock shot some cum, and it happened to land on Hunter's foot. He looked angered at first, but that quickly changed when he noticed things getting smaller around him, not just you. Because of that little squirt on his foot, Hunter grew far above Alex, and towered over everyone in the room. Alex walked speechlessly over to Hunter, looking up at the titan. Hunter quickly put two and two together and smiled ear to ear. He realized the stimulus, he didn't need to be shown anything else. He threw his boxers down, revealing the biggest cock you had ever seen. Yours wasn't small by any means, but this one would put it to shame. It stretched at least 10 inches long, and with how small you had gotten, it was practically right in your face. Hunter grasped his giant cock with an equally giant hand, and pushed it to his body. From there, a stream of cum shot up his body, sticking to him like glue. You gulped as Hunter vibrated, and started to stretch. He started rocketing upwards, as cum continued to spill out of his cock. To make matters worse, seeing this happen in front of you, you also shot cum on to Hunter, and you couldn't stop it. Hunter was now growing faster than he ever could. His head hit the ceiling, and he crouched to continue his growth. You had stopped shrinking at a measly 3 foot 5, but Hunter showed no signs of stopping his growth any time. He had surpassed the 10 foot tall mark, and was seemingly aiming to be skyscraper size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex,\" Hunter roared overhead, \"I need more cum. Come over here and spray me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your brother was obeying Hunter, obviously intimidated by his size and what power he had. Alex lowered his boxers, revealing a mighty cock, not quite as large as Hunter's though, and started jerking off on to Hunter. You used this opportunity to run, or jump, up the stairs, which were really big for a person of your small stature. You went to the bathroom to remove any trace of cum from your body. While washing yourself you could hear the moans from Alex, as well as from Hunter, but Hunter's were ones of pleasure. It didn't help that every few seconds you would hear bangs coming from certain objects throughout the house. Once you were done, you went to the stairs to look down and see the damage. In the two minutes that you were in the bathroom, Hunter had gone from about 11 feet tall, and was engulfing the house, you would guess easily 30 feet tall if he were to stand. And he was still growing! All of the cum was sticking to him, and as long as it was there touching his body, he would grow until he was satisfied. But when would that be? Does he want to be 100 feet tall? 1000 feet tall? Tall enough to stomp a city with one step of a god-like foot? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Alex had not come in touch with the cum at all. He had obeyed Hunter's orders, but Alex was still his size, granted he was huge compared to you and any normal person, but to Hunter, Alex might as well have been some sort of toy. You could hear Alex say to Hunter, \"Can you do it to me next?\" Hunter let out a loud laugh and said, \"No, this is only for me to enjoy, and if you break those rules you'll feel my wrath.\" You shivered as you heard it. Was Hunter really controlling everyone around him as if he owned all of you already? Your thoughts were interrupted when....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The house began to shake, violently. Bursting through the floor was Hunter's giant hand. Tearing the floor out, he grabbed you in a steel grip, pulling you down to his floor. His growth had slowed, Alex had run out of cum and sat panting on the floor. Hunter as well had stopped cumming, but some still left dripping from him allowed him to continue slight growth. Hunter looked down at the pest in his hand and smiled. You looked up at him, terrified of what we was thinking of doing to you. Suddenly, his grasp became firmer. You winced at the pain his giant hand was doing to you, but you felt something else in your body. Hunter's size and power was the only reason you would start to cum, it was as if he knew this. You knew it too, and shortly after, cum poured from your penis. It had nowhere to go, except for on Hunter's giant hand, and also onto you. Now everything began to become bigger to you, while Hunter was increasing size at double the speed of everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Justin, I can count on you to help me grow. I guess I'm too much for you to hold in,\" Hunter said, his voice thundering far above. Feeling replenished, Hunter grabbed his cock and once again, pressed it against his own body and let cum shoot up onto him. It seemed the bigger he got, the less amount of cum was needed to help him grow. So now the amount of cum on him made him spurt upwards at a greater speed. He got so big that to stay in the confines of the house, he needed to now lay down. This sent Alex scrambling to get out of the way of the behemoth of a man. As he crashed down to the floor, a loud crack was heard. The house was giving way slightly, and would soon burst at the rate Hunter was growing. In all of this commotion, Hunter had let you fall, you were now on his massive body, laying on one of his massive pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man, did I just lay down in a pool of cum. That's just a shame,\" Hunter said with a smirk. And he did indeed. His body grew even faster than before. His body stretched through the downstairs of the house, now having to bend his legs to even fit while laying down. As he looked down at his growing body, he noticed you, sprawled out on one of his pecs. He laughed a loud, deep laugh. He knew what he was about to do would be impossible to change. He grabbed you with an even bigger hand than before and placed you right in the center of his chest. You were puzzled as to why he would move you to that exact spot. You noticed he reached further down his body, doing something which seemed needed to be precise. Then it hit you as soon as it physically hit you. Hunter's cum shot with such a force from his cock, it knocked you onto his body. Laying there, you realized you couldn't move. The force was too great. Instantly, you inched downward at an alarming rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now I know what my smallest will be,\" you thought to yourself in defeat. There was absolutely no way to escape from this. Hunter would keep his cock pointed and spraying at you until you were as small as you could be, then he would continue to grow. You were now in the 2 foot range. Your shrinking increased rapidly. Soon a ruler would be enough to measure your size. On the opposite end, Hunter would soon be measured in skyscrapers, as the giant showed no signs of wanting to slow down anytime soon. Hunter shifted slightly to get comfortable. However, this had consequences. Part of the house collapsed because of his size. Hunter took this as an opportunity to cause more destruction. He swept his leg out, taking out another end of the house, the other leg moved the opposite direction, taking out more of the house. Hunter would soon destroy your entire house, as the only part left was the part his massive head was heading towards. Hunter laughed playfully. To any giant, this would be a game, to see what they could crush and how much. To Hunter, this was some sick and twisted game. He did this to show off how perfect of a human he was, showing there was no stopping him. Within this time, you had stopped shrinking. Hunter yelled for Alex to come to the giant laying in the ruins of a half destroyed house. Alex came to Hunter. Hunter had become so big, his body while laying down towered over a standing Alex. You figured standing up, Hunter could potentially be in the triple digits. He told Alex to find a ruler in order to measure how small you had become. Alex went to the undestroyed part of the house. Meanwhile, Hunter decided to clean you off. Giant fingers rubbed around you, wiping off any trace of cum from your body. This was of course so when Alex measured you, he wouldn't get the affects of the stimulus. Just to be safe, Hunter wiped you clean with his tongue, leaving you drenched in Hunter's saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex returned with a ruler. \"Measure this measly pest and tell me how small he is,\" Hunter demanded as he laughed overhead. He threw you to Alex, who luckily caught you. Holding you in his hand, Alex began to measure you. Alex, a normal sized human, was able to hold you in one hand. Compare this to Hunter, who could easily hold Alex in one hand, and compared to Hunter you were nothing. Hunter looked over at the measurement, inching upwards every second. Alex finally finished measuring, and started laughing once he found out. \"He's only 7 inches tall,\" laughed Alex, mocking your size and how puny you were. Hunter became annoyed by this. He grabbed Alex and started squeezing him with his hand. \"You think you get to make fun of people's heights, insect?\" Hunter said, angered at Alex. Alex gulped, trying to free himself. That attempt just made Hunter increase his grip. \"I'm the biggest one here, only I can make fun of people's heights. In fact, I don't know if I want you here Alex,\" Hunter said. Alex tried begging, but Hunter only wanted you and him together. He wanted no one between you and him. He forced Alex to release you, and then he took Alex, and lifting his body up a little bit, placed him under his own, and laid back down. A crunch was heard as Hunter laughed evilly. \"That's victim #1,\" Hunter said, possibly foreshadowing. You were surprised, when Hunter all of a sudden.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter placed you down on his massive, growing body. You didn't quite understand what it was he was doing until he did it. He blew. Not terribly hard, almost a blow as if you were to get hair out of your face, and he did this in your direction. The end result was shocking to you. You went flying off his body, and across the ruins of the house, landing outside in what used to be your backyard. Of course now reflecting on it, you aren't terribly shocked that you went flying. After all, this titan could probably make some normal sized human go flying with a breath, with you it was just easier. You were the size of a bug and weak. As you were collecting your thoughts and gathering yourself, the ground around you started to shake. You turned back toward the house, and what you saw left your mouth agape. Towering above any and everything, Hunter stood ominously over the neighborhood, a slight smile across his face as he panned around at the puny objects around him. You weren't shocked because he was a giant, you were shocked because he was bigger than you ever thought he was. You had always wondered what a giant person would look like compared to the rest of the world, but you never expected it to happen today, nor would you have ever wanted it to be Hunter. You panned down the young god's naked body. Broad shoulders held a massive, handsome head. Giant pecs with defined abs. A cock which you swear could take out a skyscraper stuck far out from his body. Giant hands and arms at his sides, bulging, muscular. The hands were bigger than his cock, very hard to believe with how giant the latter was. Giant, tan skyscrapers stuck out of the earth. These were Hunter's legs. Defined, muscular, and they all led to the base, his giant feet. You couldn't believe how big this kid had gotten, especially in such a short time period. It had appeared he had stopped growing, as possibly the cum had dried up, or dripped from him. Though you shivered as you thought that he would literally be unstoppable. He could produce the stimulus whenever he wanted. A lot of it too. He had the power to grow in him, literally. Suddenly the earth beneath you began to shake and rumble. You fell back into the blades of grass as you couldn't stay upright. Hunter had lifted his foot off the ground, and hovered it over the ruins of your house. He let it go, the foot crushed into the ground, causing a loud crash sound, deafening to someone as small as you. As his foot impacted the ground, the earth shook even more than before. You figured once he continued growing he would be able to cause earthquakes. He lifted his foot up, and placed it back into the street. The titan giggled with delight, having pancaked the remains of your house. You knew that he knew he was unstoppable in every way. He had the world in his hand, and soon he literally might. Hunter, though, looked around puzzled. His loud, deafening voice called out, \"Justin. Justin. Where are you my little insect?\" \"Shit,\" you thought to yourself. He still wanted you. However, you were small enough for a giant of several hundred feet to not be able to see you. You figured your best option would be to lay low in the grass, shielded by the giant blades around you. Hunter looked to become more annoyed. Because of this he....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could see the anger build on Hunter's face. He was always a \"I get my way\" type of kid, especially with his brute strength and normal size. Now at titan strength and size, you knew that a temper tantrum from Hunter was bound to happen at any moment. He always had a short fuse. Hunter called out your name some more, each time with more annoyance than the one prior. You, however, felt safe and comfortable in the tall grass around you. Perhaps being bug sized had its perks after all. You were so small that anyone giant sized wouldn't be able to see you. You had found a way to evade Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growl, Hunter looked around, anger on his face and in his eyes. A mad, human-sized Hunter could throw some crazy tantrums. You shivered at the thought of a few hundred feet tall Hunter having a tantrum. Unfortunately for you, and your neighborhood, that tantrum was only seconds away. Hunter raised his enormous foot up, and immediately plunged it into the house on your right. You heard the screams of all your neighbors, and saw, what appeared to you, giants running every which way, trying to move from Hunter's wrath. Of course, these people were normal height, but to you they were truly giants. Hunter laughed at this commotion he caused. But, not satisfied he took his other massive foot, and crushed the house on your left. You craned your neck upwards, somehow able to see Hunter's face high above. He had an evil grin pasted across his face, and his eyes filled with fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was always the kid to like to showcase his dominance over everyone. No matter what age, he had always been the alpha of that age group. Hell, you could have put him with a group 5 years older than him, and he could have became the leader of the group. Establishing dominance was in Hunter's blood. So it didn't surprise you that he appeared to be enjoying this demolition session. After all, he normally only took stuff like this out on you. You knew he always thought he was better than anyone else.Now you realized he was 100% right with an observation like that. Your thoughts became interrupted by more screams of terror. With every second Hunter took a stomp, crushing any and everything in his path. Houses went crumbling down under his brute force. Power lines snapped, trees went every which way, telephone poles went flying. Hunter was causing chaos, something a kid would enjoy, something Hunter truly enjoyed. As all this happened, you noticed Hunter's cock stiffen and expand. You realized that meant it was only a matter of time before the titan grasped his cock with his giant hand to make himself even more imposing. Evil laughs roared overhead. You noticed Hunter was leaving 0 houses intact. Even some of his best friends' houses were getting crushed by the giant. Hunter stomped further down the street, causing more destruction and calamity. It seemed as if every step gave Hunter more confidence, more power to make the next step. As you peered down the street, not a single house from what you could see was standing. In fact, Hunter was on the other side of the street, making his way back towards you. Every passing second his steps and laughs becoming louder. Crush. Crush. Crush. Hunter had gotten to the last house on your street that was left intact. He stood ominously over it for a few seconds, peering down at the mini-house beneath him. A huge smile formed on his face. He hovered his massive foot over the house, completely engulfing it in a shadow. It was just as he started to speak that it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah look, it's Tim's house. Justin, if you were a good friend, you would come out, and then I won't crush your friend's house,\" Hunter said above, a slight laugh to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was not only strong and big, but smart to boot. He knew what he was doing. Honestly, you weighed your options. Tim is your best friend, one of the only ones that would side with you over Hunter. Perhaps somehow you two teaming up could stop Hunter. And you hadn't seen Tim leave his house. He was very well still in there, sleeping. He was always a heavy sleeper. Weighing your options, you realized you had to make a choice quickly. Hunter was slowly lowering his foot towards crushzone. You ran out onto the street, flailing, waving your arms. Shouting at the top of your lungs. You got beneath the giant and into his eyesight. Hunter let out a laugh of amusement as he stomped his foot down onto the ground, crushing Tim, and the house. You gasped as it happened, but then a giant hand grabbed you with a force you've never felt before, putting you in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Justin, I didn't think you were that stupid. I can't believe you fell for something like that. And now you're all mine,\" Hunter said, as he opened his hand. Looking up, a giant face was looking down at you, smiling an evil smile. \"Imagine all the things I can do to you. Imagine how much bigger I'll be able to get. You really messed this up, didn't you Justin?\" Hunter laughed a deep, deafening laugh. Now with him having captured you, he decided to.....</span></div></div>",

When you turned and looked to see where he was looking, you noticed he was staring towards downtown, completely untouched by the giant. Hunter then peered down toward his cock, still waiting to eject and make Hunter bigger than ever. Hunter then stepped towards the city with a massive stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I go destroy some more here, then I can finally grow more,\" Hunter roared above. In what would normally be a 20 minute drive to get to downtown, Hunter accomplished this feat in less than 30 seconds. As you looked around you noticed Hunter towered above everything here too. The only thing close to this immaculate height was the tallest skyscraper in the city, but even then Hunter was still taller. Of course, to establish dominance, Hunter stepped towards the tall building, demolishing everything in his way. Stopping beside the building, he laughed at how small it was next to him. The top of the building only reached Hunter's stomach, showcasing Hunter's incredible size, as the next tallest building was only half the tallest building's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought before that stuff was puny, but now everything is puny! Imagine what I'll look like when I grow more!\" Hunter yelled above. The giant moved towards the building, but instead of crushing it, he decided to walk right through it. His massive leg and lower torso completely wrecked the building, tearing it apart with the strength of what seemed like 50 wrecking balls. With the tallest building out of the way, Hunter now truly stuck out. The tallest building was now equal to the height of Hunter's knees, and the titan could still grow whenever he wanted! Even so, he continued to cause chaos, going on a rampage through the city. Building after building stepped on, being torn apart by giant feet and legs. All the while, you were locked in a firm grip of fingers, as Hunter held you in his hand, forcing you to watch the destruction he unleashed on the city. With Hunter's pace and size, you figured he would be able to destroy all of the downtown area in a span of 5 minutes. Almost as if Hunter could hear your thoughts, he picked up the pace, crushing faster than before. It was almost as if he wanted to prove you wrong, to show he was more impressive than you initially thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat went from letting out anger turned into a fun game for Hunter. Absolutely no one could stop him, and even if they could, who would try? Hunter knew everything in the world was now his, that he would choose what happened for everyone living on this planet. One final grunt above signaled the end of this destruction, as Hunter forced his foot into the ground, obliterating the final building in the downtown. Hunter walked back to what used to be the center and looked around, delighted at what he saw. The city lay flatter than a pancake, nothing standing up from the ground. Ruins littered the streets, people who were able to survive, shivering as they looked up at the man who caused this destruction. He looked back down, returning a smile and an evil laugh. Then, he changed his attention to you. Normal size people were already hard to see for Hunter, which made you absolutely microscopic to the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Justin, you really are ruining everything being this small. I want to grow more, but I won't be able to see you if I keep getting bigger. We need a way to make you bigger,\" Hunter said. You pondered this. You would love to return to a normal size. Even then, maybe Hunter would grow you everytime he decided to grow. The only question was: what could make you grow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hunter thought long and hard, you as well pondered what could possibly make you grow. After all, there was so much stuff in the world, who knows what one thing would reverse the stimulus? But, Hunter had an \"aha\" moment as he thought. Of course he did, you thought, after all he was a genius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since a bodily fluid made you shrink, it must be some form of bodily fluid that makes you grow as well,\" Hunter said with a smile. The question was, what was it? You thought about all the fluids. Cum already makes you shrink so that's out. Sweat. You were already in contact with Hunter's sweat, so that was out of the question. You could only think of pee as well, but that seemed to gross for you to want to grow. There had to be something else. At that moment, Hunter figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what makes you shrink is down there,\" Hunter said, grabbing his giant cock, \"then what reverses that must be up here,\" Hunter said as he raised you up to head level. The giant opened his mouth, and moved you towards it. You thought he was just gonna eat you so he didn't have to deal with you anymore. You fought, but how were you supposed to stop him? He placed you on his giant tongue and closed his mouth. Darkness covered the inside of his mouth. Every now and then you would get some light, enough to see giant teeth, bigger than you were, as white as they could be. Seriously, was anything on this kid not perfect? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter began to roll his tongue all over you. Teasing you, is what you thought. He always liked to tease you before he did stuff to you. Now he was covering you in his saliva. Wait, that was it. SALIVA. Just as you had figured it out, you started to stretch outwards. Hunter had figured it out! The giant spat you back into his hand to see your progress. You were now about half of your normal height, still inching upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Justin, I'm just gonna let you grow for a bit. After all, I'm gonna be growing even more soon, so you'll still be like a speck to me no matter how big I let you get!\" Hunter said with a sarcastic laugh. Hunter placed you back in his mouth, just to get another coating of saliva on you. After all, you were wasting his time with how slow you were growing. You reached your height, 6 feet tall, but Hunter let you keep growing. In fact, you passed the 7 foot mark, 8 foot, 9 foot, all the way to 10 feet tall. Giant fingers rubbed up and down your body, drying you off, just to make sure you weren't gonna grow without Hunter's consent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you thought that was cool Justin? Just wait for this!\" Hunter went into growth mode again. Cum spewed up his massive body, covering him in this liquid. As fast as you could blink, Hunter shot straight up. You had to guess he grew 50 feet in the matter of a few seconds. You had never seen growth like this, even his growth from before seemed like a snail's pace compared to this. The hand you were placed in continued to expand outwards, showcasing bigger size than ever. You looked down. Footprints made now were twice the size as when he was crushing through the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make you grow too Justin,\" Hunter said as he grabbed you by two massive fingers, wrapping his tongue around your tiny body. You began to grow in his hand, but it was no where near at the pace at which the titan was growing. He was probably outpacing you 100:1, and you figured the bigger he got, the faster he would grow each time. His massive footprints went from 2x the size to now 10x the size. Hunter was soaking everything in, flexing as he grew, showcasing dominance. His massive muscles bulged. As you looked at Hunter, you couldn't believe just how perfect of a human he was. Muscular, giant, massive hands and feet, a soothing, deep voice, perfect teeth, a massive cock, and to top it all off, he was a genius.. He had literally every trait a man could want. And he could make some of those traits better whenever he desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter seemed to reach a point where he wanted to stop growing. Sometimes you gotta save it and see life from every height. He looked in the direction of the ocean. You couldn't see anything from his hand, but way above you at his eye level, he could probably see the ocean, 50 miles out. What would normally be a long drive and a VERY long walk would take a minute, maybe even seconds at Hunter's size. You could see him pondering what to do. He decided to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While you're glancing around trying to decide which object you should touch next the rest of the karate class troops into the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining four students are clustered in a tight group around Hunter, competing with each other for his attention even though he's disdainfully ignoring all of them.  Obviously they idolize your younger brother even more than they fear him.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter stops at the locker next to yours and opens it.  Untying his brand new black belt he places it carefully on the shelf.  Then he strips off his gi.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery eye in the room, including yours, instantly turns toward him and dead silence falls.  Mortally embarrassed as you are you still can't bring yourself to look away and your four classmates don't even try to hide their keen interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seek to justify it to yourself as a natural impulse.  After all, you and the others are really only average kids, while Hunter is a muscle-bound Samson!  Isn't it understandable that you'd be a little, well, . . . curious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't seem possible Hunter could miss everyone staring at him, but he doesn't react, calmly placing his gi on the bench to fold it.  Modesty in any form is one of the few concepts your beyond brilliant adopted brother never seemed to grasp.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou therefore have plenty of time for your gaze to roam across every inch of the preteen Greek god's naked form.  You take in his anvil-like six pack abs, his statuesque chest, his barn-door wide shoulders, his huge biceps, and his tree-trunk thick legs.  By the time he places the folded gi neatly in his locker the five of you are almost drooling over the sculpted, power-packed magnificence of Hunter's absolutely flawless frame. When at last he wraps a towel around himself the silence is shattered by the multiple sighs of disappointment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a smirk form on Hunter's movie star handsome face; he knew all along the effect he was having on the five of you!  Damn him!  He's only twelve, for Pete's sake!  How on Earth can he be so remarkably ripped, so unbelievably <b>BUILT</b>?!?!    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Alex boasts an equally awesome physique, but at least your biological brother isn't also one of the smartest people on the planet!  It's his nightmarish combination of mental and physical perfection which makes Hunter the more fearsome of your siblings.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, on second thought, it's his personality which truly scares you.  Hunter's arrogance, aggressiveness and assertiveness are off the scale.  He really does see the people around him as his pathetic inferiors, unworthy even of his exalted attention, much less his concern.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce after he'd beaten you up when he was ten you tried to persuade him that he should use his staggering gifts for good.  In response he sneeringly told you that he was he was Nietzsche's superman in the flesh.  You argued that Superman was <i>good</i>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burst out laughing and almost kicked you through a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when you actually learned who Nietzsche was and what Hunter was referring to, you felt like a fool but that's usually what happens when you try to debate with Hunter.  First he demolishes your argument, then he demolishes YOU!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smirking infuriatingly, Hunter reaches into his locker again and takes out a small red bottle of Gatorade.  Oh, man, you could use some of that now, especially after the exertions you've made today!  Gatorade is one of the very few things which you, Alex and Hunter all agree on.  Sometimes you guys even have it with your breakfast!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter twists off the cap and carelessly tosses it to one of the other boys to take care of.  That the seventeen year-old looks thrilled by this makes you feel sick.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute!  The voice said the stimulus was very close to you, didn't it?  That gatorade was in the locker next to yours!  And you arrived in this reality right after breakfast today, but Hunter and Alex must have arrived at least a little bit earlier.  If they had Gatorade with their breakfast, then that would explain why they both turned into junior Goliaths!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Hunter's about to drink another bottle of the stuff!  You've gotta stop him!  Without thinking you lunge at your younger brother, grabbing for the Gatorade.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fortunately your sudden, desperate attack catches Hunter completely off-guard.  Seizing the bottle you wrench it out of his grasp, sending it spinning off to the right.  It hits the floor just in front of the entrance to the showers, the crimson liquid within draining out in a spreading puddle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, however, a few drops of the gatorade splatters onto your wrist.  Hunter seems to grow before you as you shrink at least a couple of inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo inches just from that?!?  You're gonna have to avoid any further contact with Gatorade at all costs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing fearfully upward, already dreading the consequences of your action, you glimpse something you have never before seen on Hunter's flawless facial features: an expression of complete and total bewilderment.  For all his stunning, prodigious intellect, Hunter cannot seem to comprehend how on Earth you could have possibly chosen to do such a thing to him.  Even his supra-genius mind cannot come up with any conceviable set of circumstances which would lead you to attack and embarass him in this manner, <i>knowing</i> what he can do to you in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unaccustomed thrill races throught you.  For once, you actually know something important that Hunter doesn't!  It's a nice feeling, but it's quickly overshadowed by fear.  Hunter's paralysis of incomprehension and disbelief won't last forever, and the very last thing you want is to be within arm's reach of him when it ends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt for the door.  Todd makes a move to get in your way, almost certainly to curry favor with Hunter, but you unleash a reflexive punch to his throat that sends him gagging back against the lockers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh.  Maybe you're learning something from this karate class after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone else can act you're out of the locker room and racing toward the exit, trying to ignore your exhaustion and the continual aching of your body from Hunter's earlier brutalizing; you're going to suffer a lot worse if he catches up to you now!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you make it outside, though, you stop and breathe a sigh of relief.  Proud and arrogant as Hunter is, he's not about to chase you in public wearing nothing but a towel, and he hates not having a chance to shower off the perspiration from his physical exertions afterwards.  You're safe for now, but the thought of what awaits you when Hunter does get hold of you makes you tremble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did you have, though?  Things are bad enough as it is!  There was just no way you could've let   Hunter down an entire bottle of the stimulus, not with how tall and massively muscled the Herculean twelve year-old is already!  Even if he didn't realize the changes, you sure would have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute.  What was it the voice on the phone said again?  That only the ones aware of the nature of this reality would be aware of any changes?  He also warned you not to let either your brothers overhear that this wasn't the real reality, because then they could get even more powerful than they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alex DID overhear, right before he crushed your phone!  Alex knows the truth and since he left the building at least five minutes before you did he's probably nearly home by now.  And what is he likely to do once he gets home?  The same thing Hunter tried to do: down some of his favorite drink, Gatorade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'll grow, and he'll <b>know </b>why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before in your life have put as much effort into anything as you do now in running home.  You're tired enough to want to collapse, you hurt everywhere and with the two inches you lost your stride doesn't cover as much ground as it used to, but you grimly ignore all of this and press on.  You have to get there in time, you HAVE to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a chance.  Alex wanted to find the stimulus, so its possible he's concentrating on that and going around touching things instead of sitting down at the table with a glass of Gatorade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe he wanted a drink and a snack before he started looking for the stimulus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sneakers pound against the concrete and sweat drips down your face.  You stumble and almost fall, but you keep going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere!  There's your house!  It seems to take a year for you get from the sidewalk to your front door and as you enter the hall your heart pounds in the agony of anticipation of what you might find.    <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n                  </span></div></div>",

Both doors of your family\u2019s double wide fridge have been left open, and the smell of food fills the air. There are wrappers and containers everywhere, all leaving a trail to the large table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sitting at the kitchen table was your brother Alex, his gut distended from his obvious binge. Then a sight that made your heart sank, a bottle of Gatorade clenched in his Baseball mitt like hand.  But wait, he hadn\u2019t drunk from it yet! Maybe he\u2019d given up in his search for the stimulus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Bro! What\u2019s the hurry?\u201d He asks noting the panicked look on your profuse sweating. \u201cLooking for something?\u201d he asks, or if your worst fears were true, he taunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-no!\u201d you stammer than shout, maybe you could finagle your way out of this mess yet, this was the fate of reality at stake here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think you are!\u201d insists your brother getting up from the table. \u201cYou look thirsty! Want some Gatorade!\u201d he smiles, perhaps savoring the moment.  The red Gatorade splashes inside the bottle and as he extends it out towards you. You whimper and step back a bit before realizing the lid was still thankfully on. The lightning bolt logo seems to glow as you approach it; and a wave of crackling seems to come over your ears. Was this it! Was it really going to be that easy to grab it and go home? Your eyes widen as you reach for the bottle but then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSike!\u201d says Alex yanking the bottle back with Karate Master levels of honed speed.\u201cThis is what you were talking on the cell phone about wasn\u2019t it? I ate everything int the whole fridge, even eating nasty cottage cheese, but it was worth it because this is it! I can feel it too bro! Like, it\u2019s literally lightening in a bottle, and the sound of tiny little static shocks popping-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on instinct, you cut Alex\u2019s speech short, just like with Hunter before, you lunge at the bottle; only this time your fingertips come up just two inches two short of knocking the bottle loose. Alex is surprised, but quickly moves back, and then with one long muscular arm he pushes you back to keep your distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying, now\u2026I\u2019m going to get bigger and stronger! Stronger than Alex! Bigger than <i>anyone</i>!\u201d His eyes wide with delight the complete opposite of your own eyes filled with horror. And with a flick of his thumb easily forces the lid off. He doesn\u2019t just drink, he chugs it! Dousing himself with it and letting drops dribble down his chin, cheeks, and chest, his already super-sized lungs letting him down the entire bottle in a single breath! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d he breaths wiping his mouth carelessly with his sleeve. \u201cUrrppp!\u201d he adds, the belch loud enough to rattle windows. Then, silence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare. He stares. Nothing really seems to be happening. Alex seems upset scanning his body for any notable changes when suddenly he grabs his stomach. \u201dWhoa bro\u2026\u201d he whispers caught off guard by whatever he was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<b>Whoa bro indeed</b>\u2019 was your last thought before\u2026</span></div></div>",

His shoes are the next to go his feet rising and lengthen like baked bread in order to catch up to the bulk they were supposed to be supporting.

His eyes fall upon you, and he smiles, sensing both the awe and the envy in your gaze. He gives his bicep a flex, it\u2019s huge, the size of a cannonball if you had to guess, and probably just as heavy and powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Wait till Hunter gets a load of me. He\u2019s going to freak out! Probably, not as much as you are right now \u2018<i>lil</i> bro.\u2019 Hey, about a little wrestling match? Loser buys the winner another bottle of Gatora-\u201c His gloating is cut short as he suddenly clutches at his heart, his massive hand hitting his frying pan sized pectoral with a smack. \u201cW-wait!\u201d he sounds suddenly scared his voice going high pitched once more to the original voice of your brother. You\u2019re mouth still remains open, at a loss for words. Blue sparks of Electricity surround your brother\u2019s body; his eyes are suddenly illuminated glowing like car headlights. \u201cJustin-Wh-what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex!

You\u2019d known the stimulus would make him grow but now what was happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis headache seems to subside, though his glowing eyes remain, he stands up again, slowly, like the opening scene in Terminator 2.  \u201cJustin\u2026I\u2019ve\u2026I\u2019ve never been better!\u201d a smile lighting up his face, his voice deep and loud like it was coming out of a megaphone. \u201cI can see them bro!

His body had sure grown, but his attitude was till that of your younger brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning Alex winds up throws a punch! It was in your direction but just above your head, then the loudest sound you\u2019d ever heard! It was like glass breaking, times a million!  You looked up to see what he had just hit, but all you saw was\u2026blackness!? No ceiling, no sky, but a miniature black hole just above your head.  You realized all of reality breaking! Your brother had just punched a hole in reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself sucked in, and then a feeling overtook your body, like when an upwards going elevator suddenly stopped. You close your eyes to keep from getting sick and when you open them, you were in a huge mansion hallway, surrounded with millions of doors! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex!\u201d you shout, your voice echoing off of doors and down the empty halls. Curiosity getting the better of you, you decide to peek into one of the door, and are amazed at what you see\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was you and your brother Alex on the beach. Only, again, Alex was far bigger and muscular than you were. A crow had gathered around Alex on the beach and he seemed to be soaking up the attention.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Time to get up, shrimp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think you're about to get teased by your brother yet again as you wake up, but then you open your eyes, and see the reality of the situation is much, much stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex isn't here, but his image sure is. Posters of Alex in various poses and levels of dress, all adorned with the same smug smile, cover your walls. Slowly looking down, you see you've been sleeping in a bed with Alex's giant smiling face imposed on the sheets. Your rug also has him on it, focusing on a floor-to-ceiling shot that makes it look like he's standing on the other side of a glass floor, and the computer in your room has Alex in the Thinker pose as the background. That voice you heard? It came from your bobble-head Alex alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced to blink twice before you can even start processing how weird this is, then eventually make the connection. Riiiiiiight... Alex had the choice to choose any dimension he wanted to be the next one, so he chose one where he was the focus and ruler of everyone. Wow. That kid has some serious ego. You roll your eyes and get out of bed, then go to your bureau to get dressed. You're grateful that your wardrobe doesn't consist of solely Alex-themed clothing... only <i>mostly</i> Alex-themed clothing. You briefly give the shirt bearing Alex's face in a Che Guevara-style logo a bemused look before just settling on a white shirt with khakis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get dressed, you consider how to proceed. You admit that the clues you've been given this time don't make any sense to you yet- but you have an idea on how to get more of them. The stimulus makes you shrink and Hunter and Alex grow. Given that you've woken up here at your normal height, you can assume that you've never unintentionally been in contact with it. (Unless the stimulus only makes you shrink if you KNOW its the stimulus, you consider.) If you can see Hunter or Alex's height in this reality, it'll also tell you how often <i>they've</i> been in contact with it. Hopefully, that won't turn into the fiasco that happened last time. All that's left is to find them. Wait, didn't she say it affected other people somehow? Could that cause this whole Alex-mania thing this reality had going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the rooms of Hunter and Alex, but aside from more Alex-focused paraphernalia, there's nothing. You furrow your eyebrows and trot downstairs, checking the kitchen next, but instead, find your mother. She's drinking coffee out of a coffee cup that just says \"I <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Alex\" on side while watching the news on a miniature television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom,\" you ask. \"Do you know where Alex is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a look of great confusion. \"Shouldn't it be obvious, dear? He lives in New Alexandria, in the Emperor's Building. Been there for years. You were there when he left with Hunter, he'd just gotten too big and important for only our simple abode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo no Hunter either, then. Whatever, it's not like you were looking forward to meeting the two of them anyway. You get some cereal ready when an opportunity for some answers actually comes to you: an announcement pops up on the miniature television. Alex is going to make a live address, which is due to be broadcast on every news channel. When the live shot appears, you finally get your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many times has he come in contact with the stimulus?</span></div></div>",

I'll be back in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex lies down on the ground, closing his eyes and quickly starting to doze. Shaking your head in disappointment, you turn around and start to explore the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no doubt about it. This kitchen is laid out exactly the same as yours, right down to the last details: the homework stuck on the refrigerator, the same dishes and silverware in the same cabinets, the photo of the you and your brother from a couple of years ago over by the telephone. You think for a second after you look at the photo. Was there something weird about it? You look back at it, and are stunned to see it almost hazy, as if you can't make out the details. You rub your eyes, but the image stays the same. Strange, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you turn your attention back to exploring the cabinets. Unfortunately, the tongs are kept on a shelf above the oven, so you wouldn't be able to reach them without climbing up onto the counter. Maybe that would be a last-ditch effort, you think, but for now you look around some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping your fingers, you think of something. There's a grabber tool that you use to help clean up garbage and other debris from the front lawn. It should be in the garage, leaning against the workbench, easy enough to reach. You head out of the kitchen, past the stairs and down to the garage door, which opens with a loud creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garage is dark and empty. It's unusual for both your mom's and your dad's cars to not be parked here, especially at night, but that isn't the first unusual thing you've seen so far. You have an idea to maybe open the garage door, but looking up, it too is out of your reach, even moreso than the key. Scowling in frustration, you climb down the three steps onto the cement floor, then run over to the workbench. Sure enough, the grabber tool is there, though it's as tall as you are now. Wrapping your hands around the midsection, you lift it up. It's heavy, but not too hard to carry it with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly move back up the steps, seemingly a little more steep than before, and into the house, making sure you quietly close the garage door behind you. As you make your way back to Alex, you notice him stirring and eventually sitting up. When he does, you nearly drop the grabber tool on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is significantly larger than he was before, and his clothes prove it. His pajama shirt, tight but still covering his entire chest before, are now a half-shirt, ripping against his arm muscles and revealing a surprisingly-toned stomach. His shorts (you're sure they were full-length pants before) are now skin-tight, near the breaking point and leaving little to the imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawns, then stands up, and your jaw drops. He's taller than you now, by a good three or four inches. He looks down at you, surprised a little, then sees what you have in your hands. \"Oh, the grab-thingy. Good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him for a second, then shake your head in disbelief. \"Alex, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you! You're clothes are all tight, and you're taller than me now! You're huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex half-grins and cocks his head slightly. \"Are you sure you're feeling all right, Justin? I've been taller than you for nearly a year now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you're speechless, then you shake your head. \"No you haven't! Just a few minutes ago you were like eight inches shorter than me! Remember, you stood on my shoulders to try to reach the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop as you notice the key, which you're pointing at, is now much further away. It was still on its hook above the door, but that door was now much bigger as well. Looking around, you realize that everything in the house has seemingly gotten bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I've shrunken somehow\u2026\" you say to yourself. \"But wait! Your clothes! They're much tighter on you than before! You must've grown, somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Alex shakes his head. \"Nah, bro, I just haven't changed my PJ's in several years. These give me good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to formulate a response, but before you can answer, you hear the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs. Twirling around, you see...</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure if he was the real owner of this place, but you doubted it; he wasn't any taller than you, and far too small to live comfortably in this house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even acknowledging the two of you, the strange man calmly looked around as if seeing the place for the first time, until his eyes landed on the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is,\" he muttered, glaring up at it like it had personally offended him.  Scowling, he turned toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done with it yet?\"  He demanded crossly.  \"I don't know how you got here, and I don't care; just do whatever it is you have to do and get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"  You sputtered.  Alex looked equally stunned.  \"Who the heck are you, and what do you mean 'are we done yet?'  Where <i>are</i> we, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent, the stranger turned and looked you and your brother up and down, shooting the occasional glance at the key.  Finally, after a glance at the fridge of all places he turned and lifted his hand imperiously toward Alex and snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex promptly dropped like a sack of potatoes.  You promptly slammed the man into the wall by his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Did. You. <b>DO</b>?\"  You growled threateningly.  Even if Alex was a major pain most of the time, and REALLY weird stuff was happening, he was still your brother, and this guy DID something to him and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's asleep.\"  The man said simply, not even looking like he was hurting or choking at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asleep.\"  The man answered in a calm, even tone.  \"Actually, he's REALLY asleep.  This is a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a punch in the gut.  Staggering back from the wall, you looked at the pinstripe man with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dreaming?\"  You asked, your voice shaking.  Quick as nothing, you gave stamped hard on your own foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>you</i>,\" Pinstripe rolled his eyes and gestured grandly toward Alex.  \"Him.  This is <i>his</i> dream.  I'll admit, I had to guess, but given how odd he looks right now, and how little it seemed to bother him, I figured he was the one dreaming.  I was right, too.  I can't tell the dreamer he's dreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, wait, time out.\"  You sat down on the floor.  Hard.  \"This can't be his dream.  I mean, I'm <i>me</i>.  I'm real.  Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do philosophical arguments.\"  Pinstripe muttered, dusting himself off and walking toward the fridge.  \"But sure, you're real.  So am I.  So's that.\"  He jerked his head toward the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key?\"  You asked, glancing up.  It seemed to shine oddly in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>my</i> key.\"  Pinstripe glared at your brother as he ambled back over and sat down beside you.  \"I spent most of my life trying to get it; it's what brought me here, it lets me have complete control of this place.  At least until <i>you two</i> showed up.  Up until an hour ago, I was <i>god</i> here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinstripe passed you the photo from the fridge.  On it, you could now clearly see you and Alex, but he was <i>way</i> closer to your height than he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's really dreaming.\"  You breathed, staring down.  \"Is that real too?  I mean, is he that big now, for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know?\"  Pinstripe grumbled.  \"I don't even know how you got here!  Maybe the key got bored belonging to me for too long, maybe your brother is some kind of dream invading psychic mutant, who cares!  I just want you to leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your brother dragged you in here by accident, it has to be him that gets you out.\"  The man huffed.  \"He can do it with the key.  Of course, he can do anything else he wants, consciously or subconsciously while he's holding it, as well.\"  He grinned at you.  \"Looks like he wanted to be the big man at home, huh?  Lucky you didn't shrink or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think we did!\"  You insisted, looking around.  \"Before, Alex was barely tall enough to touch the key from my shoulders, I bet that's still true now, even with the grabbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell.\"  Pinstripe groaned.  \"Part of him knows what's really happening, and doesn't want it to stop yet.  Just...humor him, I guess.  When he's satisfied, he'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the odd man hopped up and started back the way he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"  You cried.  \"You're just going to leave me here alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"  He nodded.  \"I want no part in this.  Stuck in a highly mutable dream-scape controlled by a prepubescent punk with height issues?  Literally sounds like a hellish nightmare world from which there is no waking.  I'm out of here.  Just don't tell him it's a dream.  It might cause...problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind?\"  You called out desperately.  No use.  The man was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justin?\"  Alex muttered groggily from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\"  You asked, still a little freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Your brother chirped happily from the floor, slowly rising to his new height.

I'd cause your spine to collapse or something! Don't worry, I'll keep still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you realized that he was right. Not only was he now several inches taller than you, but since he still had the proportions of a twelve-year-old who hadn't hit his growth spurt yet, he had rather wide shoulders and probably outweighed you by a good twenty or thirty pounds. It wasn't something you necessarily wanted to do, but if you two were going to get that key, then he was going to have to be the one to lift you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said reluctantly, \"let me get on.\" Alex bended down, letting you climb on his back and work your way up until you had a perch on his shoulders. Slowly and steadily, he stood up to his full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now reach for it!\" he called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up as high as you could go, as Alex grabbed your ankles with his hands, steadying your legs. He then handed you the grabber tool, which you reached up as high as it could go. Even on your tiptoes, the clasp of the tool was still a good ten or eleven inches from the bottom of the key. You strained your arm, hoping to be able to grab it, but there wasn't going to be any way possible. Finally, you lost your balance, and fell off of Alex's shoulders, hitting your head on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWWW! DAMMIT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and rubbed your head, where a lump felt like it was starting to form. Alex placed his hand on your shoulder. \"I'm sorry, bro,\" he said, his face sincere. \"Here, lemmie try one thing.\" He backed away a dozen or so steps, then got in a stance. You watched in amazement as Alex took a running start, leaping at just the right spot in the floor, and soared through the air. His vertical jump looked more impressive than an NBA star's, something you knew your brother had no earthly business of doing. Was this something that was part of his dream, you thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOT IT!\" Alex exclaimed as his hands grasped the key and pulled it off the hook. You could hear the sound of a shock again and a hissing noise as he fell back down to the ground with it. \"Owww!\" he said, but didn't drop the key, instead throwing it from hand to hand until he apparently could tolerate it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the\u2026\" you muttered, then said louder, \"since when can you jump like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grinned at you and chuckled. \"What, are you jealous? I blast my glutes and quads every day! \" He quickly turned his attention to the key, which had evidentially stopped shocking him, and he turned it over in his hands. \"I don't think this is the key for the door, Justin,\" he said. \"It's way too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, unfortunately. Trying to jam the key into the door, it didn't even come close to fitting. What the hell was this place? you thought to yourself. Am I really in his dream? You look back up the stairs, hoping to see the man in the pinstripe suit come back down, but no one was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, bro!\" Alex shouted. \"Watch this!\"</span></div></div>",

As Alex held out his other hand, a can of soda shot out from the bottom shelf and zipped over to his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell?\" you asked. \"How'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alex just grinned even wider as he popped open the soda. \"I have THE KEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled Pinstripe's words: \"He can do anything else he wants, consciously or subconsciously while he's holding it, as well.\" Had Alex already figured this out on his own, just in the past few seconds of holding the key?

Turning around, you saw that the can had embedded itself into the drywall, the bottom sticking out by a couple of inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Alex said, shaking his head, \"you've gotta be more prepared, Justin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I just--\" You swallowed hard, unsure of exactly what to say. \"I guess I just wasn't expecting to have a soda can shoot at me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eyes lit up with a mischievous glimmer. \"Well, maybe you should learn to expect the unexpected from now on.\" That statement scared you immensely, and you hoped Alex wasn't being serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the living room, looking over at the entertainment center. \"Hey, Justin,\" he called as you followed him in there. \"You know how we both wanted to get a Playstation 3 for Christmas?\" Whipping the key out again, the pink light flew out of its tip and hit the entertainment center. Right before your eyes, you saw the entertainment center morph and change, the television stretching out, becoming much larger, eventually taking up the entire wall from the floor to the ceiling. In front of the screen, various game consoles began to appear from all different companies and eras, over two dozen different ones in all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Alex crossed his arms, a grin appearing on his face. \"Still... there's something missing... Oh yeah!\" Flicking the key again towards the side wall, large stacks of video game boxes started sprouting out of the ground. Row after row, stack after stack appeared, tens of thousands of games in all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" your brother now appeared satisfied. \"Wanna play, Justin? We have every game ever made now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, no...\" Playing a video game was the last thing on your mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shrugged. \"Suit yourself.\" He walked over to the stacks of games and picked one, seemingly at random, walking over to one of the consoles and sticking in the disk. He grabbed a controller and plopped down on the couch, which was still oversized despite his bigger body. He hit a button on the TV remote, causing the huge screen to light up to a bright, flashy intro screen. His feet dangled off the edge of the couch as he started playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head in amazement as you tried to make sense of it all. Telekinesis, being able to transform things like he did... it wasn't right. Pinstripe's explanation was crazy, but it was the only thing that came anywhere close to making sense. If you truly were stuck in one of Alex's dreams, you just hoped that it stayed as relatively safe and straight-forward as it had so far; you remembered having some really crazy, kinky dreams when you were his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at Alex, though, brought back another worry from earlier. Right before your eyes, Alex was getting bigger, his skinny legs lengthening and his head inching upwards. You noticed he had set the key in his lap, and while there wasn't the purple lightning coming from it like before, it did appear to be glowing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex...\" you walked in front of the couch, trying to catch his eyes, which were glued on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" he asked, still focused on the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure of how to exactly ask him about what you were seeing, so you just decided to be blunt. \"Why are you making yourself bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother paused the game, turning his head towards you with a slight sense of puzzlement in his eye. \"What are you talking about, bro? I'm not making any changes to myself! I don't even think I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-- you're certainly bigger than before!\" As Alex neared seven feet tall, his shirt ripped down the sides, leaving him bare-chested, his lean but bulging torso too much for it to contain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, crap!\" he cried out. \"So much for my lucky shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" you pointed at the remains of the shirt, now in tatters on either side of your brother. \"You see! Your shirt fit a few minutes ago, and now it's in tatters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex chuckled. \"I'd hardly say it fit, Justin. You know as well as I do that it's been extremely tight for several years now. I guess its time finally came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth, starting to speak, but the look on Alex's face appeared genuine; he didn't seem to have any clue that he had been the size of a normal twelve year old just an hour or so before. What's more, the top of your head now only came up to the edge of the couch cushions; the house and everything in it seemed to have grown with him, adapting to his new size. Could this be the 'subconscious' changes Pinstripe was referring to? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, you just were glad that Alex didn't seem to be harboring any malice towards you... at least, not yet. Of course, as he got bigger and started reveling in the power of the key, who knew how that could change? As your heart started to beat slightly faster, you realized one thing: somehow, you had to get the kitchen door open and get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you shouted, your eyes lighting up. \"Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Your brother stood back up, stretching a bit, the key back in hand. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea, a solution, was formulating in your mind. \"So you can do most anything with the key, right? Besides change yourself, I guess?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded. \"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then,\" you continued, \"why don't you point the key at the door and open it? I know you said it doesn't fit the keyhole, but with that... whatever power it is, the purple zap stuff, you should be able to force it open. Right?\" A relieved smile started to form across your face, hopeful that you finally figured out how to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirthful look in Alex's eyes, though, caused you to second-guess yourself. He thought for a second, before finally saying:</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Startled out of your thoughts, you wonder what Alex wants you to see.  Turning around, you notice he's sitting on the floor near the doorway; the key seems to have vanished.  To the side of the door, right next to your brother, is the floor mat where everyone drops off their shoes when they come home. Taking up half the space are your dad's work shoes, blown up to the same huge scale as the rest of the house. Closer are your shoes, and your brother's, both tiny in comparison just like the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well</i>, you thought, <i>Pinstripe said he had height issues. I guess dad still makes me feel a bit small sometimes, too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother's focus wasn't on your dad's giant shoes, though. They were on your shoes, which looked slightly bigger than his own in spite of him dream-growing himself so much already. Not as much bigger as they <i>should</i> have been, but enough that subconsciously he must have thought they were supposed to be bigger than his. Alex grabbed one of your shoes and held it up, looking at you with an excited grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro,\" he whispered excitedly. \"You'll never guess! My <i>feet</i> are too big for my <i>shoes</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" You reply, deadpan. Alex had made himself almost a full head taller than you, and made it so that had always been the case, and he was surprised that his shoes, like all of his other clothes at the moment, didn't fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly he missed the sarcasm, because he just nodded so fast his head looked like it might come off, grinning hugely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahuh! I just tried them, 'cause I thought it'd be safer to have my shoes on, but my feet wouldn't go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the shoe (your shoe) in his hands, and then back up at you, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to see, when I tried yours.\" He said quietly. Then, poking his tongue out, he started to do just as he said, and slipped the shoe onto his foot. Or at least, he <i>tried</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.\" He grunted softly, as the toe of your shoe bulged out with pressure. The heel of his foot was still hanging over the back! Slowly, he peeled it off and set it down, and looked at you grinning wider than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just like dad said!\" He almost yelled, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked, looking at your brother in confusion. This was his dream; so clearly this was something he wanted to be happening, but you could admit at least to yourself when you were completely lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talk with dad sometimes,\" Alex said, standing up to pace. He paused briefly to beam down at the top of your head, because even in his dream, he probably realized on some level that this angle was new, and he loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows I hate...<i>hated</i> being little, and how everyone picks on me,\" his story was a bit confusing with the dream-logic,\" but he said he was little too for his age and one day he woke up and none of his shoes fit anymore, and he started growing <i>real</i> fast! He got to play basketball in school and got picked first a lot, just like you! And I remember kinda a few years ago when we were almost the same size and then your feet got really big and I couldn't walk around in your shoes and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly panted a bit, beaming, as his story wound down.  Suddenly you understood this place a bit better. The giant house, with everything you needed always out of reach. Alex suddenly always being the bigger brother, but the house changing so that he was <i>still</i> too little, and even his sudden basketball jumping skills and now the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Humor him</i>, Pinstripe had said. Well, it was his dream, and you loved your little brother, so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Alex!\" You exclaimed, maybe hamming it up a bit. You plopped down quickly and stuck out your foot, matching it up so that you could both see how your toes stopped where his toes started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex laughed, wiggling his toes and curling them over the tops of your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're right!\" You said. \"And you're already outgrowing <i>my</i> shoes! I'll bet you'll be first pick on your school teams in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Alex cheered, hopping up and racing for the stairs. You see him scowl slightly at their size; the house is still keeping everything out of easy reach. Then he smiles and turns back toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go change into some daytime clothes,\" he calls back as he slowly clambers up the steps.  \"Maybe not socks though!\" He giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and nod a bit to yourself as you sit down to wait him out; 'humoring him' might not be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

It was like nothing ever happened. The two of you entered the living room.<br>\r\n\"What's like being so tall?\" You were surprised by his answer as he could easily grow himself as he did earlier, not that he was aware that he did.<br>\r\n\"It feels great, I guess. I'm not the tallest guy but it's still pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Alex asked. \"Your the tallest guy I know!\" As if his words were a trigger, you begin to grow.

And what's your name?\" Justin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sighed and stepped back, running a hand through his blond hair. \"Ok...I know you were asleep, but I didn't think you'd forget that fast. I'll start with my name...it's Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, the 10-year old Mark proceeded to update Justin on everything now, apparently to Mark, for the 2nd time at that. They were both to shortly be on a game show known as the \"Big Bad Sibling Show\" where an older teen would play against a kid for various prizes. However, the show had decided to hire a permanent 'big bad brother' for the show. Justin was supposed to just play his part and give a show, but actually allow the boys to win, but without letting the audience realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do I get out of it?\"<br>\r\n\"Duh! If you let me, and any other boy win, more money! If I or someone else loses, less money. Just that simple.\" Mark replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finished talking, a stage hand entered the room they were in, and hurried them towards the stage where they were announced from seperate areas by a man in a gaudy suit, and carrying a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages! Welcome to the Big Bad Sibling Show! I'm your host, Pat O'Malley! Let's meet our two 'siblings' for our show today! Over here we have Justin! The big, bad, older brother!

As the stage hand guided him to his spot, checked him over from head to toe one last time, and then ran off the set, Justin realized that he might have a hard time ahead of him, as he looked up to something that looked like a man-made cliffside that stretched at least forty feet above his head. He started to ask what the hell was going on when a spotlight flicked on overhead, startling him, and the audience started to cheer wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooouuur first event,\" the host said, dragging out the words in a way that Justin found particularly annoying, \"will be the Race to the Top! Justin and Mark, you both find yourselves at the bottom of identically-designed rock walls.\" Justin glanced to his left to see that Mark was, indeed, also standing beneath a forty-foot high cliffside. \"Your goal is to climb up the wall and grab the flag sticking out of the top. But bewaaare! As each of you ascend the wall, there will be certain... obstructions... that come your way, some of which may knock you down, perhaps even all the way to the bottom! Are you rrrrready??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh,\" Justin stuttered, \"not really. Shouldn't we have some sort of safety harness or someth--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Set! And GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Justin nevertheless whirled around and started climbing up the wall. \"This should be a piece of cake,\" he thought to himself. \"After all, how good a climber can that scrawny little--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped himself as, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Mark zipping up his side of the wall, as natural and as nimble as a monkey climbing a tree. He already had shot out ahead of Justin, and the audience was cheering him on. \"Maa-aark! Maa-aark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid kid,\" Justin muttered, as he kicked it into high gear. He started pulling himself up higher, putting in an extra effort, and within thirty seconds, the two were dead even at the halfway point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ittt's anybody's race at this point, folks,\" O'Malley called out. \"But let's see if the boys can handle what they're about to encounter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Justin looked down to make sure he had the proper footing, he heard a loud rumbling coming from up above. He looked up and his eyes widened as he saw several large, heavy-looking boulders tumbling down the side of the wall at him. Panicking, he covered his head with one arm while clutching on with his other to the handhold. One of the boulder's hit right where his hand was gripping, the shock knocking him loose, causing the crowd to let out a collective gasp. Justin started falling, but instinctively reached out with one hand to grab something, anything, and stopped his fall, only having lost a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, that was a close one for Justin,\" O' Malley egged him on. \"Will he be able to catch up to Mark now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin glanced over and saw that Mark was now three-quarters of the way up the wall. \"How the hell did he survive that?\" he asked. Shaking off the pain still in his fingers, he tried in vain to catch up, but by the time he was back to where he was before he fell, Mark had already gotten to the top and grabbed the flag. Bells started ringing and lights started to flash, and Mark let out a cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we have a winner!\" O'Malley yelled out. Dejected, Justin carefully made his way down the wall again, while Mark walked down the stairs that apparently were built into the backside of the wall. When Justin got to the bottom, a stage hand shoved him towards the right, where the host was standing with a beaming Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other assistants started moving the rock wall sets away, Justin noticed that, while the boulders on his side had to be pushed away one at a time by several stage hands at once, the assistants clearing Mark's side were lifting them up with practically no effort at all. \"Son of a bitch.\" He muttered. \"His must've been made of styrofoam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mark,\" O'Malley said, \"since you won Round 1, you've won\u2026\" He paused for dramatic effect. \"Eighteen inches added to your height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Mark pumped his fists in the air, celebrating, while the crowd's cheers grew even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, meanwhile, wrinkled his nose in confusion. \"Eighteen inches? What the--\" He stopped as he saw Mark starting to inch higher and higher. At first, Justin thought it was just an optical illusion, but after a few seconds, he saw that the boy's clothes were growing tighter and tighter, revealing more skin than they ought to. For his part, Mark looked like he was immensely enjoying the growth, maybe even a little too much, Justin thought. By the time it was over, the ten-year-old was now the same height as Justin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Mark, we'll have to get you some new clothes before the next round starts!\" The audience laughed in unison as O'Malley grinned, and Justin shook his head in disgust. Whatever was happening around him needed to stop, and now before it got even crazier. He just had no idea what was going to happen next.</span></div></div>",

He was too busy gawking at Mark to realize they were fixing to start the obstacle course. He turned around and saw Mark halfway across the first challenge. He looked like he was having trouble adjusting to his new-found height... \"This will be easy..\" thought Justin. He took off toward the first obstacle- a 25 foot wall. He was supposed to climb over with a rope but the rope was greased up! He looked over at Mark who was almost halfway to the finish! Justin tried as hard as he could and eventually made it over. Apparently Mark was having trouble with the second obstacle because he was just starting the third leg of the race- a swinging rope over a small pool of water. That's it?! Justin was crawling under 30 feet of barbed wire when he saw Mark clear the three foot jump and started on his last event. Justin hurried to catch up but saw he had to clear a 20 foot pool of water! As he leaped for the rope the buzzer went off. \"Mark wins again!\" Justin fell into the water and was helped to the finish line where O'Malley announced his next prize.. \"OK Mark.

But as he watched, Mark grew bigger and bigger and bigger! All at once muscles layered onto his once skinny frame. His shoulders broadened and were like coconuts. His back grew almost twice as wide. His neck thickened. His biceps turned into bowling balls and his triceps and forearms grew just as much. His meaty pecs pushed a foot off his body and castes a shadow over a deep 8 pack where each ab looked like a brick. Mark's shirt couldn't take it. It burst off of his massive body and fell to the floor around his size 13 feet. He got a nice sporty butt and a thighs bigger than tree trunks. Even his calves ballooned to the size of softballs. When Mark was finished growing, the only way you could tell he wasn't an 18 year old bodybuilder was from his boyish face. Mark checked himself over and felt his new body. He flexed a few times before looking up at you. He walked over and you realized he was not only as tall as you; but he was at least three times bigger than you! He took his huge hands and put one under each of your armpits then proceeded to lift you high over his head several times. He started laughing and all you wanted to do was cry or scream. \"Ok now Mark that's enough fun! You'll have plenty of time to get used to your new strength in the next challenge!\" said O'Malley. </span></div></div>",

His squeaky voice and boyish face were the only signs of his youth. <br>\r\n\"Alright you two we have uniforms for both of you to change into.\" said O'Malley. \"The sooner you get ready the sooner we can get this started!\"<br>\r\nYou quickly put on the singlet and checked yourself over in the mirror. To think, before you got here you would have been impressed with your ripped, athletic body, but since the events of today, you felt emasculated at the idea of the 10 year old you were about to see. A stagehand came to let you know they were ready for you, so you walked out to the ring to face your opponent. <br>\r\n\"Oh this will be fun!\" said Mark with a cruel smile on his huge face. His singlet really showed off his huge frame as it hugged every muscle and outlined every curve. His body looked stuffed in the uniform even though most of it was hanging out of it!<br>\r\n\"Ok the first to pin the other for three seconds wins!\" said O'Malley. \"Reaaadddyyyy? GO!\" <br>\r\nYou figured you'd get this over with so you charged at Mark hoping to catch him off guard and win a challenge for once. You hit him low and bounced back! It felt like hitting a brick wall! And he didn't even budge!! Mark just stood there and laughed. You ran at him again and pushed with all your might at his rock hard muscles. You couldn't even wrap a hand over his arms. You tried to pick him up but your arms couldn't reach all the way around his huge body. He laughed again and picked you up with one hand. He lifted you high over his head and slammed you on the ground! It knocked the breath out of you. Mark put his whole weight on you and pinned you. <br>\r\n\"1! 2! 3! MARK WINS!\"<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as O'Malley announced the results. \"Ok Mark. Your prize is Age! But you can choose...</span></div></div>",

He inched up and out as he got taller and more muscular. His singlet was skin tight and threatening to rip in some places. Hair started to grow on his arms and legs. His face became less round; acne started popping up. You couldn't help notice another part of Mark grow. The bulge in the front of his pants grew more and more! The singlet left nothing to the imagination as his manhood swelled. Justin blushed as he noticed it was even bigger than his! As his growth slowed Mark groaned in a much deeper voice (it wasn't as deep as Justin's yet!) Mark looked around then down past his meaty pecs to see Justin almost a foot shorter! He laughed as he flexed and lifted justin several times into the air. O'Malley- along with the entire audience- roared with laughter!<br>\r\n\"Ok Mark time to put your \"big\" brother down!

Both of you go get dressed while we get everything set up.\"<br>\r\nFor this event they gave you baseball pants and a tank top. You got dressed and went out to see a full size baseball field! Already swinging his bat was Mark, and he looked massive. Standing at seven feet tall, you barely came out to his giant pecs that pushed a foot off his body and stretched the fabric of his shirt. His shoulders looked like cannon balls and his biceps bulged bigger- and harder- than bowling balls with every movement. His forearm was bigger than the barrel of his bat and his hands were bigger than a baseball glove! You. Could clearly see 8 abs, each the size of a cynderblock. His back was so wide, you could hide two people you size behind him an you would not be able to see them! Heck even his thick neck looked bigger than your waist! His baseball pants hugged his lower body. His thighs were literally tree trunks. The bulge in his pants showed balls bigger than tennis balls and an eight inch member. His feet were at least size 15! You stood in awe of his huge body and thought *He's only 15!* <br>\r\n\"Alright Justin you go first!\" said O'Malley. <br>\r\nYou grabbed a bat and stepped up to the plate. You both got 10 pitches- whoever hit more over won. You did pretty well. The pitcher threw you all kinds of junk (curve balls, knuckle balls, sliders, etc.) but you were patient. Then he threw you fastballs. And they were fast! At least 80mph! But you hit eight out. One hit the fence and stayed in. The last one you launched out of the stadium but it went foul. You smirked obviously pleased with your performance. *He doesn't stand a chance* you thought. You were wrong. Mark<br>\r\nLooked stupid his first pitch and missed completely; however, after that, the pitcher tossed the ball up there for Mark to crush it over the bleachers! Nine. He beat you by one. <br>\r\n\"And Mark wins again! Justin just can't handle his \"little\" bro!\" said O'Malley.

He slowly inched taller, and his muscles slowly swelled and became more defined. Hair started to grow all over- including his chest and armpits. His acne cleared up. His face grew into that of an adult model with a full beard. Finally his manhood grew to match the rest of his body. In fact, it was exceptionally big even for someone of his stature. He moaned in pleasure and the sound was not that of a tiny 10 year old. Instead, he sounded like a grown man! He was now 10 feet tall and must have weighed a ton! His shirt didn't stand a chance against his huge body a it was in shreds around his feet (which were as big as your torso!) Mark's pants had ripped around his soccer ball calves and looked like compression shorts on his legs. You probably couldn't wrap your arms around his waist let alone one of his thighs!  You only came up to Mark's abs- all 12 like toasters! His happy trail led to a 2 foot long member and balls bigger than softballs! You looked up and couldn't see his face past his big pecs and broad shoulders but you saw him flexing his massive biceps! He was absolutely huge! He let out a booming laugh that was met with a standing ovation from the audience. You almost cried when O'Malley started talking again...</span></div></div>",

The boyish looks on his face vanished as his new physique. Pimples formed and disappeared throughout his face as Mark's look matured up into a glorified and handsome face. In fact, his face wasn't the only part changing. Mark kept on inching in height slowly as his muscles expanded further. His arms thickened up as Mark's kid-with-muscle look turned into a full-fleshed-atheletic build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarked walked forward to Justin making him step back a little in intimidation. He noticed that Mark was now a full head taller than Justin. \"Looks like I'm the bigger brother now,\" Mark said, his voice noticeably deep and sexy compared to the previous childish sounds. He pushed Justin down in a show of power as Justin couldn't do anything. From his perspective he also noticed that Mark had grown in his lower region as well; his bulge quite noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't stop now, can we?\" O'Malley spoke again, \"We need to move on! Let's bring out the wheel to see what is our next event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not over yet?</i> Justined thought as Mark smirked right down at him. They both turned their attention from each other to watch the wheel as it landed on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight lifting challenge,\" O'Malley shouted enthusiastically as the stage around him transformed. The stagehands brought in different sizes of weights all arranged in order of the.. weight. \"It's simple, y'see? These two siblings, Mark and Justin, will battle out to see who of them can lift the most weights. The first one who is unable to lif that weight will be the first to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No fair!\" Justin remarked only to be muffled by Mark's laugh of amusement. The cameras panned towards the boys as Mark flexed his biceps, only to further boost his ego as the audience cheered for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras returned again as the stage was ready with the different weights. \"Mark, since you're the bigger brother, you should start first,\" O'Malley announced as Mark stepped on the stage. He looked around for a while before heading straight for the heaviest weight. Justin felt a slight hope sprouting, because if Mark fails, Justin automatically wins. Mark readied himself as he brought his hand down to the weight and lifted it up with all his strength. \"YEAHHHH!\" Mark shouted, veins sprouting along his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin had lost the entirety of his hope as he approached the weights himself. He tried with all his might to lift it, but he only got it slightly above the floor before it fell back down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have a winner,\" O'Malley announced as he began spinning the wheel to see Mark's prizes.

At first, you figure it must be yours (after all, who else's bedroom would you fall asleep in?), but when your eyes begin to focus, you see that the walls are painted a dark forest green, and several posters and pictures decorate it - most of the posters featuring shirtless young male movie stars. This is definitely not your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm,\" you hear a voice next to you, and a body shifting in the bed. Startled, you turn and look over in shock, seeing that the person making the noise looks to be a boy a few years younger than you, maybe fourteen or fifteen. You look down his back to where it goes underneath the covers, noticing that he's completely naked -- as are you, you quickly realize. Yikes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, he stretches out, revealing a very light amount of hair underneath his armpits and virtually none on the rest of his tanned torso. He has plenty of thick, dark black hair on the top of his head, though, as it completely covers his ears and hangs down into his eyes. Racking your brain, you can't seem to recall who this person is, though he does look familiar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens his brown eyes and looks up at you, smiling. \"Good morning, hon,\" he says, and starts to lean forward, his eyes closing and lips puckering. Out of surprise more than anything else, you back away, leaving him kissing nothing but air, and causing him to open his eyes again. \"Justin, sweetie, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" you ask, a little stunned that this boy seems to know you, and apparently thinks that you're his boyfriend. \"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiles and shakes his head. \"Oh, I forgot. It's the first of the month, isn't it?\" He looks over at the table next to his bed, confirming the date on the desk calendar there. \"Okay, Justin, don't worry, everything is going to be fine. My name's Sam, and I'm your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend?!\" You jump out of bed, forgetting that you're naked for a moment, then quickly remember and grab the covers off the bed to conceal yourself, though this leaves Sam completely naked as he lies on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't seem to mind, though, as he sits up and leans back against the wall, spreading open his legs and leaving his cock for all (okay, for you) to see. \"Yes, boyfriend. You've known me for a long time, Justin. We're in my house, we spent the night together and slept with each other -- trust me, these are all things we typically do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"I don't remember doing anything close to that! I'm not even gay! In fact, I have a girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bends his legs and leans forward, wrapping his arms around his knees, tilting his head in a way that, even you admit, is rather cute. \"Do you? What's her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is--\" You stop, trying to recall what her name actually is. It's right on the tip of your tongue, you can tell, but for some reason, you can't place it. \"Oh, c'mon, I should know this,\" you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm, that's what I thought,\" Sam nodded. \"Do you even have any idea what she looks like this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time? \"Of course, she's--\" Actually, now that you think about it, you can't bring to mind any image of what she looks like. In fact, you don't really have any memories at all of having a girlfriend, just a general feeling that you should have one -- and that feeling is becoming less and less certain all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Justin, sit down next to me and we'll have a talk.\" He pats the bed and motions you over. Reluctantly, you follow, still wrapping the bedsheets tight around your body. \"Look, I know you're confused right now, and you have every right to be. But, trust me. There's an explanation for all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head towards Sam, a skeptical look on your face. \"Well, what is it? And please, tell me the truth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam beams back before answering,</span></div></div>",

Once every month you forget where and who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part caught you off guard. You still knew your own name, right?

And you definitely still knew certain details about yourself, like your birthday and even your Social Security number. At least, you're pretty sure you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, because you always ask this question next. Yes, you do remember certain details about yourself. Other details get slightly <i>warped</i> shall we say. Like this 'girlfriend' you always think that you have. Your brain is vaguely aware that you have a significant other, but can't access the information to tell you that it's me. So you think you have a girlfriend even though you can't remember anything about her, even her name. Basically, you remember some general details, like your birthday, but lose most of the specifics, like that fact that I'm your boyfriend.\" You can't help but notice that Sam moves a little bit close every time he mentions he's your boyfriend, as if to emphasize that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy,\" you say, your mind reeling from all the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean that you're crazy, hon,\" Sam said, smiling in spite of himself.

But something about this feels good and moreover very...natural. \"Okay. So I have amnesia. And you said it happens every month. Does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You are going to get your memory back. Usually it happens slowly over an hour or two. Once it lasted about a day, but it's never lasted longer than that.\" You look at the ground, uncertain. Sam will have none of that. He grabs your chin and forces you to look him straight in the eyes. \"I know what you're going through right now, and I promise we've been through it several times before. Your memory will come back. It always has before, and it will this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever uncertainty you had before melts in Sam's sincere gaze. You've never felt this way before about anyone. Or, at least, you think you haven't felt this way about anyone before. If what Sam says is the truth, you think that this just might be how you think about him when you remember who he is. Even now, with his face so close to yours...those eyes...and his lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're both surprised by what happens next. You lean forward just a little bit and find your lips pressed against his. Getting over his initial shock, Sam responds enthusiastically  and passionately, closing whatever distance remained between you too and pushing you down onto the bed.

It's warm and lacks even a hint of malice. He puts his hand on yours as he says, \"You don't have to apologize for being a good kisser, you know.\" You realize how ridiculous it must be for him, having to deal with a boyfriend who forgets that who is he once every month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I'm still a bit bashful...it's just, until I get my memory back, the fact that I even...\" you struggle with how to put it politely. \"...swing that way is confusing to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're much better about it than you used to be, trust me,\" Sam replies. \"The first time you woke up with me in your bed you tried to kick me out, claiming that everything I was spouting was nonsense and that there was no way I could be your boyfriend. That was the day it took you almost 24 hours to realize your mistake. Though, to be honest, I always kinda thought you waited so long more from embarrassment than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he talks, you find yourself involuntarily looking him up and down. You blink your eyes a few times, making sure that your brain isn't playing tricks on you. You continue to see your boyfriend's smiling face (you are becoming more and more comfortable with seeing him as <i>your</i> boyfriend, not just some random guy you happened to wake up next to), but can't shake the impression that he looks bigger than he did when you woke up. It wasn't that significant, only a couple of inches or so, but it was definitely noticeable. With a mixture of curiosity and confusion, you ask, \"Sam, how tall are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5'6\". Why do you ask, all of sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\" You decide directly asking him if he's grown probably wouldn't go over well, at least not until you got your memory back, so you try a different tactic. \"I just figured it might help me jog my memory to know some more things about you. I still don't even know how old you are, or how we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. You usually wait until after I mention something about the high school before asking about personal details.\" He sees the look of confusion on your face and chuckles a little. \"Honey, I've been through this many times. You aren't the most spontaneous person out there. Still, I guess you are entitled to know the epic story that kicked off our amazing romance.\" The last line is dripping with theatrics, and he can't help himself from smirking a little once he finishes it. \"In all seriousness, even if it doesn't jog your memory I love telling this story. You see, as you can probably guess, we both go to the same high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Valley Ridge High.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't this unusual! You've never remembered the high school this early. Maybe there's hope for you after all.\" He squeezes your hand a little before he continues. \"Anyway, I'm a couple years younger than you. So when I first saw you, I was just a measly freshman and you were a mighty junior, with loads of friends and, to be honest, a really hot body. So hot, in fact, that I convinced myself to join the swim team just so I could catch more glimpses of you in a speedo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not sure how to react to this, so you just stare at Sam blankly. \"Seriously?\" is all you can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've told you all this stuff before and I don't see the point is glossing over certain facts, as uncomfortable as they might make you now. Besides, you should proud! You're a real catch.\" Sam leans in a little, lips puckered, and for a moment you think he's going to kiss you on the lips again. You're happy when he ends up planting a kiss on your cheek. You find yourself increasingly attracted to Sam, but without your memories there was still some awkwardness between you two. \"I was awful at swimming. I could get the forms down and I came to practice every day, but I just couldn\u2019t swim fast enough to actually swim in meets and everything. You, however, were amazing. You set a bunch of records that year, first for the school, then for the state! I probably should have felt jealous or something, but I knew you worked just as hard, if not harder, than I did. Besides, you were just so cute! And considerate. Which is really where <i>our</i> story begins. See, you noticed that I was trying my hardest and not getting any better. But unlike just about anyone else on the team, who treated me at best like a lost cause, you thought I was coachable. My heart skipped a beat the day you came up and offered me lessons, and I tried my best to remain calm as I spat out \u2018I\u2019d love to.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was awful those first few days. I tested your patience and came really close to just giving up. But you kept me going. And not just because you were incredibly cute! No, there was just something about you that kept me going. You just had this boundless energy about you, and whenever I found myself out of breath or discouraged by the lack of progress, I found myself drawing on that energy. Using you for encouragement. Sure enough, after the first few weeks, there was rapid improvement in my times. Soon, I was not just qualifying for swim meets, I was actually doing really well in them! You were improving your already phenomenal times too. Practicing together was clearly helping both of us somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAround January, we were alone in the locker room after a particularly intense practice. We had become pretty close friends by that point, but I still tried to keep a little distance from you, because of the whole \u2018having a massive crush that I\u2019m sure isn\u2019t mutual\u2019 thing. Which is why what you said that day caught me off guard. You started by saying that you\u2019d noticed me staring at you since the first day of practices, then moved on to admitting that you thought I was pretty cute too, and ended it with a resolute, \u2018so, you wanna go out with me?\u2019 that honestly sounded more like a statement then a question. Like I would say no. We\u2019ve been dating ever since, coming on nine months now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still don\u2019t have your memories back, but Sam\u2019s story does sound very familiar. It feels more like you read it in a book once than it actually happened to you, but you figure small steps were better than nothing. You think for a moment before asking the next question.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam's smile fades, if only slightly, at your question. \"Well, that's the one question I can't really answer. Simply because I don't really know. It happened right after your class's field trip to tour Fort Helios back in April.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fort Helios?\" you interrupt. \"The Army base outside of town?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Sam continues, \"Exactly. It was an all-day trip to see some historic tank or something. I dunno; the trip was Juniors only so, alas, I wasn't there.\" He motions in a rather overdramatic fashion at these words, but then chuckles. \"No one knew of anything unusual happening, to you or anyone else, but the next morning, you woke up like this. Well, much worse than this, but you get the idea. Your parents, worriers that they are, took you to the hospital, and the doctors ran a whole bunch of tests on you, but they didn't find anything that gave them any clue of what was going on. Luckily, you got your memory back fairly quickly, so they sent you home.\" He smiles, leaning his head against your shoulder. \"Lucky for me, your first stop after that was my house to apologize... in a manner of speaking.\" A mischievous grin crosses Sam's face, and you notice that he has become slightly aroused at the story, or the situation, or whatever is going through his head, you're not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you ponder this story for a few moments. \"So my parents know? I can't imagine my mom taking this very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she didn't,\" Sam agrees, shaking his head. \"That's why we decided to not tell her the second time it happened. And the third, and ... well, you get the idea. It's just been our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this strikes you as a little worrisome, but as you think about it more, you realize it's probably for the best. After all, your mom would force you to the doctor for a scraped knee. You can't imagine how much she'd overreact to something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you feel?\" Sam asks, looking up at you from your shoulder. \"Are you still disoriented at all, or is this making sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-- I think I feel okay,\" you reply. Looking into his eyes, your breathing rate begins to quicken as you realize how cute this boy next to you is, and how much you're attracted to him. The awkward feelings have started to subside, but you still feel a rush of excitement and wonder, as if you had just met (since, for all intents and purposes, you sorta had). \"In fact, I'm ... I'm more than okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you lean in again and kiss Sam, this time more passionately and for much longer. You let the bedsheets fall from around your waist, and press your body closer against his. Your cock, which has quickly grown aroused, presses up against his stomach, and you can feel his digging into your skin as well. This all feels so new, so fresh, so exciting -- and so right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well,\" Sam says as he breaks the kiss momentarily. \"I think we've set a new record for your recovery time. Lucky me,\" he adds, lying back on the bed while pulling you down on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you continue to make out, you can't help but notice something peculiar going on, something that had been nagging you before. Sam had definitely continued to grow since you last asked him about his height, and by now he had to be nearly even with you, if not maybe an inch or two taller. Nothing else seemed all that different about him; he still had the same slender build, same shaggy hair, and same adorable face -- but he was definitely bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow would be the worst time in the world to bring it up, you realize. But, hell, he had grown nearly eight inches in a matter of minutes. Was this really something you could just ignore?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your thoughts are interrupted when you feel Sam reach his hand down and wrap it around your cock. Your eyes widen a little in shock and your muscles tense up a little, but as you look back into Sam's eyes, filled with a look that was somehow a perfect mixture mischief and libido, you relax. Even though you don't have a memory of doing anything like this before, you can't deny a sense of deja vu as Sam's hand slides up and down your manhood. Rather than lessening the experience, however, you find that knowing exactly what to do heightens your ecstasy. It certainly helps that Sam is a more than capable partner, sensual and passionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't ignore, however, the fact that Sam is steadily getting bigger and bigger. It's still slow enough that you don't yet see him getting bigger, but every now and then you notice that he seems bigger. Instead of distracting you or concerning you, however, you actually find it, for lack of a better way to put it, really hot. You start to get more and more passionate before you finally motion for Sam to turn around and let you enter him. He complies, and you start to gyrate back and forth into his larger and larger asshole. Before long, you find yourself shooting the largest load you have ever shot, basking in the best orgasm you've ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're reminded that Sam still has his own massive (and growing) erection to deal with as he turns back and around and starts to finish. Without skipping a beat, you wrapped your lips around his engorged member and suck. It doesn't take long for the sensitive organ to burst into your mouth. Sam's seed is salty but satisfying somehow, and you find yourself greedily drinking every last drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you do this, Sam's slow growth kicked into overdrive. He shot up in spurts of several inches at a time, ultimately ending up so tall that his feet hung over the edge of the bed and almost touched the floor. You gaped at how large your boyfriend had become. He had to be close to 8 feet tall. You gaped at his size, looking him up and down several times in shock and awe before you were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what happened to me?\" Sam asked, in shock and disbelief. \"I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me earlier, but I am definitely much taller than I was before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this isn't normal for when we have sex?\" you joke, trying to defuse the situation with a little humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it really isn't,\" Sam responds, sighing a bit. \"I see that you are becoming more and more of yourself, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. Now, you used to be half a foot shorter than me, right? How did you get to be taller than an NBA pointguard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam shrugs. \"Your guess is as good as mine.\" You're both silent for a minute, unsure of what to say or how to deal with the situation. Sam's the first to speak up. \"I can't deny that I kinda like it up here, though...it's nice to look down on you for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debate whether you should be honest about your increased attraction to him like this, but decide against it, figuring that there were more pressing matters to discuss right now. \"And something like this has never happened before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I understand you not remembering anything for the moment, but I think I remember if I randomly shot up to 8 feet tall after a nice fuck.\" You cast him a sideways glare. \"Alright, a great fuck!\" he adds, and you can't help but laugh a little at his misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but focus. Did you do anything different this time than you have previously? Eat anything weird last night? Feel weird in anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head. \"Nothing like that. Although, now that you mention it, I do feel something kinda weird. It's like my whole body is pushing outwards, if that makes any sense. It's really faint, but it's there. Maybe I'm still growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to respond, you notice something weird yourself...</span></div></div>",

It's not quite the way you were describing, the whole 'pushing outward' thing, but something's happening to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand up off the bed, you notice the feeling start to subside once your no longer making any contact with Sam's body. \"Hmmmm,\" you murmur, and slowly bring your hand back to Sam's stomach.

Of course, it could be the other way around, and I'm just feeling an effect of whatever it is that's making you grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is,\" Sam says as a sly grin comes to his face, \"it's making me horny again. Wanna give it another go-round?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't deny that you're growing horny again as well. \"Let's see where this goes,\" you say, smiling, as you climb back on top of Sam.</span></div></div>",

As you start to make out with him, you wrap your legs around his slender stomach, still having to stretch to reach his mouth from that position. You can feel his cock, bigger than ever, begin to press against your thigh, and you realize that, with the size difference between the two of you now, having something like that inside you would come close to tearing you apart. Though it would be one hell of a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more and more into it, you start to move your hands down Sam's neck and chest, stopping at his nipples, which are rock-hard. As you lightly rub your fingertips over them, Sam moans, his voice filling the room, and as you feel his cock rubbing against your backside again, you sense more than a bit of pre beginning to ooze out of the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to pleasure your boyfriend, you begin to think that his growth has leveled off. That is, until you hear the thunk of your head hitting the ceiling. Looking up, then back down, you realize that the two of you had both been growing in unison. Sam's feet now pressed against the opposite wall, and the bed was beginning to groan under the increased weight. You quickly climb off the bed, pulling Sam up along with you, and you're stunned to see that, even sitting down, Sam's head now hits the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" you moan between pants, \"how big do you think I am?

I guess it has something to do with keeping this a happy place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, still not believing what you're being told. Turning around, you begin to walk around the room, trying to clear your head. As you do so, your eyes glance over some of the decorations on the wall. You first notice a poster of a boy who looked to be around your age, maybe a little younger, coming out of what appeared to be a river, water dripping off his body. The poster next to it has a younger boy, closer to Sam's age, posing with his arms crossed across his bare chest, smiling, standing in front of a city skyline that you didn't recognize.

Doesn't that mean I can do whatever I want? Like there's no rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Sam shakes his head. \"Not exactly. Most of the inhabitants of this part of the afterlife are governed by a set of rules. Those rules are set by the Master of the afterlife. That's a position that was set when we all appeared here. Supposedly it was based on things we did in life, good vs. bad deeds and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for all that you learned in Sunday School when you were a kid, you think. \"So, then, who's the Master of this afterlife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's smile grows wide. \"Who do you think, cutie?

How many people live in this afterlife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's exactly a thousand people who live here; apparently that's a hard limit or something.\" Sam shrugs, chuckling slightly. \"All of the inhabitants of my afterlife are males between the age of 12 and 17; you're actually one of the oldest ones here.\" He walks up to you, placing both of his hands on your shoulder, which initially causes you to flinch, but you don't seem as nearly as reluctant as before. \"But you're by far the sexiest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winks at you, then leans in for a kiss, his hard cock pressing against the inside of your thigh and his arms wrapping around your lower back.

Then again, if this is the afterlife\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Sam loosens his grip around you and walks over to the window as he talks. \"Well, there's been a few breaks every now and then. You know, for variety's sake.\" Walking back to you, he places his hand on your chest, covering up your left nipple. \"But, for some reason, I always come back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, you think.

One time, all at once!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really sure how that would work, but so far, it makes about as much sense as anything else, you suppose. \"I guess that's one of the perks of being the Master?\" You smile softly, sitting down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" Sam nods, sitting down next to you. \"Want me to show you another one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh\u2026 sure?\" What harm could it bring, you figure? Worst case scenario, you're already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grins, and you can see his hard cock twitch in his lap. \"Okay, stand up and close your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as he tells you, making sure that you can't see anything. After a few seconds of your eyes closed, however, you feel the air begin to change, and a cool breeze begins to blow across your naked body. Faintly, in the distance, you hear horns honking, sirens wailing, and other sounds of a busy city. \"Uhh, Sam\u2026 what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, open your eyes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's voice seems significantly louder and more ominous, and as you open your eyes, you see why. You are standing on top of a skyscraper, one of the tallest skyscrapers you've ever seen, some 1500 feet in the air, near the edge of the roof. Straight in front of you, you see two massive tan towers. Craning your neck upward, you realize those are Sam's legs, as his naked torso stretches high into the sky above you, his massive face smiling down thousands of feet away. Closer to your level, but still significantly higher, is his cock, still every bit as hard as before, but now stretching over you like the neck of a huge crane. Seeing this enormous, and, you must admit, incredibly sexy fourteen year old tower above the city (and you) like this is enough to make your cock spurt a little bit of pre, and you can barely resist from gripping it with your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like this perk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand slack jawed, unable to answer the \u2026 truly \"god\" is the best word to describe Sam. He can do anything he wants, and he's your boyfriend to boot! Things could get really interesting here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Sam\u2026 that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen!!!\" You can't even begin to explain how much you enjoy this, lamely trying to gesture with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Sam nods. \"You always have seemed to like me at this height. Tell you what. I'm gonna do something special for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Your heart pounds, giddy with anticipation, and not knowing how anything could be more special than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam takes a deep breath, then says, \"I'm gonna\u2026\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...grow you to my size so we can have some real fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words boom above you, and it takes you a moment to process just what he's saying. \"You mean...you'll make me your size?\" You say in disbelief, before realizing that he's already started it! You are now easily twice the size of the door on the roof back into the skyscraper, and you are rapidly increasing in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Now, I could just poof you to my size...but what's the fun in that? It's much more fun to have you outgrow that little 'skyscraper' you're standing on.\" Sam emphasized the word skyscraper as if it was a joke, and you couldn't exactly blame him. As you got larger and larger, you weight started to cause the rooftop below you to groan and bend inwards. \"Ooo, looks like little Justin's getting big enough to cause a cave in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are around 50 feet tall (or so you estimate...there's no sure-fire way of knowing) you hear a telltale crack from somewhere behind you and the roof collapses in, taking out two or three floors below it. You brace for any damage from the impact--you know you're a giant, but there's still plenty of glass, steel, and concrete that you're sure could do some damage, even to someone your size--but when you don't feel anything, you open your eyes and realize that you don't have a scratch on you. In the rubble underneath and around your now much larger form you can see printers and desks and papers flying everywhere, as well as the steel beams, concrete, and broken glass you expected to see, but even where those beams came close to stabbing into you, you couldn't see a single mark on your body. Sam, still towering far above you, sees you checking your body for damage, lets out a laugh, and explains, \"You think I'd let my boyfriend suffer any damage? Besides, it's the afterlife, it's not like you can die again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he's done talking, you're surprised to find you've grown another 50 feet, making you an even 100 feet. You're finally pushing triple digits, but at this point, Sam's getting bored. \"Alright, it's fun to see you grow for a little bit, but it'll take FOREVER for you to reach my height if you keep growing at that rate.\" Your expansion kicks into overdrive as you start crashing through more and more floors. Soon, you've worked your way through half the building, both of your feet large enough to cover the whole skyscraper. You start to crouch down, almost as a reflex, in a futile attempt to slow down your growth...instead, it kicks up again, and without much delay you are standing in the ruins of the skyscraper. If you stood to your full height at this point you'd easily top 1500 feet tall, but even in your crouched position you're over 1000 feet tall. Your massive body has knocked over a few of the adjacent buildings...you start to feel guilty for causing all this damage before you realize that none of this is real--at least not in the traditional sense. You look up at Sam's still massive face beaming down at you. \"You're getting close, honey!\" He says encouragingly, and you manage a half-smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand up to your full height, you realize you are now eye level with his crotch. You thought his cock was a magnificent when you were both normal size, lying in his bed...but that was nothing to prepare you for seeing it like this, twice the size it had been then (or, well, appearing to be twice the size it was in his bedroom) and somehow many more than twice times as magnificent. Unable to restrain yourself, you reach out and grab it with your right hand, amazed at how massive and hefty it felt. \"Oooo,\" Sam boomed from above, \"someone likes what they see down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I more than like it,\" you answer as you open your mouth in anticipation. With the ratio of sizes between the two of you the same, you know there was no way that you could force that massive length all the way into your mouth...but you could at least fit the head and some of the shaft. At this moment, there is nothing you want to do more. You open your mouth wide, stick out your tongue, and start to lick the engorged cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--we've--never done something quite like--this before,\" Sam says between moans, clearly very pleased at this unexpected turn of events. It's clear as you start to insert his cockhead into your mouth that he isn't growing you anymore, clearly satisfied to see how this turns out with you only half his size. You don't mind...you've never shrugged off a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fit as much of his length into you mouth as you can, alternatively sucking and licking it with dexterity that can only come with thousands of years of practice. You still don't remember doing it even once, of course, but by now muscle memory has kicked in and you are basically on autopilot. If the loud moans and massive shots of pre-cum spewing out of your boyfriend's mouth and penis are any indication, he doesn't notice or mind. Your right hand starts to massage the part of Sam's cock that you can't fit into your mouth. Much sooner than you expect, you feel him stiffen up, and what must be hundreds of gallons of cum start to pour into your mouth. Your do your best to swallow the delicious liquid as much as you can, but Sam is just too much bigger than you, and inevitably some of it falls onto the ground below, flooding the city streets and demolishing a few cars under the weight of his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, and find yourself eye to eye with Sam once again. \"Even after all these years, you can still pull a surprise like that out? I'm impressed, Justin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's why I'm your boyfriend and not any of your other subjects,\" you say with a wink as you lean in and kiss him. It's sensual and not a little bit sloppy...you've clearly made your \"master\" very happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know it!\" he says with evident glee. \"Now come on, you can't just give me that much fun and expect me to not return it,\" and with that Sam gives you a light shove and you find yourself falling to the ground. You're terror fades quickly, however, once you actually hit the ground and realize that despite the damage your massive body has made in the city, Sam's rigged the ground to bounce a little when you land on it, sort of like a trampoline, so you end up unscathed. He practically pounces on top of you, giving you a light kiss on your mouth before kissing your chin, then your chest, then the top and then the bottom of your abs, before reaching your by now completely erect member. He starts to lick and suck with the same level of skill that you did, though the amount of pleasure he causes is astronomical, enough to make you wonder if he's maybe amplifying it with his powers somehow. You aren't used to this level of stimulation--you orgasm after only half a minute. For a millisecond you are somewhat embarrassed that you can't last any longer, but the waves of pleasure that wash over you wipe away any concerns you have about that. There is no reason to be ashamed of something that feels this good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Sam eagerly lap up as much of your juices as you tried to lap up of his, and after he's finished he crawls back up to where you're sitting. He gives you another peck on the lips before looking into your eyes and saying, \"I don't think I'll ever get sick of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" you say, and you mean it, even though this is the first time you can remember sleeping with Sam. \"What did I do on Earth to deserve someone like you in the afterlife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam starts to blush, \"Stop it!\" he insists, \"It's not like I don't get anything from this relationship...as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around yourself, once again amazed at just how huge you both are. \"Just how often do we do things...like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looks at you with a quizzical expression. \"You mean...give each other blowjobs? Or grow to 4000 feet tall and give each other blowjobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was more referring to the outgrowing a city part,\" you answer. \"Where are we, even?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The afterlife.\" Sam explains, \"This city is mostly a recreation of cities that we both knew back when we were alive. Mostly New York, to be honest. But there isn't any single location I can point to--I can create as much space as I want to. It's just one of the many perks this job affords me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure you completely understand, but you're not sure he could explain it any better, so you just asked another question. \"And where is everyone else? The other 998 boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in the suburb, probably. Spatially, it's over there,\" he points off into the distance. Even squinting your eyes, you can't make anything out but grass, at least not from this size. \"But of course we would never walk there, even at this size! Not when I can just poof us wherever we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...do your powers have any limits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few. I can't kill any of you guys, at least not permanently. I can't make you do something you don't want to do...though there are still ways I can be persuasive, of course,\" he explained with a grin. \"Oh, and I can't leave this space. We're stuck here for eternity, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not entirely sure where exactly \"here\" is, but you don't want to press it. You have too many other questions to ask. You pause for a second to collect your thoughts, deciding what exactly you want to ask your giant boyfriend/master again.</span></div></div>",

You get everything you want and whoever you want. This place is your heaven. Good things come to those who do good.\" \"Then why can't I remember anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam suddenly looked puzzled. \"I'm not sure exactly. I have a theory though. You see, this world and everyone in it are yours. There are others like it, various dimensions. They all float around in the vastness of space, or something llike that. Occasionally, two may collide and have some nasty side effects. Your amnesia may result from a collision of your paradise and another one. Who knows for sure? Im just glad you're not hurt, darling.\" \"Another question,\" you ask, \"Why are you trying to kiss me and why do yoi call me 'darling'?\" \"Duhh!\" Sam said as he slapped your arm, \"I'm your lover. Out of all the hot guys in your paradise too. You decided you wanted a special someone and that was me!\" Sam hugged you and held you tight. You didn't fight, instead you hugged him back. Suddenly you realized just how attractive this boy was and how accepting you were of him being your boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're my boyfriend, I'm the master here, and I can do literally whatever I want?\" \"That's right. Anything at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much thought you quickly decided to see if you could get your memory back. This way you'd have a better understanding of who you were. Suddenly, images flashed into your head. Memories of you and Sam embracing, kissing...doing other things... as well as your fetishes. Height, growth, muscles... as you looked back at Sam you notice how strong and tall he was, explaining why you chose him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not all your memory came back but enough did for you to have some fun. You quickly grow Sam until he is a good ten feet tall and very muscular. You feel you excitement and arousal growing. Sam moaned in pleasure at this growth. \"I love it when we do this!\" he said with a grin. With pleasure you plan what to do next....</span></div></div>",
