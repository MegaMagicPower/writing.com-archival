He has had this attraction or fetish since he was a young lad, having a nanny that constantly sneezed while taking care of him being the event that created this mild fascination that slowly grew into a fetish. Once he was old enough to take care of himself she was let go, with her gone he know longer had anyone to satiate his fixation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother and father were never around much because of work. They sent post cards and letters regularly and only came home on the big holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving. He considered his friends to be his true family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never told any of his friends about his odd attraction to sneezing, instead he kept it to himself and enjoyed it when he could. In truth he had never heard any of his friends sneeze and he really wanted to know. So today he planned to make his friends sneeze as discreetly as possible. But who was he going to make sneeze first?</span></div></div>",

All of her fur was green, of varying darkness, with extra-dark green stripes on her face, ears, arms, legs, and around her sides; the stripes stopped at her light-green belly and around her breasts, but those areas were covered by a light purple halter top and black tube top.
