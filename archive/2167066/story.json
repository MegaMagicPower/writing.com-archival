Laying at the side of the road was a Poke Ball. It wasn't just any old ball, however, oh no no, but a freaking Master Ball. Sure, it looked somewhat ancient, but it couldn't be anything else aside from this famous, one-of-a-kind Poke Ball of legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking you threw yourself at it, possibilities already flowing through your mind as you held it in your hands, when your scouring finger accidentally bumped into its button. The Master Ball opened in a bright flash of light, catching you completely off guard as it released the creature that was held inside of. Once the light subsided, you were able to take a look at the being that you unwittingly set free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt... No. She was something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pokemorph that came out was from...</b></span></div></div>",

Not big surprise, given the creature herself stood well over twice your height. They looked similar to those of a human, each one sporting five long, sharp toes. Although most of her body was cream-colored, her toes instead bore a scarlet hue, as did the webbing in-between her big tootsies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving up from her feet, we have her long, strong-looking legs, as well as her tail. It seemed powerful enough to pick people up with, though for the time being it remained dormant.<br>\r\nMost of her body was reminiscent of a well-endowed female human, with a couple of more feral, beastly details sprinkled here and there, such as the aforementioned claw-like toes and webbing. Similarly, her fingers too ended with sharp, scarlet claws, and had webbing in-between them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough, the creature wasn't 'naked', at least in a traditional sense of the world. Her body was wrapped in what appeared to be some kind of a gown made out of red'n'blue scales. It started at her breasts, and went all the way down to her feet, splitting at the front near her knees, and giving any onlooker a good look at her legs. You wondered if there was some hole at the back of it for her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of that out of the way, we finally move onto the very top of this being, her surprisingly long neck, at the beautiful, unmistakable head of a Milotic that sat atop it. You knew these serpentine Pokemon were regarded as beautiful among both humans and other Pokemon alike, but even that knowledge couldn't prepare for the sheer gorgeousness of the entity that now stood before you. She looked so imposing from your point of view, so powerful, but also graceful, and collected. Truly, an embodiment of the marriage between dignity and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter adoring her looks for what honestly felt like eternity, the Milotic finally looked back at you. She... didn't look too impressed by what she saw, but nonetheless your presence seemed to draw out a small smile on her lips. Slowly, the giant Milotic woman began walking towards you. Her steps were heavy, and fell hard to the ground, yet she still remained as elegant thorough her walk as you expected someone of her majestic visage to be. The earth shook only a little with each of her steps, but it proved enough to easily have you tumble down on your bum. As you looked at her from the ground level, she somehow managed even more powerful than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milotic seemed to know exactly what she wanted from you, as when she finally reached your fallen form, her last step brought her giant foot down to rest right...</span></div></div>",

She was easily twice your size and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">-es of shit!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she just hurled an aura sphere at you, immediately jumping to the side as soon as she fires off the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a panicked shriek, you hurl yourself to the side, narrowly dodging the aura pok\u00e9mon's signature attack. Fearing more attacks, you quickly curl up in a ball, not daring to peek out until you're confident no more attacks are coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you do, you find the blue-furred amazon is as confused as you are. Still clearly on edge, she's currently scanning the forest around with a bewildered expression. Now that you're able to get a good look at her, you conclude your initial estimate about her size was pretty much spot on. Sitting crouched the way she is right now, she still easily has half a head over you. While she unmistakably looks like a Lucario, she also has a couple of features which are clearly more human-like. The first is a pair of luscious breasts, perked on either side of her chest spike. She also has clearly human-like hands, though they are completely covered in black fur, the inside having pads along her palm and on the tips of her fingers. Her feet are also fully plantigrade, each ending in four, equally-sized, plump toes ending with a small, ebony black claw. There are also scuff marks and small injuries all over her body, it's clear she was in a major fight shortly before being trapped in that ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello?\" You try getting her attention, only to immediately curl back into your protective ball when her gaze snaps in your direction, already preparing another sphere to toss at you.You brace yourself for the impact of the attack but again, it doesn't come. Instead, you yell out in surprise when a furry mass suddenly pushes against your shoulder, nudging you on your back before immobilizing you by planting itself on your chest. Opening your eyes, you see the Lucario standing above you, one of her paws resting on top of your prone form. You didn't appreciate it before, but they're absolutely huge!. Her heel seems to rest near your bellybutton, and you can feel the tips of her claws scratching irritatingly against your chin. It's easily wide enough to cover most of your upper body with only a bit of your chest and shoulders sticking out from underneath it. The weight of it is making it difficult to breathe, and you're pretty sure she's not even intentionally pushing down on you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What are you doing here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mea-uuughhhhh\". That was evidently the wrong answer, a sudden increase in pressure crushing the air out of you as she briefly presses the ball of her paw down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What are you doing here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking\" You quickly reply with a wheeze, not wanting to serve as her squeeze toy again. \"Trying to get to the next city, I heard there was a shortcut through this forest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">How did you bring me here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBring her here? Did she not know that someone caught her? You're about to point out the masterball which captured her, but you stop yourself. She hasn't really been the most friendly of encounters, and it's clear you'll be no match for her if things turn violent. Hell you've just been rendered utterly helpless by just one of her feet. That masterball may be your only hope to control over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you're not answering, the Lucario tauntingly slides her foot over your head until the pain pad on her paw is hovering over your face. Then, she presses down, the grimy cushion smothering you as it molds over your head. She holds you like this for a while, enjoying your panicked struggles under her foot as she cuts off your oxygen supply. As you're about to black out, she shifts her foot slightly, freeing your mouth by twisting your head to the side so that the offending pad is resting on your cheek instead. You greedily inhale the much-needed air, doing your best to ignore the heavy aroma of her feet as you feel her body heat radiate through her paw, small drops of her sweat rolling off of it onto your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm not going to ask again</span>\" She calmly tells you, idly rubbing one of her toes against your scalp as she waits for an answer.</span></div></div>",

Just get that thing of my face first, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you agreed to help her, and answer her question, the Lucario 'babe' didn't back off like you asked. In fact, it seemed like your request riled her up, the creature bearing her fangs at you as she growled warily, and, of course, grinding that large pawpad of hers into your cheek, rubbing whatever little dirt and sweat it built up into your soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Who are you to demand anything? Speak, unless you want to end up crushed like all the others that dared challenge my rule.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario pushed her foot hard the second she mentioned crushing, squeezing a couple of pained yelps out of you. Without this 'demonstration', you would've though that it was just a figure of speech, not an actual threat. Now though, you had no doubt that this bitch could easily crush a watermelon with those feet if she wanted to... Or your head, as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching your teeth in pain and fear, you shakily rose one of your arms to point it towards the Master Ball, accepting that your life was now completely at her mercy. It'd be for the best not to agitate her any further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, you weren't quite good at that, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon-esque beauty followed your finger's lead, and quickly spotted a little, shining object that you were pointing it, lying in the grass.She was... less than pleased with her find. Once again you felt the crushing weight of her paw come down on you, threatening to splatter your brains all over the ground, if she as much as tried to squeeze it a little bit harder. The Lucario carefully bent down to speak to you in a more direct manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"><i>Human, are you toying with me right? This dinky little thing is what summoned me here? Impossible.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes. It is impossible.\" You spoke, your words shaking as you knew it was a unstable ground that you were treading right now. \"It... It didn't summon you here, but released you. Well, I released you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven her track record so far, it came off as a big surprise to you when instead of pushing your face into the dirt again, maybe even smearing your whole damn face underfoot, she instead finally backed away, weirded out by what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"><i>R... Released me? What, what is that supposed to mean?</i></span>\" She was clearly shaken by those news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer pinned down by her foot, you carefully sat yourself on the ground, and looked up at the still confused Lucario gal, ready to answer her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that you've been captured.\" You paused to see how she'd react to that bit, but seeing no change in her expression, you continued. \"Those things are used to catch creatures like you, and then store them inside. This one in particular never fails, so it was used on you to guarantee your capture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nudged your head towards the Master Ball, once again drawing her attention back to it. Slowly, the Lucario lady approached the small device, both of her feet landing around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah. You've been sitting in that thing for who knows how long, until I got you out of it. Heh, no need to thank m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>THOOM</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike thunder, the Lucario brought her foot crashing down hard on top of the Master Ball, instantly smashing it into smithereens. She didn't stop there, though, oh no. Her paw would repeatedly come up and down, stomping the broken device over and over and over again, until most of it got buried in the ground. Even when naught but the smallest pieces remained, the Lucario would still not relent, twisting and turning her foot left and right many times over, until finally the very last of that Master Ball's existence has been erased from the face of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the device was gone, the Lucario continued to stand over its 'burial ground', not saying a world. The tensions were high, and in spite of your better judgment, you've decided to give it a go at de-escalating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look miss, I can't begin to imagine how you must feel, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, and the look in her eyes shut you up instantly.

While the enormous canine still looked imposing, she now also appeared... vulnerable, with her ears drooped down behind her, and her gleaming red eyes pleadingly searching yours for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uhm\". You stammer, idly trying to rub out the numbness which has crept into your cheek from having served as her doormat \"Right now we're somewhere in between Mauville to the south and Fortree to the north. The weather institute should also be nearby somewhere around he-... You don't know any of these places, do you?\" The Lucario softly shakes her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could join me to the next city\" You offer \"Someone there must know how to get you back home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I suppose I must</span>\" The massive canine accepts with a dejected sigh. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Come, stand up and get a move on. I don't want to spend a day longer in this forest than required</span>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, there was her assertiveness again. With a groan, you pull yourself to your feet, setting off for Fortree,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              ----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour leisurely stroll has turned into a brisk walk as you're forced to keep up with the pok\u00e9mon's much larger strides. Still, the increase in speed doesn't mean you can't enjoy your romp through nature. You try and spot some wild pok\u00e9mon to break up the monotony of your journey, but are unable to find any. Odd, the forest was teaming with them earlier. You then turn to your companion. She's clearly moving with a purpose, her eyes firmly locked on where she imagines your destination to be, somewhere far over the horizon. Even still, she's on constant guard, her ears flicking periodically towards different spots hidden in the surrounding trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you have a name?\" You attempt to break up the silence with some small talk. \"Hmm?\" One of her ears flicks in your direction. \"Do you have a name?\" You repeat. \"I could keep calling you 'Miss', or 'Lucario', but it'd be handy if -\" \"<span class=\"clblue\">It's Lucy</span>\" She interrupts you.\"Well then, nice to meet you Lucy, I'm Marcus.\" You offer your hand. She looks at it uncertainly for a while before grabbing it with a soft grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice broken, the two of you start chatting more freely. Mostly, it's her asking you questions about the world, which you happily try to answer. Judging by the surprise, bafflement and laughter your responses invoke, she must've been trapped in that ball for a very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You must have me meet your mistress, Marcus</span>\", she offers with a giggle after you've answered her latest question about pok\u00e9mon centers, \"<span class=\"clblue\">She's done very well to train you with a sense of humor</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to be confused. \"Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mistress, master, owner, goddess, queen,... Whatever they want you to refer to them as</span>\", she hand waves your question away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't think I have any of those?\" Did she think you were someone's butler or something? You were about to ask what exactly she means when you find her seemingly rooted in place, her mouth slightly gaping in astonishment, eyes wide open as she quickly looks you up and down. \"What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You're not pulling my leg here, right? You're really a free human?</span>\" She demands, still looking at you as if you'd suddenly sprouted a second head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so? What is thi-Lucy!?\" You see the Lucario quickly dash towards you, picking you up to hold you face-level with her. Any further protest is quickly cut off when she drags her tongue over your face in a long, slobbery lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Mine</span>\" Is all you get for explanation, the amazon regarding you with a big smile, seeming very pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUCY WHAT THE HELL!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm?</span>\" The furry amazon asks, only now realizing that you seem a whole lot less pleased than she is with this recent turn of events, \"<span class=\"clblue\">I just claimed you, I'm your owner now.</span>\" She... couldn't be serious, right. Before you can even protest, you feel yourself falling down, landing right on your butt between the massive pok\u00e9mon's paws. Looking up, you see she's crossed her arms over her chest, a stern expression on her face as she watches you beneath her. \"<span class=\"clblue\">And I won't have you shouting at me like that</span>\" She warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" You quickly raise your hands \"No more shouting. Just uhm... Imagine I was an alien visiting this world, how would you explain what you just did and why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy cocks an eyebrow at your question but still seems willing to answer, if only to figure out what kind of trick you were trying to pull. <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Well, I'm a pok\u00e9mon, and you're a human. You humans were made by Arceus to serve us pok\u00e9mon however we see fit. In return, we take care of you as our pets and playthings. To avoid any misconceptions, pok\u00e9mon mark their humans with their scent, so that other pok\u00e9mon know not to claim them for themselves</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heavily swallowed the lump which had formed in your throat. Did she really think you were now her obedient pet? Or some plaything, to do with as she pleased? But if that's all humans were to her, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who trapped you in that ball back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy frowns at being reminded of her imprisonment. \"<span class=\"clblue\">A human rebellion, some of them weren't happy with their place in Arceus' plan. One of them probably hit me with it from my blind spot. They must've smuggled me away before their rebellion got crushed.</span>\" She suddenly flashes you a dangerous grin. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I just wish I could've been able to see the punishment they had to endure for their foolishness</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if...\" You hesitate, unsure how to break the news to her \"It.... didn't?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">What if what didn't?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That rebellion... What if it succeeded?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scoffs at the thought. \"<span class=\"clblue\">That's impossible there's no way you...</span>\" But then you see her slowly connect the dots in her head. \"<span class=\"clblue\">But then... Where is...</span>\" She's starting to look worried again, looking around the forest for any familiarity of the world she had left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why did you release me, then?</span>\" She suddenly demands of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were inside!\" You quickly explain \"I just stumbled across it during my travels, saw it looked ancient and thought it was wrong for any pok\u00e9mon to be left abandoned like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario slowly sits down, hugging her knees tight to her chest, trying to process what you just told her. \"<span class=\"clblue\">So it's all gone?</span>\" She quietly asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">But then... Why help me at all?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm just that nice of a guy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Even after I nearly squashed you like a bug?</span>\" She asks incredulously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A really nice guy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">You didn't even protest knowing I kept people as pets...</span>\" She continues, more to herself then you, a sly smirk starting to grow on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was meaning to talk to you about tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Rub my feet</span>\" She suddenly interrupts, revealing the bottoms of her large paws as she extends her legs towards you. Looks like they'd already started collecting little souvenirs from your walk through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-What? No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why not?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't want to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I thought you said you were a nice guy, not wanting to see pok\u00e9mon suffer?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not suffering Lucy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh but I am</span>\" It would be easier to believe if she wasn't currently giving you a grin that would make the Cheshire cat jealous. \"<span class=\"clblue\">My poor little pawsies ache from all the walking they had to do</span>\" She gives you an adorable little pout before throwing her head back in a melodramatic whine, putting the back of her hand to her forehead as if she was about to faint. \"<span class=\"clblue\">If only some kind soul would free my tormented paws from their suffering with his delicate little hands...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Why not? Do they intimidate you? I guess they are rather big for you...</span>\" She's raised one of her legs a bit, not even hiding that she's comparing your size to that of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your feet don't scare me Lucy, it's th-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Then what? Do you think you're above giving someone a footrub?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous, I just don-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Of course it's ridiculous, so just do it!</span>\" She exhales deeply, looking back at you with a comforting smile. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I know it's scary, but trust me. You'll feel better</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is <i>me</i> rubbing <i>your</i> feet going to make <i>me</i> feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Isn't it obvious? Like I said, you were put here by Arceus to serve us. That rebellion threw some sand in the gears, but deep down you know that's how things should be. That's why you stuck around even after I manhandled you like I did, you knew it felt right. That's also why you have those silly pok\u00e9mon battles, even after gaining your freedom you were still desperate to admire our superiority.</span>\" Your mouth was starting to hang open as you heard her explain her delirious theories, but she kept pressing on unabated. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I'll probably need to train you again from scratch, but we can take it a bit slow in the beginning to ease you into your proper role again. Believe me, you'll be much happier once you're back in your rightful place beneath our tootsies</span>\" She gives her toes a small wiggle, clearly excited at the thought of having you underneath them. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I bet you won't even want to leave them once you've gotten to know them. They can be pretty demanding, but they're <i>very</i> friendly to humans who treat them right</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy lifts one her legs again, softly nibbling on her lip in anticipation as she tauntingly wags her 'tootsie\" at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now, about my footrub...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>D... Damn it! What is wrong with me?</i> You thought worryingly, as the gentle swaying of her paw somehow managed to catch, and keep your attention. Lucy giggled at the sight of your eyes helplessly following her paw around, until she suddenly lowered it back down. Now the two of you were staring at one another, with the Lucario smirking smugly at your apparent embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Ohoho~, you are <i>sooo</i> mine, human.</span>\" she uttered in sadistic delight \"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm certain that by the end of this day, I'll have you happily lapping at my feet. For now though, a footrub will do just fine~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe just how confident she sounded. She seriously thought that you could be turned into some mindless thrall of hers simply by having you rub those <i>admittedly nice-looking</i> paws. Hah, as if! Time to show her that you're made of tougher stuff that them <i>beauties</i>. Bring them o-Wait, what was that again?... Ah, no matter! Bring them <i>cuties</i> on!<br>\r\nFirst things first, though, you just had to give her a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll do it.\" You spoke loudly and proudly, amusing the Pokemon 'goddess' a little \"Not because I want, or because it's 'muh destiny' or some crap like that, but because I'm a good trainer, that takes care of his Pokemon.\" You finished with a smug smile of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstoundingly, Lucy kept her cool, throwing you off a bit. You really thought that this would at least somewhat offend her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"><i>Aww~</i></span>\" she cooed, much to your chagrin \"<span class=\"clblue\"><i>The little boy thinks he owns me. How cute.</i></span>\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, she took a more serious, wary tone.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\"><i>Your claim holds no merit, human. I am superior to you in every conceivable way. Personal power, wits, looks, you name it. It is by my whim that you are even given a choice in this matter. I could easily subjugate you by force, and you know it, but it simply wouldn't be a fun thing to do. Try my patience a few more times though, and I will be much more interested in stomping that face of yours into dirt, rather than letting it lick my paws.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech almost made your heart stop. You wanted to respond in some fashion, but what could you say? She was right. She was stronger, smarter, and <i>definitely</i> prettier than you, and could easily force you to do whatever she wanted to. The only way to 'win' against her would be to prove her wrong. To massage her <i>gorgeous</i>... paws, and retain you free will. Heheh, how hard could that possibly be~? Heh, heh... Ehhhh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no point in trying to argue with her any further, you reluctantly approached the Lucario's sitting form, and sat yourself down by her giant paws. With a smile, this time a genuinely happy one, Lucy carefully placed her feet in your lap. It's as if she was saying that it's gonna be fine. You retorted with a disgruntled groan, letting her know that you were not happy with any of them. She merely snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you raised one of her feet to your face (with the necessary help of the Lucario herself), you couldn't help but be impressed by their size. As demonstrated before when she so rudely put you under one of those babies, one foot was more than enough to cover all of you face. Though you hated to admit it, those things were clearly made for domination of lesser species, which apparently included humans. A bitter pill to swallow, but what can you do when faced with a pretty paw?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the pink pawpad that took the main portion of her sole seemed unnaturally well cared for. It was soft, and squishy, and not at all damaged. Since she walks everywhere everywhere barefoot, and was apparently in the middle of a fight when her capture took place, it would only follow logic that they would be cracked, or damaged in some way, but nope. Maybe it had something to do with her apparently 'divine' status? Instant healing, impervious to harm, something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, whatever thing-a-magook it was, it sure didn't prevent those things from sweating, smelling, or getting all dirty. Even though your walk was rather short, Lucy somehow managed to break a ton of sweat, and collect a lot of grime on her soles. This then led to her feet reeking of wet fur and the natural musk of feet, a rather powerful, unpleasant combination to get a whiff of.<br>\r\nMaybe the reason why those goddesses needed all those foot slaves was because their feet required a lot of attention, and constant care. Man, that must've sucked both for humans, and their Pokemon mistresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weird it felt finding her feet somewhat attractive, you certainly didn't appreciate that dirty, sweaty part of the ordeal. In fact, you'd rather take care of that first, before moving onto the foot rub proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, Lucy?\" You asked the giant Pokemorph \"Mind if I clean your feet first before rubbing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment the Lucario simply stared at you, carefully processing the question. Once she got it, her response was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pok\u00e9mon shoots you a wolfish grin. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Of course Marcus! As long as they get their rubdown, you can do aaanything you want with 'em~</span>\" You feel her foot grind into your chest as she taunts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and stand up, to get some piece of cloth from your bags, but find the foot in your lap is forcefully pushing you down every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy? You mind shifting your foot so I can get something from my bags to clean em with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmmm..-Nope!</span>\" the amazon exclaims with a giggle, scrunching her toes in delight as she continues teasing you. \"<span class=\"clblue\">You're not leaving until you've finished. Though if you want something to clean 'em with... You've got a perfect little washcloth hidden right in your mouth, see?</span>\" She stick out her tongue at you with a grin, pointing to it for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not... I'm not going to...\" you stammer, your head having turned beet red at the shameless suggestion,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Now don't try and go blaming this on me, Marcus!</span>.\", she laughingly scolds, \"<span class=\"clblue\">I just wanted a footrub. You're the one who wanted to go above and beyond what I asked for.</span>\" She pushes her foot into your chest again, a bit firmer this time, threatening to knock you over. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Now quit stalling and start rubbing, I don't want any more excuses out of you</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her <i>beautiful</i> paw. You see small streams of sweat emerge from between her toes every time she clenches them, slowly running through the fur, over her main pawpad all the way to her heel where they are quickly absorbed by your shirt, a dark circle of moist cloth slowly spreading out from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull off your shirt, invoking another giggle from Lucy. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Oooh. A footrub <i>and</i> a show. You know how to spoil a girl, Marcus!</span>\" Ignoring her taunts, you quickly wrap your shirt around your hand and start using the improvised towel to wipe the dirt off her foot, confident that you've beaten at least part of the Lucario's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the dirt manages to simply fall off the pok\u00e9mon's paw. Her velvet fur having stopped the filth from being able to adhere itself to the vast expanse of Lucy's plush sole. The most effort had to be put in to cleaning her pads, where the grime had combined with her sweat to start coating them with thin, disgusting splotches of foot-sludge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cleaning done, and your shirt forever tainted with the canine's foot-grime, you start the pawrub in earnest. You decide to begin at her toes and work your way down. Taking hold of the first of her piggies, you find you're just unable to fully wrap your hand around it. It radiates with an unusual warmth, making the fuzzy toe feel pleasantly toasty in your grasp. You gently push your fingers into the smooth pad, finding surprisingly little resistance at first. Almost as if you were mushing into a big, warm ball of dough. The advance of your fingers is quickly halted by a solid wall of muscle hidden underneath the soft exterior. You carefully start exploring the obstacle, poking and prodding at it to coax the tense muscles to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oohnnnggg.... You're a natural at this...</span>\" Lucy approvingly growls, unable to stop herself from wiggling her toes in delight at the feeling of getting her feet pampered for the first time in centuries. Despite you best efforts, you're unable to force the Lucario's toes to stay still, feeling your arms getting jerked along with every single one of their twitches and clenches. Eventually though, the muscle yields under your onslaught, approvingly kneading back into your caress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One piggy down, three more to go\" you silently count down as you move to its sibling, giving it the same treatment. You're forced to squeeze your hands between her furry toes now, granting you your first feel of the fluffy crevices between them. The warmth is much more potent here, her body heat trapped between the plump digits with no escape. The moist fur tickles pleasantly against your hands, as if you'd just slipped them in a pair of snug, fuzzy mittens heated on a stove. Enthralled, eagerly explore more of the space between her toes, not even noticing the drops of sweat collecting on your hands, their curiosity coaxing more of the smelly moisture from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've worked up quite a sweat of your own by the time you finish the last of her toes, causing you to slightly shiver in the cool air. You hug her paw close to your chest, smiling as you feel its pleasant warmth chase off the evening chill as it spreads throughout your body. You're snapped back to reality as the source of your comfort suddenly lifts into the air, taking you with it as its owner lets out a small giggle. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Aaaw, that's adorable!</span>\", she coos, as you hang suspended from her foot. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I don't think I've ever had a human volunteer as my slipper before~</span>\" You're not even given a chance to protest as she crosses her legs, lifting you even further away from the ground. She shifts her foot this way and that, humming in approval of the way you look on her paw \"<span class=\"clblue\">And you're just my size too! It's a shame there's only one of you.. You won't mind swapping feet periodically to let both of my girls enjoy you, right Marcus?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lu-Lucy! Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm? But I've already put you on, shoe-boy. In fact, you make such an adorably cute piece of footwear, I don't think I'll ever want to take you off~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thi-... This isn't funny Lucy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh, au contraire. This is hilarious!</span>\" The Lucario exclaims with a laugh. \"<span class=\"clblue\">You were so confident in claiming me as your pok\u00e9mon and now, not even twenty minutes later, you're desperately clinging to my paw like a lost, little flip-flop! Tell me slipper-boy, how's the view up there?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I...\" You take a moment to look around. Right in front of you are her four plump, furry toes, slightly spread to allow you a good view into the damp crevices between them. They happily wriggle on top of you, lovingly nuzzling against their <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">new insole</span> <b>your chest</b>. Your arms are hugged tight around her foot slightly behind her toes,  serving as sandal-straps to hold you firmly against her paw. Beneath them, you can feel the pad of her sole softly rub against you with every flex of her foot. You feel her heel push against you with every shake of her paw, just between your belly and your crotch. From there, you've wrapped your legs upwards around her ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly think of your own, well-worn shoes,  their insole permanently marked by your own feet. You can't help but wonder if Lucy's paws would mark you the same way. You picture yourself, laying flat on your back before her, the Lucario towering above you. Thick black imprints decorate your chest, clearly marking you as her favorite slipper. She'd grin down at you, slowly lifting her paw over your body, her toes giving you a teasing wiggle before the foot settles down on top of you. She'd wait patiently for you to grip her paw tightly, giving you a sly wink once she felt you've secured yourself properly. Then she'd walk off, feeling her powerful strides getting cushioned by the very same human who released her into this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the paw would apply a fresh layer of its foot-funk onto you, grinding it deeper into the imprints with each of her thundering footfalls. Lucy probably wouldn't spare you a glance during her travels. No, she'd be much too focused on other things, things much more important than the happiness of her sentient flip-flop. You however would be forced to recognize her superiority which every one of her pounding steps, her massive weight serving as a constant reminder of your place beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she'll allow you a small reprieve during her breaks, crossing her legs to allow you to freely dangle from her <i>gorgeous</i> paw, letting her grateful toes lovingly rub against you in appreciation for the comfort you've provided them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she'll need you again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppress an involuntary shudder at the thought. \"What about your footrub!\" you desperately shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm? What about it?</span>\" She coyly responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want me to finish it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her shift her gaze upwards to the sky, doing her best to look bored by the suggestion. \"<span class=\"clblue\">No, not really</span>\" She starts absentmindedly tracing small circles throught the air with her paw, unwillingly taking you along for the ride. \"<span class=\"clblue\">It was nice having you rub my feet, but I think I prefer having my feet rub you instead</span>\" she concludes with an exagerated yawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lucy! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Please what, little flip-flop?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't turn me into your shoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario failed to suppress a smirk. The thought of using Marcus as her slipper did intrigue her greatly, but it was clear he wasn't ready yet. He'd just let go the second she planted her foot on the ground. She could punish him of course, but that would just make him build up resistance to her. No, the trick to taming a human was to use just the threat of punishment to make them walk willingly down the road to servitude, pushing them on by increasingly humiliating demands, never letting them be comfortable until they've become the perfect little footpet they are meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus isn't there yet, but it's clear he's getting closer. She could let him continue rubbing her feet. She hates to admit it, but the human was remarkably talented, and she already misses the way he'd carefully managed to loosen up her knots. Her toes feel absolutely divine now, and she can't wait to have both of her feet feel equally loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she's having so much fun taunting the poor guy. Seeing him dangle from her foot like that, desperately pleading with her to think of him as something more than a piece of footwear is making her feel more powerful than she ever has, including back when she had legions of servants worshiping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, what to do...</span></div></div>",

You jumped on there all by yourself~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-w-whaat?\" You stuttered out, unsure of what Lucy could mean by it. \"That's ridiculous! I would never-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Oh, stop with those silly, pathetic excuses, and take a good look at yourself.</span>\" The Lucario suddenly retorted, waggling her foot around, dizzying you a little. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Hugging my pretty little pawsie like that, as if it was your precious childhood plushie. Probably for the same reason too</span>~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks burned at the mention of such a degrading comparison. You didn't know what to say to that. Thankfully (NOT) Lucy wasn't done with her breaking speech yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sigh</i>, why won't you just admit it already, my little flip-flop? You find this experience comforting, calming. Sticking to the bottom of a superior being's foot, you're simply slowly accepting your proper role, your place in this world. And I, like the benevolent goddess that I am, will gladly assist you in this transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lucy bent herself forward, nearing her muzzle to your groveling form as much as she could, and looked deep into your eyes. It's somewhat hilarious how different you two perceived this situation. She was clearly amused by your antics and reactions, while you found it all borderline terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't worry, Marcus. By this day's end you will learn to accept, and love your place underneath my feet, just as millions have before you. That, I promise~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you weren't given even a moment to respond, before the Lucario moved on with her ploy, this time by lurching herself backwards. Her upper body now lied sprawled on the ground, while she held her legs in a vertical positions. The paw you were now effectively lying on was being held concurrently to the ground, to make sure you wouldn't accidentally slip from it. From up here, you got a good look at Lucy's quite captivating. She seemed so much cuter than usual, just relaxing, enjoying herself, catching some rays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you wish you could enjoy the experience as much as she was. Like a good shoe that she thought you were, your form was a bit bigger than that of her foot. It made clinging onto her paw a bit harder, your arms and legs clenching it as hard as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lied there, unable to force yourself to drop down, you began to smell something... funky. A potent musk it was, smelling of both wet fur, and sweaty feet. Since it wasn't coming from the paw you were clinging to (well, at least not to this powerful extent), you began looking around for the source of this curious aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even take your eyes five seconds to finally settle on the Lucario's other leg, and by extension its 'far-from-dainty' footsie. Lucy held it vertically in front of the other one, with her foot angled in an arch, so that it too could enjoy the Sun's warm light. Mesmerized, you observed her profusely sweating toepads, and the multiple paths those sweatdrops took, as they rolled down the arch of her foot, only to stop and dissipate at its heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, so that's what that smell was coming from. No wonder her other foot didn't sweat as much, it had its faithful little shoe to protect it- THE HELL YOU'RE THINKING OFF RIGHT NOW!?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cute giggle broke the silence of this moment, snapping you out of your thoughts, only to plunge you into the deepest, dankest darkness you've ever know, as Lucy rammed her other foot into your face. This time the Lucario laughed out loud, as she gripped at your head with her plump toes, pushing your face further and further into the sweaty arch of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Ohohoho~ This is sooo rich!</span>\" You heard her gloat, as she started swaying her foot, and as a result you head, bopping it up and down, left and right, only to disorientate you further, preventing you from gathering you thoughts, and fighting back against her feet's bold advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Please, pardon me for this, but when I saw you so lovingly staring at my foot, I just couldn't help it.You needed it. To see my lil'friend from up close. To feel it Smell it... Taste it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't fight against it, against her. Your body was fully in her control now, with only your mind putting up any sort of resistance. You couldn't try to hold your breath, or close your mouth, and had to endure through her powerful, all-encompassing musk, and that incredibly salty, yet surprisingly appeasing taste of her sweat, all the while your vision's been completely obstructed by her paw. Lucy would occasionally bop her foot, slapping her face against her sole.<br>\r\nShivers ran down your spine, and you couldn't tell if you got them from disgust, or excitement, or something else entirely. Your mind got all foggy and screwy, no doubt due to that inescapable foot funk of hers, and the over humid atmosphere she's been exerting upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough at this point you were barely responsive, you were still tightly clutching her other foot, they one you've been lying on thorough this whole ordeal. Lucy couldn't help but crack a snide grin at it. She got you now, she could feel it thanks to her aura powers. You were now practically at her mercy, she could do whatever she wanted to you. At the moment though, she really had one role for you to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hehehe~ That's right, my little flip-flop</span>\" She seductively whispered, augmenting her voice somewhat so that her words could reach you. \"<span class=\"clblue\">You've lost yourself to my feet, to what they've got to offer. Their texture, their smell, their taste. All things that only a proper human slave could appreciate. You've reached that point now. All that remains for me to do, is to take the final step. Literally~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Lucy switched to a sitting position, though she still kept 'your' foot elevated above ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I am going to stand up now, and I want you to stay where you are clutching my paw tightly as you would the love of your life. After all, that's what my little footsie is now to you, isn't~</span>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you really do it? Could you really willingly let her turn you into her shoe? All things seemed to point at 'yes' at the moment. Your mind still clouded by her musk, you could hardly feel her leg being lowered to the ground. It would actually take a miracle to get you out of this situation with some dignity left, let alone your sense of self-respect and worth. No matter the outcome, you would be a changed man, the question remained if you'd still be a man after this, or a shoe for Lucy to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground's getting closer, time is running out. What's gonna happen next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She couldn't... She wasn't... Your head was swimming, the sweat of her poor, slipperless paw still stinging against your face.You picture it again, rising up before you like a monolith. You feel ashamed as you think back on how the divine sole was covered in grime, every splotch of dirt on it desecrating its beauty, a monument to your failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou... No! You weren't a shoe! You forcefully try to shake your head clear of the oppressive thoughts. You were a promising up-and-coming trainer! Granted, your gym career hit a spot of bad luck lately, but you thought finding that masterball would turn it around! It even contained an amazingly powerful pok\u00e9mon, too! If only you could get Lucy to see things your way, some way to get her to listen to... Wait... Listen? That's right, Lucy said something, hadn't she? What was it again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"clblue\">I am going to stand up now, and I want you to stay where you are clutching my paw tightly as you would the love of your life~</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! All you needed to do was let go before she stood up, and you'd be saved! She wouldn't want a shoe that would constantly slip from her magnificent foot, would she? You just needed to let go but... You hesitate, thinking back on how high up from the ground you were. If you were to let go now, you'd surely fall and hurt yourself. You needed to hang on, just for a little while longer. Until you were close enough to the ground to jump off. You just needed to see, to find the perfect opportunity to release yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open your eyes, having shut them since the assault of her paw's unprotected sibling. You see Lucy, towering above you, the afternoon sun behind her giving her an angelic appearance. She's looking down at you, beaming in happiness, patiently waiting for you to realize that... No... No, no, no! You quickly look down, finding the familiar sight of her four plump toes before you, happily twitching against your upper body. You stare disbelievingly at them, only now feeling the rough forest ground scratch against your back with every shift of the mighty appendage you're still clinging to for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm so proud of you Marcus!</span>\", the giant canine lovingly coos, pulling your gaze back up towards her as the compliment snaps you out of your daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You are?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Of course! You've accepted your rightful place much faster than I thought you would</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back down at the paw covering you, your treasonous arms still clutching it tight. Your heart starts pounding in your chest as you watch yourself still lovingly cradle her foot. <i>\"Why haven't I let go?\"</i> The question remains unanswered as your hug defiantly continues, shackling you to Lucy, every passing second cementing further cementing you as her slipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why -<b>can't</b>- I let go?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I... Am I really your shoe now?\" you fearfully stammer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm... Maybe</span>\", comes her coy reply. \"<span class=\"clblue\">After all, I need to test you out before I can formally adopt you as my footwear, right?</span>\" She gives her delightful toes a teasing wiggle against your chest. \"<span class=\"clblue\">To see if you feel comfortable enough against my pawsies~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess that makes sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Don't worry Marcus</span>\", She lovingly assures you. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I'm sure you'll be just perfect. Now brace yourself, and...-Hop!</span>\" You feel your butt lift from the ground as she stands on her tippy-toes. An involuntary grunt gets forced out of you as her full weight pushes down on your chest. Then you feel your upper body get lifted as she balances on her heel, uncaringly squishing your guts flat beneath her. You see her toes lift up before you as she holds the pose, their lovely pads shining with sweat in the sun. A quick glance down to your chest reveals four damp circles on your skin, marking it as theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy repeats the exercise a couple of more times, coaxing more grunts and groans out of you as she slowly tramples you underneath her. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmmm... I'm used to my insoles being a bit firmer than this...</span>\" She mumbles, mostly to herself. \"<span class=\"clblue\">But that's nothing that can't be fixed. Now Marcus, I'm going to walk around a bit with you, ok?</span>\" You're about to reply, but she was already taking her first step. Of course, she wouldn't wait for her shoe's approval to start using it. Her gorgeous toes slam back into you as she sets off. You can feel the pressure building on your chest but... it doesn't seem to stop this time! Balancing on both feet earlier, her other foot took at least some of her weight. This time, you'll get to bear it alone. You can feel your ribs buckle underneath her, crushing the air out of your lungs with a pitiful wheeze. Your face is starting to turn beet red under the strain until, just as you think you were going to pop, it disappears. You find yourself suddenly flying through the air, passing her other foot planted down on the ground as you eagerly suck in more air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you crash down again. Knowing what's about to come, you try to brace yourself as best as you're able, the ground slamming into your back as she completes her first step. Her heel mercilessly pushes into your abdomen, until you're sure you can feel it rub against rub against your spine. The paw rolls over you, crushing everything in its path as Lucy casually continues on.You look up at her, hoping to get some mercy, but she's not even looking down. The only thing you can see is the underside of her muzzle as she slowly continues her stroll, fully focused on feeling your torso bend and flatten underneath her as it molds to the shape of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her little test has finished, leaving you exhausted and feeling like a wayward wad of gum. The small walk has made her paws sweat more noticeably, the extra moisture rubbing off some of the filth your shirt had missed, painting your chest with five, greasy, grey circles. Four for her toes, and one from the larger pad on her sole. You feel yourself sliding back and forth along the ground now. \"<span class=\"clblue\">Not really offering a lot of grip... I guess you're more the in-door slipper type of human, aren't you Marcus?</span>\" She giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're too spent to even offer a reply, helpless to do anything but just lay there, feeling her foot relax on top of you. It's warmth spreads throughout your body, soothing your aching muscles. The sole eagerly settles on top of your torso, the wet fur covering you like the most comfortable blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel it's sweat pool underneath it, the fragrant moisture feeling divine against your sensitive skin. You look up and see Lucy's lovely toes happily wriggle against your chest, the adorable sight revitalizing you. You slowly lean your head forward to plant a kiss on one of the cute, plump digits, drawing an approving coo from their owner up high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was... Do I feel comfortable on your paw?\" You ask, granting the toe's siblings a smooch as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Very</span>\", She sighs, each of your kisses sending a delightful shudder up her spine. \"<span class=\"clblue\">I don't know how I ever managed without you.</span>\" The Lucario lifts her toes, presenting their grimy pads to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I'm your slipper now?\" You obediently trace your tongue up and down the exposed bottom of her digits, making the pretty little things clench in delight<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Hmm... Do you want to be?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. Taking another good look at the tantalizing toes twitching before you. At the way your chest disappears beneath the ball of her foot. You focus on how the magnificent paw feels, perched on top of you. The way its fur pleasantly tickles against your exposed belly.The way it's wonderful sweat sticks against you, small rivulets of the fragrant liquid starting to trickle down your side onto the soft grass below. The way its warmth comforts and soothes you. How it's potent stench fills your lungs, swallowing you utterly in its undiluted musk, your every breath dominated by its presence. And of course, how its owner is lovingly smiling down at you like a benevolent goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes...\" You shamefully reply, resuming your worship of Lucy's gorgeous toes, much to their delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">Then I'll happily accept, my little slipper. You'll serve as a cushion for my pretty little pawsie for as long as I choose wear you.</span>\" The Lucario crouched down, resting her muzzle on her knee above you, smirking down at her new flip-flop with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">And I don't think I'll ever be taking you off~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pushed her toes down again, trapping your head in the sweltering crevice between them. Hot, humid, fuzzy and dark, with the scent of her divine paw increased tenfold, your new role in life began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you couldn't be happier.</span></div></div>",

You have no idea how long she walked with her adoring slipper, all you know is that slipper was you, and every moment was pure heaven on Earth. Why wouldn't it be? Your goddess was above you, trusting you to take her full weight with your torso each and every step she took. Of course, to thank her for this offer, you kept her \"pawsie\" nice and clean for her, licking up all of her sweat and grime before it could really even accumulate. Each time your tongue ran under her pads, or across the fur surrounding it, you could feel them clench in delight, and every so often, she would coo down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 <span class=\"cteal\"></span> \"Aww, you're such a good little slipper, Marcus, keeping my tootsies nice and clean like that.~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 <span class=\"cblack\"></span> She would reward you for this by either grinding her toes against your head, or letting you bathe in her undiluted musk from between them, the moist fur wrapping around you lovingly, trapping you there. Like you would ever want to leave. You had a duty to your goddess, and would stick to it until she didn't need, or want, you anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 Now though, she seemed deep in thought. She kept tapping her toes up and down, putting the full wait of her heal on you for a few seconds at a time. <span class=\"cteal\"></span> \"Marcus, you said that the human rebellion succeeded, right?\" <span class=\"cblack\"></span> You quickly nod. <span class=\"clteal\"></span> \"And I was trapped in that 'Master Ball' because of it, right?\" <span class=\"cblack\"></span> Again, you nod. <span class=\"clteal\"></span> \"Do you think that maybe other Goddesses like me were trapped in a Master Ball then?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you now stood a majestic-looking creature, one that resembled a Pokemon known as Primarina. Most of her body resembled that of a human woman, only covered in a short, pristine white fur. The tail that a normal Primarina would have now resembled a gown. Other than that, however, and a frilly bra, she didn't seem to be wearing anything else.<br>\r\nAs you gaze fell down, you took note of her white, furry legs, and her surprisingly large feet. As the being spread and wiggled her toes in delight, apparently enjoying the feel of grass tickling her soles, you were able to spot webbing between her digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, this unusual Pokemon extended one of her legs forwards, giving you a good glimpse at her soles. You instinctively jumped backward, weirded about by such action, while the creature giggled cutely, seemingly amused by your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh, my apologies~\"</span> You heard her speak. Speak. She was talking to you like any normal human would. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Seeing how you were eyeing my feet, I just thought you were ready to serve them, my slave.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlave? What was she on about now? This whole thing is getting weirder and weirder with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, excuse me miss, but who are you?\" You asked, hoping to get a good answer that would explain this whole maddening situation that you were a part of right now. Instead you've managed to get her to scowl in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Hmph! First of all, your ignorance knows no bounds. To talk to me so casually. I almost feel offended.\"</span><br>\r\nLooks like you pushed some wrong buttons there. You didn't see anything wrong with what you said, though. Looks like somebody here had a pretty fragile.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Secondly, I am no 'miss'. I am your mistress and goddess, and you shall address me as such, or not speak at all. I'd much prefer to have an obedient, if quiet pup lapping at my feet, rather than some uncultured, babbling swine.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, you were liking her less and less now. She looked pretty, that much was undeniable, but there was something rotten about her character, hidden underneath all that clean fur of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen here miss, I ain't no sl-\" You tried to approach her, but a sudden burst of water sent you flying backwards. When you tried to get up, you barely got a glimpse of 'goddess' Primarina's shooting a water bubble at you, its explosion pushing you down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired and in pain, you couldn't do much, as you've head her feet slapping against the wet ground. At the last second you tried to gather your strength and get up, only to have that work swiftly undone, as Primarina harshly stepped down on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get your filthy foot away from me, you b-\" Once again, you found yourself unable to finish a sentence, as the now clearly infuriated Primarina slammed her other foot into your face, using it to scrub her sole off filth and mud that stained it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Silence, you cretinous wretch!\"</span> She spat out at you, grinding her foot left and right, as if she was squashing some bug. <span class=\"cteal\">\"My perfect soles only got dirty because of you, and your arrogance. It is most fitting then, that you shall be the one to cleanse my soles of this filth. Debase yourself for me, and lick my feet slave... Unless, that is, you want to end up as just another stain underneath them.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold, cruel way she said that last part, and the emphasis she put on it by rubbing her foot as hard as she could against your face, actually filled you with dread. Was she serious with that threat? Turn you into a stain under her foot?<br>\r\nAt any rate, she was much more than just some high'n'mighty bitch you initially. She actually had enough power to enforce her will on you, and there wasn't much you could do to defend yourself from her. The situation was dire, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, two faced two choices. You could either submit to her, and see what misery befalls those who serve her, or try to defy her, and see what punishment awaits those that resist... and fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a young, wandering trainer, who just happened to come across a mysterious Poke Ball, one that held inside a creature beyond your wildest imagination. The being presented herself as your new mistress, and easily bound you to her will.<br>\r\nUnable to escape, and helpless to resist her allure, you are now at the mercy of a voluptuous Pokemorph goddess, either forced to or willingly following every single one of her commands... Most of which, curiously enough, revolve around serving her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a foot fetish-centered interactive story featuring anthropomorphic Pokemon. ALL Pokemorphs are female, even those of Pokemon that are mostly/always male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that are allowed to write about in this story:<br>\r\n- foot worship, licking, sniffing, massaging.;<br>\r\n- trampling, stomping, crushing underfoot,<br>\r\n- shrinking/transformations, so long as the focus is still kept on the Pokemorph's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome other things worth mentioning:<br>\r\n- Pokemon are separated by generations they first appeared in. So for example Pikachu and Raichu are in Gen 1, Pichu is in Gen 2, and Alolan Raichu is in Gen 7,<br>\r\n- Mega Evolutions as separate Pokemorphs are to be put in Gen 6, but you can also have your Pokemorphs Mega Evolve at will if you so choose,<br>\r\n- preferably the interaction in this story will remain 1-on-1: you and your Pokemorph. However, there is an option for teams of mistresses for those interested in a group play like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit me up with any question that you might have in regards to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun~</td>",
