Recently, your favorite berry bush has been raided by a flock of birds, and you need to find a new source of food. You travel west, opposite of the bush. The grass here is in patches, so you must be careful not to get too exposed. Dashing patch to patch, you start to get the feeling that you\u2019re lost. Nevertheless , you press on.<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so of exploring, you find yourself in an unfamiliar area. Still foodless, you continue your search, even farther away from the known.<br>\r\nJust then, you see a huge wall in the distance. It appears to be what you have heard before as a fence, but you\u2019ve never seen one. When you were little, your mother told you stories about huge creatures that looked like us, but they were tall enough to touch the leaves of trees! These hundreds of feet tall creatures were rarely friendly, and often used micros as foot slaves, sex toys, and even snacks. But they were just stories, not real or anything... were they? You, like many micros, live life inside of trees and under rocks, and rarely come across these \u201cgiants\u201d. Micros often congregate and socialize, so maybe macros are the same! You can\u2019t take it. You pick up your pace and curiosity takes over. About ten minutes later, you arrive at the base of the fence. You feel a shiver go down your spine, and you get ready to make the decision.</span></div></div>",

You make your way to bottom of the fence and crawl underneath the partially rotten wood. You immediately notice the grass on this side is a lot thicker than the forest grass. Seeing that the grass can support your weight, you step up atop the large green blades. <br>\r\nThe view in front of you is startling, yet exciting. In front of you was a long yard, leading to the biggest structures you have ever seen. The house it lead to has a white exterior, as well as a concrete porch. The doors that make up the entrance are glass. You run with haste toward the house, excited to experience such a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\nYou stand in awe at the foot of the massive door. You get in by slipping between the door and the ground. Once inside, you stand on hard wood floors, takeing in the beautiful new landscape. Every wall of the house touched the sky. Each room was bigger than any tree you ran around before. This place seems like one of magic!<br>\r\nYou feel a strange yet sudden sense of vulnerability. If this was a creature\u2019s house, then the creature living here must be huge! Thankfully, no one seems to be here. Catching sight of a door, you make your way toward it. <br>\r\nYou are about halfway to the door before you stop. The ground... a faint tap... it was and odd thing for the floor to make a sound like that. There it was again! Only this time, it was more heavy. Once more, it makes that sound, but now it\u2019s an audible *Thump*. You start to grow scared as the sound grows louder and louder. Your jaw drops as a Masive figure steps into the room!

A loud crack echoes around the room as you escape with a bit more leeway than before. You slide hard as you reach the door. You slide cleanly under the door and make a brake for the fence. You pant as you scramble under the wooden fence. You sigh in relief as you look out at the wild. Though unsafe, it is a lot safer than that other world. You walk home, a little wiser, and a little stronger, but mostly importantly, you are alive. The trees are your home, and nothing can change that.</span></div></div>",

He is an orange and white fox with green eyes, and is wearing beige khakis and white socks. He is mildly built, but not muscular. His black, digitigrade footpaw claws stick out of his sock. <br>\r\nYou see him smile, \u201cAhh, here it is!\u201d He picks up a sheet of paper and steps out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in shock.

You look around and notice a shelf like structure with a gap between the floor and the bottom shelf. The gap is slightly taller than you are, and it is rather dark. You quickly run towards the shelf and hope that the fox does not come back.<br>\r\nLuckily, you scurry under the shelf with ease, and the fox is still nowhere to be found. While you glance out from under the shelf, you hear a voice from behind you!<br>\r\n\u201cH-h-huh-who are you?\u201d Say a shaky male voice. <br>\r\nYou twist around and see another micro. He is a gryphon, with lion legs and stomach, and brown feathers and yellow talon arms. His ribs are freakishly visible, and his feathers are fading. He looks as if he is actually starving!<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Samuel. Are you alright?\u201d You extend your paw and start walking towards him slowly.<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten anything in two weeks. It hurts to run.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cHow do you survive?!\u201d The fact that he is alive is astonishing.<br>\r\n\u201cI drink whatever water drips from the back of the shelf. He waters his flowers on the top shelf every few days, and a few drops of water runs down the back of the shelf. As for eating, I don\u2019t.\u201d He wobbles a bit. \u201cTwo weeks ago, I ate a piece of mulch that ran down with the water. I... I ...\u201d He nearly collapses on the floor, but you quickly catch him.<br>\r\n\u201cI got you, sit down, your okay.\u201d You comfort him and guide him to the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI...

There\u2019s food on the counter, but I can\u2019t climb. Not like this. Look out for Tom, you know, the big fox.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I will.

You extend your arm to lean on it, but as your handpaw touches it, it feels warm, and hairy. You freeze. You must have touched the bear!

From current evidence, you conclude that she is on her back, therefore, attempting to climb up them would take awhile. Dazzled, you aproch her knees. Her legs are digitigrade, so they have the same bend in them as your legs. Alas, there\u2019s still no way under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, you finally reach the end of the bed. You stare at the dark outlines of her paws, now coming into view as your eyes adjust. You stand in awe. They are five times as tall as you are! You approach her huge paw pad and place your tiny hand paws on it. You gently push on her paw, and in turn, causes a small indention. You get a tad nervous and back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you back up, you notice that she has her legs are parted just enough for you to walk through.

As soon as you pass her paws, you can feel the heat radiating from her legs, warming up the air and you. There is very little room to walk. You can reach out your arms and touch her legs on either side of you. You shiver to think that what would seem like an insignificant action to this beast could easily kill you. You continue walking and pass her knees a second time. As you approach her thighs, you notice how tall they are, as well as how the fat distributes itself. The fat is creating a tunnel that you <i>could</i> crawl trough, but you should probably walk. Her thighs force you into a triangular path, with her thigh fat closing in to form a point. <br>\r\n\u2018Hmm...\u2019 you think to yourself, \u2018I wonder if I could...\u2019 you slide your handpaws into the crevice of fat and try to separate it. \u2018Grrrrraah!

As you crawl, you constantly rub your back on the furry roof. It\u2019s dark, cramped, and there is an interesting smell that you can\u2019t put your finger on. Finally, you come to a fur wall that has a tunnel leading up, and a tight tunnel at its base. Yup, you are at her groin. It appears that there are two choices.</span></div></div>",
