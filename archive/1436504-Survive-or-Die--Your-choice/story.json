One purchase of a pie, can lead to another's death. I am not a hero, nor am I the only one who lived through the mass extinction of our race that I shall now call EX-Day. I am but a single story in the grand tapestry of events. If I could swap lives with those unknowing people who suffered a fate worse than death, I would....

Parzoni Kepsulot signing off.<br>\r\n.....................<br>\r\n     Damn. Has it only been that long? That's too short. I hate looking at their smiling grins, and knowing what I know. I am no hero. I am but a lucky fool. I... I can't remember. I don't want to. They won't make me! Not anymore! I can beat them with a single latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ting* The latch opens, \"Ready for take off Captain Rudy?\" The ex-Astronaut grinned off into the dark depths of space. Fake gravity ... it was never that hard to beat, was it? Maybe they didn't care? Knowing them, it would be encouraged to do what I was about to do. But so what? They won. Like always, they won. But this time ... I would win too.<br>\r\nSpace grew closer and closer, the sun was far away, but her glare was reaching way far out ... catch me! Catch me before I fall! Ha Ha! Like the good old days, ain't that right Rudy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pudgy grinning face, shining with sweat, deep bags under his eyes; it was right before him.

Who knows when he's here? But there ain't nothing to fear! Cuz he's here to help with all your needs, so please baby, please, can I be your ... sales representative?\" Another flawless performance by the one and only King of this little sweat shop. They love me, that's the only reason they come back here. Oh well, at least they have me to boost up their ratings.

Approach with caution, I repeat approach with caution. Subject extremely hot!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman stood with her back to Trent, and from his angle he could see all of her curves! The girl had something that just screamed out beautiful. She was struggling with the zipper, ha! Let a man do it for you young lady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but could I help you with that?\" Trent grinned his patented Trent Davies sparkle and winked at the poor, helpless beauty. He reached out towards the black dress and was about to grab it when the woman snatched it back like it was her child and she was it's crazy overprotective mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang, sounds like the girl's a little angry. Or nuts. Either way, she might not be one to mess with. Then again, she is just a customer, and Trent Davies knows all too well how to handle customers. Why would this one shake him? Trent, cleared his throat, ready to pounce back on his victim and go for the kill when she yelled out in the worst screechy voice, \"Quiet! I don't need your help! I can do it myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent jumped back at this, uncertain what to do about this oddity.

Some people obviously need their privacy - this one was one of those. Besides, hot or not, I ain't dealing with one of those women again. Angela was damn fine enough! Remembering her, he shivered slightly, but then refocused quickly to his work. An old woman, dumpy, stringy old carrot-hair, was meandering around the shoes. I know her, Trent thought, straightening up, and getting back into his groove. I just don't exactly know her name. Uh, hell. Miss, or Ma'am, that's a universal word, ain't it? She sure was confused, as usual. With one last sideways  glance  at the odd  woman, he walked over  to  his  real customer  and began helping her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello, Ma'am, is there anything in particular that i can help you find?\"\" He suavely proposed to the little old woman.<br>\r\n\"Why,  hello again Samuel.\" I still don't where she gets that name  from, but as long as it ain't from her old dead husband, I guess I can live with it. \"I'm looking for some comfortable shoes, my pair are getting a little raggedy, is there any here that are comfortable?\"<br>\r\n\"Why, of course Ma'am! We've got a wide range of selections devoted to the most comfortable pairs of...\" Of course, it was then that I got interrupted right in the middle of my speech. The speech never failed, and if I couldn't deliver it, who knows what will happen to her senile mind.  I glared over to the tap I just received, to see that crazy gal standing right next to me. She looked like a junkie or something, a sense of want in her eyes. Of need. I can see her tremble and all and I wondered what the hell she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm ready for your help.\" I just looked at her and laughed. My help? Girl, my help was on sale for one time only. It's off the shelves now. I wanted to turn my head and continue talking to my client, but it didn't look like she'd go away that easily. None of her type ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what do you think you're doing, miss? I'm afraid I'm with another customer, could you please hold on and I can be with you in...\" I tried to calm the frantic girl down.<br>\r\n\"No! No, I ain't got time for that! This is important.\" What a damn ... important? Who does she think she is? I looked over at the old lady, she had a worried look in her eyeglasses, she looked just like they do before they say \"I'm fine, actually,\" I didn't want to lose her! So, I took this other one aside,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, miss. It's clothes. Clothes can wait, now so can you. I'll be with you in just a second.\"<br>\r\n\"No. This isn't about clothes...\" She said in her odd melodramatic voice. Right then I could feel relief welling up inside me. I laughed her off and turned back to my actual customer, but she kept going on..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about the end of the world!\" She screamed out in a screechy  whisper. I put my head down, too embarrassed to be talking to this person. Then picked it up to see how my customer was doing. Damn!! She looked scared! That damn crazy witch has gotten her scared! I could hear those words coming right at me like a bullet,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Samuel, I can come back. I think you two need to talk...\" And there she went. Oh well, it's just a customer. The worst part will be talking with this nut job! Turning around, I glared straight into her horrified eyes. Witch! I'll smack the fear out of your eyes... that's what I felt. But what I said was,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The end of the world?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" She was serious. Dead serious, like one of those bums with the \"Apocalypse is Coming\" signs on outside. She was odd though, because she did this with her beauty. What a damn waste, I thought as I looked into her perfect green eyes. I didn't really want to talk with her anymore. It was almost closing time, and I was already tired of her. Then again, what the hell do I have to lose, I guess...</span></div></div>",

Zombie outbreak? What in the hell is the problem with the Earth now?\"<br>\r\n\"Aliens ...\" Aliens. Little green men, and bug eyed slimy creatures. I had an uncle who used to read these weird comic books to us each night. Brother Joey really got a kick out of them. They bored me a bit. In fact, this whole situation was starting to bore me. I was a no nonsense kind of guy,and this story already sounded like a waste of my time. But, I didn't follow my better judgment. I waltzed on over to a little chair and sat down for this yarn.<br>\r\n\"From Mars?\" I asked, with a mischievous little grin.<br>\r\n\"No ... I don't know from where though.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, then in theory, can't they be from Mars?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah ... but! Where they're from doesn't matter! They're here! I saw them with my own eyes...\" She really was beautiful. Rosy red lips, lovely tanned skin, too bad she was so..<br>\r\n\"... I was with my friends Gracie and Janet down at Janet's dad's place. And there it was ... all of a sudden there was ... was this thing! It had barely any torso, and a small head. It's arms and legs were monstrous. Me and Gracie grabbed each other as we saw ...\" She stopped her tale there. She looked as though she were about to cry. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor misguided weirdo.<br>\r\n\"... it shot this gun that ... turned Mr, Peterson inside out..!\"<br>\r\n\"Must've been some mess to clean up\" I almost laughed but stopped as I saw the look across her face. Even for a fable this one was eerie. This girl had talent with words.<br>\r\n\"We ran ... we got separated. I went to the city ... to find help. She went ... I don't really know. But before we split up,she told me what Janet had told her. That they were controlling our minds .. the aliens, I think. It had gotten me and Gracie. The only thing that can stop it ... is DLC.\" DLC, I believe, little lady, you've mixed up the d for t, and in this case I would be...<br>\r\n\"You know what that is?\"<br>\r\n\"No. I don't... You're going to tell me aren't you?\" I laughed.<br>\r\n\"Diamond-like-carbon. Mr. Peterson said the military had tested it and it was the only thing strong enough to withstand the kinds of waves they send out. That's why I'm here. I need to find some DLC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm. Lovely story and all, I smiled at her. Boy, she was no fun at all, even for a psycho. You expected at least a little ... aw well. I guess if that's what she believed in. That was alright with me, as long as she didn't ruin anymore of my...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you help me?\" I looked deep into her troubled eyes, and said,<br>\r\n\"Sure. You want me to drive you to a hospital so that they can...\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" She yelled, just like before. The boring phase looked like it was over. Time for the crazy, screaming one again. I looked around the place, hoping that they didn't see me hanging around with this banshee.<br>\r\n\"I thought you were different! I thought you could help me fight these aliens!\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She looked at me as if I had said something stupid. It was a legitimate question.<br>\r\n\"Because ... You ... you kinda remind me of a friend I have ... and because you don't seem hypnotized.\" Aww. How sweet of her. Who cares? Does she really think i'm going to go running around yelling \"The end is near!\". No. It was getting late, and I was officially off the clock. She gazed at me with sparkling eyes, and a puppy dog pout. But, cute or not, that was just crazy ... wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

I didn't see how in the hell she could be right, but she wasn't exactly a boring person, at least when she stopped all that crying and yelling. But then, I thought about the consequences that might ensue from dating a crazy girl like her. Yelling, crying, slapping. Er. I hated slapping. I took another look at her, but those glossy lips told me that maybe it wouldn't be all bad. Enjoy the ride, I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" In moments she had been jerking me by the arm like I was some sort of doll. Damn, girl! What a grip she had too! Things were looking less and less likely that she would take off that whole bossy, controlling attitude and be a sweet and gentle creature, ready for the Trentster to give her some sugar. But what could I do now, I had told the girl I'd help her, and I was a man of my word, if nothing else. Sure the exes would say otherwise, but they're bitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we whizzed by the fat, lazy, boring blurs of the crowd I couldn't help but feel embarrassed. I usually did the tugging. In fact, no self respecting cat could sit by while she pulled on him. So I said something to her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, babe, could you loosen up a bit, I think I'm starting to ...\"<br>\r\n\"What? Sorry, I can't hear you over this damn crowd!\" Come on now! They weren't even that loud. Was she deaf? That was it, I was getting tired of all of this mess. Checking my new watch I could see how late it was, normally I'd be leaving by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! My name's Lisa, by the way!\" I heard her screech back. Yeah, well that's fine and all, but I really don't care. I was so annoyed, I almost didn't want to give her a proper introduction. But of course, I knew that this would be too harsh, so I went right into it; of course the passion was all out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Trent, of course. Trent Davies, I'm sure you've heard of me before..\" I forced a shine of those pearly whites, and a wink too. I admit, I'm a bit too generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I've never heard of you. But it's nice to meet you!\" Oh come on! There was clearly something wrong with the girl. Was this her first time here? Well, by the looks of it yes, she was running into the junk section of the mall, where all the kiddie and useless stores were located. Hell, I haven't been back there since a long while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost, sweetheart?\" I asked her, trying to help her mixed up mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think it's around here somewh... oh there it is! Come on!\" She finally let go of my arm (damn, my sleeve was practically ruined by all that tugging, not to mention that it left a bit of pain in my arm). She dashed into a small store like the little crazy sprite she was, and I decided that I'd gone all the way here, so I casually walked on inside too. Then I noticed where we were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe junk store, the place that didn't even, or really never had, belonged in the mall. Owned by that old fart with the thick glasses, white mustache; the fool who hadn't noticed in twenty years that no one - especially the teenagers of the mall - cared about old, beat up parts. Yet here he was, selling to no one and wondering why \"no one is coming to buy anything?\" I'll tell you why, doc - You're a failure. A loser who should never have gotten into the business in the first place. Kids don't want junk, they want CDs, soda, junk FOOD; but of course he wouldn't of known that now would he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassed the \"watchful eye\" of the shopkeep, Lisa was digging through a barrel of old engines. She really wasn't like much other girls was she? And I meant that in the worst way possible. While she did whatever the hell she was doing with those engines, I sat down on one of the rickety old chairs and wondered why the hell I was even here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I ... I think this is it ...\" Looking over at her, she had a chunk of greasy metal, barely even shiny in her hands. Did she know what to do with that thing, or was she gonna spray paint it silver and use it as a UFO for this crazy \"movie\" of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell is that?\"<br>\r\n\"It's an engine made with DLC, I think. It should ward off ...\" She was talking about that crap again... ugh... give me a break! I <span class=\"clgreen\">green,</span> if i have to hear one more <span class=\"clgreen\">green</span> word about that stuff, I'm leaving! I don't <span class=\"clgreen\">green</span> to help or <span class=\"clgreen\">green.</span> <span class=\"clgreen\">Green. All I know is green. All I live is green. Green will help me now.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgreen\">Green.</span> \"Are you <span class=\"clgreen\">green</span> about these shoes? They're really comfortable? Because last time I bought Arnold, that's my husband, a pair he didn't like them. And I just <span class=\"clgreen\">green</span> to be sure that ...\" I didn't know why. But I felt good. But of course, taking one quick look could tell me why. It was ... uh, Ma'am. She was my best customer. Always blah blah blah, but she ate up my pitches like a hobo takes a handout. There it was, her hopeful, sad look. And here it was, my quick wit had memorized and preprocessed a new pitch just exactly for this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they're fine, Ma'am. In fact, my uncle used to have a pair of these shoes. Do you know what he said about them ...\" Always that same look of awe, \".. the damn finest shoes he'd ever bought. True that! In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch flowed from me naturally, I'd have this sale wrapped up in no time. I wasn't irritated. That was an odd thought. But of course I wasn't, what was there to be irritated about? All there was was me and my customer. And it was ....sale time!</span></div></div>",

Surveying the rest of the store, I could see a sea of lost and worried customers, seeking out their one and only employee of the month December and October 2006 to help them out. Much obliged I grinned. But I had to choose. Eenie meenie minie ... there you, another lovely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent!\" She screeched at me. It was Ma'am again. What the hell did she want?

Oh no, she wasn't one of those clingy girls was she? Oh god, why had I ever gotten started with her in the first place? That was it!

You lost me a customer and are just too plain ... weird for me! I really hope you can understand. Cuz, I don't want you following me or nothing. That's it!\" I stood tall.

It has DLC, and as I've said before, DLC's the only thing that can stop the daze.\"<br>\r\n\"That... that's crazy.\" I couldn't believe he was actually ... er, zombified, or whatever. How could what she said be real? Was this all a dream? It had to be, didn't it?<br>\r\n\"Here.\" She gave me a piece of that damn engine, kinda heavy. \"If you don't believe me, put this piece over his head. He'll snap right out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the metal, this couldn't do anything could it? But then I saw the old man; he certainly didn't look right.

Secretly I was relieved, all this talk of aliens and crap wasn't true. I didn't want it to be true. But then I was left with this old guy looking at me with those weird spacey eyes. If her crackpot idea didn't work, then what the hell was wrong with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't swipe it; you have to hold it over his head for a bit,\" Without warning she leaped at me and grabbed the engine piece. At first I thought she would hit the old man, that's why I let go quick and stepped back, making sure I knew where the exit was.  But then, just as she had said, she held it over him for a bit and then..... presto. He was moving again, screaming and yelling, almost having a heart attack, waking up to a stranger holding a engine part over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with you?! Get out of my ..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited outside, thinking about what the hell had just happened, as Lisa straightened things out with him and paid for a few things. It kinda seemed like she could be right. I wasn't quite sure to believe her, and hell I didn't even know why she would be right, but, it was sounding more and more like that was the case. Of all the people to be messed up with, why did it have to be her? And why today? Maybe I would've liked seeing her curvy good looks some other time, but now it seemed more than ever that she was trouble. And yet. It looked like she was the only one who knew what the hell was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I think everything's ok with him; And look, I've got some tools to build us helmets..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lisa. I guess I trust you. I mean, I kind of have to. This whole f***in' world's going upside down, and you're the only one who can tell me what to do. I guess I sort of ... well. You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Trent, I'm glad you believe me.\" She checked the watch on her wrist, \"But we should be going. This place isn't safe. No public place is. Can we go to your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I 'spose.\" She had done it again. The girl sure did like to talk; I was just about to be all nice to her, and there she goes flapping her gums. Oh well, no use arguing with her. What's wrong with me, though? This woman ain't my mother, so why am I letting her be such a *****? Maybe it's that damn mind control crap. I hope not; this feels so dumb to just say \"yeah\" to her orders, like a damn dog. Maybe it's cuz I love her? Naw. I barely met the chick. Got the hots for, hell yeah. But love, that's nuts. My place, though? Damn, she's fast isn't she? Wonder what she'll want to see next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe moved through the crowds of the mall, still heavy with people who're probably enjoying their damn nights instead of worrying. I wonder if it's be better to never have met her? I wouldn't have to be worrying about this insane bull***, but what if it's real? Then all these suckers are gonna die, aren't they? Die, or get their mind controlled. I guess it's better I know, just so that I can do something about this crap. I can live it up once this ****'s over. We get in my truck and drive to my place, the streets are littered with minivans and small convertibles stuck in the night traffic. We drive through the mess until we reach my home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, before we got home I could see something staring me right in the face. Not actually staring, but something coming right at me - it was light. But not green light; I couldn't see any car in front of me, or anything above making it, so I just kept driving. But do you know what she did? She just grabbed the wheel right then and there, didn't ask me or anything. Hell, we almost crashed right into a lamp post, had i not regained perfect control with ease. I looked at that crazy ***** and began to yell,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHat the **** do you think you're do...\" She just pointed behind us, smugly, with some ulterior knowledge. As I turned I saw a black Mustang get swallowed up by the blue light. ****! The blue then died down, leaving nothing there. I was gonna ask her a billion questions about what the hell just happened, but she told me to drive. Seeing another blue light near us, I did just as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got home I ran upstairs like a sprinter on crack and collapsed on my bed, my face buried in the silky sheets, mind drained, in the darkness of my apartment. I could hear her beginning to work on those helmets as she said, making a loud noise about every three seconds. I guess it dawned on me here; this is the end. Aliens, mind control, if this was real it could only be a dream or the end. That meant death. That meant afterlife. One good thing popped into my mind - Aunt Mildred - her big spectacles and grimy old hair and wrinkles under her eyes. I wanted to see her again. That's when I thought about my family. How are they? Were they experiencing the same crap as I was? God, I hoped not. Mom was old as it was, she didn't need all this **** to give her a heart attack. Damn ... I wished they were here, where I could see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI popped back up and found myself in my room, in the dark, with a basic stranger working on helmets and no one else in sight. I was alone here. So was my father. And my mother. The guilt was rattling my brain. The fear was overpowering it. I went to the TV to take my mind off of the chaos, but only saw bloodshed and blue lights. Horrific images of decapitated corpses and shadows of some creature, probably these damn aliens. I had no choice; I was not a dreamer, and I had to face up to the truth. I had to see how they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into my pocket I pulled out my cell phone and dialed a number. I waited for an answer. Finally I got one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sounded deeply sad, troubled probably by thinking about him. Worrying about her crazy son's whereabouts. Don't worry yourself over me ma', I don't want to hear you cry, Trent thought as he heard the trickle of melancholy in his mother's voice. I just want you to go on ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm ok, mom. But how 'bout you? ... Is .. IS everything ok, there? There any blue .. or green lights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here? Things are crazy here ... I just don't know what's wrong with this world...\" She paused her rant, thinking about her son. Wondering about him. \"Is everything alright over there, Trent? There's not any of that explosions and ... weird things there, are there son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent paused for a few seconds. He remembered the things he had seen. Hell, just now he could hear some screaming outside. He spun around to see Lisa almost shivering at the voices agonizing in pain outside. He stared into her cold eyes and saw the fear. But, he shook that and clamped the phone tightly so as to not let his mother hear anything,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... uh, no, ma'. Everything's alright, here.\" He lied with a fake genial tone.<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well that's good news. I hear that some really odd things are happening all around the world. In Hong Kong there was this man .... ook...\" She shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it ma'? What happened to him?\"<br>\r\n\"They say he ... was fused to his wife. I don't know if today's another April Fool's Day or...\"<br>\r\n\"Probably just an odd circumstance.\" Trent tried deeply to comfort her.<br>\r\n\"Well ... I don't know. There was also this ... this poor little boy in London ... he ...\"  She didn't continue. It was alright with Trent. He didn't want to hear the horror shows. He wished his mom didn't have to see them either.<br>\r\n\"But what about your home? What about San Raphael? ....\"<br>\r\n\"Oh ... well, we're not as unfortunate, I'm happy to say.\" Trent's heart almost leaped up at this. There she was, still alive, still sweet as ever. He had not lost her. Maybe things would be alright.<br>\r\n\"But your Uncle Ricky did lose his car, it's a real shame, there wasn't even tire tracks of it. And then, there's the Reddington's Super Market ... I don't know if I believe it, but it seems that the whole place just went away. Can you believe it? Without a single trace? Ha Ha. I think one of those magicians on television might be around here. ha Ha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent was less pleased with this information. Whole places just disappearing? It sounded like what Lisa had been talking about. He looked over at her to see her still working at those helmets. The helmets! That green light! He was glad she hadn't gotten hit by that. Damn, I wish I was down there. helping out mom. I can't believe I'm here in ... this old city with nobody. Lisa's not family. I barely know her. Not like I know mama. God. But, she was so damn far away! It would take hours to see her by plane! I really hoped she'd be ok. I prayed, I believed that she would be ok. Nothing can harm her as long as she stays inside. We'll just both wait it out. Yeah. Then we can go meet each other when all of this whole mess just blows over. Sure, the other's might be dead. Sucks for them. But Mom, and hopefully dad; Uncle Ricky. If they're ok, then it will be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, just ... stay inside. And, uh, buy lots of Diamond Like ... uh...\" What the hell was that stuff called? \"Lisa ... what was..\"<br>\r\n\"Carbon!\" She said, not even pulling herself away from the project.<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah, Carbon. Just buy it and put it around your...\" Oh god. Listen to myself. I sound like a damn fool. This must've been how Lisa felt when she told me about all that crap. God, why was this crap actually happening? It didn't make any sense!<br>\r\n\"What? ... What are you talking about, Trent? What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"It's ... It's just something you'll need to have so that...\"<br>\r\n\"Trent, hold on one second, baby..\" Trent waited, but could perfectly well what his mother was saying on the other line.<br>\r\n\"...blue? What do you mean blue? Like a light or something..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when Trent's eyeballs went wide and extreme, and tense fear popped right into him. He could care less about those suckers in Hong Kong and everywhere else... but this was HIS MOTHER for God's sake! And it didn't sound good at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! What the hell should my mom do?!\" Trent asked out of instinctive fear.<br>\r\n\"Why, what's going on?\" Lisa spoke like a mouse, finally stopping her task for a moment. Her eyes were wide with confusion.<br>\r\n\"The blue! The mother f***** blue ****'s coming at her! What the ****'s she gonna do?!\"<br>\r\n\"I ... I..\" Lisa was stumbling. She was hesitating those dreadfully painful words for as long as she could. But Trent had no time for stumbling. He needed an answer now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lis', gimme an answer! She's gonna ****in' die!!!\"<br>\r\n\"I .. I don't know. I can't tell..\" But Trent couldn't even let her finish. He couldn't handle that! He screeched into the phone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma! Get the **** out of their, now! Get out of the blue!\"<br>\r\n\"Trent Lee Davies, watch your mo...\"<br>\r\n\"Ma! Pleease! Just get out now! Get out of the blue!\"<br>\r\n\"Trent, what's wrong with you? Why are you...\"<br>\r\n\"The blue kills mom! I've seen it! Get out!\"<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n\"The world's ending mom! Now get out!\"<br>\r\n\".....\" There was no answer. The phone was dead. she was gone. His mother was gone. ............ ****!!!!!! ****!!!!!!!! Trent was mad. He began kicking in the wall, thrashing the ****in' thing! It's over! It's over! It's all ****in' over! The world was over ... Mom's gone... dad's probably gonna be gone soon. I'm next. We'll all be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent ... Trent ... calm, down.\"<br>\r\n\"No! What the ****'s the point! We're all gonna ****in' die! Just like my mother, just like me, just like you!\" Trent cut deep into Lisa. She leapt back away from Trent, who no longer yelled, but sat on the floor crying about the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Trent!\" Lisa raised her voice slightly, shaking in fear of him and the truth. \"Trent, your mom's still on the phone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? What the hell? I crawled over to the phone, off the hook, hanging about. And I picked it up, hearing the tender tears across the line. It was true. She wasn't gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Trent, baby, are you there? I'm alright, son. It was just a close call. I'm alright,  baby. Please son .... talk to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, a fire grew inside of me. I had a reason for saving her, I wanted to go down there and take her away from this hell. My dad too. Lisa too. But could I? ... Oh, damn, could I? Was this all just crap? Useless, futile junk? Was it possible to save them?</span></div></div>",

I glared over at Lisa, who'd turned her face away from me as soon as I looked up. I knew she was watching me. Well, I ain't a monster. I'm just ... not stupid. Any man who would say yes was just an optimistic fool. Over the years I had seen great men fall - and the only ones who survived only did so by thinking firstly of themselves. If I died, how the hell would I be able to save her? I wouldn't. Besides, she's a grown woman. So's my uncle. They didn't need me. We survived on our own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Trent, baby, please, tell me what's wrong? I know we don't know what's going on, but if you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma', just make sure that you stay clear from those lights, and take care of yourselves. Don't worry about me. I'll live. Just take care of yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent, honey? If you're in trouble I can...\" Silence. She stopped. We both knew didn't we? From the damn start I think the whole planet knew when the end would happen. We just didn't believe it. We expected a huge triumph in the end. A magical conclusion that put everything into perfectly working order. But what we get is this - absolute confusion. Damn. If I wasn't so reasonable I'd be pretty pissed about now. Heck, why not? I'm damn pissed. How could this be the end? I mean, I know about the aliens, the blue and green, the fusing ****; but it was still too dumb. This wasn't the end. Not for me. I dare you, you *******s! I dare you to end it now! Now? No. As long as I have blood pumping through these veins I'm gonna fight. The Earth's one thing. My family, my life's another. Standing here waiting, HIDING?!!! Mom could, should do that. But not me! I gazed at Lisa who kept on working and I grinned. There she was working away. And here I was acting like a ****in' pansy! I'm Trent Davies, baby. Hear me roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I love you. Take care. I'll see you when this's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere went the phone. Talking time's over, let the action begin to flood this ****!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent walked towards the door, but Lisa ran up to him before he opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent, wait!\"<br>\r\n\"Not now, I'm going out!\"<br>\r\n\"But, Trent, there could still be green light. Here. Put on the helmet... It's finished I think. Should work, I think. Check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrummy rusty old metal on a crappy looking bike helmet or some ****. It wasn't my style. I felt like I didn't need it; I was ****in' invincible right about now. And I didn't need this **** to slow me down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thanks. I'll stop 'em, before it happens again...\"<br>\r\n\"What?! Don't be stupid Trent, the next blast's bound to be any moment now.\" She checked that old watch of hers. \"You gotta put it on.\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Still no arguing with some people. Eh. To each his own I suppose. But I take back what I've said about her - I might need her now, but I'd never even be friends with this nutjob, bossy *****. Good intentions or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... wait! Where are you going anyways? Don't you know the world's going mad outside? The aliens are probably...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well ... I need a few things. A gun, some smokes, whatever else I think of while driving down there..\"<br>\r\n\"A gun? Why? I don't think it could even hurt them. I mean, I' ve seen...\"<br>\r\n\"I need it for protection. I'll be back soon. Just chill out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there I went. First time I broke free. Sorry Lis', but you don't know everything. But the place does look a bit ****. ****, fires, yelling, cars abandoned on the roads. Oh well, I guess you'll just have to get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy baby; she's still here. I open her up and cruise on down to the closest gun shop around; and in these parts, most ain't too far. Turn the corner and there's only a few more blocks until... ****! There he is. Just like mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there, on the grungy sidewalk, captivating all the local gawkers and pedestrians is a body of a young man. It's not technically a body, but a living breathing human being. There is no blood. But there are muffled screaming coming from his mouth. The on-lookers are horrified; some run away yelling in panic and frenzy, others stay frozen transfixed at the spot like statues. All clustered around the man with a pole stuck straight through him. His mouth open screaming, you can see the metal right from inside him. His eyes are rolled back and no one truly knows how this could happen, or what to do. A woman near him, crying, holding his shaking arm tight, streams rushing down her face, crying out to anyone who can listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please god, can anyone help?! Please?! He's dying here! He's dying!!! Pleeeease.... oh god, Roger; No, hang in there. Just keep..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent parked there on the side, gawking and unsure what to do. Should he help? How the hell could he though? Look at him, the man's a freak. He doesn't look like he could even be helped. I mean, what the **** does that? I should just keep on driving. Drive to the store and get a gun so that doesn't happen to me. The poor sucker's a goner, ain't he? Let's just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police!! Anybody!! What's wrong with you all! Pleeease!! He is dying!!!!!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And with that, I just kept on driving into the distance, trying not to think about what can happen. Only thinking about when this will all be over. About these damn aliens getting what they deserve. Yeah, that's my best bet. I quickly glanced back at what became of this poor dude, and knew that that wasn't gonna be me. Naw, man. I'd do better, yeah. Of course, I'd do better. And with that last thought of hope, and blind belief, the only things going for Trent stuck in a mad world where nothing seemed real, he moved on to the Gun Shop. Help oneself, then help others, I always say. Can't be taken advantage of, now can I? Learned that from my old man. I wonder how the poor bas.... Gun Shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very quick drive up from there. And by the looks of it, it wasn't closed. Many other shops down the street were, Chummy's Bar and Grill, KepCo, all the chains were abandoned by their workers. But that only made sense. I mean, what kind of a nut, some workaholic maniac, would go down with their ship? Especially when it's only a job. I mean, as dedicated as I am, no department store is worth my own life. But, this guy was still here - with his guns. Somehow, it felt good to see someone doing this; sucked for him, but it really did feel good to have someone helping you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I walked in the shop, however, I could only hear loud ferocious yelling, bitching, complaining, whining. To me, I was taken back to one of the 50% off sales at Plemenbrooks', on some kind of... hat, or pants. I laughed at this connection, but then walking over to the counter, I noticed the severity of the issue (damn right I know that word, learned it in college). There he was, some old store owner, probably owned it all his life or something, and he had this real dilemma with the boys who were at his store. They wanted free stuff, so that they wouldn't be killed by the weird *** aliens out there, because clearly they didn't have, or really didn't care about, giving him the right compensation for his goods. While he, like every other store owner, had no recollection of something such as \"free\" and didn't care whose head it was that came off, as long as these freeloading *******s left his place immediately.  Now, where did I stand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, hell, first and foremost..... I wanted my ****in' gun, and wanted to get the **** out of this dump and back to my place. And I didn't wanna be killed by the time I ****in' got there neither. But of course, me being the sympathetic genius I am, also felt something for the old man. I mean, sure he reminded me of that old fool in the mall, and it would mean that I would actually have to pay for my stuff, but I could sorta relate to the poor *******. I mean, I'd never give some freeloading suckers all of my **** just because they wanted it. Even in a crisis there was a time for everything. This was the time for these suckers to pay up. The old dude knew that and no matter how hard they pushed, kept his ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I looked at the other guys, these freeloading robbers, and I also saw a little bit of myself in them. Obviously not the way they smelled, looked, dressed... but the real passion to survive. Now here were these guys that could see that life wasn't over, nor was it just like every other day. They knew that they had to do something, and so, like myself, went to their local gun shop to get some ammo, baby, and take care of these threats like real men! You gotta love the strength of the spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on old ****! Give us the ****ing guns, else we'll have ta take 'em from ya!\"<br>\r\n\"Hell no! Y'all jus', jus' stay back, stay back! You have any money?! You pay up and I'll give you the guns!\"<br>\r\n\"**** that! You raised the prices on us!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm running out, I need to raise prices...\" not even listening to his reasons, the crowd, or should I say mob, groaned and paced like hungry hyenas toward this limp wounded gopher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I am blabbing on and on about this and that! **** it! I need a gun, and a plan! It's real simple. Obviously there's gonna be a fight here....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can just take 'em for ourselves!\" Yelled a man in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that's the cue I believe. Right, old man, protecting the civilized society and man's monetary interests, or the mob, getting things done fast but rough and not giving a flying **** about the other poor *******s that they hurt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, well, here's my ****in' choice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was just as angry as ever, probably more so since I'd joined the fight. Poor guy was clearly outnumbered, but hey, I swear that I would not hurt him, or let them hurt him in any way.

I gazed over toward him, him holding tightly a couple of pistols ready and aimed to fire, and well, I didn't cower. That was sure. But maybe, I was a bit put back. You know, from the surprise of it all.

Yeah, I guess I could live with that. No problem, pal, I grinned up at the slimy  grizzly and then looked forward at the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****! He had a shotgun! A****in' shotgun right there! How the ****, why didn't I notice that before?! It was aimed at the poor ******* to my right. Good luck with that. I walked a bit to  my left, and looked over at my \"group\". There were two men, the ringleader, and a smaller more grumpy young man, with guns, a pair of pistols and an uzi respectively. The rest of us had either a close range bat or broom or something, or were completely unarmed. It didn't really look all that fair, even though we had a bunch of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was almost ready to back out completely, and try another shop when the ringleader yelled out amongst us,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrestle 'im down and take his weapon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe, or should I say they, went forth over the little counter and jumped the little old man, even with his shotgun he was no match for their brute strength. Only three shots were fired. All by the shotgun. One was unsteady and hit right through the window behind the mob, the other actually hit the shoulder of a big angry fellow, who stopped for a few seconds but then picked himself back up like an undead monster and continued on, and the final one was shot up at the ceiling when they had gotten the situation under control. They took the shotgun away and knocked the guy out. It was the man with a wounded elbow who did a few unnecessary kicks of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad, not to have been involved, but then snuck up from the side to the hustle and bustle of the crowd behind the counter. I had my eyes on a fine and powerful revolver, or maybe the automatic sitting there, but was stopped by the big guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't you touch that ****!\"<br>\r\n\"What?! But I'm apart of the team!\"<br>\r\n\"No you're not ****head! You cowered in the corner.\" I did not. I merely watched, not like I was .... shaking or anything.<br>\r\n\"Well, come on man. Let me have something! It's a death trap out there...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well maybe you shoulda...\"<br>\r\n\"I saw a man fused to a ****in' pole! ... If I don't get anything.. I could die...\"<br>\r\n\"....Alright alright, give the baby his bottle and shut 'im up!... We got more than enough anyways... only take one though.\" Yelled the ringleader. I got a rifle, heavy. Not fast, but pretty damn good. I got a few rounds, and waited for my turn to leave the place, after all the others rushed for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I was outside again, already forgetting about the old man on the ground. That is, until I heard the police sirens blaring in our direction. A couple of guys ran away afraid, a couple kept moving slowly in their own direction. Others hid. I? Well, I ran of course. Only an idiot would walk, I didn't want to get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran from the sirens until I tripped over some damn thing on the road. I didn't know what it was, but it was probably like a piece of concrete or trash or something. But then I didn't care anymore, because I could see a light shining down upon me. It wasn't a cop's light, or a flashlight. No, it was coming right at me, like all around me. And I knew it was one of the alien lights. But I couldn't tell it's color. It had a tinge of blue I think, but I could only see it for a few seconds. What if it was blue, well then I'd better get out of the way. But what if it was just green? Well, then I'd be ok, and so I guess jumping out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I felt my head. And noticed that it was gone. Lying alongside me was the helmet. Must've come off when I fell. So here it was, either it was a green light - in which case I would need the helmet, and didn't have to move, or it was a blue light and all I would need to do was get the heck out of the way. Great. I looked back a second but it was really close now, so I just took action without knowing and relied on instinct and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wait was painful, not long, but terrifying in Trent's opinion. To him it felt like hours of waiting, not sure whether he'll be transported or merged or stay exactly where he was. The image of the man stuck to the pole kept flashing through his mind. He thought of himself stuck to it, trying to call out for help, of any kind, but only get odd looks from passerby. What a death, what an awful way to go - helpless, unfinished, unready. What could they say of a man like Trent Davies? He was a damn fine man, a great salesman, a true lover. But incomplete. An unfinished masterpiece. He hoped not. *Stomp* *stomp* *Stomp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from his covered eyes he saw hundreds of people converging in the middle of the streets; flowing to a central point - most carrying a weapon, a gun sometimes but mostly a small knife or a heavy steel bar. He saw the big guy from the gun shop walking slowly onwards with the crowd. They all looked like a marching procession. The crowd was formed of, in Trent's words, the foxiest ladies, to the toughest mugs, to the dog ugly shoppers, to even the little kids who once played about the streets. All ready and armed for battle with something that Trent had no understanding of. A second ago they just wanted to leave, and now they were prancing down the streets ready to risk their lives - and for what? The extinction of the human race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the looks of it, the green beam had hit them all, attacked their minds, influenced them as badly as a smooth negotiator could. Thank god, I chose the right one. He felt his helmet, and thought of Lisa. Thanks, Lis'. But then he moved as quick as lightning, amongst the shadows of the street, following the crowd closely to see what they intended. He could see the dazed looks that to him translated as murderous glints and didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're probably gonna go kill everyone, or themselves, or something, and I don't want to be here to find out. But damn, how many people are here? Millions man, because they all didn't know. These ****in' aliens really know how to get them. And hell, I guess you could say that they basically won, can't you? I mean, they can just tell you exactly what to do and you go out and do it. ****, how many people I wonder didn't get hypnotized? A dozen, a few hundred maybe. A low number. Now, just think of the world now, all turning against itself - the aliens won. Basically. And there's nothing we can do....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he thought about the helmet. He remembered the old man in the store and how it had brought him back. How he had, apparently, been in a green coma as well, and Lisa even. It sounded like there was never really an end with the helmet. Looking at it, he realized how he could use it to try and even up the numbers. Imagine if everyone knew about the.. uh, DLC... then there'd be less of these marching Nazis everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLe'me think. This was a major crossroad for Trent, even if he didn't realize it. Throughout all of his \"adventures\" so far, he'd been pretty selfish. Not helping out that pole guy, running past everyone in need, taking those guns with force. But now, he had something that could help, he could help save the damn planet! He'd be a hero, wouldn't he? Savior of the Earth. I like the sound of that. But what about them? Would they like it? Would they kill him? Those eyes don't lie..... But Lisa would be happy. It would be something she would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent felt a deep thumping in his chest as he walked over to one of these walking zombies, a middle aged thin man who looked like someone's father, carrying a pistol, and picked up the helmet. It was difficult to keep it steady with his head when he kept moving  like that, but Trent did his best to keep steady. His hands were shaking like constant turbulence and he was still unsure if this seemed like the smartest plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was placing it close to his cranium, he swore that the man swerved his head a little and glared straight into Trent's eyes. He also swore that if he hadn't done what he was just about to do then he would probably have been shot right there. Wake up from this whole nightmare dead. But, with a burning fire in his chest, Trent.....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a quick flick of his wrist the helmet slid over the man's head, instantly clearing the green control over his mind. Trent stared into the depths of his eyes and found a person staring back, not just a hollow space. His eyes became wider, as his expression became that of anger and disgust. An odd expression, for that of someone whose life had just been saved. The man eyed Trent and then leaped back, bumping into a marching soldier of the streets. Looking around at all of the people, he was horrified and enraged, and could only focus all of his hatred on the one person he saw. Unfortunately, Trent seemed to be the only other person unharmed, in full control of his mind and it seemed to the man that he must have had control over the army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the side of the still marching procession, stood two men, locked in stares. Trent's one of defense and confusion, unsure what this guy's up to. The same almost goes for the other man, however he doesn't even think of the idea that his \"opponent\" might be good. He waits for it. Waits for Trent to drop his guard so that he can reach for his pistol and aim it right at him. He had never done this sort of thing before, and hoped that he wouldn't have to do so again. He felt like a hero, the only one able to fight against this mad maniac. The fierce hatred and passion was building up so much that if he didn't find some sort of an outlet from which to remove it, he would surely explode. The man opened his clenched jaw, and a screech echoed out. Trent became more tense and glared back at him harder. The man, tried again, and this time spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... who the hell are you? The ringleader of this operation?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this sentence Trent almost burst out laughing. But instead shook his head and continued eying the man. Knowing now that he knew even less than himself, and apparently thought him to be some sort of an evil genius. Genius, naturally; evil, hardly. The man was still tense however and was really reaching straight for that gun. Any wrong move or phrase could set him off like a firecracker. So Trent reassessed the situation, and just like at his job, tried to figure out the best way to speak with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...N.No. I'm not anything like that... I'm like you...\"<br>\r\n\"Ha! Liar! You ain't nothing like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how the hell did he know that? Trent wondered. Great, the man's real agitated. Which means it's gonna be pretty hard to convince him to behave rationally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Look, I'm not a psycho, or some madman, I'm just a ****in' salesman,\"<br>\r\n\"Ha! Salesman are the slime of the Earth. Well, you can't sweet talk me you killer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****. It's be easier to deal with a butcher as a pig than this guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a job,sir. I need it to pay the bills. Like we all do. Now, let's be cool about this. Neither one of us wants to get hurt,\"<br>\r\n\"I want you to. I want you to die like the rest of these alien scum.\"<br>\r\n\"Alien?! Do I look like an alien?!!\"<br>\r\n\"You ... you probably took human form; just like the ******* that ate my daughter!\"<br>\r\n\"...Look, I'm real sorry about your daughter,\"<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT HER!!!\"<br>\r\n\"... But I'm a human.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what's the thing on your head for... Human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was talking about my helmet. Fool. That's what got him out of this mess in the first place. But of course, maybe if I could show him that I helped him, and can help all the rest. Then maybe he'll calm the **** down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.... this is my helmet,\"<br>\r\n\"To breath in the Earth's atmosphere?!\"<br>\r\n\"No! This is the only reason I'm not walking around like them,\" I pointed to the hoard of zombies that still kept flowing in from every part of the city.<br>\r\n\"What, does it control them?\"<br>\r\n\"No. It blocks the ALIEN'S rays. The rays that control your mind.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about. You're an alien!\"<br>\r\n\"No I'm not! I'm one of the few lucky people that know how to defend themselves against these creatures and their weapons. This has a special metal in it - DLC- that can reflect the waves. Bounce 'em back. That's what I did to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was surprised by this, and slowly raised his hand to feel his head, wondering if he was alright. Probably worrying about some brain slug. And of course, given the right amount of time, Trent quickly, and in a nervous sweat, grabbed his rifle from behind his back and pointed it at the man. Trent was shaking, because he didn't know what this guy was capable of. He was expecting to be shot right then and there.<br>\r\nBut the man didn't do anything. He simply glared at him with beady little eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't want to hurt you. I want you to put the gun down, and I'll show you that I'm not an alien, and that I'm a friend.... Is that cool?\"<br>\r\nThe man continued glaring, not saying a single word.<br>\r\n\"Is that cool?\"<br>\r\n\".......I'm not going to shoot you. But I ain't putting my gun down, neither. You can do what you say, but I want to be able to kill your ****in' alien *** if you **** with another human in front of me.... now, is that cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis guy was real sure of himself, reminded me of myself, but he wasn't me because he was dangerous. But I suppose, I had nothing else to do. I didn't want either us to get killed. So I relied on this nut job to make the right choice. Of course, I was still shaking. Knowing that my entire life, and probably many others relied on some crazy old guy like him. I felt bad for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around towards the people that were walking forward into the nothingness of their campaigns. Like zombies. I stood right in front of one, a young man, greasy, long haired, carrying a small, what was that a butter knife? Well, at least he couldn't hurt me too bad. I placed the helmet over his head and once again, he stopped for a seconds and then looked at us both, then all around him, with huge horrified eyes. He looked like he wanted to say something, but kept closing his mouth without a word. The other man came forward and began inspecting him, his eyes, his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Yeah, he seems ok, I guess.\" He looked towards me and although not smiling, didn't exactly look like he hated my guts either, \"I suppose this thing works... I don't know who you really are, but as long as you stay on our side, I think we won't have any troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man snatched the helmet from me, and begin admiring every little detail about it. Many I probably didn't see, cuz I really didn't care. As long as it got the job done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you call it again?\"<br>\r\n\"It's made out of Diamond Like Carbon.\"<br>\r\n\"Ahh, yeah. That was it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was waiting for him to finish and give it back, when the little guy who I just saved grabbed the damn thing and ran off like a mischievous little chimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the **** do you think you're doing?!\" I yelled out, but that little ******* kept on going past all of the zombies into the distance. I grumbled in anger and then began to run after the little idiot when the other guy I saved said something,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why're you running into all of those creatures for?\"<br>\r\n\".....cuz he just stole my helmet!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but can't you just make another... from that carbon stuff?\"<br>\r\n\"....Well, yeah... but it'd be a little hard to find it... I'd rather just get it back...\"<br>\r\n\"But it's dangerous out there.... I think it'd be safer not to go after him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" I paused and thought about it, trying to put aside my anger at that little ungrateful... I thought about the pros and cons, really quickly might I add. And then came to a certain conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ignoring his warnings, which really seem pretty useless to him, Trent runs into the crowd, as they crawl along. How could his warning even mean anything? A few seconds ago he was ready to shoot me, thinking I'm a psychopathic engineer. Naw, he seems too damn paranoid, and besides, Lisa made the helmet for me, so that I wouldn't end up like all of these zombies, I couldn't just let some idiot take it from me. What would I say when I saw her again? Uh, oops, some jerk took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed past the marchers, making sure not to come too close to them or their many sharp weapons. I looked all around for that son of a ***** that had my helmet. I kept thinking about what would happen if another blast of green came my way. Hell, it's the only thing I thought about. It kept me going past all those streets, not giving up even when I couldn't even see the little figure running down the street. But it didn't take that long to find him. He wasn't the most stealthy person in the world, even though I had to admit that he was damn fast. I snuck down low, so that I didn't scare him away, and waited to get close enough to grab it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man with the helmet was holding onto it for dear life as he tried to keep up with an older woman, carrying a ****in' rifle, as she marched forward with the group. He was saying something to her, his voice squeaky, shaking and shivering as he tried yelling and pleading with the woman. It certainly was an odd sight to see, but I continued following them, listening to this little conversation, or should I say monologue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please? Come on! .... Ma'! Ma'! I know you ain't like the rest of these guys! Please, just talk to me!!\" He stopped for a second, pouting and thinking out loud in deep anguish, \" What the **** is goin' on to all these people?! Why're they all like this!?!\" Then he went straight back to talking at the woman, who I could only assume, was his mother, \"Ok. I know I made some mistakes in the past .... but... I got this!\" The little ******* showed her my helmet, but that did nothing to changer her, of course. I could have told him what would , but I guess I really wasn't focusing on what he was saying. \"Nothing? Well, what the ****'s this thing good for then anyways?!  Come on Ma', just snap out of it!\" He yelled at her while lunging forward and shaking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was crying like a little kid. This was when I came up from behind the two and began to talk with him; the helmet was between the two, and unlike him I wasn't so stupid that I'd interfere with whatever the **** these things think they have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, give me back my helmet,\" I told the young guy. But to my surprise he, damn quick, like lightning I swear, grabbed his mother's rifle and pointed it at me in a second. The mother hadn't continued marching even though he was no longer constricting her. She just stood there watching the guy with those same vacant yet dangerous eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ....I... It's mine now, ok? I got it.\" He was saying this in the same way a child would tell you that that little shiny thing he found was \"his\". The damn fool probably didn't even  know what it did.<br>\r\n\"Do you know what it is?\" There was a pause, of course. Like I expected.<br>\r\n\"....I...No, I I don't. But, it's mine!\" He said, trying to seem really forceful. But he didn't scare me, even with the rifle in his hands. Even now I was thinking of a way to get it back.<br>\r\n\"That there's a helmet made from Diamond Like Carbon..\"<br>\r\n\"I don't give a **** what it is! You're not getting it back!\" He screamed out, pointing that damn rifle too damn close to comfort for my poor face. I wanted to stop this foolish mess and just get it back. Every little blathering second he spoke was time wasting for me.<br>\r\nBut as he blathered on, I saw the eyes of his mom. She looked angry. At first I thought it was trickery in the lights, but I looked again and saw that it wasn't. She turned around as her son was poking me with the rifle, conjuring up childlike insults, and pointing out towards a couple of guys just passing by. They stared at each other a while, and then they all turned around, walking towards us, weapons raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at the young guy, rambling on, not taking notice of what was going on around him. Well, I wasn't gonna be like him.<br>\r\n\"Hey, genius! Look what's going on behind you!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not falling for that! What do you think I am, stupid!\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm serious. It's your mother.\" He glared even harder at my comment.<br>\r\n\"You stupid *******, how dare you talk...\" But of course, this must've been the time that he realized that his mom was no longer at his side. He looked over his shoulder only to see the crushing blow of two heavy bats. The group, along with his own mother, was beating him down to the ground. I stepped back, seeing the revolver in another member's hand. They beat him down and he looked up in fear, horror, crying at this injustice. I actually felt sorry for the little gremlin. His own family. It was harsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter beating him badly, they took the rifle back and his mom's eyes went back to vacant, as she and the others marched on. Her son was bleeding, weeping down on the floor, still holding my helmet. Grabbing the helmet as though it was the last relic from an older world, that if he let go, his old life would disappear. Of course, I knew the truth. The poor son of a *****'s old life, just like mine and Lisa's, was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to him, and he didn't seem to notice. Stuck in his own bad memories. Well that'd be fine if I couldn't do anything, but I can, and have no time to waste. He can die if he wants, but he ain't killing me along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man, sorry about your mom and all...\" He doesn't move, only quivers a little. \"But, their minds are being controlled man. You gotta undertstand that it wasn't your mom who hurt you...\" He squirmed, \"It was those freaky *** alien *****es controlling her and all the others....Man, do you understand that?\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you here? Haven't I been tortured enough? Can't you all just leave me alone?\"<br>\r\nThe idiot probably didn't hear a single word I said. Too damn busy pitying himself.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I will. Just give me my helmet back...\" He turned away, hiding MY helmet.<br>\r\n\"No!! I need this! It's the only thing I have left!\"<br>\r\n\"But, you don't even know what it does!\"<br>\r\n\"So? It... It's all I have! Can't you leave me that much?!\"<br>\r\n\"Wel..... no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he sprang back into action, even while he was still bleeding from his lip. He sat back up and began to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Please, I beg of you! Spare this! Pleeeease! ...*Sob* I need it to live! *Sob* I.. I... I'll give you this..\" He showed me a large brassy metallic ball with deep indent marks on it's side, \"if you just leave me with this thing. Please! PLEASE I NEED IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was crying so damn loud it was annoying. He didn't need it and was just acting like a baby. But, the guy did need something. Maybe I could tell him what to do, how to survive. That would be better than giving him a trinket that he can't even use, wouldn't it?  But looking at his sad self, I, well I suppose I'm just too damn compassionate sometimes. Still, something had to be done, didn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so? Can I have it?\" He asked, wide eyed, clutching the helmet with all he had left, sniveling. And I said,</span></div></div>",

Mumbling something, his hands still in the same position that they were in even without the helmet. He looked frozen; the poor guy had lost it all together. But I had to get it back, and looking at the helmet - still in pretty good condition - I felt proud of its recovery. Knowing that my damn conscience would never let me live this down if I didn't do something, I knelt down before the guy, and tried to console him out of his catatonic state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, man, you, you still got that old metal ball-thingy,\" I spoke softly to him, but he kept staring ahead into space. I grabbed the metal orb, still cautious of what he might do, and held it in front of his gazing eyes. He didn't seem to notice it. I moved it around a couple of times to try and familiarize him with it, but I eventually had to just put it into his limp grasp, so that he could keep it, the day that he actually woke up from his coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I. Yeah, I took this from you, but,\" His ears and eyes perked up like a dog, as he stared at my face with anticipation,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna give it back?\" He almost drooled.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no,\" he slouched back down into his careless statue, \"But, I'm gonna give you something even more important than some crazy metal trinket. I'm gonna give you information. Huh, some knowledge. That'll be my gift to you.\"<br>\r\n\".....\" He groaned in anger, looking down at the beat in little brassy orb.<br>\r\n\"This helmet, it isn't just a toy.\" He watched carefully like a rabid dog hungry for the meat I was describing, \"It's a tool that I use to cover my brain, my head, from the green waves that the aliens send out. These green waves usurp your mind and tell you what to do. That's why I need this.\" He didn't care, of course. \"It's not special, it's just a damn helmet with some Diamond Like Carbon welded or something onto it. You can get some of it from an old engine depot, or wherever.\" He still didn't care, so I nudged in closer, being careful that he didn't bite off my eye,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DLC or Diamond Like Carbon, that's what can stop the daze these people are under! You just get any, any at all, and put it over someone's head, and they turn back to normal - like I did with you!\"<br>\r\nThe idiot still didn't seem to care, not even at this ****in' important as hell fact! What kind of an idiot wouldn't care about... I was mad at the laziness of this *******! So I yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the **** is wrong with you?! Can't you hear any of this?!\"<br>\r\n\"Only too well!\" He yelled right back at me. I braced myself, controlling the rage.<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you do anything?! This stuff can help save your mom's life! You can go get some and just ... wave it over her head, then poof, she's back! You live happily ever after! Can't you ****in' see that?!\" The guy was shaking, in rage or fear, or tears, I didn't know, hell could've been a combination of all three. There was a pause, where he didn't say a word. Then he slowly said something in his high-pitched tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe a damn word your spewing out. Just leave me alone you thieving *******!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it; looking at him, all sad and pathetic, I couldn't care less. So what if he died, so what if the aliens controlled him again; at least they'd get him to do something! I wanted to just leave right now, hell right when I met the dumb ****er! But my stupid conscience was still there, telling me that I should try and help. Well sometimes you can't help people like this one. He just sits there and tries so damn desperately to get his way. But I tell you what, this isn't going to be his day! Sure, I feel a bit guilty for not helping, but I at least tried to help! He had to do the rest for himself. Staring into his disgusting, twisted little eyes I could see the weakness, the sloth, the stupidity, and then I felt little remorse. Whatever the idiot wanted to do was his own doing. I didn't do anything to cause this mess, all I ****in' did was help him out! So I turned around, hoping to never see his little face again, saying one final word before I left,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Have it your way.\" I tried hard to forget about him as I walked back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on my helmet and walked around the crowds of people, still as possessed as they were the last time I walked by, but this time they were all still. Still as statues, all staring up, looking straight up into the sky. I looked up for a few seconds with them, but only seeing dark blue, I continued the walk back to my car. I wanted more than ever just to get back home, where Lisa was, where it might be just a little ****in' safer than here. I found my car, but the damn window had been broken into and the alarm was going off; I looked around quickly hoping that these alien *******s weren't trying to stop me from going home. But just as I spun around I saw the older guy, the father, the first man I had saved from this crowd, lying on the floor bleeding, almost knocked out. Across from him was a young woman, an older woman, and a young boy all standing together like 3/4ths  of a loving family, or in this case a real ****ed up one. The older woman had a bloody pistol and knife, and a deep bruise on her forehead. I walked over to the father and laughed a bit at his bloody palm,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't resist stealing my ride, could you?\"<br>\r\n\"...my own little girl, and my young champ... and Julia...\" the poor guy cried out, weakly. I shook my head, and then deciding that whatever they were about to do it had to be big, I got into my car, ready to blow this pop stand. God how I wanted to leave here. Forever. Never come back to this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the people, they were all aiming upwards, even the ones with bats and knives, began shooting and throwing and making futile upwards swinging motions like one huge blast had just been shot from every single one of them in unison. It was so ****in' loud out here. Shotguns, pistols, even some ****in' grenades were thrown up and bounced back down, spraying blood everywhere. Bazookas were blowing up some dark object secretly floating up in the sky. I saw what they were all trying to hit - it looked like a UFO, all around were these blue little UFOs, and they were being, like, well I don't watch Star Wars or whatever, so I wouldn't really know the name, but they were going up to the big shadowy one. Shots were fired at the little ones too, sometimes shooting them down, and crashing them with a huge fireball at the end. The whole sky and streets were active - and all I could think about was getting the **** out of there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like there was a war, now between two aliens, fighting on planet Earth, using our home planet as their battlefield, and our people as their pawns. Needless to say, I started my engines and was ready to go when I realized that these shooting *******s were in my way! I thought about waiting for them to move, but it didn't sound like they would leave anyways, so I tried the old tried and true method for situations like these,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ********! Move, will ya!  You're blocking the ****in' road!\" Of course, I should have known that this wouldn't work with these guys. I tried honking my horn a couple of times, but still no movement at all. They were really focused on what they were told to do. So, I figured I could do either, say, three things. One, was I could wait, wait for them to finish with their little shootout, and wait for possibly total annihilation and for some big chunk of spaceship to fly on down here and crush me and my car into pancakes. Yeah, no, not happening. The next thing was that I could just drive on through the crowd, running over these freaks, and hoping that I could get away with damaging them that much. Of course there were a hell of a lot of them, and it might mean really crunching up my car, plus they had guns, and they might shoot my head in as I cruised on by. Of course, there was always the hope that they would be so ****in' focused that they would still be trying to destroy the spaceship long after I plowed into them, and hell, wouldn't that mean less evil alien pawns? But, it would also be excessive manslaughter of the poor innocent *******s that I ran over. The last option then? To walk, without a car, back home. It wasn't that far, and might be pretty safe. The safest way at least. Well, looking up and hearing those damn gunshots and explosions every five seconds isn't good for the brain, shell shock ya know? So, I think I better get out of here quick! Yeah, I think I'll just.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I got out. Left the car I'd owned for the last few years, my lovely little black vehicle, for dead, and tried to move on. I did a hell of a lot with this car, and now it was adios time, I guess. But I hoped that when these ****head aliens had done what they did, and the planet was finally normal, if the planet would ever be normal again, then maybe I could come back here and pick it up again. I looked back as i started walking at first slowly toward my apartment, having one last glance at my car. Then I looked in front of me, looked ahead and didn't look back again until I was back at my apartment. Back home safe and sound, finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to be known as a killer, especially of innocent people, who were idiots for being overtaken by these space ****ers who came right out of left field and all, but hell, who could blame them. Only some real weirdo or smart guy could know what was going to happen here. So I ran, like I said, and saw all of the zombified civilians just shooting up, trying so hard to destroy the alien ship up there. And then I thought about what would happen if the ship wasn't alien but like from NASA. What a trip that would be. Getting our own people to kill our own. That would be the ultimate irony. One that would be too obnoxious to me. I kept thinking about stuff like this as I ran home, out of breath and a bit tired, but one glance around only fueled me to continue on until I was home. And unfortunately I couldn't filter out the stupid thoughts from cropping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I passed this old torn up, fiery billboard that had probably gotten hit from some explosive side blast or something, I could only think bad things. Real screwed up things that I shouldn't have been thinking of. The billboard was of a little family, a mom, a dad, kids, a granny, the whole works. But I thought of my ma', and that little weasel guy's ma'. I then thought about what if my mom was like that, all hypnotized, not caring about me no more; beating me up? ****. I couldn't shake the thought, and, I guess I almost got a tear in my eye, but shook the ******* loose, and just continued on. Thinking of Lisa, smiling in her cute, short, skimpy little dress, about my mom, my real mom, and dad, in the same room, safe. And the drinks and food was just flowing. Ha, take that you stupid thoughts! I got this to look forward to! The real future! What WILL happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued running I could hear these large engines up above, and I looked up for a moment to see the crafts, the small ones, the large ones, just tearing off. The firing was still going on down here, and they looked like they were leaving. Going home? I sort of breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that, and wondered if at least one damn alien race had won. Were the humans free, or would they have to serve this one now? I didn't know what to make of this \"victory\", but I hoped that it was the beginning of the end of all of this mess. I had hoped that the next step was to let all of these humans turn back, and live normal lives again. If only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the street I lived on, I could see a, like a sea, sort of, in front of it and surrounding it. There was this one like black hole in the middle that seemed to spew out all of this blue stuff. This - well, hell, as I went closer I could tell what it was. Blue light. All around my street. Near my home, near my neighbor Miguel, near the old guy who sold half off turkey around the holidays. All here. I stopped dead here, tried to recover my breath and take in what this would mean. Blue light. The crap that distorted time and space. Stuff that probably did the job on the pole guy. I looked at my apartment, and sure enough it had engulfed it a bit. Strangely, not the bottom, but the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran past the blue deposits towards my apartment building, looking up to the top. I waited here a while, trying to think of what to do. But that's when I thought of Lisa. She was in there! Might even be gone now. I shuddered at her head stuck in the fridge... Damn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Hey, Lis'! Are you here?! Anywhere here?! Just say something if you can, baby! Cuz something's happening out here!\" I yelled out in hopes of her hearing it, and calling back. I yelled in hopes that she would burst out somewhere and we'd just go off, somewhere into far away into the damn sunset. But no such luck here. There wasn't an echo, or not  even a squeak. Or crumble anywhere. No damn response. Just eerie silence. I didn't want to go inside, my apartment was kinda high up, and the blue might just be there. I was fine down here, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was a nice girl, but, I didn't want to die. Not even for her. I know it may sound kinda selfish, and jerky, but ****, can't you see how going in there could just kill me? You think the man with a pole stuck in him lived such a happy life? Hell no! Love is fine, but it doesn't conquer all. And hell, I don't even think I loved her. She has a good body, and she's alright, but not good enough to die for her ***. Sorry Lisa; that's what I can and will do. I'll say sorry, and hope she's alright. I can't do much else, so stop hastling me about it. I ain't no damn hero. I'm just a guy. An unlucky ******* in hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called my parents because, right now, I was pretty much dead. The blue, the green, all of these aliens; it all seemed really close to just ending right here. On my doorstep. So I called up my mom, wanting to say one final, and hopefully quick, goodbye. But I didn't get any answer. So I tried my dad, but I also got nothing. Ain't that great? The end of the world, the real end, and you know it's here, and yet you can't say nothing to anybody. No one but yourself. Maybe the others were all dead, or zombified, or had turned into sniveling idiots like that punk who got beaten by his mom, or the dad who had tried to steal my car. No one intelligent or human anymore but me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, ma'. Goodbye dad. Goodbye Lisa....\" I whispered to myself. I was the only person worth thinking about. Yet, there was a problem there too. I know it's selfish, but what was I to do, go down with my one helmet and save everyone from certain doom, somehow get on a spaceship and divert all of this mess? Kill the aliens? With what? Where the **** were they anyways ... hiding in their ships, letting us do all the dirty work. I sat there and thought for a while. Damn, all of this mess really gave me a lot of time to think. I hated thinking, it was always so boring really. But ****, what the hell else was there to do but get my *** shot up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more good people. But me? I was good? Who the **** had I helped? No one. Who deserved it though, probably no one. But, did Lisa? She helped me didn't she? ****, where would I have been without her? Probably out there marching. I looked up into my window, trying to make out anything beyond the shutters. I have nothing to do, to live for right now. I could always kill myself doing good, couldn't I? Why the **** not? Or I could just leave, and ride this ride out 'till the bitter end. I thought about leaving, wandering to more death traps, more blue land, possibly one land free of aliens, if I was really lucky. But, would I find home elsewhere? Or was this, this rotten land plagued by the current condition of tearing apart, my home still? God. Like I said. I hate thinking so ****in' much. It screws with your head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, I guess, here goes nothing, yeah? Why the **** not. I open the door to the old apartment and looking through it at the flickering lights down the hall, and the dark shadows scattered around the place, I almost wanna just turn around and forget about the whole mess. I can't believe that a place like this, one as familiar as ever, could be so damn ominous to me. Still, I step inside and begin calling out to anyone alive enough to hear me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Lisa, if you're in here say something!\" No answer. So I kept going down through all the halls, pushing hard against the doors, trying to get some kind of a response even before I got to the fifth floor. But I didn't get a single peep out of anything there, so I went right to my place and banged on the door,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lis'! Are you in there?! Come on and say something!\" Still nothing. So I sort of sighed restlessly, but then I went around to the other doors and started pounding them down, trying them all before I gave up. But I got nothing. I looked around the hall, and noticed that a huge wave of blue was engulfing half of the hall. My room was actually right next to it and I hadn't even noticed. I jumped back, being damn sure not to touch the stuff. And then I quickly ran forward and putting my key in, tore open my door. But beyond the door was nothing - nothing at all. No floor, no ceiling, no Lisa, no nothing. My room had disappeared, unfortunately, probably with her in it. And this got me mad, and I mean really mad. I could barely think straight right then because this thing, this blob of blue, this damn color had taken Lisa away from me but not only her, but my parents and all of humanity. I was so irritated at it that I wanted to take a swing at the thing. But I didn't, of course. I mean, I was pissed, but I wasn't stupid. I just stayed there, really angry, and looking, glaring at the blue for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I saw the blue move, move closer, creeping along the walls. And it must've been continuously moving because I looked behind me and right there where the door I had gone up in was was the blue curling around it like a snake. It had closed off the whole place, caged me like a rat, probably had tricked me in here the whole damn time. And here I was standing here, helpless. I began pounding on the wall as it encircled me.  I was punching it so hard that I was making dents, or it damn well felt like I was making dents. And I saw the blue light breaking through - and with no other options, a person will do anything to survive - so I did just about the most crazy, insane thing that I could've done - I jumped straight through the window and I saw blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was disoriented for a second or so I saw a full enclosement of dark and light shades of blue swirling all around me until I went out back into the daylight, bright blinding daylight that wasn't due 'till at least a couple of hours later. I could see it brightly as I fell into a huge sea of greenish water splashing around me. I felt the searing pain of red blood against my forehead and arm, but I really didn't notice it much because I was too busy worrying about whether I had an extra arm, or if I was now going to drown somehow? Where was I? In the ocean? How did I get to here in the ocean? Drowning.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was floating around out here, trying to kick and doggy paddle or do anything that could help me stay afloat in these waves when I heard some yelling and screaming around me. As I bobbed up and down out of the ocean I could hear a short order of commands or something to that idea being shouted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are\" *splash*\"ok?\"*splash* \"\"*splash* \"you\"*splash* \"the\" *splash*\"dings?\" *splash*\"Sir\" *splash*\"you\" *Splash* \"assis?\" *Splash*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all I heard. I tried shouting back that I needed some help, that I didn't know what the **** had just happened and that I didn't know how to swim, but the damn waves kept screwing up my speech. But the rescue happened so fast, that I hardly remember what exactly happened. I remember being picked up out of nowhere, and then I was back on solid ground somewhere being asked if I could walk, and if I was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm alright.\" I told these guys, lifeguards and paramedics. I looked around me, and I could tell that I was in a beach, and probably nowhere near my city, my home. It looked like I had just been teleported. Then the idea of mutation had struck me and I started feeling around me, asking the rescue crew if I had like, an extra eye or something, and they went to go and check me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ok. Body seems fine, you're like most of the others.\" He looked sternly into my face, his eyes really weary, probably from doing this all day. \"You know, you should be glad; a lot of others didn't come out so luckily.\" The guy told me, and I damn well knew that half of what he said was right on the nose. Others weren't so lucky, but I wasn't lucky neither. I looked at him, stupid cause of the excitement, suddenly alive and well on some beach. I could only say one thing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I saw a guy stuck in a pole.\" The man looked at me and nodded, then he began to leave, but before doing so he said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're safe now, here. With all of the rest.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but where am I? What the hell happened to me? Why is it day?\"<br>\r\n\"You're in a little beach containment camp for the people in that building,\"<br>\r\nLooking at the man's finger, I could clearly see the total destruction of about half of the building I was just in. Lying like a ship wreck in the ocean. All my things were now truly gone. But what about Lisa? Had she made it out alive? He continued on,<br>\r\n\"We're here to help you guys and all of these jerks that get screwed up by the aliens. That's all we know.\" The man left. He seemed really gruff. I guess you can't blame him, but ****, he was a real *** thinking that he was like the only person going through a hard time. I was a little annoyed, but sighed and then went outside with the other guys who were teleported here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when I exited I saw all the guys on my floor, Joey, Kate, that old broad with her four snotty crying children attached to her. I guess they were alive after all, just here instead. And it wasn't so bad I guess, at least there were people who weren't hypnotized, that was refreshing at least. But what about Lisa? Where was she, she lived didn't she? Was she here? Damn. I didn't know anything, just like before, I felt like a complete idiot. Lost. But at least I had some hope now. I could at least be with others, some guys who could tell me what the **** to do. Maybe I should ask them what just happened, or the rescuers. Maybe not that tired jerk, but someone who's nice, if there is one. Or Lisa. If anyone would know, it'd probably be her. If I could just find her, then I know' I'd be home free. And with that, looking at the mess that lie in the ocean, the remains of my home, knowing that I could never go back home, I....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just bolted like lightning with a new purpose. Kinda felt a surge of energy through-out. To find out what was going on, to find Lisa. To grab her and make sure that all of this crazy blue and green **** is finally over. I run out of the camp, probably looking as crazy as I feel to the other survivors. I look back at them, at their worn and tired faces, and I know that that's probably exactly how I look too. I can't deny, no need to neither. Just now, I feel my scarred face, still trickling with blood. I make sure I'm ok, then continue on running out towards the beach as I scream out to anyone who would listen,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Liiiiiisaaa! Come on babe, where the hell are you?!\" I yelled out and ran all around the beach. There were crowds of people gathered around the beach - some looked ragged and confused like the rest of us survivors, others looked like tourists who had come to this place to point and laugh. How the hell does someone go through all of this hell, and not even get a single scratch on him? Well, I keep screaming, not paying attention to the wide eyed stares or the scowls that I'm faced with. I just keep belting out all I can muster until, finally, I hear that little voice call out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trent?!\" It's like a shrill screech in my head. I shake from the noise. But then turn around to see there, walking amongst the stupid crowd Lisa, all hot, her clothes ripped in places exposing her more lovely figure underneath, glistening with sweat from this overhot sun beating down. And here she comes, towards me. It's kinda like in those sappy movies too, where the chick and the dude rush out to meet each other, calling each other's names. Only I ain't moving. I stand perfectly still, nervous and shocked as ****, as I wait for her to just come to me. I don't know, it's weird. The moment I have nothing left to do I take action, and the time I see the only woman I've known for the last few hours, who I can ask questions, who I can confide in, I totally go limp and act like I don't give a damn. Hmmm. A curious thing. But who really cares? The main damn thing is that we at least are together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! I can't believe it's you, Trent! I thought...\" she stopped her speech. Probably because the next few words would involve me sleeping with the fishes. But for some reason me down there bloody and dead made me chuckle. I'm no masochist or nothing, but I ain't dead neither. I just smirked, put my arm around the girl, clutching her firm stomach as I said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we all thought it's the end. But... look at us here. Ha Ha. Now, babe, It's really great to see you and all. But can you tell me what the **** is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..uh..yeah.\" Her childish grin conformed back into adult apprehension as she began explaining what she, like so many of us, really understand only what they tell us. And hell, even most of that's a bunch of crap. Still, I tried to be as open-minded as I could. If what she told me was wrong, then oh well it's as good a guess as mine. But if it's right, then hell, we got us a real plan there. So I opened my ears, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..well, I just basically got here too, you know. And like, just a few minutes ago it was night.\"<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" I agreed.<br>\r\n\"..Well, like, what they've been telling us, which really isn't anything, they like to keep secrets, just like .... uh, but, well they're saying that the blue, it took us... from ... well\" she struggled to make sense, \"we... all of us\" she pointed, \"who were in that apartment building have all experienced 'a Trans-temporal-spacial-shift.\" Huh. Fancy word I thought, in fact I even liked how it sounded. but the thing I didn't like was that it said something without explaining anything. It was like a waste of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Lis', in English please. For us common folk.\"<br>\r\n\"..uh, well that .. basically means, we all got transported from our place and time. It's\" She started to look at her watch,<br>\r\n\"Transported? Like teleported?\"<br>\r\n\"3:29 PM, approximately like a day later.\"<br>\r\n\"A day later?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Trent. It's... June 19th.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\" was all I could say. Yeah, well, it's not much. But given the circumstances.<br>\r\n\"I... I really don't know that one. But you just gotta trust me I guess. That's what they're saying and, well it's like all we have to go on.\" Great the issue of trust, just what I needed. Now I've got even more questions to ask.<br>\r\n\"Ok. I guess I can trust you.\" I grinned. She smiled back. I grabbed her dainty little hand and tried to get a grasp on the world. \"I ... were you there when everyone started walking around like zombies. Cuz of the green light.\" She nodded and wanted to talk, but I continued, \"I don't just mean a few people, but like everyone was marching down the streets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I heard. There's a lot of people who died because of the fighting that people did.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? What fighting? They didn't fight. They just shot up at the spaceships. It was crazy. Is there like a war going on here? Like between two groups of aliens or...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But there are these aliens coming here.\" She smiled. But I didn't. All I could think of was that man with the pole through him again.<br>\r\n\"****. I guess we all have to hide or something, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked, looking all innocent. I wondered if she had really seen that guy get killed like she said she had. If she did, she was really taking this oddly.<br>\r\n\"The alien bastards! They're probably coming down to stop us from shooting at them or some..\"<br>\r\n\"No. No, these aliens are different,\" Lisa tried to explain, \"they're like nice. I think they might have helped us because the other aliens are all gone now.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice?\" I contemplated that idea in my head a couple of times. But I still couldn't accept it. Lisa was willing to accept it. But I wasn't.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I wouldn't trust 'em. I think the best thing we can do is wear the helmets and like blast their brains out if...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that Trent. That sounds really hostile.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, ****, don't you think it was hostile of them to start ****ing with our heads and bodies like they did? ****, the reason we're in this mess is because we weren't prepared once. What about the next time?\"<br>\r\n\"But Trent, these guys are different. Totally different.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that.\" I said. I couldn't either. It was crazy. It was like they were still brain-washed. Hadn't they seen what they had done to us?<br>\r\n\"Well... It's our only chance of hope. We should at least try to be nice. They could help.\" She was well-intended, I liked that. But foolish. Once again I felt different from everyone else here. I was the only one against the mob of aliens. But hell, maybe I was wrong here too. It wouldn't be the first time. Still.<br>\r\n\"Whatever. You do what you want. I'm gonna go get some weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around. I looked up at the bright sky and thought of their huge ugly spaceships crashing down upon us like they had. Sneaking up on us and controlling us. I kept walking as Lisa rambled on about the aliens and how they're nice and ****, but I blocked it all out. At least until she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Pluma Beach.\" Those two words caught my interest and I turned around, facing her,<br>\r\n\"What about Pluma Beach?\"<br>\r\n\"That's where we are, Trent!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n\"What? But that's in California.\"<br>\r\n\"I know. So are we.\" I looked around, and saw behind us the large skyscrapers that decorated the city. It did look like Pluma. But ...<br>\r\n\"I told you we were teleported here. In time and SPACE.\"<br>\r\n\"But, my mom, she lives around here in Los Angeles. She...\" I smiled like a little boy. My mom. She wasn't too far at all from here. I reached into my wet pockets but couldn't find my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, must've dropped it or something... you got a phone?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh..no. I don't.\" I wanted to call my mom, make sure she was ok. And if she was, maybe I could go up and see her. At least she was my family, at least I could go out protecting my mom. Ha! I couldn't believe the sheer luck of my situation. I went over to one of the \"tourists\" in the crowd, and tapped him on the shoulder. He looked taken a back and a bit horrified with a taste of disgust upon seeing me, but I didn't care,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, could I use your phone?\" I didn't even have to ask if he had one. I knew he did. All people like him had one readily available. The question was if he would...<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah, I guess.\" He murmured as he pulled out his dated phone and handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to call my mom, no answer, my uncle, no answer, any relatives I knew in Cali, but I didn't know those. It looked as though I would need to go up there to find out myself. And that would either be really stupid, or really brave. The two are so damn close anyways. I gave the sucker back his phone and went over to Lis',<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, listen Lis' I might want to go and see my mom,\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, is she here?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sorta. She lives down in LA, and I wanted to see how she was.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh yeah. Sure. That sounds good. Is she ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...I don't know. She didn't pick up the phone, so, I really don't know. She might not even be there.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I hope she's ok..\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go see. Um, would you wanna go and...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh? Me? No, sorry. I gotta stay here, and wait for the aliens to come. Sorry, but I hope you find her. Uh,\" She looked as sad as I felt. I wonder why we even liked each other? We were nothing alike. But there it was. We both wanted the other to go with us. And it wasn't going to happen. \"If you, if you have anytime left and you could make it in time, just like come here around ... 7PM or so. We could.. meet the aliens..\"<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah. We'll see. Thanks though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around, ready to leave to check on mom. Was about to leave Lisa, possibly for the last time ever. I was a mixed bag of mushy gushy emotions, but hell if I would show it. I was about to walk away when she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck. I hope you're ok.\" She smiled a little half-smile that was dipped in guilt and fear. I smiled a similar one and said,<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Good luck with the aliens! Say hi for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both grinned and took one last look before...</span></div></div>",

The green, it must've done that to them. In every glaring eye I could see that guy who got beaten up by his own mother. I could see the guy who had been beaten up by his family. The world had gone mad, and now everyone was just starting to realize that. Welcome to my life. I didn't care what they thought, I was unlucky enough to have a brain during all of that green ****, and yes I saw the awful attrocities people commited, and yes I was a bit afraid that these alien scum might flip on their switch again. But I didn't have time to worry about that right now. I had to get to L.A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green. That reminds me. My ****ing helmet fell into the damn ocean. Looking back I knew it would be hard to find it alone. I'd have to go on without it. Grinding my teeth in anxiety, I passed by a rescue worker and tapped him on the shoulder. He seemed startled, \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost my helmet in the ocean when I fell out of my room,\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... okay. Alot of people lost alot of stuff when that big ass building got dropped..\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But this was really important. If you find it, it has some metal welded to the top, just give it to that girl over there,\" I pointed to Lisa, who was staring into the ocean.<br>\r\n\"Uh.. sure buddy.\" He agreed, probably not even caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and then walked off this god-forsaken shore. I couldn't believe that I was going to go see my mom again. But my excitement was premature, I thought. I don't know what happened. What's happening down there in L.A. hell, I even forgot where to go it's been so long since I've been here. Some things were vaguely familiar, but I needed some real help. A cop was waiting in the distance, eating his lunch, I walked up to him and introduced myself,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi officer,\" I grinned faintly, \"I'm one of the people who fell out of that building,\" I pointed. But by the looks of his eyes, he didn't seem very amused, or interested, but I continued, \"And I haven't been to L.A in a long time. Truthfully I'm from ...\"<br>\r\n\"So what?\" He grunted.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just saying that I've only been here when I was a boy, and I need some help finding out how to get back to L.A..\" I tried explaining to this thick-headed..<br>\r\n\"L.A?!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"You don't wanna go back to L.A. You're better off here.\"<br>\r\n\"No I have to go to L.A.\" I protested,<br>\r\n\"That place is a deathtrap.\"<br>\r\n\"...Why?\" I was able to muster, after becoming unsettled at the damn images flashing through my mind. I didn't like the sound of deathtrap.<br>\r\n\"It's closer east. It's closer to the ...\" he stopped for a second, probably remembering that I hadn't been on the Earth for a bit. \"... well, it's more prone to be get green waves shooting in and out of it. Green waves are hypnotic..\" he blathered on probably not even believeing in it himself,<br>\r\n\"I know what they are.\" I cut his lecture short, \"I had a helmet that protected me from that.\"<br>\r\n\"A helmet? Weren't you folks supposed to be from the past?\" I nodded and he looked at me as though I was mad.<br>\r\n\"Every place can get green waves,\" I explained, \"unless you're wearing the helmet.\"<br>\r\n\"Not these ones. They're stronger. Trust me you don't want to go in there. Hell half the city's probably dead..\" He continued on, recounting the death, carnage, bloodshed, violence and horrors that had happened to L.A in the short frame I was gone. But I blocked it out. I didn't need to hear this. I already knew what he had meant, but I didn't care. I had gone all of this way so far by not listening to orders, the damn cops didn't help me so far, so why was I going to need to be told more horror stories. My mind was already made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. I don't care who's dead and who's half-pole. I need to go back, are you gonna tell me how to go or not?\"<br>\r\n\"..... Right through that route. Just keep following it until you hit a sign that says 'Teddy Burger', that's when you wanna make a left,\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" I reluctantly thanked him, even though he had been quite a prick.<br>\r\n\"Just how do you plan on getting there? Walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't thought of that. I guess I sorta figured that I'd just take my car and.. but it's about half-way across the country. I hate changes in plans. So I turned, and aksed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got a car. Could you take me?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell no!\" He yelled, \"Do I look stupid?! You wanna go get yourself killed, you do it on your own. I'm staying right here.\" He scowled at me. And I scowled back. I flipped the jackass off and walked away, wondering how in the hell would I get to see my mom again. But I kept on trying asking a couple of \"tourists\" what if I could catch a ride. No one let me. They were all too damn afraid of getting killed. It seemed as though I'd be stuck here, which I guess wasn't all bad, I'd get to see Lisa, kick those alien asses and get some well deserved revenge. Ah, but who gives a **** about that **** when your mom's life is on the ****ing line?! I sat down on the pavement and wallowed in my own ****ing pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I looked across from me, and what the hell do you know, I see a motorcycle with the keys sticking out of it. Looks like some dumb bastard was killed as he was about to get on. This looked like my chance. As I approached it, I looked around, afraid of being caught by that cop. At first I wasn't quite sure if this was the right thing to do, but soon enough my general fear was replaced by the urge to go and see my mom. I really didn't give a damn if I died in the process anymore, things were way too out of control already, I had to have at least some common thing. I got on the bike, and it brought memories flooding back of this punk chick I used to date a few years back. Damn, she was fine. I could see her now yelling \"Come on Trenty, you gonna take it or what?\" heh. Those were my more, heh, rebellious days. **** it. Why not? I tunred the key and road off, steadying myself, and trying to remember how to even ride this thing.</span></div></div>",

Oh, just your typical suburban mother who tries to do the best for her children in this muck of a world we live in. I mean, you can't watch TV anymore without hearing about a shooting, or the skyrocketing prices of gas. That's why I find it's best to have your children read. Of course they have to be good books, and not the trash schools try to fill their heads up with. Something clean and family friendly. Something sweet and gentle. Speaking of sweet, I hope little Jeremy, Miss Murphy's youngest boy, can play well with Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seems nice enough, those cute little shoes running around the house all day! I just hope he's not too active with Todd. You see, my Todd's not a runner, and he could get hurt with all that activity. That's what I've told Rachel, Rachel Murphy; I told her, they should play a fun board game like Checkers or Monopoly. It's never too early to learn how to run a successful business. Isn't that right, Rachel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Linds, absolutely. My Tommy was a born accountant since he was three. He's so bright now, I wouldn't be surprised if he were president someday...\" Rachel took a sip out of her glass, and I had to agree. This was turning out to be quite a lovely evening. From the sitting room downstairs you could watch the boys in the yard play, make sure they're alright. You never knew, even in a small quiet well renowned neighborhood like Elmester Heights. The boys were playing something outside now, I tried to tell them to play indoors, but boys will be boys, I say. Besides it's too lovely of an evening to spoil it with yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linds, did you hear about Samantha?\" That perked my ears up from their pleasurable stupor. Samantha was a petite little thing, a few blocks down. To tell the truth, she and her dog of a husband were the talk of the town these days. They always fought, and her loud, obnoxious crying could be heard from very far away, even with the windows closed! I had heard the rumor about her recently from Ethel, and I already knew what Rachel was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's finally decided to move out! Take the kids and go stay with her mother,\" Hmm. I hadn't heard of this before. I wondered if it were true. She didn't really seem like the type who could stand up for herself. Maybe the poor thing had finally had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good for her!\" Linda applauded quietly, gracefully. \"It's about time she left him. How does he feel about it?\"<br>\r\n\"He's furious ... heard he didn't come home at all last night. I heard from Ethel that he might have ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rachel couldn't continue on as she heard in the little garden, loud, excessive crying coming from a little boy. It was Todd who was crying. It struck a chord in Linda's heart to hear such a noise. How long had he been going for, she wondered. Was he alright? She looked over at Rachel's worried face, and narrow eyes staring at Linda, waiting for her to go see what was wrong. But Todd always cried didn't he? She had glanced out quickly to see him playing with Jeremy still. He had probably lost; he always cried when he lost a game. Jeremy looked happy, it couldn't be too bad. But something in her told her that she had to do something. Linda ...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's a trucker, fella, and that's just what he'll stay as. Been a freelance driver since I got my license those years ago. And through all of them twist and turns, things have turned out alright. Not the best, but life's manageable, and that's all I need. Peggy Sue underneath me, and a big haul in back of her. Just picked up a shipment of Estelle Sugar, and afore I drop it off at its destination some 160 miles away, I want to give Peggy and me a small rest. Heck, may even see that girl inside the diner again. Now, if I could only remember her name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be good to her, Doc.\" I give a half-grin to that little springy fella who pumps her blood into her. Damn its getting pricey too, but I guess that's what living's all about. Making it through the rough patches to sail on the clear open water. Speaking about drinks, I can't wait to guzzle down a few mugs and maybe order a pie or two, depends on how hungry I am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside I see all the regulars, including that perfect little smile that greets me at the door. I look down, sly-like, hope she don't think I'm gazing a gander down at her. Charlotte, damn right. That's the girl's name. Charlotte, honey, I swear to you, we're getting married one day. Can't be the biggest thing, but who needs big. Damn, I really hope she ain't one of those girls who needs big. Economy's slow right now, and besides, a park beats out a ritzy church any old day of the week. Damn, she has a cute little smile, and those sparkling green eyes ain't too bad neither.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, C.R, how're things going with the business?\" She harps like an angel.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so so. Got a shipment of sugar going up to Reston City MegaMall.\"<br>\r\n\"Dang, I always loved that place!\" I know, I think. I heard her talk about how her and her sister ran away from home and stayed up there for a while. Well, hell, this time there could be some better circumstances. And a hell of a better ending. Should I ask her though? She was on duty, and she wouldn't want to go with a slob like me, now would she? Looking at her again, I can see her eyes glancing around the other fellows in the room. Well, she's a free woman, she's bound to look at others I 'spose. Better just order something quick, and get on with the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'll have a heavy chocolate shake, and a ch.... make that three cherry pies.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, C.R, Three red disks and a dirt sundae coming right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I'm getting more work than last week, that's always a good thing. But boy does Charlotte look good in that skirt. Too bad she couldn't go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Huck, I'm gonna get off for the day, if that's alright?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, darling, you've done quite enough for today.\"<br>\r\nCharlotte walked over to the back, hung up her work clothes, and put on a large dark sweater. She almost always worked later than this, it was odd to see otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Charlotte? You getting off so early?\" Carlos asked her.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, switched my shifts so that I work earlier, and get out earlier. I forgot to tell you about that didn't I, C.R? Sorry.\" Dang! Things seemed just about perfect now. Could I ask her to come with me? Would it even be a wise thing to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Charlotte!\" I hollered out after her before she walked out the door. She turned her stream of red hair, and gazed straight at me...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I don't have time for introductions and stuff, I have to check out this house! It's creepy. And not just that regular odd feeling of creepy, this has a definite menacing feeling to it. Look! I think I saw something move inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be owned, you know.\" That's my older brother, John. John's a real drip when it comes to investigating. The only reason I bring him along is ... uh ... because he has a functioning camera. Yeah. Otherwise I could probably do this myself. I mean, he doesn't believe in anything, and he's such a coward. But company's company. A brother's a brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owned? No way that place is owned. I mean, who owns it the Adams Family? The Munsters? Give me a break John, that place has murder mystery written all over it.\"<br>\r\n\"Amy, this isn't a book you know. You're not a junior sleuth!\" John tried to diminish and extinguish my efforts, as he always did, but this time I would not be rattled. I had finally seen something truly odd in our little town ... and I had to get to the bottom of what was going on! I had definitely seen something move inside - something big, and probably hairy. I shuttered at the thought. I looked over at John, who was shaking in his boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on John! Let's go in and investigate!\" I ran ahead while John stayed there probably whimpering. I heard him yell something after me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do it, Amy! It's dangerous!\" I laughed in the face of danger! Ha Ha! I ran up to the heavy metal fence, and hid behind some particularly itchy bushes. I crouched down, pulled out my digital camera and looked into the highest window in the house. It was open, no curtain or anything, a perfect chance for catching something. I could hear John coughing behind me and said to him, without taking my eyes away from the window,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! Be quiet, John! And sit down! I don't want you to scare them away!\"<br>\r\n\"But Amy...\" He began to whine again, but something was happening,<br>\r\n\"Shhh! There it is!\" I caught a glimpse of a small stout shadow roaring across the upstairs planks and snapped a few photos. Then it was gone. This was so exciting, nothing like this had ever happened before in the little town of Red Grove! I was so giddy I could almost hug John, but I didn't. I ran up to the gate, and began wondering how I could go in. The most obvious way would be to climb. But the spikes at the top looked frighteningly real. I didn't really want to risk my life. Maybe, I could ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"forget this, I'm telling mom!\" John whined as he ran away. What a chicken! How could he ... darn! I'd be grounded again! But I couldn't let this thing get away ... but how would I get in?</span></div></div>",

What the characters do is up to you however.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Barely any civilians know that A Secret Group (VMRS) has been testing mind control with waves (people see them as green). They accidentally sent a wave so far out that it reached aliens (antisocial engineers) and got them angry. So they've sent down Camorbs (camera orbs) and alien surveyors to check us out. They get annoyed by our constant testing of mind control and decide to move the earth. These aliens use an experimental (unsafe) blue beam that alters time and space and can have disastrous effects. While VMRS control our minds and tell everyone to fight them. But the mind control is also unstable and leads to riots across the earth. The only way to stop the mind control is by using DLC found in engines, dashboards etc. <br>\r\nto block the waves.<br>\r\n- Earth is moved in two days, near another planet (with aliens from the intro) these aliens notice our planet and go seek us, but Earth is then locked up in an alternate universe by the engineer aliens for hitting them again with the green waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I'm sorry for the long intro</td>",
