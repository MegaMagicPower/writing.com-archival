What do we have here?\"  I boom as you lie on my hand.  \"Congratulations on drinking that drink at the party last night.  You would think you could trust me, but nah, you can't.  I've kinda wanted a tiny person to play with a bit, and you seemed like an easy target.\"  You, dazed, stand up on my hand with difficulty from the instability caused by flesh not being too firm.  \"If you'll notice, you're about 3 inches tall now, or about as tall as my hand.  Just so you know, I have the ability to change that if it becomes necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue, after placing you between my legs as I sit with them in a V on my bed, \"Now, for some house rules: If you have to use the bathroom, you will tell me and I will take you to the bathroom;  if you dislike something I am doing to you, you will deal with it; you will submit to my every whim under penalty at the discretion of my imagination.\"  You cower as my voice booms over you.  You stare up at my face, seeming to be quite high to you, like a large billboard.  You notice I am already dressed in my tank top and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then.  I do have a home prepared for you, but first I figure I should make sure you understand my dominance.\"  You look puzzled and scared as I suddenly roll off of the bed.  You turn and see I'm dropping my pants to the ground and my panties after.  I climb back on the bed.  \"Now you will do as I say: Get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cower back, but trip on my blanket.  \"Not going to listen, I see.  Well then, I guess you'll be penalized from the start.\"  I grip your small body.  Your head and neck stick out from my grip and you open your eyes to see my pussy coming at you.  Your hearing is too distorted to understand what I'm saying as I slowly push you in.  You get deeper and deeper until your entire body is inside me.  You hear me moan as I rub my clit and juices start covering you.  I feel your struggles and react by pushing you deeper inside.  I feel your tiny body pleasuring me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time I reach orgasm.  I let out a small scream which hits you from all sides.  Your world shakes as I convulse lightly.  Then you feel yourself pulled out and tossed onto my bed.  Without a word, I pick you up and drop you in my lizard tank, giving you some time to examine the world as I watch TV from my bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I still don't quite realise what has just happened... Still the drugs are still in my body, I can feel them. I sit down on the sandy ground and hug my legs with my arms. Tears are running down my eyes and her pussyliquids which are all over my body and went inside every opening where cooling out my body. I freeze and I can taste my tormentor even after spitting out loads of her juice. I break out crying and bury my head between my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while I got myself settled a little bit. Maybe as good as possible in this situation. Scanning my envoirenment I am obviously sitting in a lizard tank. There issand all around and fake cactuses and brushes are placed here and there. Some rocks complete the illusion of a desert. My heart freezes. Is there a beast that calls this his home? I jump to my feet and press my back on the nearest glasswall. It was cold but at this moment I do not care. In panik I scan my surroundings but nothing moved. I stand here for several minutes until I am sure I am alone. I turn around and look out. The young woman, I would guess a little younger than I am, is still watching TV; she doesn't even share a quick glance with me. Her bottom was still naked. I look around some more. I seem to be in a room. Unfortunatly I can only see the bed and a small part of the TV. Pictures on the wall with her and probably her friends or siblings. A Clock told me it is about 11 O'clock AM. I am going to be missed by my roomate if I am still missing. The police will look for me and I will be rescued and can live my normal life again. I hope it is going to be very soon because if that treatment just now was just because she wanted to show me who is the boss, then I don't want to know what will happen if she is pissed. Rescue is on the way... I say that mere dozen times as I sit back down freezing again as the adrenaline rushes out of my body and look into emptiness. I am full of thoughts and have to somehow have to come in terms with the abuse. And my temporarly new position</span></div></div>",

I glare into the glass tank, my eyes burning a hole in your back.  You turn around and jump back at my presence.  You look kinda cute, being so small and all.  I silently pick you up and drop you between my legs.  You recover for a moment before curling up into a fearful fetal position.  I flick you with my fingernail and you roll across the bed.  I leap onto my belly, landing inches away from you.  My weight on the bed creates a large valley for you, and you roll into my t-shirt covered breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a minuscule scream and I drop a bit of my weight onto you.  I faintly feel you struggling to push me off and I feel it a good time to torture you for it.  I sit up and boom, \"What did I say about resisting me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond, meekly, \"I couldn't breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say, abusively, \"Oh well.  If you thought that was bad, then you are in for hell.\"  I watch you scoot back, and I put my hand over your body, your finger in your mouth, blocking off air.  I feel the air from your nose pulsing heavily.  Not wanting to let you have relief, my thumb comes and pushed your nose in.  \"Heheh, wonder how long you can hold your breath.\"  I grin and look at the digital clock on top of the tele.  Then I feel you biting my finger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see me suddenly glare down.  \"You fucking cunt!  You do not bite me!\"  I hop off my bed and walk over to my dresser.  You see me grab a vial out from a drawer.  When I turn around I snatch you up from running.  \"I do not like your resistance.  Since you think it's okay to bite me, we'll just have to make your bites nice and weak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dunk your head into the vial and watch you lose consciousness and then lose size.  When you diminish to a mere inch in height, I pull you out and drop you back in the tank.  Knowing you may try to escape after being reduced further, I put a lid on the tank, securing your position.</span></div></div>",

A flash of memory returns quickly and an adrenaline rush kicks me up on my feet. I am in the terrarium once again but something has changed. The cactus are mere trees now. They where taller than me before but now they where gigantic. The sandy ground felt different beneath my naked feet. Not so soft and sandy but harder. Rocky. I stare down at my own body in disbelieve and already knew what happened. \"That bitch has shrunk me further\", I whisper in disbelieve My hopes diminish. The rescue will never be here in time to find me alive. They will have to be very keen eyed to notice a one inch tall women in a lizard box. I did not want to think of how she will hide or dispose my corpse if they won't arrive in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears rolled down my eyes but it was no time for crying now. After taking a deep breath I look around and made a dash to the nearest rock I see. I am aware of the presence of my captor right behind the glass walls and just try to get out of sight before she gets another idea. I have to win some time. Hiding behind the rock I sit down and waited. I don't want to think about what she will do next to humiliate and torture me so I tried to guide my thoughts into another direction: Escape but before I could even think about that my desperation takes over once again and I start sobbing silently.</span></div></div>",

I gaze around the sand but I don't see you immediately. I think to myself, I could pick out the fake rocks and cactus, but as my bladder calls me, I get a better idea. I straddle the tank, making your sky turn from the ceiling of my bedroom to my underside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't hide from me,\" I scold. Piss streams out of me and rains down on your tank. The sand absorbs some of it, but it can't absorb fast enough as the entire ground becomes soaked in a shallow layer of piss. I slide back and forth a bit, making sure no matter where you're hiding you get drenched. When I finish, I stand on the ground again and pick up the tank. I still don't see you, so I swish the tank around a bit, seeing if that will loosen you from your position.</span></div></div>",

I had to find a way to escape, but I knew it wouldn't be easy. After all, I was nothing but a mere insect to everyone else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the jar begin to twist off, so my heart started pacing more rapidly. \"What was she going to do to me now!?\" Was all I could think of at the moment. It wouldn't be long before I found out. I glanced up and, to my horrific eyes, I watch as you straddled the top of the tank, your pussy completely covering my only way to escape. \"No, please don't!\" I shouted as the yellow liquid began to pour all over the sand within the tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take more than a few seconds before the entire sand, and my self, were completely soaked in your piss. I gagged and tried to free myself from the sand, but the liquid made it harder to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my entire world begin to shake as you began swishing the tank back and forth. I was completely soaked in your piss from head to toe. I felt humiliated and only hoped for this nightmare to end, but that wouldn't happen for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid there completely soaked in your piss, wondering what you would do to me next.</span></div></div>",
