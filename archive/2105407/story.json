The jeweler on Monty Street is giving them away!\" The man then glanced at your boots for a second, before moving on with his day. What a creep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case you need some money, maybe you could get one of them and pawn it off for gold? On the other hand, this seemed very unusual, it seemed all the men wearing these necklaces were giving odd untoward looks downwards...at each other's crotches...maybe their feet? You decide to investigate, you soon find the jeweler on Monty Street, there's a long line to getting a pendant.</span></div></div>",

In fact, they were probably worth a dozen or so gold coins to a travelling salesmen. Specially, with the current demand for foot-related items in New Solesville... I made you shudder, just wondering how an entire city could become so obsessed with feet overnight. Still, you had to admit: those foot-shaped necklaces weren't <i>that</i> bad. Quite beautiful, actually! Captivating, even... (-1 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited in line for your turn, you manage to hit up a conversation with the lanky young man behind you. His brand new clothes and puffed-up chest denounce him as a proud member of the petty bourgeoisie. \"So, you're here to buy some supplies, eh?\" he asks, a slight hint of disdain in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod enthusiastically, and reply with as much conviction as your heart could muster: \"Yes. I've come here to buy some armour and training, and then I'm heading west, through the Crevices, to find and slay the Monster King!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...\" the young man chuckles, clearly not impressed by your bravado. \"Sure you are. Lots of adventurers come through here singing that song, you know? Funny how we don't hear from them again... still, if you're that much of a hero, you're better off fighting serpent-boys in the wild, then here in Antiuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" you ask with morbid curiosity, the pain from your damaged ego immediately obscured by the man's cryptic statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say the Sisterhood doesn't like seeing men run around with armour over their shoulders and weapons around their waist. They say it's for our protection, of course, but they're really just projecting their daddy issues onto us, law-abiding citizens. I will be damned if those lesbian fanatics think we actually care for any of their sanctimonious bullshit! My suggestion: if they tell you to do something, just nod quietly and piss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides... I hear there's rumours of something brewing down in the sewers. Something big. A revolution, maybe. Don't have a clue who's behind it yet, but I, for one, would gladly welcome the change of airs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to press the bourgeois for more information, when you hear a lisped, high-pitch voice calling: \"Next!\" You turn around to see you've finally reached the start of the queue, and are now standing before a large velvet table, lined with a hundred foot-shaped pendants. And behind the table sits a sickly young woman, her pale blue eyes staring right into yours as you feel her cold dead hands reach out to measure your neck. When she opens her mouth to talk, you swear you can feel the smell of cheese emanating from her throat... (-1 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, sire.\" she says, fitting a silver pendant encrusted with a polished malachite foot tightly around your neck. And as the necklace clicks into place, and you look into the exquisite pendant shining in your chest, right above your heart, all your doubts about their legitimacy fade away instantly (-3 MP). You walk away from the jeweller with an unprecedented sense of satisfaction and excitement, to the point of feeling a bit light-headed in the sun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean against the wall of a nearby tavern, so as to catch your breath, but what you see next only makes you gasp even harder: a procession of monks marches down the street, their feet clad in nothing but a pair of thin leather sandals! And without realising, your eyes are helplessly drawn to the monks' visibly dirty (and no doubt, sweaty) soles. (-5 MP) Suddenly, it didn't feel wrong or even weird to stare at other men's feet. Not when you understood how subtly rough and beautiful they looked... not when their toes felt so strangely appetising and seductive... not when their soles suddenly held such a mesmerising power over you... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monks finally disappear down the street and you're crash-landed back into reality. Looking around you, you can see you weren't the only one left hypnotised by the show of parading male soles: at least a few dozen other people, all wearing the same foot-shaped pendants as you, remained with their eyes stuck on the spot where a few seconds ago, a young monk had laid down his sweaty foot. And looking down, you could see that, much like your fellow necklace-wearers, you had unwittingly pitched a massive tent in your trousers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head clear and your cock limp, you decide to ignore this incident, and promptly resume your business here in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: 85/100 (-5 MP ongoing while the necklace is equipped)</span></div></div>",

As the day progresses, you regularly find yourself reminiscing about the morning's procession of sandalled monks, and their luscious, sweaty soles. (-5 MP) Thankfully for you, there are plenty more feet on display at the market: big feet, small feet, old feet, young feet, pretty feet, ugly feet, clean feet, dirty feet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... dirty feet!\" you think to yourself as you catch sight of some young rascals washing their toes in a fountain. For a moment, you consider pledging your very own oral cleaning apparatus to help wash their feet, but the boys are too soon chased off by an angry Sisterhood guard, leaving you with nothing but lust and regret (-5 MP).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sheer amount of barefoot plebs around you, shopping quickly became a strenuous task, demanding all your attention and focus. Despite your newfound foot fetish, you manage to purchase a rusted iron sword dealing 2 damage per hit for 4 gold, and bunch of dry lavender for 1 gold, to wear under your clothes and help mask unpleasant odours (even though your definition of 'unpleasant odour' was progressively shifting away from cheesy feet...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, your initial idea to sell the pendant for a couple more coins was silently forgotten in between gawking at other people's lower extremities, and thinking of clever ways to convince merchants to sell you their worn shoes. Not that money was useless... but, as strange as it sounded, you felt a kind of emotional attachment to the necklace. You felt a warmth throughout your body you had only experienced once before in your life - the first time you had ever fallen in love. You just loved the pendant, and loved feet. Specially feet. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a long day's perving, your legs automatically found their way to the nearest inn, ever so ironically called \"The Rabbit's Paw\". As your stepped through the door, a chubby little woman rushed to welcome you into her establishment and present you with usual array of food and drink. Since toejam wasn't on the menu, you decided to ask for a beer. And another one. And another one... quite a few, actually. By the end of the night, the alcohol had done its part chipping away at your self-consciousness. (-5 MP) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it didn't take long for you to try and have a taste of your drinking buddy's toes, before being triumphantly kicked and punched up the stairs, and toward your room. As you leaned on the doorframe, wiping the blood off your swollen lip, your eyes wander to the end of the corridor, where you saw a young gentleman of exotic descent, no doubt a Far-Southerner by his tanned skin, pitch-black hair and deep-blue eyes, slowly enter his bedroom. Your eyes bulge along with your nether regions as you look down to his shapely feet, encased in nothing but an exquisite leather sandal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your drunken stupor, the thought of storming into the young man's room and taking your frustration out on his soles does cross your mind... on the other hand, you had barely escaped alive minutes ago from a similar exploit.

You hold your trusty pendant between your fingers one last time, before falling into a deep, dreamful slumber... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\nA foul smell permeated your nostrils. Even if you were conscious, you could barely describe its pungent perfection; but you transfixed by it. The smell, the wonderful cheesy smell, was all you saw. It was like a dense fog, swirling and twirling within your mind, leading you deeper... and deeper... and deeper... into nowhere. You were falling, and all you could hear was the rancid mist, rushing past your ears, singing, speaking... and as you fell into a sleeping trance, you could finally hear His words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ever close, my Stench draws near...<br>\r\nSmell it: your purpose is clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith eager hands you reclaim<br>\r\nwhat faithless minds thought profane...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at my Soles do you toil,<br>\r\nfor the Feet which rule your soil...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis verses echoed through your mind, and your body.

And that image was the most beautiful pair of feet you had ever seen: giant creamy soles, their enormous arch hanging over you, dripping drop after drop of sweat from their perfect, round toes; you were fascinated, mesmerized... you pressed your hands into the warm, smooth flesh... you rubbed it with all your strength... all your effort... all your love. You worshipped His Feet, as you knew you should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou planted a single, delicate kiss on the divine arches before you. The sight, the taste, the scent... it overwhelmed you.

Besides, it's not like I don't already know the answer.\" He smirks as wet gagging sounds escape your throat, which are then muffled by the bird boy's girth. You would find the repetitive motions of the musky cock going in and out of your mouth hypnotic, had you not already been thoroughly entranced by the harpy boy. With each thrust, the harpy deposited just a bit more pre-cum down your throat, which you eagerly swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own meat began to stiffen up, its length and girth poorly comparing to the harpy's. The harpy, with his hawk-like vision, didn't take long to notice. \"Wow, you really love sucking cock, huh? Maybe I should give you a little present for giving in so easily!\" He raises his right foot, wiggles his smelly toes, and with a motion as swift as lightning, cuts apart your pants and undergarments with the talons on his toes. \"Wow, you're so small, even for a human! No wonder you gave up, heehee!\" He then takes your modest cock between two of his toes and wiggles them. His sweat combined with your saliva created an excellent lubricant, causing the toes to easily slide across both sides of your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy boy edges closer and closer to an orgasm as you suck his dick. His hips move faster and faster, and he forcefully grabs the back of your head and shoves you against his cock, forcing you to deepthroat him. It's only a matter of time until he stuffs you with his seed...</span></div></div>",

It was easily twice the size of his friend's cock! As it dangled before you, it reached all the way down to the bottom of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter admiring his massive cock, you picked the head up and opened your mouth.

You can feel his cock hitting the bottom of your stomach!<br>\r\n\"Ung! So, are you humans typically this weak or is it just you? I think I could even lift you off the ground using only my cock!\"<br>\r\nThe harpy boy seemed to think this was actually a good idea! He was slowly starting to step backwards, while holding your hair to keep your face in his balls. After he walked about a metre backwards, he let go of your hair. He was right! There you are, dangling on his cock, unable to move and completely at his mercy!<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Look at how pathetic you look!\"<br>\r\nYour master then grabbed your waist and starting pumping again. It didn't take long for him to burst his seed inside you. You were still dangling on his cock after he finished inside you, only touching the ground after he went soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green harpy boy then sat down on a bench nearby, ordering you to lick his feet. The blue harpy boy returned soon after. The two friends then laughed at the fact that you could dangle in mid air on the green harpy boy's cock. You noticed the blue harpy boy seemed a little nervous about his friend's size. The green boy suddenly said<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he was good! I think I'm going to keep him as my permanent slave.\" <br>\r\n\"No way man! I found him first and I broke him! Go find your own slut.\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't mean that he is yours! You know the rules!\"<br>\r\n\"So you're challenging me then? Alright, lets get this over with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two harpy boys were fighting over you! You could only watch in anticipation at which harpy boy would be your new master.<br>\r\nWho will become your new master? The stronger green harpy boy with his massive cock?

Due to his speed he will attack before anyone (except if you're ambushed). Also since he is a rogue, he can tell you if a chest is trapped or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Taiyo age 14, class priest. He has nothing but a wooden staff, since he is a priest he cannot attack monster boys (he can be targeted by them though). But thanks to his ability, he will heal you and himself after the end of a fight (+ 10 MP) and will also use minor heal spells on you and himself each the end of each chapter (+ 2 MP). He also has a kind of mental and invisible shield. That shield is always activated and while it doesn't protect from physical attacks (such as kicks in the face, or foot rubing) it will make your mind stronger against mental attacks (foot odors, teasing, verbal domination and ay kind of mental attacks), halving their damage on your mind. He can also negate any kind of curse (from a monster boy or a cursed item). Finally thanks to another passive skill, he will negate bonus monster boys can obtain by fighting while it's dark.All that seems really strong, but keep in mind he literally cannot attack monster boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose partners all have 80 MP except Taiyo who has 100 MP since he is a priest. </span></div></div>",

But you came here for treasure you can sell, and you highly doubt anyone would buy a monster boy. Well, there might be some people, but they're weird..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put. I want to have a look around this cave of yours.\" The Kitsune pouts as you reject his advances and instead opt to rob his cave. He doesn't say anything on the matter though, which you'd find suspicious if you weren't mesmerized by the huge piles of golden coins and trinkets in front of you! Forget weapons, you could probably hire a small army with all this! Everywhere you look there's something valuable, and you don't even know where to start! Eventually, your eyes settle on a small black box on top of one of the gold piles. It looks just like a box you'd hold a ring in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune sees you walk towards it, and he immediately says, \"nonono! Do not take that ring! Please! Take anything else, but leave that alone! It's far too valuable to l-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipe down, will you? This is my treasure now, so I'm not taking anything!\" His words only make you more curious about what's in the little box. You climb up the pile of coins and pluck it from its resting point at the top. When you open the box, as expected, you find a gold ring inside. What you didn't expect however, is the big, glowing, purple gem on it! This ring is definitely magical, and given how much the kitsune seems to want you to stay away from it, it's also probably very powerful! You take the ring out of the box, and can actually feel the energy coming from it! Without a moment's hesitation, you slip it on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured the instant you put it on, you'd feel more powerful, but as it stands you feel largely the same. Except...your finger feels a bit...itchy. You look down at the ring, only to see that your finger is turning purple! Your eyes widen in shock, and when you try to pull the ring off, not only do you see that it's stuck, but your finger feels like it's made out of some kind of cloth! The purple cloth spreads to the rest of your hand and starts crawling up your arm. Also...does the Kitsune look...taller than he did before? Oh...no you're just shrinking. Oh no! You're shrinking! You drop the Kitsune boy's ball as you try to desperately yank the ring off! Said ball is immediately scooped up by one of his tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to warn you about that ring. It's one of the most valuable items a monster boy can own! If a human puts it on, they turn into a sock! Serves you right. No actual hero would be so greedy. You'd have probably just given up your quest had our stupid king just bribed you. Luckily, I saved him some gold.\" He pulls off his left boot, making you feel sick as his overwhelming foot odor flows back out. Strangely enough, you don't lose any MP! \"Heh, you're going to go on this foot. And thanks to that special ring, you'll never get used to the smell, and you'll never go foot crazy like most humans! Heh, you won't even wear down and eventually die. You'll be stuck with my nasty feet for eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to respond, but your mouth won't move! Your arms lay at your sides as your body turns entirely into purple cloth. A few moments later, you've turned completely into a purple, knee-high sock! The ring clatters to the ground, and the Kitsune picks both of you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few moments are a blur. He puts you on, and your entire world is his godawful foot odor! You can feel the stench literally seep into your entire being. This truly is hell! You can't cry, or beg, or anything. All you can do is take in the smell of his feet, especially when everything goes dark as the boot is put back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune makes good on his word. You spend an eternity suffering at his feet. No matter how much time passes, no matter how foul, filthy, and sweat-soaked you become, you never wear down. There's no escape. The only thing you can ever hope for anymore is that the Kitsune might make another human smell you. At least then you get a momentary break. Sadly, with how disgusting you become, those moments don't last long, and you're soon back to suffering in his sweltering boot.</span></div></div>",

His slender frame and unmarred, light skin make him seem so fragile. And so usable! Given his performance, you can only assume that this fox-eared boy WANTS you to fuck him anyways, so might as well! You hold his ball in one hand, and use the other to unbuckle and drop your trousers. Your cock is already starting to harden and form a tent in your underpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk down at the fox boy and hold his ball a bit tighter as you say, \"well, a little fun couldn't hurt! Alright foxy, get over here and pleasure me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune grins eagerly and crawls over to you. His fingers gently wrap around your waistband and slowly slide your underpants down. His fluffy fox ears twitch a bit, and he licks his lips eagerly at the sight of your semi-hard cock. You think he's going to open up and start sucking, but instead, you see his tails inch closer and closer to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tail very gently brushes the tip of your penis, and an intense jolt of pleasure courses through your body! It feels so wonderful that your entire body, not just your cock, goes completely stiff! His tail is so wonderfully silky soft, it's like magic! Hell, it probably IS magic! Forget fucking him, you need as many tails on your dick as possible! Now! \"A-aaaahhh! U...use your tails! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs at how eager you are all of a sudden. \"Heh, so turns out I'm not so disgusting after all, hm? You seem to like my fluffy tails just fine!\" One of his silver tails lightly coils around the base of your dick, and just like that you're in heaven! He makes things even better by wrapping another tail just below the tip, and then...the stroking starts! The two luxuriously silky tails meet in the middle with each stroke. It feels so amazing that you're rendered completely speechless! He isn't done yet though! Another tail starts to brush over your sensitive tip, eliciting a moan of delight from you. You don't even seem to notice as his other tails slowly lower you down to the ground till you're lying on your back. He giggles mischievously and takes a seat on your chest, making sure to keep you in your pleasure trance as long as possible. It isn't terribly long though, because in a mere five minutes, you let out a scream as you paint his metallic colored tails white. The intense orgasm rocks your whole body, causing you to shiver and unknowingly drop the Kitsune boy's ball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie there with your eyes closed, sucking in deep breaths after such an intense experience. As you take in another breath though, the air suddenly reeks like hell again! (-20 MP) Your eyes shoot open just in time to see his filthy, bare foot stomp down on your face! His arch covers your mouth, and your nose is pushed right in between those filth-caked toes! Your face goes green in disgust, and your eyes widen in fear when you realize he has his ball back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was kind of hoping you'd be the one. The guy who'd finally take out that fool we're forced to call king. After all, I've never seen a man or woman able to resist my feet after such a close sniff! Unfortunately, if you're THIS easily distracted by your lust, you couldn't possibly win against him. Better to just end your journey now! After all, I'm much nicer than some other monsters you'll meet. Or, would have met! Now come on! Breaaathe in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tails have your arms and legs pinned, and you're still weak from the tailjob he gave you. You don't have a choice! You still keep holding your breath till you're blue in the face, but in the end, you inhale. As you sniff his disgusting foot, both your nose and brain are overwhelmed by that potent, cheesy stink! It's so unbelievably foul! Way worse than anything people had described monster feet to smell like! Your nose burns like someone had just stuck a match in it! It's a sharp, vinegary odor, but with an insane intensity to it that just makes your brain sizzle! (-50 MP) Needless to say, you pass out almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, it feels like no time has passed at all, but in reality you've been unconscious for a couple of hours! While you were unconscious, all your clothes were removed, and you'd been chained to the cave wall with a golden collar and chain leash. You wake up and, after the initial confusion, look around for the Kitsune and those sexy, filthy feet of his! You see him sitting on a pile of gold with his feet tucked away in those boots he conjured up. \"You know, slave...I like these! They get my feet all hot and sweaty...why, they're probably toxic by now!\" The sound of that makes your mouth water, and you immediately crawl to his feet. \"Mmm, someone's eager to serve his master! Well, okay! Sit down and spread your legs!\" You do as commanded, and watch eagerly as he pulls off his boots with his tails! One is tossed away, but he places the opening of the other over your nose! It's so muggy inside, and as you take a whiff, your brain is again blasted with hot, putrid foot reek that makes you retch, but love all the same! (-100 MP!!!) You happily take the boot and start sniffing! Meanwhile, Master smirks and sandwiches your cock between his two filth-ridden, noxious feet! You moan in delight as he starts stroking you with those nasty things! \"Hehe! Enjoy my feet, slave! You'll be licking your own cum off them soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, your adventure came to an end. You dutifully served your Kitsune master for life. You spent your days sucking him off and worshipping his godawful feet,  hoping to be rewarded with another heavenly tailjob! Life could never be better.</span></div></div>",

Unlike you though, he can just clean himself up with a little magic, which he does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, just like I thought! No human can resist a fairy's Pleasure Powder! That's like resisting a Kitsune's footjob! Or a blowjob from a Vampire boy!\" He does a proud little flourish in the air before hovering himself over your face. The Fairy boy's shit eating grin just gets wider as he lowers both of his noxious feet down to your nose. Despite the horrendously foul smell wafting off them, you just start sniffing. He didn't even have to tell you! Despite your gags and groans, you find yourself staring at those tiny, stinky feet with complete adoration! You can't stop sniffing their vile scent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with his victory over you, the fairy plans his next move!</span></div></div>",

What has this mean little fairy done to you? Now I'll have to fix your brain before <i>I</i> get to do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looks between you and the Kitsune with a confused look on his face. \"Wait, the human is your slave?

I fix his brain a lot and let him run away just so I can chase him down and break it again! Now if you'd be so kind as to give him back to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy scoffs at the Kitsune. \"Oh yeah? Well I found him fair and square! I don't care if he was your slave! He's mine now! If you don't get out of here, I'll enslave you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune glares at the fairy boy, \"hmph. Stooping so low as to enslave a fellow monster? Just what is this world coming to? Four hundred years ago, the old Monster King would have executed you with his sock for doing such a thing.\" His tails begin to wave threateningly behind him. Despite what he told you about not having to fight fellow monsters, this fairy's attitude seems to have definitely irked him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy folds his arms and scowls, refusing to leave you. \"Oh yeah, grandpa? So what? The new king says we can do whatever we want. Cull and enslave weak monsters included! You grew up in a softer time.

Eight centuries of life just means you've had all this time to sit on your butt and get weak, clinging to the old way of peace!\" He shouts, earning a smirk from the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune looks over at you for a brief moment, just to make sure you're good and brainfucked right now.

No no no...we may get a new tail every century, but I've been alive FAR longer than eight hundred years. Nine is just the maximum, little fairy. No, I've been around for, oh...five thousand or so?

His lips are pressed against yours, and he gives you a wink when he sees your eyes open up.

Don't do that!\" You shout, glaring at the smiling monster boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do what? Fix your brain with a little kiss? Sorry, but the only other method I have for that is making you drink my cum! Guess I'll try that next time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like protesting, but at this point, you've noticed your surroundings. Why is there so much dead plant life around you? \"Ummm...what happened here? You ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune stands up and shrugs. \"I decided that fairy needed punishment. The plants were just collateral! Anyways, as I was trying to tell you earlier. My name is Kusai. Now, let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's already started off on the trail before you can ask anything else. Not that he'd give you a straight answer anyways.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, other than that fairy attack, the journey is mostly peaceful. The only outstanding thing is that, occasionally, you think you hear muffled whimpers coming from Kusai. Specifically his boots. You're pretty sure you're just imagining things though. And even if you aren't, you really don't want to ask him about it, lest he decide to take off a boot and show you. You're excited to get to Antiuck as well. You haven't been there since you were little. Your village has been a little concerned at the lack of travelers from the city lately, but there wasn't a huge amount to begin with. In fact, you hadn't really thought it was that strange until Kusai's laugh at the mention of Antiuck earlier. You can see the city walls coming into view now though. Guess you'll see what's going on in a mome-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the name of the Holy Creator of Humanity are you witnessing right now? You can see the gate leading into Antiuck, and the guards right in front of it. Said guards seem to have just decided to not wear their greaves, or trousers, or even underwear! That's not even the most shocking part! No, the most shocking part has got to be the Harpy boy sitting in front of them, jerking them off with his filthy talons. The guards aren't doing anything to try and resist him! Additionally, Kusai doesn't seem to be disguising himself. He's just smiling like always and strolling along like nothing's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get closer, the smell of the Harpy boy's talons stings your nose like an angry bee. Ugh, his species is pretty well known for their stench, but you've never smelled one before now! It reeks! (-5 MP) You have to help those soldiers! You put a hand on your sword, but the guards slowly look your way, and one holds up a hand. Of course, your first assumption is that he's been messed with by the harpy's feet, but then you notice that the harpy boy is wearing an Antiuck guard breastplate! You stay your blade for now and let the guards speak. \"H-halt! Wwwweeee mnh...aahh yes! W-we uh...need...s-something? It was...uh...mnm...o-OOOHH!\" He bucks his hips and lets out a load all over the Harpy boy's talons. The other guard quickly follows suit! They don't stop humping those bird feet though, and the harpy boy doesn't stop rubbing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The winged monster boy looks up at you with a wink. He keeps those guards under his talons, but at least decides to talk to you. \"We need you to register if you don't already have identification. It's a new rule! You should start at the big, ugly metal building not too far from the gate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't budge. There's no way you're just going inside! \"I need some answers first! Why are you here? Why's your armor got the city symbol on it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of realization dawns on the harpy's face, and he stops jerking his fellow guards off. He stands up and puts his face right in front of yours. Ugh...filthy harpies. At least most monsters only have smelly feet. This guy though, he just stinks! His rank breath blows into your nostrils with every word.  \"Have you...not been here in the last five years by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been here in over ten.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy smiles and nods his head at you. \"Thought so! Well, you have to go through the identification acquisition process, which can take about two weeks. In the meantime you'll b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my slave.\" Kusai says, cutting the harpy boy off. Before you can argue, he casually blocks your mouth with a tail, and pulls out a few papers from his robes. \"I think you'll find that he doesn't require any identification, since he's escorting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harpy boy frowns and takes the papers. \"I'm sorry, sir. Even slaves need to be regis-oh...\" He looks up at Kusai and back down at the paper. \"Er...uh...n-never mind! You can go right on in!\" He hands the paper back to Kusai and waves the both of you through the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're both out of earshot of the harpy,  you yank his tail out of your mouth. \"Okay, what the hell was all of that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusai gestures towards the bustling streets of the city. Your eyes follow his hand, and they get wider than you ever thought possible at what you see. There's monster boys all over the place! Some are chatting with humans. Others are getting worshipped or are straight up fucking humans in the streets! \"Well, ever since the local lord took a Cat Boy as his husband, this has been the norm. Antiuck is a monster friendly city. The only monster friendly human city, I might add! As for what happened at the gate, I just saved you about two weeks of running around in customs. I believe a \"thank you\" is in order, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" You say flatly. This fox is up to something, that's for damn sure. You're not about to give him an inch! He seems to take your refusal in stride though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! And after all I've done for you! Ah well. Now just so you know, as long as you DON'T have your own permits, you'll have to stay by me! Otherwise you could actually end up as a slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch at that. Antiuck has a slave trade now!? And monster boys freely roaming around? This is absolute madness! \"This can't be real. The city's ruler must be under some sort of spell!\" You shout, prompting Kusai to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you know, most monster boys aren't happy about it either. Now, you wanted new gear, yes? I'll tell you now, that handful of coins you took from me won't get you much. Follow me!\" He takes you by the hand and leads you through the streets. You eventually end up at a pink, five story building. Outside stands a Goblin boy who greets you with a wave. \"This is the House of Temptation. It's a pretty big attraction around here, believe it or not. Basically, they'll give you money if you can resist being seduced!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at the fox boy. \"What's the catch?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles, \"oh right! If you lose, they enslave you. All you have to do is make it through five monster boys! One per floor! There's several on each floor, separated by types! You get to choose! The workers are usually volunteers. Heck, I've volunteered once or twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would I want to do that? I'm a Hero, not a whore!\" You shout defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the entire objective is to NOT have sex. You lose by whipping your dick out, after all. Also, the town's military is pretty strong. They don't usually have any quests that need doing. You might be able to scrounge one up, but it'll be incredibly dangerous. Or you could roll up your sleeves and work with the blacksmith. I hear he's usually hiring. None of those offer a ten thousand coin payout though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes light up. Ten...thousand...gold? For NOT having sex with monsters? That's incredibly tempting...what do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 95/100</span></div></div>",

That gold reward can buy you the highest-end equipment, and if you're careful with your spending, a life of luxury after your quest is over. Sure, failure means enslavement, but no matter what you do, you'll be working with monster boys, which usually results in enslavement regardless. You take a deep breath, stand up straight, and approach the goblin in front of the House.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, human!\" The goblin bows courteously. He's suspiciously polite for a monster, and <i>especially </i>polite for a goblin. \"How gracious of your master to bring you here!\" You want to correct him, but there's no telling what would happen if you blew your cover. You grit your teeth and bear the humiliation. \"So, you want to enter the House of Temptation, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" The goblin's grin stretches from ear to ear. \"Now, I'm sure your master taught you the rules of the House, but a refresher never hurts: there are five floors of the house, each with a selection of monsters behind closed doors. Simply make it past the monsters without being seduced, and after you clear the fifth floor, a cache of ten-thousand gold coins is waiting for you! Fall to temptation at any time, and the monster that bests you is your new owner, free to do with you as they see it. One more thing: the doors lock when you enter, so it's do or die in there! Do you still wish to enter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you answer again, annoyed that you had to sit through that explanation you already had less than a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, just one more thing before you go...\" The goblin whips out a bottle of perfume, and before you can react, blows a cloud of blue mist into your face. The bitter taste and scent causes you to cough and your eyes water, but your senses feel as sharp as ever. (MP MAX)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little brain refresher. Trust me, you'll want all the wits you can get in there!\" You grab Kusai's arm and prepare to walk through the door, but the goblin stops you before you can enter. \"Ah ah, no bringing along your master! You have to take on this challenge alone.\" You look to Kusai's face with worry, but he merely chuckles. \"You'll be fine in there. At least, you better be. I don't want my slave taken from me so easily!\" He sticks out his tongue and winks at you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou shakily push the door open without your kitsune companion in tow. You enter an unlit room, with the only source of light being the sun behind you. The door creaks shut, leaving you in total darkness. You hear a click behind you, which you assume is the door locking shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few tense moments, a candelabra above you magically flickers to life, illuminating the room. There's little in the way of decor: just the candelabra and three wooden doors before you. Examining the doors, you see they all have wooden placards above them with figures carved in. You assume these tell you what monster lies beyond the door. The left door has a mouse. The middle door has a raccoon. The right door... well, you can't really make out what's above that one. It seems someone intentionally scratched out any image it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich door do you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 100/100</span></div></div>",

It's composed of just basic wooden floorboards with matching wood paneling going up the walls. More notably, however, are the numerous articles of footwear. Dirty socks, well-worn shoes, and sandals with deeply-embedded footprints littered the room so densely that you couldn't possibly take a step without stepping over at least item. It doesn't help that all these used shoes and socks combine to give the room an odor of stale footsweat. The stench snakes its way up your nose, and while it's hardly enough to floor you, especially in comparison to what Kusai put you through, but it's still rather unpleasant and makes you scrunch up your face. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the room stands the mouse boy you expected to see. He's short and lithe, only coming up to about your chest in height. Light grey fur covers his body, only stopping at his wrist and ankles, leaving his pink hands and feet bare. A mop of medium-length black hair lays scattered atop his head, his bangs just above his bright blue spectacled eyes. The only article of clothing he's wearing is a tight, white pair of underwear, accentuating his above-average bulge. His whiskers and pink nose twitch in excitement as he sees you step through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome, traveler, to the House of Temptation! I am Rodello, and I shall proctor your first trial!\" His smile seems genuine, but you can detect a glimmer of eager malice behind his sparkling eyes. \"Your objective is simple: you only have to get to the door on the other side of the room. There are no hidden traps, the room is exactly as you perceive it. You may take as long as you need. I will stand here and not physically impede you in any way. You only fail if you concede or otherwise are unable to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arch an eyebrow. Sure, this might just be the first floor, but there's <i>no way</i> this rat's about to let you pass this easily. \"What's the catch?\" you ask, hoping you won't regret your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodello's smile transformed into a bitter smirk. \"Oh, I'm glad you asked...\" He closes his eyes for a moment, and when they open back up, they're glowing purple behind his glasses. He begins chanting in a language completely unknown to you, and after a few seconds, the words begin to give you a throbbing headache. You move your hands to grip your head, but discover your hands have disappeared beneath your sleeves... and it seems your head is about to retreat beneath your collar! By some arcane force, you're shrinking right out of your clothes! You try to get moving, but you trip over your pant leg, falling flat on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you climb out of the pile of your clothes just as the shrinking stops. Suddenly, the room is no longer a short stroll from one end to the other. To your inch-high body, it's a vast landscape with mountains of cotton, silk, and leather. And the smell... gods, <i>the smell!</i> It was unpleasant at full-size, but now that you're tiny, forcing you to be at ground-level, where their rancid fog lingers, it's downright toxic! (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodello's squeaky voice booms high above you, echoing off the walls and shaking you to the core. <b>\"You see, us mice are weak and typically low on the hierarchy. Even among my brothers and sisters, I was the runt of the litter... but I found myself with a gift: supernatural attunement to the magical arts. I've brought dozens of humans to knee with just a simple charm spell whispered in their ears... and I would've done the same with you, had not the rules of this establishment forced me to give you a fighting chance!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puny monster, a powerful mage? You would've scoffed at the idea, but here you are, standing nude in a pile of your own clothes. You grit your teeth and leap down to the wooden planks. You swiftly dart forward, knowing that, despite what the mouse boy said, you are on a strict time limit. Sooner or later, the noxious odor of feet surrounding you is going to warp your mind and make you comatose with lust, and your only hope is to escape as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rush past piles of footwear and socks, you come across a pair of blue satin slippers. The stench around them is highly concentrated; just a single whiff forces you to stop running and start coughing. Despite your viscerally negative reaction, your cock instantly becomes stiff! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodello's ears pique up as he hears your hacking fit. <b>\"Found my favorite pair of slippers, have you? Ah, how I love roasting my toes in their warm embrace with my feet by the fire as I pore over my tomes. Countless nights have those slippers wrapped my sweaty feet, and never once have they been washed. Perhaps you'd like to join my feet in them after you concede, hmm?\"</b> (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the mouse's taunts and stumble away from the slippers. You shudder at the thought of being roasted under his hot, sweaty feet for hours on end, and yet, your cock twitches eagerly... you have to get out of here before it's too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of sprinting, you begin to notice something odd about the footwear strewn about. From above, it looked as if they were thrown around haphazardly. But now, being among them, you're starting to think they were placed around <i>very</i> deliberately. Then it hit you: every turn you took from the center of the room, where you would eventually run into Rodello, eventually made you veer right back. Clearly, he wants you to run past his feet, and he's certainly planning something when you do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you draw closer to the halfway point, you're unfortunately proven correct: all along his left and right side is a wall of smelly socks. Even if you crawled along the edge of the room the entire time, you would've faced the same hazard. They're not insurmountable, but time is of the essence. You look up to Rodello's gargantuan visage. The shine of his glasses prevents you from seeing his eyes, but his smug smirk is all too clear. He's got you right where he wants you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste even more precious seconds fretting on your decision, you start moving on instinct, going towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 75/100</span></div></div>",

Normally, they would be docile enough to slip past without much trouble, but if it happens to be mating season, they're horny enough to fuck the first hole they see... and you don't want it to be yours. Meanwhile, the right door could be <i>literally anything</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat leaves the middle door, and there's only one type of monster you can associate with raccoons: the tanuki. Tanukis are known to be fairly docile as far as monsters go, and even amicable at times. Many are content to live out their days as traders and are easily able to flit between human and monster settlements with their shapeshifting powers. It's widely believed that about one in three humans have interacted with a tanuki at some point in their life, whether they know it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that dealing with a tanuki would be the safest option and hope you can pass through with no trouble. You crack the door slightly ajar to see if you can take just one peek before barging in, but all you see is blackness. Regardless, you enter anyways. Just as when you entered, the door locked shut behind you and the lights flickered on, illuminating the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you found yourself in a sauna! The air was hot and stuffy and vapor gathered around your ankles. The only furniture in the room was a sturdy looking bench contrast with a flimsy table in front of it. On that bench sat the tanuki. He was covered from head to toe with greyish-brown fur. He was a full head taller than you, and quite a bit girthier, but you've seen enough fighters to know that with his type of body, layers of muscle are bound to be beneath that fat. You can't tell if he's \"old\" or not- he looks like an average tanuki you'd see in an illustration- but he certainly has an air of maturity and wisdom beyond your years to him. He was wearing naught but a short bath towel, and beneath it you could spy... the hugest testicles you've ever seen! Each one had to be bigger than your fist! You've heard rumors of tanukis' virility, but this is almost cartoonish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanuki gives you a friendly smile and a wave. Not exactly what you were expecting. Is he trying to lull you into a false sense of security? After an intense silence and a one-sided staredown, you finally speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what? Are you gonna try to seduce me?\" you ask, trying to hide the anxiousness in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanuki softly chuckles. \"My human-chasing days are long behind me, but if you're offering yourself...\" You scowl at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I can just walk through the door like that, and just be on my way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast,\" the tanuki says, shaking his head. Looking closer, you see a key hanging from his neck by a cord. That must be the key to the door out of here. You sigh, knowing better than to think it would be so easy. \"Alright then, what do I have to do to get that key, fight you for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing so boorish,\" the tanuki says, frowning slightly. \"I've been waiting here for hours with nary a soul in or out of my chambers. All I desire is some company for a few minutes, then you shall be on your way.\" He pats the bench to his left, beckoning you to sit. \"Please, have a seat.\" He then gestures to the table, which has a bottle of sake with two clay shot glasses on it. \"Have a drink as well, if you wish. And no, there's no footsweat or sleeping potion in it. Just famed tanuki-brewed sake.\" He pours himself a glass and drinks it himself as a show of good faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this situation is <i>highly </i>suspicious. You just know the tanuki is up to <i>something</i>, but at the same time, you don't have very many options to get that key from him, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 100/100</span></div></div>",

You take a cursory sniff, and it smells just as you would expect alcohol to. \"Kanpai!\" the tanuki cheers before throwing back his own shot. You join him, throwing the sake down your throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and promptly coughing and sputtering it back out. Heavens, that stuff is strong!

Hmm, I have a little proposition for you, then: if you can outdrink me, you can take the key and leave as you please. If you drop before I do, you have to give my feet a little tonguebath while you're down there, then you can be on your way... if you can stand back up, that is.\" You take a look at his feet, and you can instantly tell he wasn't lying about being in here for hours: his hairy, dull-claw-tipped toes are absolutely glistening with sweat.

A cringe runs down your spine as his heel inadvertently caresses your cock. (-5 MP) You try to get up, but his powerful legs keep you forced in your seat. \"You bastard!\" you begin to cry out. \"I knew I never should've-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" the tanuki interrupts in a soothing manner. \"I am not forcing myself upon you. I merely request a... friendly foot rub while we speak. The management does not appreciate it when I merely let humans go without some sort of ...<i>risque </i>action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could glare daggers, you'd see this monster pinned to the wall. Nevertheless, he continues. \"Come, now. If you can't handle a little foot rub, you would have no hope of making it past the second floor, let alone the rest. Think of this as... <i>practice</i>.\" He does have a point. You assume it only gets worse the higher you climb. Perhaps you should be glad he's only asking for a foot rub... and hope it stays just a foot rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh with resignation and begin rubbing, digging your thumbs into his padded, hairless soles. They're surprisingly soft for someone so well-traveled, and your thumbs easily sink into them. (-5 MP) Unfortunately, they're also quite a bit sweaty, as you would expect from someone having been in a sauna for so long. Squeezing his feet is akin to wringing out a damp sponge. Sweat cascades down his soles and across your hands. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanuki sighs contently as you massage his feet. \"Ahhh, much better. Now, I believe we are overdue for introductions. I am Kenta. And you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David! A pleasure to meet you.

Kusai, your master? That old fox? Come now, lad, tell me why you're <i>really </i>here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your heart drop and grit your teeth. \"How... how do you know who Kusai is... and how do you know I'm traveling with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta merely continues laughing. \"Me and him go way back. I'd always stop by his cave on my trading route, and he'd always want to sell me the most useless, gaudiest knickknacks I've ever seen at five times their worth! His damn silver tongue always got me to buy at least one, too. I'd curse the name if he wasn't such a good drinking buddy. As for how I know you're with him, why, I can recognize the stench of that fox anywhere! Now, c'mon, tell me why you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe sharply out your nose and look away from Kenta. \"...I'm here to earn gold to buy equipment sufficient to slay the Monster King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta cocks a bushy eyebrow, bemused. \"Oho! That old fox always talked about wanting to overthrow the King. Something about finding 'the human with the resolve to overcome the toughest odds.' I suppose if he's finally ventured out of that dusty cave, he must have found him in you. I only hope he placed his trust the right way... the odds do not get much tougher than in the House of Pleasures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of massaging and idle chit-chat, Kenta seems ready to let you go. \"Alright then lad, I can tell you're eager to get going...\" You try to get up, but his powerful legs keep you pinned down. \"...but there's just one more thing I must ask. The monsters on the higher floors are not nearly as gentle as I am. If one of them enslaves you, you can expect a short life of intense cruelty with your mind, body, and soul shattered... if you're lucky.\" Kenta raises his right foot onto your shoulder, leaving his sole just inches from your face. The cheesy, musky odor of his foot washes over you, flooding your mind with forbidden thoughts. Just when you think you couldn't feel any hotter, the heat pouring from his sweaty foot as well as your flushed cheeks make you feel like you're about to melt! (-5 MP) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you submit to me right now?\" Kenta asks. \"While I would be the dominant partner, we would be <i>partners</i>, at the very least. You will help me while I travel from city to city, trading with the locals. They will treat you with the same respect and dignity any trader deserves. You will be paid your fair share. When we are alone, you will have proper sleeping arrangements... and you may indulge in my feet from time to time. Don't think I didn't feel your growing erection while we spoke.\" Kenta punctuates his point by grabbing your shaft through your pants with his dexterous toes, causing you to bite your lip. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are more than welcome to decline my offer. Just know it is the most generous you will receive in the House. Should you accept...\" Kenta's right foot flexes forward, placing his big toe over your lips. You can feel your brain fizzle as the scent from between his toes wafts up your nose. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...part your lips, and accept my toe into your mouth as you accept your new lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, his \"generous\" offer is ridiculous on its face. How can you defeat the Monster King while being a sidekick to a tanuki and being forced to worship his stupid <i>sexy </i>feet? On the other hand... Kenta has planted the seeds of doubt in your mind. Can you really resist the advances of four more monsters? Was Kusai right to place his trust in you? Perhaps this new lifestyle is where you really belong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 70/100</span></div></div>",

You don't know if he's mocking you or not, but he has a point either way. You get down on all fours and begin your search anew. Being down here like a mutt, intentionally looking for a smelly pair of shoes... it's all very humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play hot-and-cold with your olfactory senses, going to where the smell of feet strengthens and adjusting course where it weakens.

Surely, you owe it another sniff, just to be absolutely sure these are what you're looking for. Even if you had a sniff with them in your hands, would it really be that bad being this kobold's slave?

I mean...\" he seems to be a little confused about his feelings. \"I'm happy you did the challenge, it was really fun watching you go! But also, I was <i>really </i>hoping you'd lose! I don't have any slaves of my own, and you look like you'd be the perfect first one! Maybe even the only one if you're really good!

It's been a long while since I've had someone choose my room! Guess bees aren't that popular...\" he seemed to deflate a little at that, and you couldn't help but feel kinda bad for him. He seemed pretty lonely \"Yeah, leaving the hive wasn't the best of ideas.... Anyways! I'm guessing you wanna know the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What do I need to do?\" you ask. The bee smiled and pointed at the wall right next to the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behind that pile of honey is the key\" he explained. Peeking over, you could see something inside the glob \"Well, half the key\" the bee said, holding up the other half \"You have to get it without eating any of the honey. If so much as a drop inside your mouth, you lose and become my slave\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I just don't have to eat honey?\" you say, shaking your head \"This might be the easiest yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really don't know anything about bees, do you?\" the bee giggled \"Our honey is really hypnotic. The smell makes you want to eat it, makes you crave it. And when you eat it? The effect is stronger than the smell of a kitsune's feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, you gulp and take another glance at the bee and the wall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck,\" the bee said, making you look at him in confusion \"What? I don't mind if you win! I got to meet someone new! And if you lose, I get a nice, obedient, and happy slave! It's win-win for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you walk to honey coated wall and start digging through the golden goop</span></div></div>",

The honey's scent was utterly delectable, and as you scooped through it with your fingers, you felt your stomach growl loudly. You heard a quiet chuckle from the boyish bee behind you, but you tiredly decide to ignore it. (-9 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes traced the path of the sticky yellow goo as it molded back into the pile. From the higher parts of the ceiling, more honey sunk with alarming rapidity, filling the hole you made in a few seconds. Ugh, looks like this'll be harder than you thought. You grasped large clumps of the stuff and ripped it away from the main body, tossing them onto the floor. You made some decent progress, getting a few inches closer to the key, its murky visage becoming clearer, more defined. Subconsciously, though, you began to move your face forward; partly because you were trying to find the optimal amount of honey to scoop, partially because its saccharine smell was luring you in. As diligent as you had been, you were bound to make a mistake somewhere, and when the key was nearly in your grasp, you slipped up. Your incessant pulling at the viscous honey had left little flecks on the stuff on your face, and when you gave one last good pull to force the key out of its goopy prison, you instinctively flicked your tongue out in strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the flecks of honey touched your taste buds, your dick shot straight out, hard as a rock. All inhibitions left you as you opened your mouth and chomped down on the soft, sticky ball of the sweet stuff. You dry humped the air as the aphrodisiac overwhelmed you, but you were soon pulled away by the bee boy. He was wearing an ecstatic smile; obviously, he hadn't expected you to lose after that impressive display of self-control you made. Without so much as a word of warning, he pulled you in for a kiss. parting your lips with his tongue and entwining his with yours. Still under the effects of the honey, you returned the embrace in tenfold, squeezing him into a tight hug and forcefully tonguing his mouth. You both moaned in pleasure, muffled by the kiss. His legs slid against yours until your inner thigh pressed hard against his groin. Your tents, both thoroughly defined in each other's legwear, were squashed together. Even though it was covered by the sleek fabric of the shorts, you could feel him pulsing, erect without care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, hnnnn!\" he yelped, letting your tongue take control. You ravaged his mouth, exploring each and every inch of it as you continued to grind against him. \"Mnnnh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and the bee were rapidly approaching climax. Lust pumped through your veins; something about pushing this twink down and letting him have it was sending you to new heights of pleasure. You wrap him closer to you, thrusting into his crotch as you hold him in the air. Your rod was quivering, and his was, too; you can't...take...much more of this...!!! (-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cum in tandem with the bee in your arms, jizz staining the front of your pants. Most of it was yours, but you could tell by the dampness of the boy's spats that you had left a damn good mark on him too. Sighing, you slide against the wall and to the ground, taking the trial-captain with you. For a moment, you both lay there, snuggling each other. Any thought of continuing your quest was quashed by the pleasant contentment you felt when you cuddled with this cute bee boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trance you were under broke when you heard him sniff. Your stomach started to twist itself in knots. Did you do something wrong? The thought of hurting or failing him in any way made you want to vomit. Reluctantly, you shift your gaze to his face, still having trouble with the concept of disappointing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw instead was the face of a very, <i>very</i> happy bee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...\" he whispered, tears of joy running down his blushing face. \"I'll be honest, I was lying a bit about not minding if you won. I've been so lonely since I left the hive that seeing another person go would've really stung...but now, I don't have to worry about that...now, I have <i>you!</i> Hahahaha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart lifted, and you don't think you've ever felt this overjoyed in your life. He accepted you! He wanted to <i>be</i> with you! Overcome with excitement, you press your lips to his again, giving him a hard, quick peck, and continuing to nuzzle yourself into him. He returns the gesture just as cheerfully, happy to finally have a faithful companion at his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next several hours railing each other in all sorts of positions. A recurring theme was the proximity of his feet to your face; whenever he faced forward as you dicked him, he smothered you with his soles. They'd been stewing in his boots while your embraces got steamier, so when he freed them from their well-worn confines, you were hit with an amazingly pungent aroma. They reeked of both honey and sweat, and when they pushed against your face, you lapped up the addictive mixture with reckless abandon. As you rammed your rod into his hole, you sucked his toes like a starving wanderer, mouth aching for more of the delicious liquid like it was the first sustenance you had in ages. Sometimes, he'd do the same to you, and you'd fill each other with hot, dripping seed. It was a mind-blowing experience, and not a thought of Kusai passed through your mind as you made passionate love to this lonely bee boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you two had exhausted yourselves, your new owner parted from you briefly, leaving you whining pitifully. You saw the pained look on his face as he stared resentfully down at the slave collar meant for you. Sure, he'd love to have you with him forever, but...it just didn't feel right, permanently altering your mind like that. You could probably argue that honey addiction is basically the same thing, but you didn't even consider it wrong, having just submitted to it. Scowling, the bee boy tossed it aside, confident in your loyalty to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gazes into your eyes as he pulls you up off the ground. \"Okay, let's go home and get some rest, sla--er, I mean, <i>friend!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wordlessly agree, hugging him with one arm as you both traipse out of the room and down to the foyer. You were so enamored by your new bee lover that you didn't even notice Kusai pocket his orb from you, a hurt look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, your journey ended in the arms of a lowly bee boy. For the rest of your days, you traveled with him, enjoying food (sometimes together, sometimes at his feet), exploring the world, and of course, fucking like rabbits. You were truly content being his love slave, tasting his honey every day of your life. With the help of another adventurer and a wily Kitsune, the reign of the Monster King and his cronies eventually ended, but by that time, you and your lover were long dead. At least you enjoyed your life while it lasted...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve got bee boys, who are all sticky, hive minded, and have their aphrodisiac stingers. You\u2019ve got harpies, who are probably the least hygienic Monster Boys out there. Not necessarily the smelliest, but most Monsters just have foot odor problems, not all this other stuff. Then there\u2019s the mystery door, which could be anywhere from a fairy, and you already know how THAT will go, to a freaking wyvern or something. Screw it, maybe the harpy\u2019s B.O. will turn you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head into the Harpy room and, just like you expected, it fucking reeks in here. The room looks like a bunch of birds got caught in a tornado or something. There\u2019s twigs, leaves, and feathers everywhere. In the center of the room, a Harpy boy is laying around in the middle of a nest. He waves at you with a wing, and that simple gesture wafts a wall of stink your way. A nasty cocktail of musk and talon stink fills your lungs, making you gag! Gah, he smells way worse than the one by the gate! (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya there!\u201d He chirps as you make your way towards him. \u201cReaaady for your third challenge? It\u2019s super easy! All you have to do is not pull your pants and undies down! For fifteen minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. \u201cW\u2026what? I just have to not whip my dick out around you?\u201d You ask while taking a seat in his nest when he gestures for you to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harpy pulls out an hourglass and flips it over. \u201cMhm! I just have to try and get you to with my various techniques! Wings, then mouth, then my butt, then finally my talons!\u201d He stands up and slinks around you. The avian\u2019s nasty body odor makes you cough again, and his wing wraps around you. Despite the terrible stench, his feathers are\u2026r-really soft! His wing caresses your skin, making you shiver in delight. \u201cHeh, see how niiice that feels? Bet it\u2019d feel even better on your cock\u2026come on\u2026don\u2019t you wanna try? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll loooove it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGah, now you understand what\u2019s so hard about this challenge. He\u2019s really good at making you feel incredible with a simple caress of his wings. Thoughts of surrender are already creeping in\u2026it\u2019d probably feel amazing if you gave in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP; 45/100</span></div></div>",

His feathers gently tickle your arms and neck, making it harder to divert your focus away from him. The harpy grins at you, goading you to submit. \"C'moooon... y'know, I've made thousands of men cum and thousands of ladies squirt just from rubbing my wings on their bits... wouldn't you like to know how that feels?\" He must be exaggerating, there's no way a single monster boy can tempt <i>thousands</i>... but, feeling his wings caress you, you start to doubt that thought... (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he acquiesces. Before you can catch your breath, he lets loose a long lick up the side of your neck. \"Mouth time!\" His tongue slides up your neck, along your cheek, and up to your ear, which he then sensually nibbles on. You open your mouth to groan in pleasure and frustration, and it seems the harpy was waiting for that! He takes the opportunity to press his lips to yours, forcing his tongue into your mouth. Your eyes shoot wide open, and then droop back as he uses his tongue to massage the insides of your mouth. You try to push back with your tongue, but this only results in the tongues getting intertwined, deepening the lustful kiss. All the while, his thigh pushes against your groin, stiffening your growing erection. (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how long it's been since since he started kissing you, but he eventually breaks the sloppy makeout with a loud <i>mwah</i>. While you're still dazed from the kiss, he turns around, bends over, and presents his rather large rear end to you. He takes a few steps back, pressing his ass against your bulge. His ass gyrates, rubbing against your cock so hard you swear it's about to catch fire! \"Look at my ass, isn't it so <i>big and soft</i>? Don't you just want to whip out your cock and shove it in <i>right now</i>? C'mon, at least give it a <i>squeeze</i>!\" You can't bring yourself to whip your cock out, even though you <i>really</i> want to, but grabbing it won't hurt, would it? You gently push your hands into the harpy's rear, and watch in amazement as they almost entirely sink into the soft, supple flesh! There's no possible way an ass can be this soft! (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you think you're about to cave, you manage to rip your eyes from the jiggling ass assaulting your cock and take a peek at the hourglass. There's hardly any grains of sand left! You can still do this! Worryingly, the harpy looks unconcerned. \"You've done better than most, I'll give you that... but nobody makes it past the grand finale!\" With that, the harpy takes flight, hovering just above you. He juts his feet out, holding his yellow, filthy feet just an inch from your face. The stench hits you like a brick wall! You stagger backwards slightly, but the harpy stays on you, never letting you get more than an inch away from his feet. \"C,mon, stupid! Take that cock out and stroke it for your master! You want these feet, don't you? Hurry up... the timer's about to run out, and when it does, you'll never get to see them again~!\" He wiggles his cheesy talons, flicking some footdirt onto your face. (-15 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take it anymore! You do want those feet! And ass, and mouth, and feathers... you want every part of your master! You waste no time ripping your pants and underwear away, grabbing your dick and furiously stroking it, leaning forward to press your face against his disgusting feet. The harpy laughs at you smugly as he curls his talons into your hair. \"Haha, you actually threw away your life for a pair of nasty feet, <i>loser</i>! Just think, you could've came thinking about my feathers, or my ass, but no! You gave it up for <i>feet</i>!\" After he's done laughing at you, the harpy begins reciting. \"Your fate has been sealed! A moment of pleasure for a lifetime of ruin! You now belong to me, Robin the Harpy! You have given in to Temptation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirals fill your vision and a collar begins to form around your neck, but you don't particularly care, you just keep huffing Robin's feet and stroking. As the collar completes and your vision is filled, you blow the biggest load your life, dribbling from your cock and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your spiraled eyes and empty grin, you don't notice Robin strip you completely of the rest of your clothes and possessions. After all, a good slave shouldn't have things, anyways. Robin reprograms you to be his completely useless, totally reliant sex slave. He grabs your shoulders with his talons and carries your limp body back to his nest in the mountains. You never see the outside world again. Robin uses you to worship the smelliest parts of his body, from his feet, to his ass, to his wingpits. Every time Robin feels horny, he uses your mouth or your ass as a fuckhole, shooting his seed deep inside of you. When he's feeling nice, he allows you to jack off while you smell and lick his feet. You sleep on a pile of filthy used socks. The smell of your bedding keeps you perpetually horny and gives you twisted sexual nightmares about feet. The person who you were before you entered the House of Temptation would be disgusted with how you ended up living the rest of your life, but you couldn't care less, as long as Master Robin keeps your holes full and allows you to worship his body.</span></div></div>",

You don't doubt his claims that they'd feel amazing on your dick, but you didn't come this far just to give up now! Upon seeing that his wings won't to the trick, the harpy slinks around and just lets his mouth slowly slide open. His breath certainly isn't fresh, and the smell makes you cough a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggles at your reaction and gives you a sly wink as his teasing continues. \"Well, if my wings won't satisfy you...maybe you'd like me to just...suck you off? I'm really, reeeaaally good at it...I've even made men go crazy from the pleasure before!\" His tongue lolls out and drips a line of drool. G-gah...it looks so inviting! Your cock throbs and aches in your pants, practically begging you to free it! (-5 MP) B-but your free will is worth more than a blowjob! You turn away from the harpy, trying to just get the sight of his drooling mouth out of your mind. Of course, you can still picture it, and it's still hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, a good amount of time has elapsed, but you aren't sure how long you can hold out! No wonder so many people go missing in Harpy territory if they're like this! You close your eyes for a moment to try and focus yourself, but when you open them again, you find yourself staring right at his ass! It's surprisingly plush for a flying monster to have, and blegh! That signature harpy stink radiates off of it! (-5 MP) He's hovering in the air right in front of you, and his smelly rear end jiggles with every flap of his wings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy is definitely amused by your reaction to his scent, and he's all too happy to give you a full whiff! \"Catch!\" He shouts as he flaps his wings forwards, propelling his whole body backwards! His butt crashes right into your face, and his body pins yours to the floor. The harpy wiggles his chubby rear around, making sure you get good and familiar with it. \"Hehe! Come onnnn! Don't you like my stinky booty?~ Just pull those pants down and I can suck you off while you enjoy~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now forced to take up close sniffs of his stink, and it's definitely taking a toll on your mind! Not as much as his foot odor would, but you're really having a hard time even remembering why you have to resist! (-10) His ass is just so perfect...so plump and squishy. You even reach up and let your fingers just sink into the flesh a bit. Despite it all though, you refuse to take off your pants, much to the harpy's surprise. Time is running out now, but he still has one last trick up his lack of sleeves! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foul posterior lifts up off your face, and you're instead greeted with something even more rancid! His filthy talons smoosh against your nose and mouth, smothering them in dirt and stink! The vile scent shocks your mind...his feet are so odd and birdlike, but you can't help but sniff! (-15 MP) Your dick is so painfully hard that it feels like it just might tear through your pants and lose this challenge for you! Then again, would that really be so bad? You'd get to have your way with these vile talons forever...you take another sniff, and your hands start to slowly grab your waistband...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up!\" The harpy shouts, snapping you out of your stupor. He flaps away from you, but your eyes never leave his birdlike feet. \"Awww! You want my stinky talons? Well you should've given in! Now go on, get!\" He sticks his tongue out at you and tosses the key your way. Your heart sinks as you take it and step up the stairs to the next set of-hello, what's this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's still a set of doors in front of you. From the looks of it, there's a slime, an alraune, and a manticore boy ahead. Monster boys that don't fit much into typical animal like classifications. However, your attention is instead focused on the green haired catboy in the maid outfit sitting in a chair in here! He stands up upon seeing you enter and gives you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome! Conyadulations! You've made it halfway through the House of Temptnyation! You've probably guessed by nyaow, but very, very few humans ever make it this far, nya! In fact, we had to put me here because nyabody could beat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're only half listening to the cat-maid's words and strange inflections. You know for a fact that cat boys don't actually like...have to do the whole \"nya\" thing. They just do it because it drives some humans wild. However, your interest lies much more in his white stockings and maid flats. Or rather, the ominous green mist you can faintly see wafting out of them. Sheesh...just how bad are his feet? And what do you have to do to get him to step on you!? (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catboy giggles at you and continues his explanation, \"sooo...anyaways, here's what this is about! I have a tea that can fully refresh your mind! Buuut...if you take it, your prize will be reduced to only one thousand gold, or five hunyadred gold and a slave. Anya one of the monyaster boys you encounyatered here can be taken for the slave, even me!\" He shifts his feet now and purrs softly at you. \"Orrrr...I can offer you a sniff of my shoes! You can be my footslave after...if you survive the smell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost orgasm at the mere thought of stuffing your nose in those flats! B...but should you? Should you take the tea?

The bravado you held so far was stopped in its tracks when he made it abundantly clear that he didn't care about the consequences of hurting you if he just got the chance to claw your eyes out. Panicking, you duck into the nearest door, which just so happened to be the one leading to the mystery monster boy, and slammed it shut. You can feel the cat boy beating on the wood, and the creaking you hear does <i>not</i> sound good for its long term use. Eventually, though, he stops, growling to himself as he walks over to the puddle you left on the floor. The rush of fear you felt also helped to dispel the haze of footlust in your mind.

It's potent, too- just one whiff is enough to make your face wrinkle up in disgust. (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly get back to your feet, careful not to repeat the mistake, and inspect the room. Sure enough, puddles of blue slime are everywhere- on the floor, the walls, and even dripping from the ceiling. Most distinct about this room was that there was a massive chasm bisecting the room. It was much too long to jump across. The only way across was a flimsy-looking length of plank bridging the two sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, you can see your enemy of this floor: a bored-looking slime boy. He would look like an average human male in his late teens were he not entirely comprised of semi-translucent slime. The slime on top of his head is fashioned into the shape of a shaggy mop of hair extending down to his neck. He is standing around and impatiently tapping his foot, splashing a puddle of his own goo. When he sees you come in, he straightens his posture and greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, welcome to floor 4. So like, the challenge for this one is to... get to the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" you asked. You were used to more complex games than this, and you assumed they would only get harder the farther you went, but this one seemed simple... too simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" the slime boy affirmed. \"It's like, really hard, though. I've seen two, maybe three humans do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I fail?\" You were sure you weren't just going to get up and try again if you slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah. You'll see. Good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime boy spread his arms out and... fell belly-first into the pit? A second after falling, you heard a loud splash, and saw some more blue goo splash out of the pit onto its edges. You carefully approached the edge of the pit and peered into it. The first thing you noticed that it was deep enough that surely it would extend into the room below it. By what arcane means does this building keep such strange geometry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pit was filled with blue slime. At least you don't have to worry about cracking your neck if you slip into it. But, as you looked, you saw a pair of blue, slimy feet rise from the murky depths. Then another. Then another. Soon there was a dozen pairs of feet. Not long after, there were well over a hundred. The feet grew so numerous and so dense that you could no longer make out the sea of slime beneath them, only the hundreds of smelly, slimy feet all wiggling their toes and rubbing together... all awaiting you. The thought of falling into them was enough to chill your blood. On the bright side, you saw a ramp on the right side that would allow you to climb back up and try again... if you could get through the sea of feet. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the plank meant to get you across. Sure enough, it was covered in a thick layer of slime. It was so thin you would have to bring one foot in front of the other to successfully pass. Each step meant the slightest shift in balance could send you careening into the footy abyss. You took deep breaths to relax your posture. Carrying any tension with you onto the plank could prove too weighty. You take your first step onto the wood...</span></div></div>",

There's no telling what a Kitsune that isn't as smitten with you as Kusai would do. They're known tricksters, so you could easily get duped into losing. Even if he's likely the weakest of the lot, you don't even WANT to think about how bad a skunk boy would smell. You'd probably get knocked out the second you walked into the room. The odds of you winning against a dragon is fairly slim, and taking the mystery path is just an awful idea. Better the devil you know, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously enter the demon boy's room. Unfortunately, as with the slime boy's, you can already smell a thick, cheesy musk the second you open the door (-5 MP). This time, though, there's no blue slime splattered all over the walls to help it spread. Whoever this demon was, you can already tell they have the second-raunchiest feet you've ever smelled in your life next to Kusai (not that you want to expand that list, mind you). You're pretty sure that if you got up close, they'd be even worse than those awful, disgusting harpies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you look around the room, you notice that it isn't really what you expected. You thought this place would be some scorching hot wasteland, where the monster boy was keeping his feet nice and sweaty for the trial-goers, but you were wrong. It was actually slightly chilly in here--though that might just be because you have no clothes on. The aesthetic was almost like an extension of the cave from earlier, with a slightly uneven, rocky terrain. There were a few holes that you'd think were geysers if you were anywhere but here. Steam was rising up from them at a leisurely pace, and it didn't seem to heat up the room, or even dissipate. it just kind of...stayed where it was, fixed like it was stuck in an invisible chamber of some kind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I know what you were thinking, boy!\" A light, matter-of-fact voice rang out from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump at the sudden remark, and turn around to face the host of your toughest challenge yet. He was a slim, yet strong-looking demon, floating in the air even without the use of his wings. His skin was bright red, his hair pitch black, and his face was boyishly handsome, to the point that it felt weird that <i>he</i> was the one calling <i>you</i> 'boy'. You blush as a desire to kiss him on the lips grows within your chest. If he can charm you this easily, you really need to get this trial over with (-5 MP)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just say that I take no offense to your stereotypical depiction of my kind,\" he quips, an amused, if haughty tone in his voice, \"Besides, this trial was designed to be <i>fair.</i> If I let my dogs cook in the temperatures you were thinking of, I could have a monster boy like Kenta begging for more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart stops at the implications of his words. That Tanuki boy didn't seem at <i>all</i> like the type of person to be subservient. You need to stay vigilant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, as the demon boy continues to speak to you, your eyes wander down from his face. You trace his subtle musculature, from his collarbone, to his abs, and down to his massive cock. You've heard of demons of lust having larger genitals than usual, but his was practically as big and thick as your forearm! It dangled flaccidly in the windless air of the room. You feel your mouth water and your eyes glaze over (-5 MP)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand slaps your chin up, returning your gaze to the demon's face. \"Whoa there, boy; I'm here so I can watch you struggle, not so you can instantly bow down to worship me! Though I do appreciate the compliment,\" he chuckles, mocking you. \"And, in case you forgot, my johnson isn't what you're supposed to be afraid of; THESE are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushes himself back in the air, lying back and sticking his feet out. Instantly, the pungent aroma of his peds comes out in full force. You feel like you've been paralyzed! All you can do is stare at your soon-to-be destroyers. Every square inch of skin, every curve of their flesh was perfectly crafted. They were supple and shapely, with long, pudgy toes that wiggled in your face. As you took in the sight (and smell), you felt your own member starting to firm (-10 MP)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon boy laughs at how quickly you've become aroused. You snap out of your trance and shoot him a dirty look. Even when he was happily explaining his trial, he looked eager for mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! I'll stop teasing you,\" he relents, resuming his standing position in the air. \"Okay, so the trial is pretty simple. You just have to walk across to the other side of the room without blowing your load three times.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a good look at the exit, the distraction from the demon boy's soles allowing you to focus on preemptively mapping out the path of least resistance in your head. \"Hey hey, no cheating, boy! The trial hasn't begun yet,\" he grins, \"For that to happen, I have to <b>assume the position!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil darts behind you, wrapping his arms around your chest and gently hovering his bare feet just centimeters away from your erection. You feel his hot, thick, throbbing cock pressed up against your back, and just barely restrain yourself from shuddering. Your dick needs to touch his soles as little as possible if you want to keep your mind intact (-5 MP)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the trial begin!\" the demon cheers, signaling you to walk forward. Truly, this was an elaborate method of torture. If you ran, your rod would slap against his soft, slippery feet, weakening your resolve; but if you tried to walk, the alluringly potent stench would also inch you closer to orgasm.

You'd think to damn him in your mind, were you not so overtaken with your goal, and his feet. You're almost thankful when the demon boy provides you a distraction from both his feet and the sensation of his body against yours, but he makes it clear soon enough that he doesn't mean to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he remarks, \"Were you wondering what the bizarre, steaming holes in the ground were?\" You nod your head yes, shuddering at the feeling of his dick pressing tighter against your back, and his chin resting on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this room sees use more often than you'd think. Lots of humans come by, only to throw their lives away at monster feet. Most of these monsters have articles of footwear, yes? Those who come to be trial masters, like me, are required to store their 'instruments of torture' inside the building. I, for one, have dozens upon dozens of such things, to the point where I needed to create multiple chambers to keep them safe from any mindbroken slaves who want to pilfer or defile them. Unfortunately, I've become so adept at breaking minds that using anything other than just these numbers-\" he pauses, wiggling his toes, \"-is utter child's play. To give contestants a true chance, I've taken everything; my shoes, my socks, my toe rings, my sweat rags, and even my stirrups, and locked them away in those holes. I even used some magic to keep their combined stench from billowing out into the room. One whiff of that, and you'd probably cum for hours on end,\" he snickered, ending his long-winded story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping your gait, you let your gaze wander to each and every geyser in the room. All that sweat, all that filth, forced into one space... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, and notice that you've already let loose your first load. The throbbing of the demon boy's dick grows stronger, and more frequent. Your mind is cloudy, assaulted as it is by the overwhelming sensations flowing into your body. (-25 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're trembling. You feel a horrific mix of dread and arousal, far more intense than anything you've felt in your entire life. Your legs lock up, shaking at the sheer eroticism of this demon, and you have an epiphany. There's no way you're going to get through this gauntlet. Giving up, you breathe out, crouch down, and huff the perfect, cheesy fumes of the demon boy's feet. (-30 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan out as you ejaculate all over the rocky floor. The force of it shakes you to your core, and when you buckle over, your dick swings into the delicate, sweaty flesh of his soles, nearly making you cum again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirthful laugh softly echoes into your ear. \"I see you already have two strikes. Do you want me to get it over with?\" You furiously nod. \"Hehehe...here you go, boy,\" he lustfully giggles, <i>\"Get it while it's hot~\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the demon boy's peds slam into the sides of your rod, vigorously jerking you off. You drop to the floor, getting on your knees as you prepare to be milked. Thrusting and bucking along with his movements, you feel yourself speeding to yet another climax, despite the recency of the previous two. It doesn't take long; you're overcome yet again, this time cumming in unison with your gracious master. (-50 MP) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you give up your seed, you collapse to the ground, bringing the demon with you. Your vision was pure white for a few moments, the sheer force of your repeated orgasms leaving you temporarily blind. You're only knocked out of your blissful trance when you feel something plunk from the top of your forehead onto the rocks below. A hot, thick, sticky goo had spurted from the demon boy's member, dribbling into your hair, and dripping down your neck and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I knew this was a good idea. I haven't felt this good in months...\" he mumbles, still hugging himself tightly into your frame. \"I hoped to give you a fair chance, but I guess my droning made it hard for you to focus. You know, normally, I'd just recite that whole 'Your fate has been sealed' mantra and slap a collar around your neck, but I'm feeling grateful right now. For pleasuring me, and lasting more than a few seconds, I'll let you take an exclusive, expenses-paid trip to one of my footsweat geysers. All you have to do is clean all the cum off the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even stop to think; your mind has already been enslaved to the demon's will. Sticking out your tongue as far as it can go, you press it into the growing pools of semen and start lapping it up like the dog you are. It's salty, and terribly bitter, but if it came from master, it must be good for you! You continue to suck up the loads both of you ejected onto the floor, letting them flow down your throat and become a part of you. You even get the sacred duty of cleaning up more of the demon boy's spooge as he wanks one out to the utter depravity he has instilled in your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a soft hand rub into your scalp, and you push your head into the source of the touch, humming with desire. \"You did an amazing job! <i>Good boy...</i>\" When his praise hit your ears, you almost came again. \"Whoa there, easy boy! Just hold on a bit longer, and I'll let you experience paradise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon boy picked you up, floated over to the nearest geyser, and gave you one final kiss on the cheek. \"Enjoy the rest of your life buried beneath me!\" He says his goodbye, and unceremoniously tosses you into the deep, yawning hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the rest of your days in a constant state of orgasm. The overwhelming reek of the various socks and shoes, all utterly torn apart and stewing in a bath of fermented foot sweat, has seeped into every pore, every square inch of your body, and you wouldn't have it any other way.</span></div></div>",

Your heart is pounding in your chest; you think you can keep your grip, but you can't say for sure that you can pull yourself up...it's probably for the best that you just shimmy along the side and try to climb the ridge on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually manage to gain some ground, since there were so many gaps between each board. The slime, for whatever reason, didn't stick too well to the hemp, so your hold was still firm. That didn't mean the slime boy would just let you go, though. At that thought, you instinctively look down, shattering your concentration. The pool of blue sludge had steadily risen since your little fall! By now, the space between you and your sticky, sinful doom is about the size of your body, and you were only halfway to the end! Scrambling you try as hard as you can to reach the ridge, but the slime is rising faster than you can travel. Not to mention, the cheesy, enrapturing stench of the gooey soles only grew as the rift between you closed... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you can't stop! The exit was only a few feet away! B-but, the <i>smell...</i>the alluring, mind-consuming <i>smell...</i> (-15 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little break, that little stop that you just made, just sealed your fate. The ocean of blue feet closed the gap, and you could feel them swiping pleasantly against your own bare feet. Soon, they swallowed up your legs, brushing lovingly against your skin. They rose, pressing against your inner thighs, until finally, they poured over your quivering cock. You moan, releasing your death grip on your one chance at freedom, and fall face-first into the cool, plush, slimy embrace of hundreds of gooey feet. They welcome you with great fervor, pushing and rubbing against your body, exposing your nose to the purest form of foot funk; most of all, they treated you to an intense, otherworldly massage, wiggling their toes and slapping their soles against your swelling, throbbing genitals until you explode. You can actually see your semen being collected and digested into nothing, the clearness of your slimy lovers allowing you the sight. Already hard again, you buck into the sweaty, slick soles, losing yourself in the ungodly bliss of goopy, delicious <i>feet...</i></span></div></div>",

Absorbed as you were into the pile of dank, gooey feet, you couldn't wrest yourself free from the pleasurable grasp of the slimy soles on your cock. Even the horrific stench wasn't enough to dissuade you from leaning into the stimulation, spread out on all fours, allowing the feet swarming around you to more easily envelop you in their soft, cool, yet overwhelming embrace.  Subconsciously, you began to rock your hips in unison with the affectionate soles, their perfectly sculpted form bringing you to new heights of arousal. You moaned relentlessly, enraptured by the otherworldly sensation. (-20 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a particularly supple pair of slimy blue feet form out of the goo just below your head. Taking advantage of your predicament, they latch onto your face. Your vision was covered entirely by the thick pads of two large toes. Your nose, meanwhile, was submerged in the crevice between them. You recognized this, and tried to breath out of your mouth, only to be greeted to another foot making itself welcome there. Its length was shoved to the back of your throat, moist toes wiggling all the way. A sticky, tangy texture coated the insides of your cheeks and splashed out onto your tongue, which laid flat against the floor of your mouth. You couldn't even gag, with how little space was left. The ped lodged in your windpipe moved rhythmically, pumping in and out of your throat, stretching it wider than ever before. With panic flooding your body at the lack of oxygen, you involuntarily huffed through your nose. A horrendous, burning reek singed your nostrils; the contaminated air flowed into every nook and cranny of your lungs, leaving no square inch untainted by the putrescent musk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of sexual stimulation and olfactory violation was far, far too much. Your body was wracked with an intense duality of pain and pleasure, and for a brief moment, you lost control. That's all it took for you to submit, completely and utterly (-20 MP).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came. Rope after rope, you spurted out into the ocean of slime around you. The impossibly smooth feet encompassing your member squeezed tightly, making sure to leave no drop of semen wasted. Your tongue splayed out, roaming the sole of the conquesting appendage, and washing your taste buds anew with the potent zest of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to compose yourself, but it hardly matters anymore. You're a slave to your desires, and your desires tell you that your new lot in life is to be drained dry by these wonderful blue soles around you. After a minute or two, the sea of slime renews its pleasurable attack on your senses, squishing hard against your body as if to trap you further in its hold. You eagerly accepted it, hugging your arms around the sapphire fluid in an attempt to return the gesture. A lifetime of milking awaited you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were more cognizant, you might've heard an amused chuckle echo throughout the dim, cavernous room\u2014but as awash as you were with the intimate sensation of being surrounded by cool, flowing slime, you couldn't focus on anything but appeasing your own newfound lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never returned from the House of Temptation; Instead, you met your sticky end as a thrall for a very powerful slime...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, you're not quite as excited given that your prize has diminished, but at least you won't be enslaved the instant you step into the next room. Looking at your options, you find yourself legitimately curious about the Manticore. They normally live far away from not only humans, but other monsters. Few humans have ever seen one! You really don't want to pass up that chance! That way, if you ever encounter this dangerous monster in your travels, you'll know what to do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room to find him lounging around on a bed. He's got scarlet hair and cat ears atop his head. Where normally you'd see hands and feet, he's got big, red lion paws! And fitting for a high level monster, his feet smell terrible! (-10 MP) Out of his rear extends a long, hard tail somewhat resembling a scorpion's. However, there's no stinger on the end. Instead, there's a bulb that splits open so they can milk guys with it. Manticores apparently get stronger if they use that to drink someone's jizz. Which is freaking weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manticore boy yawns and stretches when he sees you and sits up on the bed. \"Oh, you actually made it past Robin? Neat. Come uh, come on over here will you? And take your clothes off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're honestly taken aback by how calm the Manticore boy seems. He almost looks like he doesn't actually care that you're here. You know the drill by this point so you do as he says and strip. \"Alright, what nowwowooaaah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cuts you off as his tail opens up and latches onto your cock. The strange bulb starts to slurp and squeeze your dick, and it feels like heaven! You fall down to your knees, only to have your face smothered by his huge lion paws! Up close like this, the smell shocks your brain as much as the pleasure does! (-20 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so here's my game. I'm gonna milk you till you cum five times. If you pull out of my tail before cumming a sixth, you win. You've got to keep from becoming addicted, and keep your wits enough to keep count. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes back to laying on his bed while his noxious paws remain pressed in your face. This is going to be incredibly hard. You've only had his amazing tail sucking you for twenty seconds and you already feel ready to...t-to...\"HYAAAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well there's one orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 70/100</span></div></div>",

To top this off, on top of getting more powerful (this extends to their scent) the more cum their tail sucks up, they also get hornier! At this point, your captor starts to stroke his own growing cock as he begins to more actively smother your face in his giant, rancid paws. The combination of the stink, the milking, and the sheer domination is driving you insane! (-30 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly find grow more and more addicted, even occasionally finding yourself taking willing whiffs of his disgusting odour. The manticore feels this and decides to make you a little more comfortable, wrapping you in his tail and placing you on the bed, never once stopping his paws or bulb from torturing you. Being restrained and helpless like this only adds to your arousal, and you you quickly feel your second orgasm coming, even more intense than the last one (-20 MP)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou <b>need</b> to submit at this point, and so you begin taking huge lungfuls of the stink in hopes that you can send a signal of your submission to your new master. The manticore boy knows full well what you want, but being even hornier only makes him want to play with you more. \u201cI did say you needed to cum <i>six</i> times before I make you my slave...\u201d he says with a smirk. Hearing this, you abandon all inhibition and begin thrusting your dick into his bulb, hoping he\u2019d milk you as fast as possible that way. But the manticore wants to extend your torture, so he makes sure to clamp around the base of your dick every time he feels your orgasm coming, effectively keeping you on edge as long as he wants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination of powerful stink being violently pumped into you as well as how ridiculously horny the edging is making you is enough to completely shatter any sliver of sanity left in you (-10000000 MP) and you begin kissing and licking your master\u2019s feet out of pure desperation to cum. He keeps this torture going for hours and hours, occasionally letting an orgasm occur just so he could power up his stink and drive you further into depravity. He doesn\u2019t even have to keep you restrained anymore as you willingly give your entire being to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 14 hours of this insane sexual torture, the manticore boy, now too horny to resist having you completely to himself and smelling so awful that he could rival, and perhaps even best, any Kitsune boy, allows you to have your sixth orgasm to seal your fate as his slave. He immediately sticks his enormous dick into you and begins pumping it in and out of your needy hole. He fucks you in more ways you can imagine: railing you sideways, pulling you down on his cock with his tail, assuming a plank position and challenging you to use your ass muscles to hang on to his rod, etc. All the while, you\u2019re engulfed in his incredibly strong stink, making you eternally horny. You spend the rest of your days getting milked and fucked by your master, who stays horny by collecting your nut every so often. You don\u2019t care about anything else in the world because your prostate getting rammed and beaten while you\u2019re surrounded by the most mind shattering stink on the planet is all you need.</span></div></div>",

Without any more deliberation, nor even considering that you're throwing your life away, you shout out, \"let me sniff your shoes!

Your member is still rock hard after the harpy boy's teasing, so you welcome his expert stroking. And while you're moaning and enjoying his soft and dextrous hand, the catboy slips off one of his shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(-50 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green haze from within his footwear is unleashed, and the small room is flooded with a stench straight out of your nightmares!

Not that it matters, because you have to obey me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words sink in, and a lifetime of smelly hell follows. Each and every day after his shifts, Chartreuse comes home and has you rub his feet, then smell them! Most of your time is spent either gagging or unconscious. Especially since he keeps you on a dog bed in his vile shoe closet. Life as a maid is hard for him, and he comes home most nights with sore feet drenched in sweat. But it's all made better by the fact that he's got a human at home ready to suffer for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never do figure out who he's a maid for anyways...</span></div></div>",

You get on your hands and knees and then resume your search. The air is still thick with his rancid foot odor. The smell makes your eyes water! Despite that, you are having a bit of an easier time telling which direction has a stronger concentration of stink. You just follow your nose and crawl about until you find a particularly foul pocket of stink. Your nose brushes up against something and you breathe in once more. UGH! F-fuck!

It\u2019s impossible to tell if you\u2019re travelling in a straight line without any visual reference. You actually end up circling back to his feet a second time! Another burst of his horrid foot odor sizzles your brain, and you even find yourself taking a small, second sniff! (-15 MP) The Kobold just keeps giggling at you, and by now, you aren\u2019t sure you\u2019ll ever find his shoes. You wander through the foot fog once more, and by now, you\u2019re honestly considering just giving in to those wonderful feet. That is, until you find another dense patch of stink, and your nose presses against something leathery. Without even thinking about it, you take in a deep sniff. The smell hits you hard, harder than the Kobold\u2019s bare feet even. Clearly, he\u2019s been wearing and stinking up those shoes for years! (-20 MP) Your body shakes and shivers, especially when you grab the shoes and take off your blindfold. Sure enough, you find yourself staring right at a pair of over-worn, leather shoes!

You have given in to Temptation!\u201d Just like that, a shadowy collar appears on your neck. Your mind pings near-instantly thanks to the rough treatment it\u2019s already gotten!

Well... you do feel a bit more sluggish and suggestible, but perhaps that's just you accepting your new role in life. You feel a genuine affection for the tanuki, and you believe that's all your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenta stands up, giving a great yawn and stretching his back out. \"All in all, this was quite an eventful day at the House!\" He beams at you proudly. \"I didn't think I'd be bringing back anyone with me, but far from me to deny a willing hand.\" He makes his way for the door and gestures for you to follow. \"Come! The sun is still in the sky, and there is much for you to learn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your feet, feeling the collar on your neck, and then back to Kenta. \"Aren't you supposed to... um... leash me?\" You hope he doesn't notice your blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanuki chuckles in response to your silly inquiry. \"Nonsense! Leashes are for slaves, and the collar is more or less decorative in your case. You're going to follow me not because you're being pulled along, but because you chose this life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's right. You follow him out the door with a confident stride. You can be comfortable in the fact that, no matter what happens, you chose this life of your own accord. As long as you stick with Kenta, you can be sure you're safe. No fickle kitsune, no surprise monster ambushes, and no suicidal quest to slay the Monster King. Just thinking about the dangers you were so eager to expose yourself to makes you want to dive into Kenta's strong arms, hoping a tight hug from him would ease away all your worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of kitsune... you retrieve Kusai's ball from your pack. You give it one last sad, forlorn look before tossing it aside. Pledging your service to another means you have no right to bind anyone into servitude. Shaking the thoughts from your mind, you smile as you follow Kenta back to his cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Kenta teaches you all the tips and tricks you need to know to be an efficient trader. You learn how to spot forgeries from the real deal, how to work a crowd, and how to sell any item for far more than its worth. His warm encouragement makes you feel like you were born to be a trader. By the end of your training, you're confident you could sell a naga his own shed skin! Kenta always introduces you to his regulars as his business partner, and never his slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of every day, Kenta divvies up the profits and always gives you the gold you put in the work to earn. But that's not your real prize... not even close. Kenta always travels barefoot, leaving his feet dirty and sweaty after a long day's haul. At the end of every day, and sometimes when it's just the two of you traveling through the forest, he permits you to rub, smell, and lick his feet to your heart's content. You always make sure you leave them spotless to let him know how grateful you are for the privilege. You like the scent from between his toes the most. After all, that's the strong, heavy odor that enticed you to be in his service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou often think about his spongy, sweaty soles, and how you much of a fool you were to ever think that was a downside. Just pressing your tongue or nose against them releases a cascade of sweet, salty, delicious footsweat! Even better, if you sell well enough, he allows you to touch yourself while you're dazzled by the taste and scent of his perfect, godlike feet! Knowing that sweet release is at stake always motivates you to be the best seller you can be. On very special and exceedingly rare occasions, he even lets you worship his prodigious testicles. They're always nice and warm, carry a strong, musky, manly scent, and are big enough to completely smother you, making his balls your entire world. Even the thought of getting a whiff of his sack is enough to make you squirt precum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a year or two of traveling, you notice you see less and less humans on your travels, and when you do, they tend to be licking the feet of a monster boy. It doesn't bother Kenta, so you try not to let it bother you. Besides, less humans means Kenta doesn't have to shapeshift as much, so you can watch his long, thick tanuki paws get sweaty and dirty while he walks and fantasize about how great they're going to smell and taste when he lets you back at them. Still, sometimes, you look up at the night sky and wonder what could have been if you continued on your quest to defeat the Monster King. Would you have found the same happiness you found with Kenta...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Good End...?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a straight up altercation, the fairy doesn't stand a chance. But, fairies aren't known for straight up, honest fighting now, are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they're known for playing tricks. The fairy stares down his larger, stronger opponent for a moment longer. Then, he lets out a sigh and starts to flutter away from you after putting his boots back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can have the dumb human. Not worth becoming an old man's insole over...\" He mumbles as he flies off towards the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune, in a strange lack of insight, lets his guard down and smiles. \"Glad to see you're not totally dumb! Now run alo-AAAANH!\" The Kitsune suddenly gets a facefull of shimmering fairy dust! He falls to his knees and lets out a shuddering, low moan as arousal wracks his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fairy giggles and presses his booted foot against the fox's forehead. \"You're right, I'm not totally dumb! Doesn't seem like the same can be said about you though!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kitsune looks up at him. He's clearly struggling to keep his urges and desires in check! He shivers and grits his teeth, trying desperately to hold onto his sanity...only to get another, different powder cloud to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no...\" The Kitsune mumbles out as his eyes widen in realization. Seconds later though, they start to glaze over. He lets out a whimper of defiance, but with the arousal coursing through his body, his willpower is already low! Colorful spirals start to slowly fill his eyes from the center out. His tense, shaking body begins to relax. His slips ever so slightly start curling into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! What's the matter? Getting hard to think, grandpa?\" The fairy taunts. He starts zipping around the Kitsune and removing his robes. The vulpine monster boy is left in his underwear and boots, just like you! His cock is straining against the fabric of his undies, and his face is straining to remain focused!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mnh...n...no...I won't...let...\" He mumbles, desperately trying to fight the effects of the hypnotic powder he'd been hit with. Unfortunately, his brain is caving fast, and the fairy is all too happy to help it along! He floats down to the Kitsune's bulge and gives him a sinister grin. He dangles his tiny foot just over the tip. The Kitsune whimpers and shakes his head. \"D-don't...p-please no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the fairy doesn't listen. \"Nope! Time's up, foxy!\" He presses his booted foot against the fox's clothed tip and just gives it a single, quick rub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...h-HAAAAAH!\" The Kitsune screams in ecstasy and his dick starts to soak his underwear in jizz! His body trembles briefly and then stiffens up. The spirals fully overtake his eyes, his smile gets nice and wide, and he mutters out, \"ping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy just laughs. A high and mighty Nine-Tailed Kitsune is now his slave! And a cute human too! The fairy darts away and wiggles his noxious feet at the both of you. \"Alright, slaves! Let's make sure those brains never recover! Come here and huff my little boots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your brain scrambled and his brain under the fairy's control, you both crawl right on over to him. Each of you grabs a boot and pulls it off, once more unleashing his incredibly potent foot odor! His little boots fume with foot stench, and without hesitation, you each press one to your nostrils and sniff deep! (-50 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you starts to spin as both you and the Kitsune choke on his mind-bending foot stink. You're both swaying dizzily. The boots may be small, but they sure pack a wallop! Driven on by the only commands you've been given, you both sniff again! (-50 MP) At this point, the stink is too much for you! Your eyes roll back and you collapse to the ground, unconscious. The Kitsune is stronger, and ends up sniffing for around three minutes, but in the end, he succumbs to the boot stink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, the two of you happily serve the smug little fairy boy. His rancid feet always send the both of you into a dizzying bout of gagging, and you're really nothing but his play toys, but neither of you care! You just want to sniff and serve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever</span></div></div>",

Over the course of a few years, you manage to hack, slash and poison your way to fortune. <i>And infamy</i>... your name became a taboo, your presence was a threat to king and peasant alike, your mere existence feared throughout the world. You earned many enemies, and many rivals. Sooner or later, they all fell before your blade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the rumours began to surface, of monster boys roaming the countryside, kidnapping innocent people and turning them into stinky-feet slaves, your greatest challenge appeared. Signed with the promise of 10 000 gold pieces, a contract <b>to locate and kill the Monster King himself!</b> After weeks of preparation, you slipped away under the cover of night, and began the long journey to the Monster King's realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of two months, you sneaked through the human realm, jumped the border to the Monster Lands undetected, covered the entire Sweatmarshes while defending yourself from the wandering packs of vampires and footwraiths, fought your way through the Beast Warrens, and survived the Labyrinth of Stench, before finally arriving at the doors of the Monster King's palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling on your years of experience as a criminal, you managed to infiltrate the fortress, and work through its trapped passages one by one. You were on the antechamber to the Monster King's bedroom, <i>when the simplest trap turned into your bane:</i> stepping through a thin tripwire, you activated a mechanism which pumped footshroom spores into the room. As the place filled up with the bitter, cheesy stench of feet, a tall, imposing figure, wearing a dark, bulb-shaped crown, was the last thing you saw before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in the accursed citadel of Kaz-Mesmer, a prison for the Monster King's deadliest enemies. During your month-long captivity, you were subjected to the most cruel and disgusting punishments, forced to worship hundreds, if not thousands, of pairs of stinky monster boy feet, surviving on nothing but sweat and toejam, and victim to unspeakable sorceries which turned your brain into mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of your imprisonment, your true self was long dead. All you knew was that you loved monster boy feet, that you longed to serve the Monster King's soles, and that it was your job to exact revenge on each and every one of his enemies. <i>Specially on your former contractors...</i> bent on seeing all of mankind kneel before the Monster King's feet, you ride out of Kaz-Mesmer and back to enemy lands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reach the border, it's only a matter of time for the monster boys. With your cunning and viciousness, the border kingdoms slowly crumble, one by one... their lords mysteriously disappear, or inexplicably pledge themselves to the Monster King; the monster boys find their way into the cities, unopposed by the guard; foot-worshipping cults proliferate; and soon enough, the peasantry is enslaved. All thanks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plots seem unstoppable... until an old nemesis strikes back. Thanks to an anonymous tip, the Sisterhood of Divine Protection burst into the Contessa's office in time to catch you trying to hypnotize their leader. You are once again captured and brought under captivity, this time in a secret fortress on the white slopes of the Snowy Mountains, where you spend many months being reprogrammed to serve the Sisterhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day of prison sentence, the chief Inquisitress visits your prison cell, closely followed by two Crusader-Sisters.

The gargoyle's body is pale yellow with streaks of red. The gargoyle's scarred with numerous chips and cracks. You raise your mace and prepare to strike. The gargoyle boy cowers and falls to his knees in fear. You lower your weapon and approach the gargoyle. The gargoyle boy makes no effort to strike you. The gargoyle rises to its feet and begins to speak in a trembling voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I'm an old scout left behind by the gargoyle prince. I'm too old to fight anymore, but I must protect this graveyard. We shall play a game. You win the game, and I'll give you a bag of gold I recently found. I win the game, and you'll worship my feet for the next 10 minutes. However, I'll still surrender half the gold if you lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. You prefer avoiding battle whenever possible. The terms of the bet sound reasonable, so you nod in acceptance. The gargoyle wanders over to a decaying gravestone, and remove a chunk of rock with his claws. You wonder what he's planning. You follow the gargoyle to a row of three headstones. The gargoyle boy turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes, and I'll hide this piece of stone behind one of these graves. You pick the grave where the stone is hidden, and you get the gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, and the gargoyle hides the stone. The gargoyle taps you on the arm, and you open your eyes again. You observe the three graves and consider which one you'll choose. The gargoyle stands nearby awaiting your choice. You point at the left grave, and the gargoyle walks behind it. The gargoyle boy bends down, and pick up something with his claw. The gargoyle returns to your side and holds out his open claw.</span></div></div>",

Reaching the monster king is a challenging goal. You have two paths you can choose. You can head east to the plains, or west to the marshes. The plains are filled with many wild animals, however, the path is longer though less dangerous. The marshes provide a shorter route, but many stronger monsters lurk along the path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank the gargoyle for the helpful advice and set off on your journey. Your first task is getting a room and some new equipment in town. You wander along the winding trail for an hour, and soon you see lit torches in the distance.

The entire village was in ruins; buildings were reduced to rubble, footprints longer and wider than you were tall lie marring the fields and unpaved roads.  Every once in a while the wind changes directions, blowing up from the south, carrying the vile scent of the beast hordes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder warned you about the monsters and their peculiar, yet unceasingly effective choice of tactics, and you tie a cloth over your face to protect your senses from the foul wind.  You wonder for a moment if its already begun its mind-altering effects, but you shake your head.  If you think that way, you may never be able to believe in your own thoughts again.   Disgusted by what happened here, you proceed to the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive crater marks the entrance of the town, the plaza is simply gone, and though the gate was intact, the walls on either side were simply gone; in their place stood two massive craters.  You adjust the heavy pack on your shoulders and turn to the elder.   She smiles weakly at you as you approach, worry plain on her face, but the pride in her eyes is unmistakable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the one that will succeed where we have all failed.  Maybe if we were given another hundred years we could've...\"  She stops the thought and shakes her head.  \"It doesn't matter now.  It's time to face the facts, they recognized us as a threat, and then they dealt with us.\"   She spits on the ground, and her battle-hardened muscles tighten beneath old scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind picks up again, so you check the seals on your make-shift mask.   Not perfect, but good enough for this distance, you don't even register a scent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place a hand on the elder's shoulders.   \"I will beat them to the other cities, Elder.   It's as you said,  they are an army, and I am one.   I can move much faster than they can.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does not reply, and her gaze seems distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake her shoulder, alarmed, before crying out, \"Elder?   Is everything okay, Elder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs you by the wrist before driving your arm behind your back, and contorting the limb into a painful hold, you turn with it reflexively, as you were taught, and she stays one step ahead.   You land hard on the ground staring up at her.   She plants a boot on your chest.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always be ready, student.\"   She smiles down at you warmly.  \"I just hope this is the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push her booted foot off of you and she helps you to your feet.  \"It's the right thing to do, teacher --  It will be a hard journey, but you've taught me how to succeed where the others have failed.  I am ready.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fade back into that blank stare to the south.  \"You need to depart, child, and I need to get back inside, this wind is getting to my old bones, but first, take this with you -- you will need it much more than me.\"  The elder pulls a pendant from around her neck and holds it up in front of her.  It glows softly in the dusty ruins of your old village.  \"This is the will of our people, wherever you go, we will be with you.  Child, remember your goal -- warn the other cities, and mount a defense.  Do not go south, you are not ready; by the time you arrive, Xinnar will already be lost, and you will be overwhelmed...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face contorts with worry or regret, either afraid for the fate of the world being left to your hands, or ashamed that she could not do more to help.   She holds the pendant before you, focusing on it for a moment.   Its glow grows more intense until it shines a bright white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take it and place it in a small pouch at your belt.  You bow your head in thanks and tears well in your eyes.  You feel sad to leave your teacher and your village behind, but also daunted by the path ahead.  You fall to your knees under the weight of your duties and bow your head. \"Thank you, Elder.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures for you to stand and pulls you into a fierce hug. For the first time in your life, you hear sniffling come from your teacher.  By the time you end your embrace, her tears have already dried, though her breaths come quicker than normal.   You think you hear her voice quiver in her parting words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe, Child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrent Status:<br>\r\nMP: 100/100<br>\r\nGold: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInventory/Equipment:<br>\r\nSteel Rod<br>\r\nMakeshift Face Mask<br>\r\nTraveler's Clothes<br>\r\nTraveler's Boots<br>\r\nGlowing Pendant -- +50 MP if your MP would hit 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You never look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour of walking over the sparse, rocky terrain, you find the mountain road that should take you all the way into Ironhaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of travel is uneventful, and you settle for the night  on a flat, rocky ridge.   You can't see much, but you think better of lighting a fire for the night.  You pull a waterskin and  some bread that your baked earlier in the week.   You down your meager feast without complaint, unsling a bedroll from your pack, and lie down for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare up at the dark, clouded sky, your teachers' stories about family members lost to the monsters begin to play out in your head.   You remember her look of sadness when you wanted to seek out your friends and neighbors.  She told you that they were gone, that the monster's army would use them all until they forgot who they were.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour teacher had described the process once as a slow, insidious transformation.  Your mind slowly let the idea of a monster's superiority in.  Something about the scent of their feet made you crave more of it, even if you hated it.   It was impossible for you to imagine it, but it must be true-- there were no bodies in the remnants of your village.   No blood, no bone, just lives left behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fell asleep, you imagined the villagers new lives in the monster camp.  In your dreams that night, you watched as those closest to you were kicked, stepped on, and humiliated.  They were stuck in massive slime feet, struggling for freedom.  They licked at the toes of disgusting ghouls while onlookers laughed.  They were kicked away by orcs, as they scrabbled after their feet, until they begged to be smothered by massive green-skinned soles.   Some simply lay face up, writhing in ecstasy under benches in the mess halls while the army idly played with their new toys during their meals.  They were locked away in cages at night, begging for more, bashing their bodies into the bars not to escape, but to be abused further.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around the camp, there is no human free.  The strongest of your warriors is stripped naked, eating the toejam out from between a giant's toes.   He seems to be enjoying himself one moment--  aroused, and moaning, but horrified the next-- sobbing, and running away.  He falls to his knees before he leaves the firelight, and crawls back, just to repeat the process anew.   You have to help him!  You approach the giant quickly without thought and he pays you no notice as he drinks a tankard of ale the size of a tent, probably just happy to have a moment to kick off his boots during a seemingly endless march.  Suddenly you crash into the thick scent of his unwashed feet.  Your stomach heaves, but you soldier on.   As you get closer the scent grows stronger and stronger until it's nearly a physical force.  You feel yourself slowing down as you fight against the warm, sweaty air washing over you in waves of cheesy musk, but you make it to the warrior.   He somehow smells worse than the surrounding air.  How long had he been between this brute's filthy toes?  You grab a hold of him and turn to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it out of the light of the giant's fire and back to  relative safety when the warrior begins to panic.  He pulls you frantically towards the giant.  You try to pull away, but the man's grip is much too strong.  You trip and he slowly drags you towards the disgusting toes.  The giant looks down from his ale and smiles before those toes close around you both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt awake.  You look around in the dark, frantic, but you see nothing.  You hear nothing nearby.  You reach for the pendant in your pouch, and let its light wash over you as you collect yourself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dreams leave you covered in sweat, you're sticky, hot, and can't shake the image of the massive giant's toes sealing you inside their moist, cheesy grasp.

Practical experience was hard to come by as none of your training partners could fly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the unseen winged creature is smart and means you harm, you understand you're at a serious disadvantage; it could strike out at you without retaliation unless you got a hold of it or damaged its wings, which meant it could play things safe and weaken you slowly over the course of hours at little risk to itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding a light makes you a visible target.  If you could fly, you would stay well out of the range of a potential opponent's light, only entering to strike, minimizing its usefulness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stow your pendant in a small pouch and secure it to a belt loop at your waist.  As long as you get enough time for your eyes to adjust, you'll be better off.  That, and if the pendant is as powerful as you believe it to be, you don't want to risk having a faster opponent nabbing it and running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the wing beats grow steadily louder as the monster gets closer.   You try to follow the sound with your eyes, but you have not yet adjusted to the darkness.  You can barely even make out the outline of your steel rod held inches in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a final stroke of the creature's wings directly above you, and then you here the whisper of tree leaves off to your right.  All but blind in the darkness, you whirl to face the sound of the movement and prepare to beat back any attack from that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strain your eyes against the dark for any sign of motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there is nothing, and then you feel a breath of the wind on your back.  You turn much too slowly to react, and hundreds of pounds of weight in free fall crash into your gut.   Despite moving with the attack, the blow sends you sprawling, and forces the air from your lungs in a sudden, wheezing, gasp.  (HP-5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fall, time seems to slow as your training takes over.  Your mind begins sizing up your opponent:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the monster, with impossible dexterity, spring off of your gut to hover inches above the ground, beating broad, leathery wings against the air.   Each stroke carries the monster a few feet into the air before he falls and needs to repeat the process to stay aloft.  It's hard to see much in the dark, but he looks to be about your height, with a similar build.  The key difference is his wingspan, which is about three of your body laid out end to end in length.  Even in the dark, blending into the night, they're an imposing sight.  You realize you won't be able to stop your momentum in the air and get your feet back under you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ground hard and gracelessly.  (HP-1) Reflexively, you gasp for air to fill your lungs.  In spite of your face covering, the faint aroma of foot odor registers in your mind in time to the beating of the creature's wings.  (MP-1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl and readjust your face mask to make sure it will stay in place during the fight to come.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster beats his wings again.  (MP-1)  \"I see.  Clever you. \"  The monster hisses out his amusement at your mask.  The inhuman sound, somewhere between a tiger's growl and the whisper of the wind causes you to shiver and makes your heart race.   The monster's praise, much to your dismay, makes pride well up within you. (MP-1) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Another beat of his wings bathes you in the aroma of his feet. (MP-1)  You groan in disgust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that clever cloth of yours isn't a perfect solution.  How much does it actually help, I wonder.\"  The winged monster muses playfully.  He's clearly enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unsure why he hasn't pounced to finish the job while you were stunned from his attack, but you seize the opportunity gratefully. You reluctantly fill your lungs with monster's scent in order to catch your breath.  You refuse to show weakness and stifle a gag in response to the stench of  his unwashed foot musk.  (MP-1)  You stand up to face him, weapon readied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to fight.  I followed you for a long time -- I could use a warm, soft perch to sink my claws into. <br>\r\n I'd love to rest my weary wings.\"   He punctuates the word wings with another downward stroke of the leathery appendages, and another wave of his scent.  (MP-1)  A condescending grin spreads across the winged creature's face.  He raises his feet, extending them towards your face and splays his toes.  As your eyes adjust to the dark, you see for the first time that his whole body is covered in short, silky, fur -- it looks black in the dark, but you can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The feet he's showing off would be nearly human if not for the broader soles and opposable thumb joint at his heel.  Each of his digits ends in a long claw that you'll have to watch out for.  \"Your face would fit perfectly in my grasp,\" he says, closing his foot into a fist to illustrate his point, and beating his wings to stay aloft.  As if his words need to be heard and validated, you look deeply at his broad soles as his wings buffet your body with tainted air.  (MP-1)  You realize, much to your horror, that he's right, his strange, prehensile feet could hold your head flush against the source of his unapologetic odor.   (MP-1)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer.\" The simple command comes out wild, predatory, and demanding.  The same shiver of fear that assaulted you when he first spoke again has its way with your heart and sets it to racing.   Some deep part of your brain reflexively causes you to move to obey, but your mind catches yourself  mid-step. (MP-1)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill mid-step, your mind is racing through options.  You're fairly certain you cannot outrun this creature, and with the way his voice seems to bypass your thoughts, you do not want a drawn out fight.   Perhaps you can use his command to your advantage and play along to get close.  Maybe you can run, hide or fight off his attacks long enough to make it to Iron Haven.  It's not far from here now, but you also might make it to the gate only to have no one manning it in the night.  Perhaps you could negotiate, he seems intelligent, and if he's followed you for as long as he said, maybe he has a goal you could help him with in exchange for his departure, though it's difficult to treat with someone who is already playing with your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what the right answer is, but you're certain you've suffered his gross feet and sorcerous words long enough .   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrent Status:<br>\r\nHP: 24/30<br>\r\nMP: 82/100.

You visualize your weapon ruining one of the creature's wings.  You can practically feel the impact of your rod and the crunch of the delicate bones.  It's hard not to speed up your pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've covered most of the distance by the time another gust of warm air washes over you.  You expected the smell to be stronger, but you vastly underestimated how much it was diminishing over the distance.  This wave of air is accompanied by a wave of nausea that leaves you dizzy and swaying.  The moist heat feels like it clings to your hair, your face, your mask.  It feels like it's waiting to seep into your nostrils and flood your lungs; like it's intentionally smothering you into submission.   (MP - 5)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reaction to his scent is completely involuntary,  and not at all subtle. You're worried your revulsion is going to give you away.  Instead, he laughs  as if he had expected your reviled groans and glazed over stare.  His laughter resonates in your ears and echoes in your head.  Instead of the anger you expect to feel, you want to laugh with him, even though he's laughing at your pain.  You want to apologize for your rudeness. (MP - 1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't that bad, are they?\"  His nostrils move with his breaths as he sniffs at the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your unwelcome mirth fades away, when he speaks again. Anger quickly fills the void it left behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force yourself to wear the foreign, jovial smile that crept across your face in order to keep up the charade.  Your teacher would be ashamed if she saw you now, and you feel pangs of guilt.  You feed them to the flames of your anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to feel <i>amazing</i> to hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since your training began years ago, you understand the full extent of the threat of a monsters' scent.  You wrestle your consciousness back from the smothering grip of his noxious aroma and find that you've instinctively stumbled to within striking distance of your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you planned to strike his wing on the backbeat, your timing is off.   You're unwilling to test if you can remain conscious through another concentrated lungful of his feet, so you abandon the plan and bring your rod down in a flashing arc towards his nearest wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature yelps in surprise and you feel the force of your blow reverberate up your weapon, into your wrists.    (Monster HP -2)   You don't feel the break you had hoped for, but he whirls into the earth, giving you time to reset your feet and strike again.  Your rod flashes, finding light in spite of the cloudy night.  It connects with a meaty thud and a yowl of pain as he pushes himself up to his hands and knees. (Monster HP -2)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls to his back, but you waste no time, you bring the weapon back up and drive down with adrenaline-fueled anger.  This time he catches the rod with his feet.  Before you can curse yourself for letting anger get the better of you, his clawed digits wrap around the weapon and he yanks you forward with powerful legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body lurches off balance, and you feel yourself start to fall.   His free foot reaches up to grab your throat, but you twist away.  His claws shred your mask and dig into your cheek underneath; blood begins to well up and bead along the scratch. (HP-1)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis inhuman screech of triumph pierces the night, and you realize the implications of what had just happened.    The winged beast pulls back his wings, unfurling them awkwardly in pained and panicked fits along the ground.  He raises his shoulders off of the ground and you hear the air rushing towards you before you can see the edges of his wings in your peripheral vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, fuck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrent Status:<br>\r\nHP: 23/30<br>\r\nMP: 76/100.

Monster boys have raided your village since you can remember, but you've never felt the need to actively fight them.

He pinned you against the bed and shoved his malodorous feet in your face while stroking himself. You can still recall the smug look of satisfaction across his face, only able to glimpse it through between his toes. He would've surely knocked you out and dragged you back to his warren, had a villager not noticed his presence and warded him off with a pitchfork.

Talking about attacks, it seems one vicious monster tried his luck against you as he jumped from the branches he was hiding.

(-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you couldn't take it anymore. You had to get more of this sexy monster's smelly feet, consequences be damned! You got down on your knees in front of the troll's soles. His toes came up to your breasts. You leaned forward into the wiggling toes, getting as close as you can without actually touching them. You could feel the body heat from his feet radiating onto your face. You inhale deeply, filling your lungs with the troll's sweaty, cheesy foot smell. The sour odor singes your nostrils, but you love it. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't hold yourself back anymore. You dive into the troll's toes and begin licking them. You lap at their undersides, and then inbetween each and every toe. You mouth fills with salty sweat and toejam, which you swallow happily. All the while, the musky odor surrounding you makes you feel light-headed and unaware of your surroundings, aside from the feet in front of you. The troll's toes battered your face and matted your hair with footsweat. You lick up and down his massive green soles, leaving streaks across the dirt. You've never been happier than right here, at this superior monster boy's superior feet. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, deep down, you know this is wrong, and you know you need to move on, but the troll's feet are so big, and so tasty, and there's so much of them you haven't worshiped....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: 35/100</span></div></div>",

Still, this woman needs your help, and the gold reward is nothing to scoff at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find her husband, a typical high-society type, and questioned him about his wife's last whereabouts. In a frantic tone, he explains that they were out in the forest, picnicking in a spot fairly close to the city, where the sunlight pierced through the trees, when they were set upon by rabbit boys.

After all, if you passed out, you couldn't smell your master's feet anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the street, a squad of eight soldiers turn the corner, and abruptly stop when they see the goblin chief, drawing their weapons. \"That's him!\" one of them shouts. They all rush forward, ready to attack. The goblin chief isn't concerned in the slightest, however. He balances on your head with one foot, and raises one raunchy sole to the soldiers. Though they are a few dozen yards away, the soldiers drop one-by-one in response to the chief's extremely potent feet. He pumps his fist, celebrating such an easy victory. \"Damn, they didn't even make it close to me before succumbing to these bad boys!\" He wiggles his toes as he talks, further spreading about the footy miasma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour MP: -100:100<br>\r\nYou're thoroughly enslaved by the goblin chief's potent feet!</span></div></div>",

You didn't really care, all that mattered to you now is your new master's feet. You happily lower your head to continue cleaning his feet. You spent an hour licking and sucking on the rat boy's feet, making sure they were spotless. When you finished, you remained kneeling before your master while inspected your work. He was very satisfied at how thorough you were.<br>\r\n\"Huh, not a speck of dirt or filth on either of my feet! Perhaps you should be rewarded for doing such a thorough job..\"<br>\r\nThe rat boy grew an evil smile while he parted his legs, revealing an unnaturally large cock! You were eager to claim your reward and just before you dived mouth first into his cock, the rat boy stopped you and said:<br>\r\n\"I only offer my cock to those who deserve it, slave! You have merely earned the right to admire my cock.\"<br>\r\nThis was the ultimate humiliation for you. You threw yourself at his cock and got denied! Right after you just cleaned both of his feet until they were spotless! The rat boy laughed at you while you were left to take in all this humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of what you have done also began to sink in. How could you have lost to a weak rat boy? Not only that, but you completely surrendered and willingly licked his feet clean! You had been beaten by one of the weakest monster boys and enslaved! How could this have happened? Were you always this weak, or is it just your destiny to live as a foot slut to a rat boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were feeling sorry for yourself, your master dirtied his feet again and then ordered you to clean them again. So you repeated the humiliating process again, licking in between his toes, sucking every last piece of dirt from his sexy feet. Once you finished again, he told you to follow him. He led you on a short walk to him home, which was a small cave nearby. When you entered the cave, he began explaining how your life would be from now on. You would wake him up in the morning by licking his feet clean, then you would make his food and once he left the cave you were to keep it neat and tidy. When he returns each day you would lick his feet and prepare his food again. When he goes to sleep, you are to sleep with your face in his feet. None of this bothered you one bit, in fact you were overwhelmed with joy at how much of his feet you would get in your new life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One year after enthusiastically serving your master, he returns home in a very good mood. After lustfully licking his feet clean and preparing him an excellent meal, he surprises you with a reward</i><br>\r\n\"This is good food slut! You've been excellent today! I think you have earned a reward that you have been hoping for!\"<br>\r\nYou look at your master surprised and pleased, you were only happy because he was happy. For the first time in a year, he reveals his massive cock! You had learnt from your previous mistake though, so you only gazed on it, admiring it's power and size. Your master then said:<br>\r\n\"Go on then, put it in your mouth. You've earned one load of my superior cum!\"<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe your ears! You were finally allowed the highest honour! You dived in between his legs again, taking his cock into your mouth, kissing, licking and sucking as much as you could! His cock was far tastier than you had ever imagined! It tasted like pure power and supremacy, a physical representation of his superiority over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for your master to explode in your mouth. You swallowed and savoured every drop. You were sad that you had already made him explode, you were looking forward to serving his cock for so long and you barely got a minute of it! With extreme reluctance you took his cock out of your mouth and remained on your knees in front of him, having a sad expression. You looked up at your master, seeing that his was in deep thought while staring at you. After a moment he said:<br>\r\n\"You know what slave? I think it's your lucky day! I enjoyed having you take my cock like that, so I think I will allow you to do it as much as you like tonight. Only for tonight though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished speaking, he grabbed the back of your head and rammed his cock into your mouth. You could feel the tip in your throat! The excitement was too much for you so you exploded as well. Just like the first time round, your master exploded in just over a minute of throat fucking you. He didn't take his cock out of your mouth though. Again, after a short while, he started fucking your mouth. This process would go on for about half and hour before your master was completely exhausted. You've never felt so much joy in your life before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later that night, your master would make you clean his feet again. After that he would throw you onto his bed and fuck you in all of your holes in multiple humiliating positions. When the both of you finally settled down, you had time again to think about everything that has happened in the past year. Instead of feeling bad about it all, you felt happy! The humiliation of becoming complete and utter property to one of the weakest monster boys seemed to turn you on to no end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is the story of how a young female adventurer, full of fire and determination, would go on to live under the feet of a rat boy and become utterly addicted to it!</b></span></div></div>",

Without missing a beat, you ducked down just in time for the black equine appendages to miss you and instead slam your captors. (-5 Both) The two snails fell to the dirt, knocked down and defeated.

What interested you was that for the smell of feet that brought you here, you didn't really see anyone around. All you could see were some patches of blue muck stuck in some holes. As you stepped out in curiosity, you could see some of the muck holes quivering. A few echoed yawns spread over the sight as you see the muck actually begin to rise up. Transfixed on the sight, your eyes stayed glued to the now pillar of muck closest to you. You other mounds come from the sides of the muck, actually becoming dripping arms and hands. The top of the blue sludge begins to shape as a masculine voice comes from it. \"Oh...*yawn*....another visitor, hello mam....*yawn*\" As other mucky beings began to take human form both male and female, you pulled out your rod and prepared for battle. All any of the creatures did in response to this was at most a yawn. \"There's *yawn* no need for that dear. We *yawn* Muckberries perfer nonviolence over...*yawn*. Many of these 'muckberries' began stepping out of thier holes, giving you a good view of thier slimy, dirty....feet...you yawn yourself, the tired vibe these monsters giving off slightly contagious. In a sleepy tone, the male muckberry stepped towards you with an inviting smile and said. \"You seem stressed, why not *yawn* join us for some relaxation?\" Already questions popped into your head, if they slept in holes than why the tents?

You could hardly contain yourself as you quickly crawled over to your masters' long, slender feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached them, you craned your neck downwards and planted small, quick kisses along the tops of their feet. After that, you accepted their toes into your mouth and started sucking, taking in 2 or 3 toes at once. The green ones tasted sour, while the orange ones tasted soft and creamy. They were all delicious to you, however. The colors didn't seem to affect the footy odor. Not that you could tell, their scent was much too advanced and sophisticated for such a lowly human footslave such as yourself. As you ran your tongue between each and every one of their toes, you finally recognized your true place as a footslave. You're very lucky you found out when you did, your newest masters are your best ones yet! Thinking of an eternity of serving them makes you extremely happy.

Many were either strapped down or up and about sporting the same beautiful blue hue as your alien overlords. Taking a left turn, you are led through an open door with a chair and an unusual device in front of said chair.

You took a deep breath before wondering into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold air in the cave nipped at your face as you slowly slogged through the narrow corridor. Thankfully, the cave seems to be linear in fashion; you haven't encountered a fork in the path as of yet. No monster boys, either, which is always a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fear you jinxed yourself as you hear a giggle echoing further down the passageway. \"Well well well, what do we have here?\" a distinctly male voice called out. You clutched your steel rod and raised your torch, revealing your adversary:</span></div></div>",

His red, beady eyes are transfixed on you, all four pairs. He's dressed in a loose fitting white shirt, with extra holes cut out of it for his extra arms, equally loose-fitting pants, and of course, leathery, well-worn sandals. You can see the wear and tear on them from here... and smell it, as well. (-3 MP) He grinned at you, sharp fangs jutting from his mouth. No doubt about it, this is a spider boy. You've heard tales of spider boys with four feet, or, heavens forbid, even six feet. You count your blessings that you only have the one pair to deal with for this encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my parlor, said the spider to the fly...\" said the spider boy. \"You human types are all so easy, you know? It's almost like you <i>want </i>to lick my feet.

It's shapely, with long, slender toes... it disturbs you how easily you can see yourself beneath that sole. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you make efforts to concentrate. You can't throw yourself at a monster boy's feet so easily. Just in your brief moment of hesitation, you can see he inched closer to you, sandal still in hand. You don't want to see what he's going to do with that, so you wave your torch to scare him back. It works well enough; the threat of severe burns tends to be enough to stave off most threats. Still, keeping him farther than an arm's reach won't do much to help you.

Most of what was behind you was natural and randomly shaped out, but this new tunnel was slightly more thought out and streamlined. As the walls continued to grow smoother, you began to accept that something dug out this way. No doubt it was some kind of monster, probably digging it out piece by piece with every part of thier body. Your thoughts began to drift as you imagined moles digging through. Thier bodies covered in dirt and sweat over thier hard work, lifting thier feet to check the damage. But there would be no damage, just a clawed foot begging to be cleaned by an inferior....like...you?  A glimmer of light broke you from your fantasy and your eyes gazed upon the wondrous sight before you. Rubies, sapphires and so many gems and minerals all hitting from the walls of the great expanse before you. The sounds of water echoed about, leading you to believe this was some kind of spring/grotto. As you walked through the enchanting field, you began to notice how some of theze crystals seemed to give off some sort of glow. An odd pulsing of light that couldn't be entirely ignored.

DIRTY SOCKS?!

A goblin emerges from the hay, who you immediately recognize as your captor, Verx...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally awake!\" he exclaims, smirking from ear to ear. \"Ready for your first meal, foot slut?\" Verx asks, scrunching his toes hard so as to let the jam ooze forth from the crevices.

(-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day from then on began with a breakfast made up of Verx's toejam, and washed down with a few cups of his foot sweat. But that was just the beginning. As the hours went by, you learnt how to properly service your master's feet: how to rub them after he had spent an entire day chasing worthless foot sluts like you, how to smell them after two weeks having been touched by nothing wet except for your saliva, how to lick them and how to suck them, how to please and obey your master. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Verx was unequivocally your master. That's what he would tell you every time you put his toes on your mouth. He was the one who gave this new life, after all. He was the one who made you see you were nothing but a pathetic foot slut, destined to worship a beautiful monster boy like him and to enjoy every moment of it. He had never refused to let you rub your face on his sweaty soles, or sniff between his stinky toes. So why should you refuse to obey him? (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was. You obeyed him blindly. In a few days time, you were released from your chains and allowed to roam the wilderness for a few hours each day. But you much more preferred to stay in your new home, keeping it filthy for Master Verx. The only time you left the hovel was when he would enlist your help to capture some new slaves. Sometimes, he would let you accompany him on his trips to the Underworks. You loved it! So many filthy goblin feet to worship, so many socks waiting to be sucked dry, so many strange contraptions! Some could capture your gaze in seconds and turn you into a mindless thrall, others could infuse a pair of boots with the smell of a thousand orc feet! But even that seemed to pale in comparison with your Master's feet. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest your life, you lived in Master Verx's hovel, first worshiping him, and then his wife, his children, his grandchildren... at the end of your days, you could be proud to say that you had licked 8 generations of goblin feet, over 50 pairs of soles, more than 500 toes in a lifetime! Yet sometimes, in the clear nights like the one that had preceded your fateful adventure, you still looked on to the stars and wondered if that small goblin lair, ripe with stink, was where you truly belonged. But then, you remembered the words your Master's had told you that same day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... embrace your inner foot slut... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you were at peace with your decision. You curled up on your pile of hay, holding the sock you had seen on your first day at the hovel, and which had been given to you on the first birthday of your enslavement, holding it right over your nose, nodding off gently to your Master's foot scent, as you slowly repeated to yourself: I'm a foot slut... just a mindless foot slut...

Of course it might all be just a ploy to make you let your guard down.<br>\r\n\"P-please don't hurt me human!

I-I was hoping...\" The monster boy starts, but does so slowly, seemingly still too shy or terrified of you<br>\r\n\"C-could you... help me... g-get out of this forest? I-I will do anything! F-follow you, c-carry your inventory, or h-help you find food...\" The shy dog boy finally finished<br>\r\nHe seemed pretty honest... but you can't know for sure, could he really be trusted?

To do this, you were going to need to go through the borders of relative safety and into the territory of monsters. Sure, many monster boys had no real sense of territory, but many miles around the fabled King's castle were heralded as the territory of the Monster King himself. Few had ever dared to venture into those lands of foot obsessed beasts, and even fewer came back without having thier minds irreparably enslaved by the power of monster feet. You however had a duty to both the Goddess and your people. You would beard the lion in his den or so help yourself. In reguard to your plans, there was only a short distance between you and the border of safety. You walked down the grassy path, plenty of signs warning of the dangers up ahead. All seemed to be written in blood, dried out over untold ages of resisting the elements. As the sun reached noon, you could see a stone monolith higher than even the the temple spires.  Looking left and right revealed that more structures lined the area, giving the impression you were about to cross the border. Sure enough, one last sign stood in from of you. There was the same blood as before, but this sign seemed to have been vandalised with what was no doubt foot gunk. Taking the time to read it's warning, you began to sense the challenges lying ahead of you. <br>\r\n<i>To whomever foolish enough to come this far, you have this last chance to turn back. <span class=\"cbgreen\">but Don't if you wish.</span>You are about to enter the perceived territory of <span class=\"cbgreen\">our leader and your future master</span>the Monster King.

You, as a prime woman in a small village, set out with merely an old rod that was gifted to her by the village priestess, and a backpack with enough food to last you to the next town where you'll have to buy some more, conveniently only possessing enough to purchase as much as well. Why leave a perfectly comfortable life, with the man of your choosing in your small home village? When you were at the age of 10, a small stealthy raid carried out by a local marauding tribe of weak goblins, orcs and trolls that only possessed the strength to attack helpless targets such as your home, kidnapped your mother and murdered your father in his sleep. They made off with a small fortune from your house too. This left you with a bitter resentment and hatred of the monsters, more than just the mere fear of your fellow kin. You weren't scared of them, you were furious at them, and you wanted to get them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11 years later, back to the present, you take in a deep breath while clutching your rod, packing it away in a neat pocket over your shoulder, you wave good bye to the priestess and began your journey along the trail into the hilly plains and light forest area. It'd be at least 2 or 3 days worth of travel before you could reach the town of Baxton. It was the local centre of trade, all the farmers from the local villages hauled their harvest to Baxton to sell and buy their goods. Officially, the town had outlawed monsters and set an eye raising bounty on the capture of, or the killing of any monsters, but in reality the human underground had a deal with a fair few of the various tribes in the area to smuggle monsters in to allow them to do their kidnapping, stealing and other unsavoury activities. It was your goal to attempt to seek employment, or at least, training from the town's guard so you can start pushing back against these beasts. The first challenge would be convincing them to even consider your offer however, as naturally they wouldn't let a woman into their barracks if they weren't a prostitute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">Turning your thoughts away from what you set out to do however, as you do have a few days alone to just think things through, you spot a nice looking, solitary tree at the top of a smallish hill just off your path. It's still fairly light, and you wager that you have an hour or two before you even need to think of setting up camp for the night. On one hand, if you continue then obviously you won't have to worry about walking extra distance tomorrow to cover for what you're losing now, but on the other hand, you may not find a more favourable place to stay for the night. It'd be horrible if you were attacked and kidnapped on the first night of your quest! What is the best course of action?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 100</span></div></div>",

You had heard stories of lone goblins who weren't part of any raiding parties, ones who were far, far more intelligent compared to the vast majority of their brethren. Sometimes, they were friendly, attempting to integrate with which ever human society that would let them. Other times, they pretended to be friendly to achieve the same goal that most monsters were known for. These smarter goblins did have one advantage over most though, and that was their highly, <b>highly</b> addictive semen. One drop accidentally swallowed, even if it were mixed in with powerful alcohol, caused the victim to have an intense, insatiable desire for it. It was time to figure out whether this one was one of those, or merely what he claimed to be, a merchant. Though, regardless of the answer, it seemed like he wasn't much of a threat. He possessed no weapon that you could see, and he hardly looked like he could throw a punch that'd be more painful than walking your leg into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Alright, alright, I'm sorry. Don't try anything funny though.\"</span> You reply in a hostile tone. You took a good look at him up and down. His skin was light grey, the only clothes he wore was a cloth wrapped around his waist and though he was small, he definitely looked well fed. Perhaps he was a wealthy merchant, or simply had a good meal recently. He had a long nose and fairly pointy ears which didn't really make his face look all that appealing, by human standards at least. His feet though, they were pretty big! Definitely bigger than most human's, they were more than double the size of yours, and pretty.. soft looking too. Standing up straight, keeping at least two metres or so distance between him and you, you wait for him to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Like I said ma'am, I'm merely a travelling merchant! After getting harassed by patrolling guards from Baxton, I turned around and decided to seek out friendlier settlements. Would you ah.. know of any? Pardon me, but you don't seem like you have travelled very far just yet. Perhaps you could point me to where you have just come from?\"</span> He replied, seeming a bit more cautious now himself. That at least told you that he wasn't interested in aggravating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"I uh.. Uh yeah, but it'll take half a day at least, and the road at night isn't really that safe\"</span> You say back, calming yourself more and laying off your hostile attitude. Sure, you absolutely despised monsters and wanted to see them burn, but you've never met ones like these. Perhaps he is to be given a chance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding slowly, the goblin casts a look down the road behind you, then around as well. He remained silent for an uncomfortable moment before replying yet again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Thank you, ma'am. If that is the case, then perhaps.. we should camp together? That tree there looks like an excellent spot. I'm merely offering because we'd be safer together, but if you do not wish for someone like me to keep you company, then I'll be on my way.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis offer made you twitch you head a bit, you were about to exclaim 'no' before you thought about it. He had a point! Besides, he has been friendly so far despite you being rude to him.</span></div></div>",

He himself seemed to have had a rough day anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything more to him, you merely turned around and began a slow walking pace towards this tree, allowing him to catch up with you. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"What's your name, then? Mine is Emily\"</span> You say after he caught up with you, in a noticeably more friendly tone. He smiled at this when you weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Bogwart. A name of my own choosing, as the one given to me by my people was.. well, let's just say, ungraceful. Glad to have met you, Emily.\"</span> He lost his smile a small bit, but still, appeared pleased. When the two of you approached the tree, you began gathering kindle for a fire before he shook his head frantically at you. Surprised, you cocked your head and listened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"No, no! That would be like a beacon, telling every possible raider around that we're here. It's fine, we won't get cold and I have food already\"</span> He said. Already, that made him trust you more, and it wasn't the offering of food, though of course that was nice! <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Oh! Oh, okay. Well, if you insist. Thank you for the food, but I have my own already. I'm a picky eater\"</span> You explain, gently throwing away the kindle before setting yourself down against the tree, Bogwart getting his creature to lay down opposite you while he leaned against it. From then on, the two of you chatted about many, many things, ranging from Bogwart being exiled and making his own living to what the two of you wanted to do. It seemed his dream was to open a large business one day to sell clothes made from exotic materials!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all of this, you found your eyes being unnaturally drawn to his extended feet. One was pressed to the ground so you could only see the tops, while the other had it's sole directly pointed at you. They were slightly dirty and dusty, but still, unusually <b><i>enjoyable</i></b> to look at! (-10 MP) You tried to shake your gaze away, forcing yourself to stare at Bogwart's face, though that obviously didn't work, forcing yourself to look around at your environment but it all always ended the same - with you staring at his feet. Was he doing this, or was something inside of you compelling you to look? Why were you even looking, what was it that you wanted to do to them!? (-15 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogwart saw you struggling, but made an effort to not react to it. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">His plan was working.</font> <span class=\"clred\">\"Which brings me to my final point - the simple cloth and wool from this continent is appalling to make clothing with. It's simply appalling! I mean, that's why I don't even bother with shoes! Luckily, us goblins have feet that are far better for going bare than humans, even if they identically looking.\"</span> He finished off, making you snap out of your trance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Wh-wha? Oh, yes! Absolutely. Appalling, totally appalling...\"</span> You stutter and trail off, clearly showing that you weren't listening. The two of you shared a smile, his a knowing one while yours guilty. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"Okay I promise I was listening at least a <i>little!</i>\"</span> You laugh before he waved his hand at you dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Worry not, Emily! It is merely the company, and perhaps the chance to talk freely that is enjoyable. I do not expect you to take interest in my passions, very few do. But, it is late now, and I do not wish to wake up after sunrise, so I'll be going to sleep.\"</span> He replied back in a comforting tone, finishing off with a yawn. <span class=\"clred\">\"I wish you the best of luck on your watch. Feel free to wake me if you need anything of me\"</span> Bogwart finished off before merely stretching his arms and feet out, rolling over and pressing his head against the belly of his creature and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was that! You were to take the first watch of a few hours, and then wake him so that he could take his. It had been right to trust him after all, then. You'd even go so far as to say you enjoyed his company. Still though, as you survey the area idly, looking for movement or any signs of a raid, it becomes clear that the night is as calm as ever. The worst thing that could happen is that a stray rabbit wanders into your camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes pass by, your eyes keep on getting lured into the same trap, staring at his exposed soles and toes. Why were they so smooth looking? So.. so.. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">kissable?</font></span> (-10 MP) This had to stop, you couldn't keep on staring. Clearly something inside of you was wrong, or he was working some sort of magic. You should just sit on the other side of the tree to shield yourself from the sight of his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand however, he was asleep, and clearly, totally unaware. He wouldn't even notice it if you just.. just sneaked over and took a closer look, right? <br>\r\nMP: 65/100</span></div></div>",

A little voice in the back of your head told you this was wrong, but it wasn't nearly powerful enough to influence your decision. Silently, you shifted your feminine legs and crawled over, positioning yourself just behind him. Breathing a bit heavily, the goblin seemed to be in deep sleep already, so you figured you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath, you lean over and examine his dusty, dirty, yet smooth and elegant soles up close. It was totally different from the rest of him, his feet were amazing! Bogwart seemed like a normal goblin in his appearance everywhere, except for his feet. They were well cared for, and just had that right look. Something inside of your stirred (-15 MP). You don't know how long your face was mere inches away from his soles, just staring and admiring away, idly taking in his foot scent which didn't seem that bad at first, but clearly was having an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes, maybe even hours went by before you did something else. You cursed yourself for doing this, but, just like before, you couldn't help but give in to your urges. You pursed your lips, closed your eyes, and pressed a kiss to the middle of his sole on his right foot. Everything inside of you tingled with joy as your lips made contact, and when they left his sole, leaving a *smack* sound, you were left with a longing for more! You had to do it again!(-20 MP) Before you could contemplate your situation however, a voice spoke up. It was Bogwart's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Good girl\"</span> He said in a soft tone, causing you to pull back in surprise, scurrying back to your spot by the tree. He shifted a bit and turned over, grinning with glee at you. <span class=\"chotpink\">\"I- Wha.. Don't call me that!\"</span> You reply indignantly, stuttering for a response. He just laughed at you. <span class=\"clred\">\"Why not, human? Clearly, you know your place already, so that makes you a good girl.\"</span> He cooed out teasingly. He didn't make any movements, but he was definitely showing his feet off a lot more, causing you to stare downwards as per usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I had my suspicions as we spoke, but decided to give you the benefit of the doubt. You did, after all, give me a chance, so I decided to give you one, and this is how you spend it. Not that I'm complaining. I'm not even forcing you, or convincing you otherwise, you did this all on your own!\"</span> Bogwart reasoned, not really giving you room to reply. <span class=\"clred\">\"You're too embarrassed, too tense, little Emily! Relax. It's us two. If you wish to admit your inferiority and worship me as your superior through my feet, then go ahead. We can even make it our little arrangement if you so wish, but that will have strings attached of course. Don't answer that question just yet, you need to think on it! But, while you do, why don't you just contemplate what you have to gain?\"</span> Bogwart explained further, making you think more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right in all his points. He never forced you, you did this on your own! You kissed his feet, you brought this upon yourself, and now he was offering you something that perhaps was the best possible outcome? Still though, this was disgraceful. You could never truly commit to your quest if you accepted this. Bogwart saw the struggle inside of your head and smiled more. He was pleased that you didn't merely have another outburst immediately. Perhaps he knew that you were his already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I know your desires, Emily. Go on. Kiss my feet, call me Master Bogwart, admit that I'm better than you, that you belong beneath me. I know it to be a fact, you merely need to accept it yourself.\"</span> He pushed further. As if to emphasise his point of him being better, he stood up, took a few cautious steps to stand right in front of you and loomed over you, his feet on the ground right in front of you while his face was above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMP: 30/100 </span></div></div>",

The soil beneath you is soft, almost marsh-like and any vegetation save for moss and mushrooms has long since died. Probably from the stink.

Their footsteps are too slow to be the beast you heard, though, and they haven't noticed you, so you decide to snuff your torch and keep low to the ground to avoid them. It's hopeless to try and help them, you can only spare them a beating. But as you creep past them, something catches you off guard.

Either it was built in a hurry, or by someone (or something) who only has basic knowledge of cabin construction. Or, in the worst-case scenario, it was ransacked by monster boys, who enslaved the previous owner while taking their home... best not to think about that one too much.  Still, a home is a home.

Tell you what; I'll give you an honest hint from the jackal himself,\" The Minotaur clears his throat and bellows out, loud and clear: <b>\"When the wicked fire dwindles, you may never find your way, for where one douses their own light is where one's sure to stay.\"</b> He pauses, then cracks a smile. \"Haha! That dork really loves his theatrics, you know. He spent a fortnight coming up with that one. Anyhow, I'll let you go this time, mister, uh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer. <i>Sir</i> Summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know. Don't lose your mind just yet, <i>Sir Summer,</i> you're pretty fun to mess with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a tired glare, which he waves off with a hearty chuckle. Sighing, you start walking away, adamant on continuing your search of the dungeon. If you escaped now, not only would you be failing your mission, you'd most likely live the rest of your life as a walking target for even the weakest and most pathetic of monster boys. You might've mustered up some courage this time, but you don't know how much more your mind can take before you start throwing yourself at the feet of anyone who passes you by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambient light of the dungeon's cavernous chambers dims as you trot forward. You think back to the riddle the Minotaur gave you, but somehow you figure that it doesn't relate to these lights in particular. It's a <i>riddle,</i> after all; it's not supposed to be so literal. It's good food for thought, which helps you in your efforts to stave off your curse-bound desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to follow the narrow passageways of this labyrinthine fortress, you count your blessings. It's nice that you haven't had any unwanted company in a while. The only thing that you could hear aside from your footsteps and heartbeat was the sound of cave water dripping from the stalactites above. Dripping, dripping, like the pungent sweat of a sleeping bat boy's tired feet... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, gently put down your trusty weapon, then rub your eyes. Alas, even with the small comfort of peace and quiet, you do not know rest. Alluring visions of monster boys and their sweaty, scrunching soles plague your thoughts, and like a bad habit, you notice that your hand has already slipped under your waistband and went to work again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have half a mind to pull it out, but another half tells you to just finish yourself off. At first, you think it ridiculous. After all, why would anyone make themselves <i>more{/} vulnerable to being captured by a monster boy? However, as you think on it more, it kind of makes sense: if you left this bothersome erection throbbing in your pants, especially after how long you've spent with it, you could easily blow your load it's least convenient. If you masturbate here, rather than falling to the enemy, you can relieve some of the lust pent up in there, and have a slightly clearer mind for future encounters. Whether it's a seed of submission created by your lust-addled mind, or a rational deduction, you can't really tell. Either way, it certainly <i>is</i> a decision you can make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you decide to tough it out and hope for the best, or stroke yourself off, potentially risking your own sanity?</i></span></div></div>",

(+8 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way down the long, dim hallway, passing through the wooden arches that kept it from collapsing. Or not, considering that the well you entered was only about as deep as five or six men stacked on top of each other...hey, even if you could still feel your member throb in anticipation of the next monster boy you'd encounter, you were getting pretty good at distracting yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, you <i>were</i>, until you started looking towards the ground. You swear you were just checking for pitfalls and other sneaky traps those insidious monsters set up, but you saw nothing out of the ordinary on the dusty, grey cave floor. Nothing but the footprints of countless smelly, tired feet, trailing along the smoothed-out terrain. It was probably just the result of this place's natural humidity, but you could only imagine the traces of moisture coating the floor as the cooling sweat of those hundreds of soles... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your eyes forward, ripping them away from the floor. It seems as if nowhere is safe to rest. Resuming your trek at a brisker gait than before, you stare straight ahead, not allowing your head to budge an inch, lest something else remind you of your addiction to feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the winding passage leads to a fork in the road. <i>Great.</i> Another potential time-waster. Well, it's probably best to get a good look at either tine of it before you choose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully sneaking toward the right-hand path, you notice that, infuriatingly enough, it gradually tapers off into another three paths. That doesn't bode well at all! If this whole thing was just a maze, you'd never manage to make it out before you succumb to the footlust curse! You're finding it harder to ignore your erection, and already, a noticeable amount of precum is leaking into the fabric of your pants...

(+35 MP) Instinctively, you start walking into the room, not even checking the surroundings first. Luckily, you catch yourself before you wander in too deep. Knowing the precariousness of your situation, it's evident to you that this might be one of those traps you were so damn paranoid about. The clearing of your mind might just be a trick to lure you into the clutches of the soldiers that guard this dungeon. Still, it's hard to <i>want</i> to go back to dealing with this persistent arousal. And with this warhammer, you'd probably be able to fend off a good deal of the lowly grunts stationed here. Goblins couldn't do much against a good thwack to the head, you muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to make a choice, and quick.

Your eyes glaze over as the lurid, damnable fantasies of monster boy feet flood your mind again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"There's something you don't see often; a human, wandering around of his own free will!\"</span> you hear a voice echo through the narrow hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you rip your hand out of your pants and slam it behind your back. Unfortunately, your suspicious movements were caught by the shadowy figure. You can't make out his features, exactly, but you cam tell he's very tall, and lanky, too. He titters, stepping out of the dark and giving you a better look at him. You tilt your head up, willing yourself to not look down at where his feet were inevitably waiting, most likely bare and waiting for a skilled tongue, willing or otherwise... (-2 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered warily at his face. He was pale, and had ornate, pitch-black markings on either cheek, one of a sharp crescent moon, and the other of a sun, surrounded by triangular beams. He wore simple, circular earrings, made out of what you assumed to be gold. His cheekbones were slender, giving him a somewhat boyish look. A cheeky, catlike grin was permanently etched into his mouth, giving you a closer look at his many sharp teeth. Curiosity getting the better of you, your gaze wanders up to his dark hair. Sure enough, he had two tiny cat ears, slicked back and almost invisible in his soft, wavy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the torch above dims as he bends down slightly to meet your gaze. The cat boy leers at you, his large, burnt-orange eyes luring you in. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Hmm. There's something queer about the way you moved. What, exactly, where you doing with your hand just then?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer, nerves getting the better of you as he closes the gap between your face and his. He closes one eye and squints, looking you over. It traces over your torso, down to the pronounced bulge in your pants, then shoots back up as he returns his gaze to your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Ah, you're under a footlust curse! You've met Addis, I presume?\"</span> the cat boy lilts, obviously amused at your misfortune. <span class=\"cplum\">\"If you wish to know, my name is Suleiman.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, and thanks. My name is Sir Summers, a knight of a local order,\" you answer anxiously, subtly extending your arm to where your warhammer lied, \"I'm in a hurry, i-if I could just grab my things and get going--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuleiman clasps a smooth hand on your own, stopping you in your tracks. You shudder at its smooth caress, its long fingers caressing your own. (-3 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Ah-ah-ah! Surely you know I can't just let you go, dear knight? It's not in my nature.\"</span> He sniffs the air, and his brows furrow as his toothy grin turns into a slight frown. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Oh my, Addis already has you marked. You must've interested him. You might be lucky today, Summers. It's not often that one of your kind eludes my grasp.\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax and let out a breath you didn't even know you were holding. It seems like your journey hasn't ended just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"However, as a keeper of these dungeons, I musn't allow you to get off scott-free; even if you belong to him, it would make me look far too soft to leave you be.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuleiman glances back down at your tent, then back up to you, a smirk on his face. <span class=\"cplum\">\"I see you're having trouble with his hex, so I'll make an offer: I finish what you started, and if you don't throw yourself at my feet by the end of it, you can walk away.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder, knowing it would come down to this. You had trained yourself to be resilient against the threat of eroticism, but as your mind was encroached upon by the Anubis's curse of relentless footlust, it was rendered near-useless. You could only hope that you weren't broken enough by the time you came that you submitted to this wily devil. Reluctantly, you nod your head. Suleiman chuckles, and you shiver as his light, raspy voice flows through your ears, making you ever-so-slightly more suggestible. (-2 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you stand up from the smooth rock and let the lanky cat boy take your place. You take a moment to eye out his outfit: he's wearing a deep purple suit that seems a bit too large for his slim form. It makes it hard for you to tell how strong he is, but you doubt you could overpower him anyways. He seems much more clever than the other two monster boys you've met in this stronghold, so you can't let your guard down more than necessary. You barely resist the intense urge to look down at his footwear (if he even had any) when he reaches out, spins you around, and hugs your form against his own lithe one. It's warm, comforting, and almost...enchanting... (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uncharacteristic quickness, he jabs his hand down into your trousers and curls his fingers around your cock, making you shudder. Though you had spend a good few minutes wholly distracted from your situation downstairs, your erection hadn't subsided one bit. You shut your eyes and subconsciously lean back, allowing Suleiman's free arm to encompass you. Finally, he lays his chin on top of your head, and slowly begins to stroke. (-5 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and quiver at the expert handjob, the plush, cool flesh of the cat boy's palm coaxing your submissive side out. You feel his own rod stiffen through his pants, pressing slightly into your back. \"Mmmmh,\" the cat boy purrs, arm hugging tighter around your stomach, \"I love when your kind surrenders. It makes it all so much easier. Fall into your place, human, at the feet of your betters.\" (-10 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're panting and pleading as you're jerked to your limit. Images of what you desperately imagine are Suleiman's soles flash through your mind, further entrancing you. His fingers squeeze tightly against your member, stroking you at untold speeds, and finally, you let it all out, spewing into his slender hand as you orgasm. Your pleasure peaks, and you nearly faint as you ejaculate the largest load you've ever made onto the cavern floor. (-20 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sheer euphoria, your eyelids weaken. You can feel them struggling to hold your last line of defense. Giggling, Suleiman whispers lewdly into your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\"><i>\"Don't look down~\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"You <i>know</i> what will happen, Summers. So, don't look down,\"</span> he pauses, <span class=\"cplum\">\"...unless you <b>want</b> to. Hihihihi...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to hyperventilate. The sight of this monster boy's lovely, filthy soles would certainly break the last of your will. A murky voice begging you to submit echoes throughout the walls of your mind. Through your bleary eyes, a narrow peek of blurry light gets through your lids. Do you even have the strength to resist anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(MP: 10/100)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you rise, freed slightly from your lust, you feel something else pulling you in. The absence of Suleiman's comforting warmth was bitter. Your head swam with images of soles, toes, heels, all waiting for you, but one stands out, unique: the blurry shape of the lanky cat boy's face was there. It grew larger and more defined, encompassing your whole view, blotting out everything else. Your legs shook as you realized what this meant, what you felt about him... (-9 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of breaking down at the shame of being suddenly, hopelessly infatuated with a monster boy, you felt a fuzzy warmth fill your breast. With great resolve, you carefully turn towards the monster boy, who stood up while you were daydreaming. He gave you a questioning look, as if to ask what you were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore a word leave his lips, you leap, wrapping your arms behind the lanky monster boy's neck, and planting a powerful kiss right on his mouth. Suleiman gasps in surprise, then blushes and chuckles softly. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Hmhm, so assertive. I can see why Addis took an interest in you...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at his feet, clad in his sweaty, worn, grayish socks and stuffy black dress shoes. He frowns. If you ever got a closer look at them in the state you're in, you'd surely lose your mind. You might even experience ego death, if tales from other high-ranking guards were true. While a part of him felt that was just and fitting end for a mere human, the way you'd managed to catch him off guard made him reluctant to just make you a foot slave. Something in him wanted that spunk, that unpredictability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closes his eyes and clears his head, glancing back up at you. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Well then, Summers. If you insist on staying with me, I will gladly accept you.\"</span> He takes a moment to press his lips softly to your forehead. <span class=\"cplum\">\"We will still have to see Addis about your hex, though.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug yourself tightly into his chest, nuzzling your head against him. He softly returns your embrace, and to your surprise, begins to walk backwards with you in hand. He presses himself against the shadowed wall, and instead of stopping, he slips further into the dark, pulling you with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's silent, pitch black. You open your eyes, but it makes no difference. This void is supernaturally still; you can barely even feel Suleiman's arms around you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you are ripped out of the darkness. You find yourself standing in the a lavish chamber decorated with gold and ancient trinkets. You see the form of Addis, the Anubis that cursed you, lying bored to tears on his marble throne. You can feel Suleiman hugging you again. One arm was wrapped around your torso, the other free for him to gesticulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes follow your new master's movements as raises a hand to his face. He's proudly wearing that same handsome, cheeky grin from before. Cupping his hand around his mouth, he shouts, <span class=\"cplum\"><b>\"OI, ADDIS!\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Anubis yelps, startled out of his chair by the unexpected sound. He very nearly falls flat on his face while slipping down the carved steps leading to his seat. Cursing, he marches towards you and Suleiman, obviously not enthused to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Well well well, if it isn't Suleiman, the snatcher of slaves,\"</b> he snarls, looking his 'friend' dead in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat boy raises his free hand up in an attacked gesture. He laughs self-deprecatingly, <span class=\"cplum\">\"Oh, you wound me, Addis! I'm not taking this human captive. I'm simply bringing him to you in order to remove this pesky footlust curse.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddis scowls. <b>\"You know I put that on him for good reason.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Yes, I know you were playing your little game with him, but he's already pledged his loyalty to me,\"</span> Suleiman remarks, turning to stare at you with his deep, orange eyes. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Be a dear and tell him yourself, would you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond by doing the same thing you did when you accepted your desires, now wrapping your legs around your master's waist as well. The color drains from the Anubis's face; he covers his sight with his arm and yells indignantly at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"<span class=\"cmaroon\">Alright, <i>alright!</i></span> You've made your point, you wretched <i>snipe.</i> I'll undo the curse...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reluctantly climb off your cat boy master, Addis mumbles under his breath, just like when he first laid the hex on you. You blink as your mind clears, the thoughts of irresistably musky soles fading. The need to stare down at his smelly paws goes away as well. It's so much easier to focus now... (+50 MP)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter releasing you from your mental chains, the Anubis sighs and sits down on the ground. He rests his arms on his knees and stares blankly at his sandals, looking utterly defeated. Suleiman shoots him a sympathetic look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Oh, cheer up, old chum! You'll find another plucky adventurer someday.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddis crosses his arms and grumbles. <b>\"Yeah, maybe in another century or so.\"</b> His sour expression softens, morphing into a sadder, pensive look.<b> \"Oh well. If he fell to you, he probably wasn't the one anyway. Still, I'd rather not have you rub your little victory in my face. Enjoy your new slave, Suleiman.\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat boy smiles caringly, more genuine now than you've seen him yet. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Take care, friend. I sincerely wish you the best.\"</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you are pulled you back into the void and warped through the inky black into what you assume is Suleiman's room. It's dim and cool, the only light source being a bluish flame that burns from a cresset at a corner. The place is fairly large, considering the cramped chambers you passed through in the dungeon. Of course, that's assuming you're even there anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make out some furnishings, including a large, cozy looking bed. An old quilt lies on top of the white sheets, grayed and patterned with the same sun and moon as on Suleiman's cheeks. Speaking of, he taps you gently on the shoulder, catching your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"Today's been quite exhausting, Summers. It was oh so <i>boring,</i> patrolling the same unchanging hallways as I have for decades. Boring, that is, until you came around,\"</span> he quips, drawing his clawed finger gently up your neck.<span class=\"cplum\"> \"I think it's time we stopped delaying the inevitable. Come, sit down by my bed. I'll show you what you've been so desperately lusting after.\"</span> Even with the curse lifted, you find yourself instantly hardening at Suleiman's blatant intent to have you under his feet. You don't notice it, but you're drooling. Not because they're feet, but because they belong to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie down on your knees obediently waiting eagerly for your master's delicious soles. He takes his sweet time, teasing off his fine, black shoes, letting their delicious, musky, beat-in stench waft your way. As you inhale, your eyes nearly roll into the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Suleiman inches a socked foot ever-so-slightly closer to you, then slams it into your face. You don't even feel the pain, the taste and smell of hard-earned sweat overtaking everything other than the pleasurable pulsing of your turgid member. You sniff, shuddering with each breath, loving your master's scent. He sighs with fake disappointment. <span class=\"cplum\">\"Oh, you really are hopeless, Summers. It seems you won't be able to stand being away from my feet for very long. I'll just have to give you a little chew toy to calm you down...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pokes a fabric-covered toe into your lips. You open your mouth, letting it in, and with expert gentleness, pull the sock off of his foot. The moment it leaves his skin, you suck the sock into your mouth and begin chewing it greedily. The salty, sour, utterly <i>delectable</i> flavor of footsweat and grime fills your mouth; you moan hotly, desire obvious in your tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuleiman stares down at your pathetic form. In truth, he did feel a bit annoyed at how quickly you fell to his feet, but he figures he'll have all the time in the world to whip you into shape. Besides, your helplessly aroused face was almost compensation enough for it. It wasn't long before he felt himself firming within his deep purple attire. He unzipped his pants, letting his erection throb freely in the cool air of the bedroom. The cute little gasp you made when you saw his cock spring free made him feel that much more confident in his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping off his socks, the lanky cat boy temporarily deprives you of his musk, only to present you with his bare feet. You were in awe. They were long and slender, much like the rest of him. Each had five smooth, pale, shapely toes that lead down to a soft, spongy ball, up to the deep, plush arch, to the firm, supple heel. You can't even bring yourself to blink, lest you deprive yourself of their visage for even a second. They were...<i>perfect...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat boy gripped his shaft, leering down at you. <span class=\"cplum\">\"You know what do to, Summers,\"</span> Suleiman murmurs, exposing his soles to you, <span class=\"cplum\">\"<i>Lick...</i>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lick you did.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next item on Dr. Kai's list of research goals was a sample of elven foot sweat. He had hypothesised that the hypnotic effects of monster boy feet were caused by a foul-smelling and volatile substance secreted from between their toes; a substance which, if there was any truth to the rumours of adventurers falling into a trance after mere seconds of exposure to an elf's soles, should be found in high concentrations in their sweat. Sadly, from what Dr. Kai could piece together, elves would only sweat voluntarily. This meant that, if he wanted to get any decent sample, he would have to bring a live elf to his laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was easier said than done... on one hand, elves weren't exactly hard to find - unlike most races of monster boys, elves were social beings who could live for thousands of years, seldom leaving their giant tree-cities. This meant that, once founded, elven colonies would rarely be abandoned. And fortunately for Dr. Kai, there was one such colony only a few miles north of his town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, hunting down an elf, particularly in his natural habitat, was a dangerous proposition. Besides the aforementioned allure of elven feet, elves had an innate connection with the forest and its dwellers. Their cunning and agility was unmatched in all of the known races. Even with the help of experienced mercenaries, capturing an elf was a tall order indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the same traits which made elves dangerous foes in their home country, also caused some of them to leave the forest and integrate the upper echelons on the Monster King's militia, as frightfully pungent warriors and generals. There were reports that an army of beast boys led by a elven marshwarden would soon pass by Dr. Kai's region on their way to besiege Antiuck. Assaulting the general's guard would require even more hired swords, but at least they would be fighting in roughly equal terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaand there was one last option... although the monster slavers would mostly trade in (more or less) foot-obsessed human beings, they would just as frequently sell other monster boys and girls. There was a good chance that if Dr. Kai were to infiltrate a monstrous slave market, he would be able to find a suitable subject for his experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those options in mind, Dr. Kai got busy planning the historically unprecedented capture of a living, breathing, stinking elf...</span></div></div>",

He was a aware of a monster slave market a few miles south in a large cave. And, the crafty wizard could cast a spell of mirage on himself to make his appearance more monstrous! It seemed perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai had decided to take on the appearance of an Orc, they were common enough to be seen as normal but threatening enough to be left alone by anyone with ill intent.

As she rose over the surface into the temple grotto, Ruto took comfort in the quiet echoes all around her. After a few deep breaths, she sat down in thought. For as long as she could remember, monstrous being plagued the lands of Hyrule and it's people. These monsters however seemed to have a rather odd fascination with feet and an even worse habit of dominating others with them. Of course the Zora' s and a few other civilization didn't have too much trouble when they themselves weren't truly human. However, it was for that same reason that the Hyailns became more and more isolated. After years of near quiet, Princess Zelda had reached out to the Queen and therefore herself with the claim she had a way to end this madness. The problem itself being that Ruto' s mother would not be able to make the journey and so the trip was upon the princesses shoulders. Sure she had been outside before, but she really only stayed to the rivers and even then barely left the domain of her subjects. As Ruto stayed in thought, she was unaware of what was watching her in the darkness. She finally did become aware when the most rancid oder assaulted her nose. \"Oh disgusting. Who dares being such an uncouth scent to....\" Ruto stopped in her tracks and her sentence as she looked at what stood before her.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a pseudo-spinoff of my other interactive story, Monster Girl Feet. Check it out here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2097160-Monster-Girl-Feet\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/2097160-Monster-Girl-Feet</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to demand, I've decided to write a story about monster boys. Not just any monster boys, mind you, ones who love to fight humans and tease and humiliate them with their feet! You can choose to be a boy or a girl, or a character from a different series (i.e. Naruto, Hunter x Hunter, Avatar, etc). Also, instead of having a pre-decided age and backstory for the main characters, you can choose one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, calato gave me the excellent idea of using an RPG-ish system. Characters have MP, gold, and an inventory. The MP stands for mind points, and as they're attacked/teased by a monster boy's feet, their MP drops, and they slowly start enjoying being dominated by the monster boy's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hero will have 100 MP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did I choose 100 mind points? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause I want the hero to start to think differently as he loses MP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 1/4 of his MP or more (75 MP remaining or less), he/she'll realize monster boy's feet (cute monsters' feet) are not bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 1/2 of his MP or more (50 MP remaining or less), he/she'll literally LOVE cute monsters' feet and will start to like uglier monsters' feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he/she loses 3/4 of his MP or more (25 MP remaining or less), then he/she'll love cute monsters' feet even more and will also love uglier monsters' feet a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his/her MP reach 0 then ... asolute slavery for all possible monsters' feet no matter who they're are ... only a miracle can save him/her from eternal foot slavery ^^.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the battle system, I thought of something like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nif our hero attacks, her basc attack is 1 + 1 for a her steel rod. Which means she will deal 2 dmgs. If the enemy has an armor of 0 he'll take 2 dmgs, if his armor is 1 he'll reduce dmg by 1 and will receive only 1 dmg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame goes for her: but since she has basic clothes her armor should be 0 so she'll receive maybe 5 dmgs from the goblin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No female feet. I made another story for that, remember? :P</span> (ADDENDUM: After thinking about just how much I like both, and how making a  \"Monster Girl + Boy Feet\" would be a needless split, I've decided to allow SOME female feet involved. HOWEVER, monster boy feet are to always be at the front and center, and a scene cannot feature female feet without also having a strong focus on male feet. For example, a scene where a monster boy and his monster girl mate both use their stinky feet to enslave an adventurer would be okay. A scene where that monster girl dominates with no input from her mate is unacceptable. If this rule serves to be particularly controversial, I will strike it down immediately. I just want to try this out for now.)<br>\r\n-Shrinking, hypnosis, transformation, and dirt/sweat are allowed and encouraged.<br>\r\n-Watersports and scat are NOT allowed<br>\r\n-Anything you want to write about that aren\u2019t on those lists? Shoot me a PM first just to be sure.<br>\r\n-You have to use proper grammar and spelling..<br>\r\n-All non-choice chapters need to be at least a paragraph long.<br>\r\n-Feel free to go crazy with monsters! Anything from plain elves, to bulky orcs, to huge dragons are okay with me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!</td>",
