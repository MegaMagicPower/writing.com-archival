What he saw shocked him as it was Steele by himself chewing on the meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steele, what are you doing?\" Balto asked as he found the husky dog that bullied him his entire life eating meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, if it isn't the wolfdog wonder who is going to report me for just wanting a snack in peace, how does it feel being a hero huh?\" Steele said disgruntled to Balto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no, I am not going to tell anyone, I was just wondering what happened to you?\" Balto said as he noticed that Steele looked a bit chubby in the underbelly while entering in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what does it look like to you!\" Steele shouted out loud when the door closed shut as nobody noticed outside as it was just the two of them alone. \"Eating this meat is the only comfort I can have after you took my place in the serum run, everydog in town hates me for lying and I guess I deserve it after all what I did to you, even my own team looks down upon me no wonder why.\" Steele anguishly said as tears started to come down from his eyes, as Balto now understood, true Steele did deserve what he did to him but he knew that wasn't going to solve anything as Balto thought of something in his head that could cheer up Steele. </span></div></div>",

GO!\" Balto shouted as they both dug in the pile of meat devouring every single piece of meat there was, lucky for Steele as he had the upper hand as his belly was just starting to get big and for Balto his belly was starting to become a bit chubby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, look at you only look like you just ate a full day's meal and your not big enough compared to me!\" Steele taunted <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenge was on and Balto wasn't going to let Steele win so easy but he felt his belly was so full so he mustard his inner wolf in him to wolfdown the meat instead of chewing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later their bellies started to touch the ground, and Balto has overcame his discomfort in his in his belly as it now started to feel so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Balto, this is pretty fun idea to see who can have the biggest belly.\" Said Steele as Balto repliedback \"Yeah I know, so I guess we're friends now?\" \"Maybe if we reach to a tie?\" So they continued on with each juicy meat they consume and digested into fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour in their bellies were bigger than a dog standing on two feet, their once muscular legs were now replaced with flab along with their big behinds and chests formed two big pillow like moobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto was in a sitting position with his paws pressuring into his fat belly as it felt good to be this big as he held in his maw the last piece of steak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wolfy! Give me that slice of meat, I'm still hungry.\" Steele said as he waddled behind Balto but couldn't move with the big lard of a white belly limited him from getting closer to the equally lard wolfdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong big guy, are you already beached, you glutton?\" Balto said with a smile as he chuckled with the meat still in his maw. Steele jumped up with his hind legs but with his belly still on the ground as Steele than rolled down in the front direction where Steele's head landed behind Balto's butt with a thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBalto than sucked up the last meat in defiance. \"Looks like I win Steele.\" Balto said as he turned his head towards Steele. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky left up from the Wolfdog's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? It look like a tie to me as we are both equally fatasses.\" Steele exclaimed proving a point. \"Okay Steele, it's a tie.\" He said as Balto moved a bit to where Steele was sitting. Both of their fat bellies making sloshing and gurgling noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look pretty good with a fat look on ya wolfdog.\" \"I could say the same for you too Steele.\" They both complemented their bellies as both of them started getting an attractive to eachother. Balto and Steele enjoyed looking at eachother's bellies with their noises going on until they heard some paw steps coming to the entrance and it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's note here's what Balto and Steele look like with idea of them both fat. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/31432577/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/31432577...</a> So far this is where let you decide what happens to Balto and Steele, will they form so fatty love relationship, what will Jenna think of this?

Inside there should be two giant vats that can somehow create a never ending stream of whale fat from nothing.\" Stella was ecstatic that she was about to get what she always dreamed of, to feed and fatten endlessly. Stella went in and sat in a wide open area of the factory as Jenna grabbed the two hoses and brought them to Stella. She stuck both hoses into Stella's mouth. Sensors in the hose sensed that it was time to activate the vats which began to send a constant stream of whale fat into her mouth. As she started gluttonously gulping down the fat, a huge smile came upon her face. Her whole body began pulsing out at a constant rate. Even after just a few seconds her cheeks were already the size of large beach balls. She already had a few dozen chins pour out in front of her. Her belly fattened and sprawled out in front of her, already the size of a small boulder. Her breasts had also fattened quite a bit and layed on the ground on both sides of her. Both rump cheeks were the size of a large boulder. Stella moaned in pleasure, delighting at the site of her massive belly growing bigger, fatter, while rolls appeared all over her. She was like a balloon being filled with fat. Stella was grabbing and playing with every roll she could reach while she still could. \"Mmmmm, so big, so fat, so sexy. Crank up the flow to max Jenna, and blimp me to the extreme. Ooohhh, fill every single bit of me with tons upon tons of soft warm sexy flubber. Make me burst out of this factory. Make me EXPLODE with fat rolls, Make me an ocean of blubbery beautiful fat. DO IT, DO IT TO ME NOW, JUST KEEP MAKING ME FATTER AND FATTER AND FATTER. Feed me, FEED ME, FEEEEEEEEEEEED MEEE. Please make me an unrecognizable billowing blob of fat, blubber, and flab.\" Fortuitously for both of them, the hose and vat can also sense her lustful desire to be even fatter, and tripled the flow by itself. Jenna climbed up on her to get a view of her fattening face. Though when she gets there all she could see is a beak slightly poking out of countless jiggling rolls of fat that was wrapped around the hose. \"Mmmm someone is a greedy glutenous piggy, aren't they. One that can't stop themselves from fattening uncontrollably.\" teased Jenna. \"OH YES, OH YES, I'm a big fat piggy goose blob, so please make this fat blob even bigger, even blobbier, even FATTER. And please also play with all my bulging, thickening, rolls of fat.\" cried Stella. Jenna was more than happy to comply, as she began jumping up and down on her fat blob body. Making her a giant undulating ocean of fat, as waves of fat rolls crash into each other over and over again all over her body. Stella couldn't describe it, the feeling of every inch of her body swelling with more and more fat. But it felt amazing, she began to relax and sink into her own rolls of fat as she watched and felt herself fatten more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until she filled the factory. Every nook and cranny filled with her fat. Her rolls started bursting through all the doors and windows. It wouldn't be long before her waves of fat smashed down the walls. Stella was squealing with joy as she felt the walls start to give. \"Come on, COME ON, just a little more until I can fatten unconstrained. Then the whole WORLD can see this massive goose blob grow bigger and bigger.\" Suddenly she exploded out of the warehouse, her blob body billowing out and hitting the ground, making her jiggle, quake and shake like no one has ever seen before. </span></div></div>",

At this point, her neck rolls numbered in the thousands, with more blubber rolls forming every second. The neck rolls have completely swallowed up her head by several feet. Her hands and feet had also sunken deeps into her fat rolls by several feet. Her blob body had just started slamming into the surrounding buildings. The feeling made Stella scream, \"Oh god, I'm helpless to stop myself from getting fatter, it just feels too good. I'm a prisoner in my own blob body, unable to move or wiggle any part of me, and I LOVE it. Oh, but I need to be even more massive. I need to be even FATTER, and I need the whole world to see.\" Jenna said \"This really is all you want to do isn't it. To have your rolls of fat pool out in every direction and smother anything in the way of your blob body.\" Stella's blob rolls have already covered half the city, truly showcasing her deep desire to grow and fatten out of control. \"Of course this is all i want to do, and why should I do anything i don't want to. And all I want is to get FATTER. To have more and more fat pour out of me in a never ending tidal wave of flabby blob rolls.\" Stella answered. From afar Stella looked somewhat like a giant volcano that was erupting with lava. Except instead out lava flowing down her body and pooling on the ground all around her, it was her own thickening blubber rolls. Stella noticed a helicopter flying overhead, observing her. She knew it was filming her for the world to see, which turned her on even more. She starts moaning again, making sure the people in the helicopter could hear her, \"Oooooh that it, make me FATTER, make my rolls cover the Earth. Feed me into a planet sized blob, just make me grow fatter beyond all comprehension. Please make me grow faster and faster. If only there was a super weight gain formula that I could also guzzle and gulp down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella got just what she wanted as several new helicopters appeared, all carrying a giant vat with the words Mega-Gain on it. When they were over Stella they releases it, dropping it into several of her chin rolls. The force of the drop makes her blob body and fat rolls jiggle and slap together even more. Jenna made herself useful and grab the new hose, putting it into her eagerly awaiting maw. The formula quickly made its way into her mouth and down into her stomach. She surged out in an even faster constant rate. This made her totally and completely give herself to the fat.  She couldn't focus on anything but the feeling of getting fatter and fatter. She just kept expanding, her goose blob body was like an ocean during an extreme hurricane. Wave after wave of fat crashed against each other harder than ever, making slapping noises that can be heard all around the world.</span></div></div>",

Which was the size of a football field. Jared, a young human male of 18 years of age, and surprisingly enough the manager of the local whaling company, walked on closer to the wobbling and jiggling mass of goose fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJared could tell that the pale purple goose was feeding from the two giant vats of unlimited supply of whale fat, judging by the two hoses going up to the top most middle area and down into the towering pile of rolls that must likely to have been the neck of the goose. So without wasting any time, Jared, climbs up the rolls of flabby fat until he gets up to where Jenna is. Fortunately, he was born with the rare ability to understand animal language. He noted the red husky playing with the blob goose's fat in various ways. He settled himself down at the entrance to the vertical tunnel of ringing and jiggling neck rolls with the two hoses going down there. \"Well, my my my, your such a hungry and gluttonous and beautiful goose. Hello, my name's Jared. I kinda owned the factory building you broke out of. Don't worry, I have more along Alaska's shores. With more giant vats of whale fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself, he couldn't help but sit down, slightly sinking into Stella's flabby and easily jiggled blubbery fat. He started to rub and caress over her fat, not minding what Jenna would think about him. He always wanted a hungry and gluttonous female to be with and feed her fatter and endlessly fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Stella's gluttonous hungry feeding on the limitless supply of whale fat, she billowed, pulsated, jiggled, wobbled fatter and fatter, spreading out in a widening radius as well as bulging upwards, rolls stacking and piling up as she mounded higher, pooling and oozing outwards as she spread out further and farther. Within an hour, Stella was still on earth but she had fattened huge, no, massively enormous that Stella herself was the fat blob size of the planet earth.</span></div></div>",

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, SIS? YOU WERE JUST THE SAME LAST NIGHT, AND ALL YOU DID WAS FALL ASLEEP LIKE THE REST OF US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu then replied: \"DO YOU THINK I'M NOT ASKING MYSELF THAT SAME QUESTION? Wait, Kodi...maybe this is just some kind of messed-up dream. How about we see if it is? You know, poking? Pinching? Other things like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodi, calming down like she just had, said: \"Yeah...that might be a good idea. This could be some sort of messed-up dream...let's see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he walked over and pinched Aleu's belly hard, pulling the giant pawful of blubber he got back just as hard and letting it snap back against her massive belly, causing Aleu to go: \"OOOOOWWWW!!!! AAAAAAAAAA!!!! OOOOOOOO!!!! KODI, THAT HURTS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" Kodi said. \"Nuts! Maybe if I poke you in your belly button and run my claw up that and another part of that region of your belly, instead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu nodded and Kodi poked her belly button, causing Aleu to go: \"EEEHHHEEEHEE.\" because, while it didn't hurt, it did feel weird and sort of tickled, and when Kodi rubbed his foreclaw up the region of that part of her belly below her navel and through it and finally above it, it felt even odder and tickled even more, so Aleu said: \"AHHEEHEEHEETEEHEEHEE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat.\" Aleu said, but Kodi then said: \"Sorry...but wait...I'm also sorry about how this is going to feel, but it's the last possibility of this just being a dream that we've got. Fair warning...it's really going to hurt, but it's either that or giving up on trying to see if you're just dreaming along with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\" Aleu said, and so it was that Kodi bit her belly as hard as he could and grabbed two fistfuls of fat to go with the mouthful of blubber he now had and he pulled it all this way and that, then, knowing how painful this was for Aleu, he swiftly switched to pushing her belly around and in and out, also this way and that, in addition to licking it and then jumping on and hugging it, making it so that he was no longer hurting her, but was now tickling, hugging and rubbing her, which of course felt much nicer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds Aleu made were: \"AAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEAHAHAHAHAHAHAHATEEHEEHEEHEEHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAHHH HHHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was no longer lost in the bliss from the soothing relief of what ways of Kodi's touching her belly were hugging and rubbing, she felt his nose touch her belly, his tail sweep across it, his forepaws beat on it as though it were a drum and all four of his feet climbing on up it with some gripping in order to get to the top of it, and when Aleu saw Kodi's face looking at her own following how she briefly laughed from how much it tickled, she then heard him sigh and shake his head along with seeing a disheartened look on his face, which she then echoed on all counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so much for the idea of it just being a messed-up dream.\" Kodi said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Aleu replied. \"No question or doubt about it now...this is definitely reality. But seriously, how did I get so fat? I was just the way I had been before prior to falling asleep last night. And I wake up being this much a big, fat load of blubber? Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, footsteps were heard by them both, and it would turn out that Balto, Jenna and Niju had recently found out about the effects of the full moon thing and what would happen if someone had slept under it the night that preceded this morning, right after they reacted accordingly to what had happened to Aleu and saw Kodi atop her huge sphere of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the way that they explained everything after their shocked reaction was...</span></div></div>",

Will the wolves think of her as weak leader for eating all of the meat and would her father and brother be ashamed of her for getting fat? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut than she remembers a dream she had a few nights ago, in her dream as the wolf pack was traveling through this new land, the wolves were having a hard time trying to hunt down prey as many of the caribou were suddenly disappearing and as the wolf pack couldn't eat the caribou, they started to get weak and starved to death as if there was no prey to eat in this new land and most of all winter was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and her mate Taku were laying down in the floor of the cave. \"Aleu, what happened to the caribou?\" Her mate said as he was weak. \"Taku hang in there, I'll find us something.\" Aleu tried to get up but her legs were malnourished and weak as she couldn't get up. \"We haven't eaten anything in months Aleu, we couldn't even support our pups. Is this the end for us?\" Taku replied as he was slowly drifting away. \"Taku no! You can't give up yet, I can still-\" Aleu was cut off as she realized he was gone as what was left were a wolf's skull and bones. \"NOOO!\" Aleu woke up right next to her mate as it was only a bad dream which woke him up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu now remembers what that dream meant, they haven't been able to find any caribou in a while and this meat would be their last chance of survival to get through the winter even if every wolf should be fat, this plane is filled with meat that can feed her entire wolf pack throughout this and she would prove it if she had to put on some weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu went outside of the crashed plane and let out a howl as a way of communicating to her wolf pack from a far distance, 5 seconds later she heard their howl to her confirming they would come to her, the she wolfdog went back into the wreckage where a ton of meat was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu continues eating the rest of the beef jerky from the bag and than moves on to smoked sausages while still having a tummy ache but Aleu mustered on as she continued eating doing her best to ignore the discomfort. As she continued eating the meat the more weight she gained  as her once thin legs started to look a bit flabby and her rump getting big as well and her soccer ball sized stomach was now the size of a beach ball as Aleu leaned back to examine her belly and she still believed she has enough room for her belly as it no longer felt discomfort and it was apparently true that wolves can expand their bellies and Aleu started to like her new fat look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aleu was about to continue eating but than heard pawsteps coming as it turned out to be her wolf pack. \"Aleu, we are here now, what have you found for us?\" Taku announced outside along with the other wolves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleu thought to herself if she would be embarrassed by rest of wolves as they would possibly think of her being selfish if she has eaten all of the meat but she should explain her plan that could help or even benefit her wolf pack. So she courageously came out of the door of the plane but with a bit of struggle as her belly was so big for the door itself \"Hing! Come on!\" She said as she pushed herself out but with enough luck she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aleu came outside of the wreckage plane within the wolf pack's sight, they were puzzled by Aleu as their female Alpha was fat. Nuk, the big wolf of the pack chuckled a bit at Aleu's new look which caught her attention. \"What is it Nuk?\"Aleu said to the big wolf, to which he repliemd back. \"Sorry, sorry Aleu, I thought it looked like you were pregnant with a huge litter of puppies.\" Nuk said with his accent as he tried to control his laughter. \"Well, than maybe you could feel them if I have to sit on you Nuk while I explain to everyone what we are going to do.\" Aleu said to the big wolf as he said \"I apologize ma'am.\" As he was no longer chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Aleu announced to the rest of the wolf pack, \"What I have found here is some human craft that has crashed down here is indeed filled with meat, and we all know we haven't been able to find the caribou in the few days we have explored this territory and another fact that we are in the season of winter, every wolf here should store up fat to stay warm for the winter as you can see me here.\" All the wolves than talked to one another about this plan Aleu has for them and worried if they lose their physical fitness they need to hunt but some were starting to see her plan could definitely work for them in the end if they need to store up fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's weird but I remember the vision I had 2 weeks ago where we were starving to death and that we would even result in eating our own, this is our best chance of survival, consider this a blessing from the spirit brothers and sisters.\" The entire wolf pack concluded in a agreement to Aleu's statement and as ordered three wolves went inside to the wreckage plane and take out the rest of the meat Aleu had not eaten yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aleu, can we have a chat in private?\" Taku said as Aleu came toward him with her fat belly jiggled. </span></div></div>",

Plus, if they have so much meat in here, would it go bad if it just stays in for the entire season?\" Dusty raised a good point as there was lots of meat that had an expiration date March in the current year but still was hesitant in joining with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we have to be in shape if we are in need to pull the sled and besides don't we have kibble the humans give us for our meals?\" Kodi countered the reasoning Dusty presented to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I heard kibble doesn't give the protein a working dog needs from what I heard.\" Dusty said to Kodi in which he replied back. \"And who told you that?\" \"Dipsy.\" \"What?! Dispy doesn't do much as she's just Mr. Conner's pet and we are sled dogs!\" Kodi pointed out the fact that taking advice from a dog like Dipsy won't do much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your part wolf from your dad's side and since dogs and wolves are related, it's much more natural for them to eat meat than what the humans provide?\" Dusty also brought up that fact that made Kodi second thinking his stance but was a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh...\" Kodi tried to muster up his thoughts till Dusty brought up another fact. \"And I heard that storing up fat will also keep you warm form the whether we're having today right?\" and just like that a blizzard was forming outside of the shed where Kodi started to shiver a bit as the breeze came in quick that the door in the outside closed on it self shut leaving only the two of them alone inside of the meat locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be than Kodiak?\" Dusty said into his ear as his stomach also growled at him for missing out on his meal in the afternoon as well.</span></div></div>",

Since when does a date involved one of the two lovers forcing the other to EAT!?\" \"Don't be like that, I am generously feeding you, look your bones are visible on your chest.\" Dusty putted up a paw to him so that he can feel how his skin was so close to the rib cage of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I am not that hungry!\" He protested but his stomach still growled at him for denying his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you stomach disagrees with you, here we can go with two options,\" Dusty said as Kodi listens to her suggestion. \"I can just hand you food for you to consume as your belly gets bigger, but if you don't comply, I am going to have force you with this device here.\" Dusty walked over to reveal a machine with a hose attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh, Wh-what is that?!\" Kodi muttered in fear of what he saw before him. \"That,\" Dusty turned her head towards it. \"its a food capacitor, what it does is it grinds the meat into bits of mush where it's easy to sallow down.\" she than looks back at the helpless wolf-husky, Kodi had no choice but to comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay okay... Ju-just don't overdue it Dusty.\" Kodi muttered those words in defeat as Dusty's tail was wagging from her big behind. \"Once you get this big like I am, you will feel so much pleasure.\" as she goes get a meat leg from a plie nearby, she comes to Kodi with only the leg of the bone as Kodi than chews on it and swallows it down and took another bite after that repeating that again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 20 minutes of Kodi eating the scraps of meat where he just finished his sixth try, his stomach was starting to bulge out a bit with a naval belly button showing itself as Dusty saw it. \"Hey look you got a cute belly button on your tummy!\" Dusty pointed with her paw to show Kodi. \"Dusty, I think I am about full here, I don't think I can take much more.\" Kodi groans as he felt like he ate 5 bowls of kibble. \"So it's the food capacitor than?\" When Dusty mentioned the food capacitor he immediately took back what he said and Dusty gladly went back to get another scrap of meat and Kodi took another bite out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kodi was now on his 13th try of eating a spare rib, Kodi's belly was at a size of a beach ball as it was full of food, Kodi felt overwhelm as this was too much for a meal a dog could eat in a day. \"Dusty, I th-thi-think I can't... eat much..more...please stop for a mome-\" Kodi fell to a food coma sleep, Dusty still wanting Kodi to be fat like herself respected his wish as he need more time to digest the food in him which just leaves Dusty the perfect opportunity to strap the food capacitor to his maw and muzzle and after that went back on packing on pounds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Kodi woke up from his food coma slumber as he flet his body was different as his chest felt like flab moobs along with his legs now felt flabby than a dog's or a wolf's athletic muscle along with his rump felt bigger and heavy as well, all of the digesting has put him in this condition and his belly now flet big but still at the size of a beach ball and his sled dog harness was still on him and he notice his maw was strapped to a hose to the food capacitor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm! Dufmh!\" Kodi tried to speak but couldn't make the words proper instead. \"Don't worry now Kodi, your belly has just digested all that food you ate so you have more room for more.\" Dusty said as she was right next to the food capacitor and Dusty was also different as well as now her silver belly is bigger as it touched the ground and was twines the size than Kodi's, Dusty than activates the food capacitor as meat was grinding into mush and moved it's way to the hose leading to Kodi's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUMMPH-\" Kodi tried to yell for help but was no use as there was nothing he can do as the mush meat went in his mouth and forced down his gullet with more and more came in. Dusty move a bit as she can with her belly just dragging on the floor, only her pudgy hind legs could move as her belly kept her fore legs up from the ground, wobbling her way to Kodi as he tried to get this strap off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kodi, you can't fight it, just let it in it will be alright.\" Dusty told him in a soothing tone as Kodi had tears in his eyes when he looked at her as he again felt his belly swollen up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just see how big your belly can get till that harness on you bursts off.\" Kodi's belly began to moan and groan at how full of mush meat was in there it was 3 times the size of a beach ball of a white creamy belly and the sled dog harness getting tighter and tighter on Kodi's belly till.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal pin of the sled dog harness bursts off of Kodi's belly like a bullet straight into the food capacitor that shut it down, Kodi took a sign of relief as there was no more mush meat going down in his gullet as Dusty took the strap off of him which fell on to Kodi's belly that was now at the same size of Dusty's sending ripples of fat on the wolf husky belly before sliding down to the floor, Now the ropes tide to Kodi's legs were also free as he could move a bit again but he couldn't move at all as he was heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusty, why?\" said now that it looks like it has been done with him not just being fat but morbidly obese. \"Because I wanted to show you my love and affection to you Kodi.\" Kodi was some what confused form the answer and was going to say something back until he felt like something coming out from his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BELCH* Kodi burped a rupptly which made Dusty giggle at him and Kodi looked at her just seeing how her giggles also sent ripples on her belly, just seeing that made Kodi blushed as he realized just how beautiful she looked being fat. Both of their bellies made nosises together as if singing in harmony. \"So how does it feel?\" Dusty said to him as she rubs her paw on Kodi belly which just felt so good. \"Well uh.\" Kodi said as he couldn't come up with words but he was starting to get the hang of it as his big belly just felt so soft like a dog bed along with it being so warm as the blizzard was still going on outside. \"You like it don't you?\" Dusty said to him in his ear to which Kodi said, \"You know maybe this aint so bad.\" \"See? I know you would come around.\" Dusty said before a belch came from her. \"Oh, sorry about that, all this eating has sort of made me sleepy.\" \"Yeah I think so to-HIC!\" Kodi said as feeling the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you Kodi.\" Dusty said as she laid her head down on Kodi's belly, \"Love you too.\" Kodi said as he laid his on top of her head as they both fall into deep sleep in sitting positions with their big bellies side by side with their navels visible making gurgling and groaning noises together.</span></div></div>",

Now on with the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Steele got up after sleeping so long. About 12 hours of sleep, which is a crazy amount of time to sleep, even for a dog. Steele still had a problem getting up a little bit, but not as much the first time. He woke up very hunger so he ate a couple 100 links of saugage for his breakfast. When he was done, he actually began to realize how much bigger he was now. He was currently about the size of a medium small bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Maybe I have gotten a LOT bigger than I used to be.\" Steele said to himself. \"It's not THAT bad being this big, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all the weight, Steele decide to go out. It toke awhile, but he was finally able to get the hang of walking with the extra weight. As he walk, he got the notice of all the sled dogs. Some of the dogs were shocked with such a massive dog, others kinda chuckled at his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't that Steele?\" A male husky said.<br>\r\n\"Woah! He really let himself go.\" Said another husky dog.<br>\r\n\"Hmm.....everyone's staring.......\" Steele thought. As he did, a young husky pup came by Steele. He put his paws on Steele's belly and had a curious look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Mommy, why is this dog so fat?\" The pup said.<br>\r\n\"H....Hey!\" Steele said. The pups mother came by.<br>\r\n\"Now Now! It's not polite to ask questions like that.\" The mother said. She then took her pup and the two were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele now had a concern look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really THAT fat?\" Steele said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele went back home after his walk. Even with some of the dogs comments about his weight, he was still ok with it. Also, his stomach was begin to growl like a beast. He was starving like before and want food.</span></div></div>",

He goes into the cellar, but has some problems fitting pass the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Come on!\" Steele said annoyed. Later, he was able to get out. He was relieved that beening struck was over. He took a look and was now in awe. The cellar was filled with ceiling-to-floor with meats. There were links, t-bones, steaks, beef shacks, pork belly, even whole calf. All smoked and cured with deliousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at all the meat. I don't know where to start.\" Steele said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second after saying that he rushed to a box of steaks. Taking a big bite of one to savor the tastes. Then goes to to quickly eating the rest of the steaks in the box. Once he was done with that, he went for the sausages. He suck them up like he was eating spatghetti. Than Steele starts to eat even more boxes of steaks. Doing so cause his belly to expand more, but he continue eating like it was nothing. He was now craving pork. He reached out for one of the smoked pig and devoured it. He would continue to more eating, til he realized that he has eating about half the food in the cellar. That and the fact that his belly has gotten so big, his legs are now not touching the ground. That and his was close to twice the size he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh! My legs aren't touching the ground.\" Steele said. \"But there is still more to eat, and I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele felt that he was in a dilemma.

It took a LOT of effort for him just to move, let alone get the door. He was able to get out, but not without wreaking the the doorway a bit. But he didn't really care about that. The only thing he cared about was his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pretty late. Nighttime in fact. Everyone in town was asleep. So this made things easier for Steele. After some long wobbling, Steele finally made it to the bakery. Actually, it was more of a bakery in the front and a factory in the back. The bakery front had all the things like pastries and few loaves of day old bread, while the factory back would most likely have cakes, pies and more sweets galore that the front doesn't show, and in bunches. With that in mind, Steele decided to try to get in the back. The factory backdoor had a lock on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, this lock could be troublesome.\" Steele said to himself. Steele grab a rock near by and banged it at the lock. A took a few times but the lock finally broke. \"Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Steele open the doors.

Next, he went to the cakes, which were mostly vanilla and topped with berries. Forget taking a slice, he just ate the whole cake. He would take no time devouring each and every cake, and getting frosting all over his face. The more he ate, the wider his belly gotten. After a while, he finish nearly most of the baked goods.

Steele now had a really fat face with puffy cheeks and a belly that was just MASSIVE. Steele currently just layed on his belly and rubbing it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the life.\" Steele said to himself. It seem like Steele has had his fill.

I'm becoming the talk of the town.\" Steele said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steele try to waddle more down, he happen to feel some small poking at his belly. Turns out, it was the same husky pup from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy look. This dog is even bigger now. How he get so fat?\" Said the pup. Steele felt embaressed.<br>\r\n\"Haha! His belly is like the size of a whale.\"<br>\r\n\"Now now. It's not polite to say that.\" Said the pup's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother than took her pup and they went on their way. As Steele watch them go, he heard the words, the size of a whale. He knew he wasn't there yet. But at his rate, he was gonna be soon. The next day.........</span></div></div>",

But he notice about the other dog putting on some autograph, saying \"FREE AUTOGRAPH.\" Everyone else came to see him, &amp; wants some autograph too. Steele was happy to be a star. He would call himself as a movie, &amp; be a movie star too. Steele had a second dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele was on-stage for a national burger eating contest. It's against Balto, Kodi, &amp; Aleu.

Once you enter, you will stay in your favorite place forever. I have a surprise for you.\" Steele was still scared, but to do what it said. Steele enter the gate. Inside was nothing. Until it said, \"Steele, this is your new home.\" Steele was shocked. It's a pile of steak, meat, turkey leg, chicken wings, sausages, &amp; pool of hot dogs where his old friend Metal asking for a date. Steele would love to meet her. All they can is eat, &amp; play. \"If you eat all of these foods, I'll let you know when you want more.\" Steele said, \"Okay, thank you!\" Metal said, \"So, you wanna go watch stars &amp; eats some chicken?\" \"Sure!\" Steele said.

I lost my girlfriend, &amp; I have no hope for my old life. I think I'm going to be fatherless, but...\" Why would you be that?\" \"I have no proof for saying that.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, sorry. Well, by the way...\" Steele remembered he had a rose to bring with him. \"Will you marry me?\" \"Uhh..........\" Steele woke up! He had an perfect dream, but he can't remember what had happen.

And, though you certainly deserved to lose your glory, fans, popularity and reputation, there is one last thing you must lose, as well, before you've fully gotten your just desserts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Steele asked. \"I've just been shut the door on and everyone hates me now, not to mention that Jenna loves Balto and hates me more than ever, even though neither of them like to hate! How much worse can it get for me, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple.\" replied the winter spirit. \"You see, I am magical, and, though you will not be seeing me again after this, the spell I'm about to cast will take away the final thing you've got going for you. Namely, your fit form. I am going to fatten you massively and make you unable to walk on four feet, and only your hind ones, instead, which, ironically is so, on the one hand, you'll be able to move, but on the other hand, everyone will always be able to see how fat you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteele opened his eyes widely, and before he could do or say a thing, the winter spirit cast her spell and he was on his hind feet with his forelegs having become like arms and forepaws being almost like hands in a split second, with both a great many layers of fat showing on the back of his body and, far more blatantly, an enormous, super fat and jaw droppingly tremendous belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, I am going to give you a link to a picture on Deviantart to show you how fat he was made, though it is worth pointing out that said picture was drawn not by me, but by HectorTheWolf, and, though the character with fat Steele, Metal, is a creation of HectorTheWolf's and with Steele, I want you to look only at Steele in that picture so you can know how corpulent he just became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img00.deviantart.net/2aea/i/2009/334/d/a/steele_and_metal_by_hectorthewolf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img00.deviantart.net/2aea/i/2009/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, having seen how unbelievably obese he now was, Steele was going: \"N...N...No...this can't be...it didn't just happen...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes it did.\" said the winter spirit. \"And, before I disappear, I would like to let it be known that you will now fall asleep, and when you wake up, it will be after everyone else does, and the door in front of you will fly open as my magic teleports you in front of all of the other dogs, those polar bears and that goose, though none of the humans, but the ones who you are being shown to will be together thanks to that same magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...please. Don't do this. Change me back to normal. I beg you. I've been punished enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you haven't.\" stated the winter spirit. \"But this is permanent, and everyone will see and know it, also thanks to my magical powers, tomorrow, so you will have been punished enough by then, by tomorrow morning. Farewell, you selfish, disgusting, rotten waste of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe vanished and Steele fell asleep, and everything went exactly as she made it happen even though Steele would, as she made clear herself before, never see her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, when everyone was near where it turned out Steele was, as they'd find out, Steele showed up right in front of them exactly in the way the winter spirit had described, and everyone was aghast at how humongously fat he was, unable to speak for quite some time, much like Steele was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the silence was eventually broken, as the ability to speak again and thus respond to this sudden and jarring sight came back to one of the dogs, who commented on what had just been shown to them immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat dog was...</span></div></div>",
