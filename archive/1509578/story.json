            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ok, you chose 7th grade. Before starting, here are some facts about this time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Blake is 12 years old and Joana 13. Karina and Ayrton are 13 also, Lillian is 12.<br>\r\n-Blake and Joana just met, so, he isn't too confident to her, and if he shrank or Joana grew he probably would get away from her. Doesn't like much affection and love and reluctantly accepts hugs from her.<br>\r\n-Cinthya is NOT here. If you want a rival for Joana that would be Lillian or Karina (which would be a betrayal since Karina they both are her friends).<br>\r\n-Ayrton and Ferdinand may shrink also, but if Blake does and is alone, they won't appear (In other words no male interaction while Blake's shrunk. If Joana or other girl grows there won't be any problem, but guys don't grow.)<br>\r\n-If there appears a bully or Blaze, Blake is at his strongest state because at this time he fought everyday with someone.<br>\r\n-Joana is near to be evil at this year, not really, she only fell in love of him and wantd to give him all her love, despite it could be too much for him at his size (or hers...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after all this (I hope it wasn't too boring). What do you want to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- Joana would try something kinda a love potion on Blake and only shrinks him to 2 cm. She only wanted to have him as her boyfriend (Not evil)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.- Joana would try to use a potion, thing, perfume or whatever to attract Blake and things go out of control. She grows!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.- ????. It could be a variation of number 1 but Joana was angry because Blake doesn't like her affection and hasn't asked her out (Evil or wrong sense of love...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.-Hmm...do I have to say something here?...Well Blake shrinks by whatever suddenly and is alone...Nobody knows about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.- Here Karina and/or Lillian may shrink Blake, or they may grow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's an average dat to the moment. Blake was wandering around in recess. Getting a little away since his friends talked mostly about he and Joana. He went alone to think something, maybe a way to show them that Joana doesn't love him or something like that. By the moment, he was avoiding everyone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile. In the lunch tables...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was some of her friends and they were talking animatedly about girls' things. Until a girl named Veronica asked <br>\r\n-\"Hey, what guy do you like from those of 'D' group?\"- (Blake's and Joana's classroom) Another girl said <br>\r\n-\"I've heard that they are good soccer players...and sexy!\"- The others laughed and talked more about it. Joana was silent. Girls talked to Karina <br>\r\n-\"Do you really like that boy, umm...Ayrton?\"- <br>\r\n-\"Of course\"- She said <br>\r\n-\"Well I know he's your boyfriend but is I think his friend, the quiet silent boy...what's his name?\"- said Adrianne -\"Who?...Anthony?\"- said Danielle <br>\r\n-\"That one who doesn't fear anyone and everyday is fighting bullies...\"- said Veronica, trying to remember -\"Ah...the cool guy, I think his name was Blake or something like that\"- Said Rose <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, Blake...He's a little better. And the girl he had for girlfriend would be safe from other guys, hehe and...\"- Veronica continued, and Adrianne made a sign to her, meaning 'Shut up'. Veronica asked quietly <br>\r\n-\"Why can't talk about him?\"- And Adrianne pointed discreetely Joana, who was silent and looking down. Only Karina knew the true officially at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica said <br>\r\n-\"Uh...I'm sorry Joana...\"- This woke up Joana from some daydream <br>\r\n-\"Huh? What? Why?\"- She said <br>\r\n-\"Oh don't pretend you don't know what are we talking about...So, what do you have with Blake?\"- Adrianne asked <br>\r\n-\"Uh...Nothing...He's only a friend?\"- <br>\r\n-\"A FRIEND?!\"- And almost all the girls laughed. Joana looked down and blushed, then Danielle continued -\"Come on!! The only girl who is with him the whole time calls him friend?\"- <br>\r\n-\"Wh-What's with that?...\"- <br>\r\nKarina intervened to help her <br>\r\n-\"I know Blake hasn't much female friends, but Joana hasn't anything with him, in that case I'd have something with him since I know him since 4th grade...\"- Joana made a face like saying 'What?!' but then realized that Karina was only helping her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So...seriously...Do you like him, Joana?\"- Adrianne continued and Rose added <br>\r\n-\"Yeah...If you do, we'll make sure nobody else will try something with him...I mean, you are the only one who deserves to be with him\"- Joana thought that it wasn't true but they were her friends anyway...and decided to tell the truth, she looked to Karina and she nodded. <br>\r\n-\"Ok girls...yeah, I don't just like him...I love him!!\"- <br>\r\n-\"You see? It wasn't so difficult\"- Veronica added and Danielle said<br>\r\n-\"You should trust on us some time...\"- The girls laughed and Joana said <br>\r\n-\"Well...I wasn't sure about anything, and, as you can see...Blake isn't easy...\"- She giggled and Rose said -\"Yeah, he doesn't seem to be an easy conquest\"-, Joana looked a bit angry <br>\r\n-\"I don't think Blake as just a conquest...No one else made me feel like he did\"- <br>\r\n-\"Umm...being saved would be cute, like a fairytale, hehe\"- concluded. Then the girls talked about much things else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the bell rang and everyone got up to go to their next class, and before Joana left, Adrianne said -\"Maybe you would want a little help...This place sells love potions that you could use on Blake...\"- And gave her a little card with the address.</span></div></div>",

I want to know if he loves me...\"- <br>\r\n-\"Ok, I'll search for a potion of that type\"- After some minutes, she said <br>\r\n-\"Hey, may you give me some facts about him...I mean, if he's though a normal potion won't have effect...\"- -\"Yes, He is, maybe the thoughest boy one could know. If you don't mind I'd like you to give me the strongest potion you have...\"- <br>\r\n-\"Here you go\"- Said the old woman. <br>\r\n-\"Umm...how much do I owe you?\"- Joana said while she was taking her wallet from the purse, the old woman smiled and said <br>\r\n-\"Nothing...I see you aren't the girl who would be bewitching every boy she liked. You seem to love really that boy, to the grade that you didn't want a conventional potion. I hope to not be wrong with you\"- <br>\r\n-\"Oh, thank you very much!\"- Joana said happily and left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going, she asked a last question <br>\r\n-\"He has to drink it, no?\"- <br>\r\n-\"Yeah, why? you wanted another method?\"- <br>\r\n-\"It's ok, just to be sure\"- And began to walk to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joana said to him <br>\r\n-\"I don't like you, George.

Then he snapped out of it and said 'I can't fall any lower. If I fall lower then joana would kill me' he thought, 'guys always look at joana because of her breasts and she doesn't like it and gets angry that boys sometimes just pay attention to her only because of her breasts.' He didn't want to find out what would happen to the guy if he fell in Joanna's breasts and secondly he didn't want to be that guy to find out.<br>\r\nAs he thought he then realized that joana had also made him a fashion accessory.

Joanna thanked god that she didn't trip over, that would have caused her to fall on Blake. She fixed herself and continued to walk not paying attention to anything else but what ahead of her till she got home.<br>\r\n    Meanwhile while Joanna didn't check on Blake after she nearly fell, Blake had lost his grip and fallen into Joanna's cleavage. Blake was freaking out and turning new shades of reds from falling in her boobs. Blake then suddenly changed his mind mumbling loudly to himself \" I rather now want to be her fashion accessory. It's better than this\". He continued to get redder and redder as he said this. Blake looked around and saw he was completely surrounded by her soft silky skin and that her slight walk created a small bounce. Pushing the wall at either side of him. Feeling this Blake freaked out and decided to climb out of there. Then he quickly realized  he was touching her breast and quickly stop climbing. Blake thought in his head 'there's no way this can get worse'. Then as he said that his world began to shake causing her skin to go up,down ,left, right causing a storm of skin to completely cover Blake. <br>\r\nBlake realized Joanna must be running to get home quicker but in the process she was smothering him with her massive breasts. </span></div></div>",

Well...almost everyone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFRIDAY, 10:00 A.M AT SCHOOL, RECESS TIME...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the circulation of the rumors, many boys stopped to wander around and kept near the classrooms in fear. Blake and friends weren't among those ones, and they played soccer as they always did. That was their favorite sport game, and they always enjoyed to play with some other brave guys who weren't afraid of the rumors. The game finished and Blake's team won by 4-2.

She looked down at him and saw how scared he was, well, anyone would be and after all Blake wasn't running away and screaming, like many other boys probably would have done. Even with this he kept some of his brave. Joana bent down to look Blake closer. He stopped crawling when she did this. He knew that it might be worse provocating the anger of someone who was able to crush him with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana tried to grab Blake moving her hand slowly but he stood up and walked away backward, he was keeping looking at her to know her next move. She tried to talk to him <br>\r\n-\"Blake...\"- and put down her extended hand. <br>\r\n-\"Please, come here\"- She wasn't intended to scare the boy she loved secretly. Blake was still, just looking at her and planning an effective way to escape and not get killed. After all what happened he couldn't trust on her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you\"- Joana said softly, and Blake, who has never been a coward and feeling cornered thought that he'd die anyway, so he'd die bravely, and said <br>\r\n-\"How can I trust you?! You betrayed me!!\"- knowing the risk he was taking. Joana wasn't really expecting that, but somehow she should know that it would be a normal reaction. Anyway, she felt sad because of what she had done, she betrayed in some way to the one she loved. She remained silent and looked down sadly, then she said -\"It was just that...that I...\"- <br>\r\n-\"So, the rumors were true...and what's supposed to happen now?! You want to torture me?! Eat me?!\"- Blake shouted, he was very angry but in deep he was feeling sad because of the betrayal. He had never been betrayed by anyone who considered a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Blake said hurt Joana more than he thought, and she said<br>\r\n -\"B-but...\"- <br>\r\n-\"What?! You wanted me as a pet?! or were you looking just for a toy for some weird fantasy I'm not interested to know?!\"- Blake yelled again, he was furious with her, and even being that small he wouldn't die without having said what he was going to say. Blake found himself in a dead end and because he was not caring about nothing anymore he'd say all what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana tried to say something but the words wouldn't come up, and she finally asked <br>\r\n-\"Why are you so mean with me?\"- And began to cry. Blake crossed his arms and turned around, looking down but still angry <br>\r\n'Hmph...and she says I'm the bad one...how's the life, she shrank me and now cries...' But, not knowing why, Joana's cry was specially making him feel bad with himself. Though even when he was a child he had never made a girl cry but he felt that this was feeling worse than it should. He was thinking about apologize himself, but his thoughts interruted him <br>\r\n'Wait a minute...she was the one who acted treacherously and I'm gonna apologize? Why should I apologize? She shrank me! She should apologize with me' But then he rejected that thought, Blake was never an arrogant and he was only thinking it with a justice sense.</span></div></div>",

Blake, previously, would have agreed with that, but he didn't want to hurt her feelings anymore, while he was thinking up something to say, he remained silent, and Joana added <br>\r\n-\"...I betrayed you...in the most evil way...you would have never suspected any evil thing from me...you trusted on me...and I ruined it...for being such a bitch\"- Blake decided to find out later why did she do that, but now he decided to calm her down and said <br>\r\n-\"Joana...\"- <br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- -\"You are none of those things you said. You're not evil...\"- Blake didn't finish the phrase and Joana gave him a very big a tight hug. Blake somewhat felt she was not really evil, but then that leaves a huge \"?\" in the question, why she shrank him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Do you really believe it?\"- Joana asked with some tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n-\"I do\"- Blake answered, but meanwhile he thought about his friends had been telling him the whole time <br>\r\n'Is it possible...Joana really likes me?...that can't be true' he rejected that thought and said <br>\r\n-\"Umm...and, just to know...what am I going to do? I guess I'll have to live in here...or in that tree\"- Blake pointed at a big tree which was near to the table. Joana giggled because it sounded so cute to her.

I can beat you both at the same time!!\"- -\"Stop prattling and show me if you're that strong!!\"- said Blake defiantly, James said -\"I don't know how much damage can he take, I've already attacked him with all my might and he remains the same...\"- -\"This time will be different\"- Said Blake, he only cared for now about beating this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight began, James and Blake began to hit the white haired boy, who blocked most of James hits but was taken by surprise by Blake, who kicked him in the stomach, then in the left leg, making him to lose balance and fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hmph...too easy...\"- Blake said, and then added -\"By the way who the hell are you anyway?\"- -\"Name's Blaze\"- Was the answer of the white haired boy.

He saw how the smoke was fading and there were two figures appearing in it. He saw James lying down, and pale, possibly dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other figure wasn't nobody more nor less than Blaze, who had been severely damaged and hurt, his clothes were tore, revealing his muscular torso. He didn't look that strong, he had the same physical condition than Blake, maybe a little worse. Blaze brushed the dust off his shoulders and muttered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Damned idiot...he hurt me...\"- Then he looked at Blake, smiled and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, you still alive? Ok then, now I'll finish you\"- And ran toward Blake, but he, after seeing his father's death and remembering the first time, the feeling to be unable to help him and let him die was too much for his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wond'ring how much more can he take<br>\r\nWatching the walls where shadows dance<br>\r\nDrifting away into a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his eyes are blazing with fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreams burnt to ashes so many times\" - Stratovarius, Eagleheart<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words were real for Blake, who was enraging at his ultimate degree, he felt the fire burning inside him and the rage flowing through his blood, he was a fighter and he wouldn't let his father die in vain like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fever is burning in his veins<br>\r\nDetermined with courage breaking the chains<br>\r\nBack against the wall under blood red skies<br>\r\nPrepared to fight until he dies\" - Stratovarius, Eagleheart<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, words come true with Blake, and not caring about anything else, he closed his fists and responded to Blaze's move, punching him in stomach with a new amazing strenght, and kept hitting Blaze with more than all his might, each punch and kick while he recalled his father's memories, and the day he died to save him, the rage, the rage for not being able to help the only person who understood him ever (except for Joana) was the last trigger, Blake's wrath was fully unleashed and even in his arms the veins became visible and slightly protuberant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked Blaze away after a lot of really hard hits, Blaze didn't expect the rage made Blake that strong and his smile vanished, he knew that Blake was going serious and in his eyes he saw a thing never seen in Blake, a killer look, Blake now fought to kill him, in the most painful way possible. Blake was feeling blood thirsty now...was that what James wanted to prevent in him? Was their lineage destined to a never ending combat? That seemed so until Blake's birth, being the first who found real love in the world, and things seemed to be different, it seemed that James' sacrifice wasn't in vain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze ran again towards Blake and a monstrous fight began, they both with new strenght, and even when Blaze could keep at the same level, he noticed that his energies were runing low and that he was extremely damaged, Blake was having the upper hand at this duel and soon overpowered Blaze's abilities, Blake fought in a style he had never used, using all his might in each hit, and taking advantage on each thing he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before doing the last hit, the one would finish Blaze once for all, Blake's might ran out and he fell backward, now breathing heavily and his heart beating very fast, his body aching with pain and not being able to move anything, Blake had surpassed his normal limit long ago, but the limit of over using his energies had been kept until a few moments ago, Blake's rage had consumed all of his strenght and now he was at the mercy of Blaze, again, Blaze had to take a decision, and even with all the damage he had taken, he was too evil to leave a chance like that, and walked towards Blake, rising him and connecting several punch in his torso and stomach before kicking him and sending him away against a damaged wall, which collapsed with the impact. This was the beginning of the massacre, and Blake struggled to get any might, but his body had said \"no more\" and he had no longer any energy, even the least, to confront Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the memories about James fueled again his body, letting him to stand up even after not having a real physical reserve of energy, and he tried to punch Blaze several times, but, unfortunately, he dodged them all, and hit him with his knee, then he made him fall straight down with his elbow and put his foot on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It's over Blake, you both made a good fight and James died long ago (more than 2 hours), you had to end up like him, you can't defeat me in any way\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grabbed his foot and attepted to throw him down, but he did a somersault and avoided it, but that gave Blake enough time to recover and stand up again. Blake, breathing heavily, walked slowly and tried to hit Blaze again, against, failing, he was too slow for him, and Blaze grabbed him from the face and began to hurl him down against some walls and the ground before throwing him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake still recovered, with his left arm disabled and his legs almost broken, and he kept trying to fight Blaze, who now got annoyed by this, and after kicking him away he said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I see you're a resistent bug...you've taken more than enough to kill you and you keep fighting...\"- Blaze punched Blakein stomach and whispered to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Too easy...why do you want to live anyway? Nobody cares about you anymore\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words triggered Blake's mind again, he now recalled about Joana, who he had left in somewhere away from there, he blamed himself for letting him to die like that and knowing how heartbroken will she get when she would know he died. He stopped a kick Blaze did and with his elbow he hit him right in the center of the shin, breaking it, Blaze screamed in pain and then growled in anger <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'll be serious from now!!!\"- Saying this, he ran toward Blake, who did the same and when they were about to clash punches Blaze twisted slightly and used his elbow to hit Blake's neck and back, and before he fell, he stopped him with a knee hit. Then he rose Blake again and sent him away against the remains of a near building with a powerful kick. Blake's body broke the wall and a lot of rubble fell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen remembering about Joana and that he hadn't power to continue, he thought about a thing: his father, and he yelled <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"FATHER!!! PLEASE...GIVE ME THE STRENGHT!!!...GIVE ME THE POWER TO DEFEAT HIM!!! I NEED IT!!! PLEASE...\"- Blaze laughed at this and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So many hits have driven you crazy, heh\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James' body disappeared and a golden light from the sky illuminated him, Blake's body lighted and even when he kept all the damage, he felt how the energy filled him. And Blaze, who saw this, quickly tried to stop it by killing Blake, and he punched toward his heart to pierce it through, but Blake's hand stopped him and he felt the tremendous strenght. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What the hell is this?!\"- He was disconcerted.Then Blake's body lighted again and he stood up, punching Blaze with the strenght he used before, or maybe more... Blaze enraged and forgot about everything, the only thing he wanted now was to kill Blake and finish all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed toward him saying <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even when your daddy gives you some energy that won't be enough to beat me!! I can't be defeated by a human!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't win, I have a reason to keep fighting...and I have a reason to live\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punches flew at a very high speed, but Blake took the final advantage and after hitting Blaze only in stomach and ribs very hardly, he, lying down, said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"H...How can this...be...possible?! How can you be this strong after all the damage I've dealt to you!!?\"- Then he added <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But it doesn't matter how much you can take, you'll never be able to kill me!!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You won't know until I try, won't you?\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake said while a golden shine surrounded him and his haird waved upward slightly, there was no wind but his hair was waving as if there was. Blake's eyes had become yellow. Blaze felt for the first time the fear...for the first time he thought he was going to die, and he was right, Blake began to hit him with all his might and even when Blaze was the toughest guy he had ever known, he began to take the consequences of the battle, he spat out blood and couldn't stand anymore, his ribs and legs were broken. Then Blake rose him strangling him by grabbing him in the neck, tightening his grip and did what Blaze did to his father, a punch which pierced through Blaze's chest. Blaze's eyes went white and spitted blood...</span></div></div>",

Joana's stomach growled, and she, after giggling, said -\"I'll have to eat also\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Blake watched the tv (it doesn't matter what was on). Joana was a bit ashamed beacause in her mind, Blake could think that she'll get fat (As far as I know, most of girls don't like to be seen while they eat because they're afraid of this. Even when they have incredible bodies). Blake had never given an answer to the question that his friends made a lot of times to him about if he found Joana pretty, he said that he wouldn't answer to not get into trouble. Even when Blake didn't like to be Joana's \"captive\" at all, in deep, things might be different, and so Blake's feelings...</span></div></div>",

In Blake's mind was like there were two tiny Blakes, an imprisoned one who would be the one to be unleashed slowly in secondary's days if they happened in a normal way, and the other who repressed his inner impulses. One side was telling him to tell her the truth, that she was beautiful and a nice girl with an amazing body (Big breasts and booty for a 13 years old girl, firm and flat stomach and regular thin waist). The other side was telling him that he'd get crushed for such comments, in the end, Blake, blushing a lot, finally nodded. Joana opened her beautiful eyes wide and her heart was beating strongly in happiness. She said -\"Awwww\"- and hugged Blake tightly, and even when he didn't like to be pushed against her giant breast at all, he was silent because now he possibly would never get back to normal and because anything he'd say would be muffled by Joana's soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Joana released him and put him near her eyes, she said -\"Why didn't you tell me before?\"- Blake said -\"I thought you'd get mad and...being this small I could get crushed as easily as any bug\"- Joana giggled at Blake's reasoning, it was kind of funny that being that brave he'd be afraid of a girl, but then she understood, recalling another talk where their friends were telling them they should be together, while Joana tried to not make obvious she absolutely loved Blake, He said that he didn't want get in trouble. She understood that what he meant was that he didn't want to ruin their friendship risking like that. In fact, knowing this, Blake at least was trying to be a lot more mature than most of the boys who were happy sneaking into girls' bathroom. She knew he was different and that was possibly one of the things that made him special to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake expected an angry response since he's been accustomed to that, his fighting life has made him like that, and even Karina was agressive at first, mistaking him by one of the bullies he defeated. Joana understood him and thought that it was his mother's fault because she was the one who forced him to survive by himself, hating him at every moment, and the only other person who would help was James, his father, but he gave his life to save little Blake long ago.

She had never stopped to think so deeply about Blake's traumas and his nature. Now she was kind of understanding that him being shy and somewhat afraid of her was related to his past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake probably blamed his father's death on himself, although at 5 years old there wasn't much he could do at that time. He thought that if he was never born his father would still be alive, but, maybe, what stuff he said had some truth... James' life wouldn't have much sense by himself, and that's what he wanted Blake to understand when he was dying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Blake, James had already seen the future, and saw that Blake would have a life way better than his own. He knew he changed the destiny, for a good one. That's why he smiled seconds before dying, he found peace with himself knowing his son would live, and would have a life, although he could think about many things, Steven, his best friend and adoptive brother, Bruce his adoptive father, little Blake, his own child, and how he'd get a life and getting married with a girl he'd meet at secondary in future. Although not knowing who was she, it didn't matter, as long as his son was happy, he'd be so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked up to the ceiling, wanting to see his father, looking at him from above, wherever he was, Blake wanted answers, and to ask him for help. Blake felt like being the weakest person ever at his current size. He wanted to see something, a signal his father was still there, he promised it. Suddenly, he heard a familiar whisper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I haven't left you\"- Blake was surprised and looked around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You'll be safe with her, trust me\"- The voice, which seemed to be spoken by the wind itself, said to him. Blake thought it was weird, but decided to trust. Joana was staring at him and he realized nobody else heard it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Ignore that\"- Blake said and laid on her belly. After 15 minutes he stood up suddenly and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Joana!! What will be of the guys?! If you got to shrink me they'll sure will and they will be dead for sure!!\"-</span></div></div>",

That place looked like a natural garden, but the sunlight was blocked by the clouds. Then, she felt a strange wind and in front of her appeared a man dressed with Blake's leather jacket*, a white shirt and black jeans. He had a striking resemblance to Blake, just that being older, in his early 30's. This man had a darker skin and surprisingly, had the same scar in the right eyebrow as Blake had. His eyes were black as Blake's, but they looked different, sharper and colder, but wise. Joana had seen a kind of fire in Blake's eyes, and a hidden warmth.

Joana then looked at her left hand, she had a golden feather on it, she played with it for some seconds before it vanished in tiny fading golden pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No, James, thanks to you...\"- Joana muttered, and then looked on her belly, Blake was still sleeping. He looked so cute to her when she saw him, and thought about how cute he should have looked when he was a baby, being held in his father's arms. Joana caressed him softly with the tip of her finger, and went back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't believe it, she didn't know Blake woke up early and trained, but that probably was what made him stronger than most. Or maybe he'd be still thinking about that guy Blaze, and is preparing for their next encounter. Blake had told her that he barely could beat him in his dream, and he felt like he didn't do it all, but now that James talked to her, she figured that maybe he helped him. He also seemed to have more abilities than a normal person, the way he spoke was like he already knew the future. Joana thought it couldn't be possible, but the fact he showed wings was... way weirder than everything, and the feather was even weirder. She decided to not let down James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hi\"- Said Blake after some more fighting training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why did you wake up early? Last time you slept a lot\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's because after a fight I'm out of energy, but now, I've gotta train to defeat Blaze next time, anyway... someone must stand guard\"- Joana noticed Blake's worrying, though he didn't want to sound protective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Awww....\"- Joana picked him up and hugged him tightly against her huge breasts. Blake was kind of getting used to this, though he still didn't like it so much. Joana released him and giggled when she saw he blushed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry about that, I'm with you\"- Joana said soothingly, but Blake replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"We were lucky last time, I barely defeated him in the dream, and he mysteriously left. But I'm sure next time we won't have that luck. And... I don't want to sound arrogant, but I doubt someone else could beat that guy, he's way stronger than Alexander*... and he's roughly the same level as me. None of my friends would stand against him even together\"- (My first thought was to mention Ivan as the strongest one Blake knew but all of this happens WAY BEFORE his encounter against him. Anyway, there have been bullies strong enough that only Blake could fight them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Uh...ok...\"- Joana said, she was a bit scared because Blake was right. And was afraid of not being able to protect Blake at his current size, disappointing James who left him in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NOTE: Alexander is Blake's nemesis, and cousin, has fair skin, black eyes, a scar in the left cheek, and physically has less muscles than Blake but is faster. His fighting skills are about the same as Blake's, and his style is almost identical, though more offensive and violent, while Blake balances both attack and defense.</span></div></div>",

Karina and Ayrton are 14 also, Lillian is 13.<br>\r\n-Here appears Marylin, a crazy and sick girl who wanted Blake for her (first Joana's enemy). She's very skinny and not what a boy would call a beautiful girl. She's 15<br>\r\n-Blake and Joana know each other by certain time, so, he is some confident with her, and if he shrank or Joana grew he probably would hope her to help him. He reluctantly accepts hugs and kisses from Joana, but in deepest of him, he's beginning to like it.<br>\r\n-Cinthya is NOT here. If you want a rival for Joana that would be Lillian or Marylin<br>\r\n-Ayrton and Ferdinand may shrink also, but if Blake does and is alone, they won't appear (In other words no male interaction while Blake's shrunk. If Joana or other girl grows there won't be any problem, but guys don't grow.)<br>\r\n-If there appears a bully or Blaze, Blake has less skills since he stopped fighting as much as he did in 7th grade...<br>\r\n-Joana would be more gentle this year because she knows enough about Blake to be sure that he likes her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this (I hope it wasn't too boring). What do you want to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- Joana was a little impatient and wanted to seduce Blake, but that he still accepted to be her boyfriend by his own will (In other words, uninhibite him, unleash the part of him that loves her) And used a kind of drink or something like that, but only shrank him...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.- Joana would try to use a potion, thing, perfume or whatever to attract Blake and things go out of control. She gets bigger and bigger!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.- Blake is shrunk by Marylin or Lillian intentionally... Most likely that Joana is aware<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.-Hmm...do I have to say something here?...Well Blake shrinks by whatever suddenly and is alone...Nobody knows about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.- Self explanatory</span></div></div>",

Marylin's brother fought him along other two of his friends (or henchmen?) and they changed the tactic from fighting Blake to catching him, they three grabbed Blake's arms and back to make him unable to move, but, surprisingly, Blake was stronger than they tought and even three guys weren't able to immobilize him.

Then Blake stood up, limping and Joana helped him to walk to a nearby table. Joana rubbed Blake's arms and his hurt leg to disipate the pain. Blake might refuse but after a year he had enough confidence on her and he wasn't in the position to protest. Rubbing felt nice anyway. Joana also liked to do this, it was one of the very few moments she could touch Blake more than usual without him trying to avoid it.

So...even with his fighting skills and his bravery, he wouldn't be able to escape for sure if somehow Joana didn't appear...or better...turning her against Blake himself.

Well, the previous day, Joana, fed up with Marylin's attempts to seduce and catch Blake, appeared before her and told her that if she kept trying to get Blake she'd get into serious trouble, and pulled her from the hair to emphasize her threaten. Joana was about to hit her but she stopped and warned her. Marylin wasn't that afraid of Joana herself except by two facts: If her brother and the bullies attacked her, Blake would appear and kick their asses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in fighting, Joana would have advantage because Marylin is too thin and weak (maybe a nice girl for an american, I haven't anything against them. Just mention culture's differences). And she wasn't really what Blake or an average latino boy would call a sexy girl. She seemed anemic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had black hair, a tanned skin and black eyes. Nothing special. And her personality didn't rise up her beauty, in fact, she was characterized by being the selfish and unfaithful popular girl. Joana, on the other side, had a very good body, and not taking on count her measurements, she had more muscles than her for sure. And, after a year watching Blake she had to know some fighting moves.

He caught every hit directed to Joana and he got angry because of all those pathethic ones trying to please a popular but not very pretty girl. Blake, after finishing them all, he asked <br>\r\n-\"Why you still try to get me?! What makes Marylin that special!!?\"- They answered that the reward and the favor of her brother who was the leader of all bullies. Also they expected to receive popularity, some even said that they wanted to ask Marylin out. Blake laughed at it and left with Joana, the thought of being hunt by everyone because of Marylin was disturbing him <br>\r\n'This is the limit! The only one I can trust on is Joana...' He walked silently while Joana followed him. He didn't understand yet why she was against Marylin or why she was so protective, and didn't care too much. To him, they were just friends and not anything else, and by the moment, she was a good ally since she could take care of Marylin herself. But a strange thought passed by his mind <br>\r\n'Ask Marylin out...how pathethic, everyone should know that even Joana is prettier' Then he astonished by his own thought and stopped walking, he stood still silent and thought <br>\r\n'Did I just think that? Why the hell would I think something like that?' His thoughts were interrupted when Joana asked <br>\r\n-\"Is there a problem Blake?\"- <br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"- Blake negated and they kept going. There was still the whole recess and Blake reached his place, a little garden with a big tree where nobody but him and his friends knew about. They sat on a bench and Blake crossed his arms backward in a relaxed attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's incredible how his personality changes...' Joana thought while stared at him, he had closed yes so he didn't realize <br>\r\n'He can fight at a moment and then he relaxes like nothing happened...he isn't definitively resentful, or vengeful' Blake felt himself being watched and asked to Joana <br>\r\n-\"Hey, what's wrong?\"- She answered <br>\r\n-\"Uh...nothing...\"- 'Except that a girl tries to claim you as hers and I love you' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana was afraid of Blake getting into too much fights, she wasn't sure how long could he resist, he was a tough guy but this seemed to be too much for anyone, and worried also about Marylin, she didn't know either how long was Blake able to resist to her. She wished deeply to be able to protect him somehow... she wanted to protect him as he always had done with her, or even better, she wanted to protect Blake in a way that nobody could hurt him anymore, and she wished to get rid of Marylin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She left her backpack on the floor and checked on Blake, she giggled when realized that he had fallen asleep, but she still worried about his possible wounds. She got a bandage and ointment but she thought that she'd have to wake up Blake, and after seeing him resting comfortably in her chest pocket, she decided to let him sleep for a while. She went to her room and laid on her bed, and took a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes, a golden ball made of light came through the window and flew above her. The lightball hovered over her left chest pocket (she was wearing a denim jacket), which was where Blake was. The lightball shot a golden beam at him (It wasn't an energy blast, it resembled sunlight) and shone. After a few seconds, the shine stopped and the flying ball left as quietly as it appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shine woke Joana up but when she had opened her eyes, there was nothing. However she felt that something had changed and noticed an unnatural illumination that lasted a few seconds. She thought that it was just the sun, and decided to sleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to sleep but she couldnt't. Joana was worried about Blake and decided to check on him again. When she looked at him (he was still in her chest pocket) , she gasped, and that woke him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"- Blake said groggily. Joana looked at him, smiled and brought him near her eyes, to which he answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Hey!! I just woke up!! Don't be so wild...\"- Blake said, and Joana blushed (because here might be a double meaning, however, Blake is so naive that he wouldn't get it). Blake didn't notice her blushing anyway. While Blake was waking up (Not that he'd wake up like this, but his unknown healing had powerful anesthesic effects and kinda 'rebooted' his brain functions, plus the shrinking) Joana was examining him carefully and asked gently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... how do you feel?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Shaken around... worse than ferris wheels I can assure...\"- He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon Blake, I'm serious about this...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So am I... Where's the 'Girls are delicate' fact? Geez, you almost shook me as a soda can... I hope you're not planning to drink me...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Heh. I might if you keep that...\"- Joana answered playfully, but they were silent for about 10 seconds, then Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I... I was worried about you... That's why I acted like that... I still feel bad about crushing you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry... I've been crushed before...\"- Blake said, trying to relieve her in his very particular way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? How could you get crushed before this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well... Lillian has done it several times, and believe me, it's painful...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"HUH?!!\"- Joana's reaction was of anger, surprise and... jealousy(?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I never agreed... I'm just resting near my tree and sleeping and she randomly sits on my lap... though because of her 'size' she almost turns me into a tattoo on her butt... That's why I climb up the tree before resting, and for more than a year I've been crush-free, well, until today...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Joana was silent again. She knew Blake wasn't lying because none other boy would tell such a thing to a girl they'd drool for (hazel eyes, D-cups, long wavy brown hair, white skin... does it need explanation? Well... Blake sure does)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The guys usually laugh, until they get to be her victims...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't know that...\"- She said and thought 'Lillian REALLY owes me SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"And I also have been crushed in fights... specially the mastodon bullies who try to fight like WWE...like Ivan\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of that name brought fresh sad memories to Joana. </span></div></div>",

After getting cornered, Blake appeared stopping his punch, and told him to stop. Blake even offered half of the money, to wich Ivan answered that after seeing Joana, he'd forget the charge and get her instead. Blake didn't allow him and so, Ivan challenged him to a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was forced to accept by the situation. Before starting the fight, Blake whispered to her ear 'I'll fight him as long as I can resist. Escape now'. Blake stood bravely before him and the fight began. At the beginning, Blake could keep up well, and it seemed that he would win by skill over brute stength, however, with the few hits Ivan was able to connect, and the intensity of the combat (Blake was fighting an enemy nearly two or three times as strong) got Blake tired, and the real carnage began when Ivan could grab him and smash him to the ground, hurl him against the walls and stomping on his ribcage. Joana cried when saw all of this. Ivan kept hurling him and thrashing him around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spat out blood but still wanted to fight, and even when Ivan had pity on him and offered him to leave and let him have his way with Joana, he denied (Funnily enough, Ivan remarked that she wasn'teven a long friend of his, nor had a special relationship, the last part, for Joana, put salt on the wound). When he threw Blake away, and landed near Joana, a nearly unconscious Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...told...you... to escape... damn... I fought this long for nothing...\"- That phrase touched her heart when she realized that Blake was aware of that he wouldn't win against Ivan, but fought him in hopes to gaining time for her. After months of trying to figure out Blake's personality, she finally had a glimpse of Blake's feelings. He was always serious and stoic, apparently with no feelings, and after months Joana was losing hopes to win his heart. Now she knew she had a chance, and that Blak might be confused with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake fell unconscious and Joana, in deep anger, stood between him and Ivan, and when the latter tried to push her away, she dodged his hand and punched him in the stomach, with such a strength that the sole hit defeated Ivan. Nobody told Blake the truth about the ending of the fight. Joana, because she didn't want Blake to be afraid of her, and the rest of the school, because they were ACTUALLY afraid of her after seeing her strength.Joana still remembered that day with sadness and somewhat hope, because it was sad to her that Blake sufered that much to protect her, but it gave her the hope that Blake might not be completely unsensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 months or 7 have passed since that, and Joana still tries to figure out Blake's personality, she constantly tries to analyze his behavior without risking their friendship. She also felt somewhat guilty because deep inside, she wanted to have Blake closer to her, and the destiny had granted her wish in a wicked way. Now that Blake has to be 90% of the time or more with Joana, she doesn't know what to do or what to say (Obviously, she wasn't prepared for thia, and doesn't want to go too fast and ruin their friendship)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Forget about that. I've been in worse situations\"- Blake said to calm her down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So, how do you feel, weren't you hurt a while ago?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh? Yeah... it's strange, I feel like new, as if nothing happened...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A miracle... is it possible?... Blake was badly hurt after I sat on him...he couldn't even laugh without pain, and now, he's like nothing happened...' Joana thought,but was glad that Blake recovered, though she would rethink the situation over and over again because it wasn't logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, logical or not, at least Blake's okay...' Joana thought as she looked sweetly at Blake.Maybe things wouldn't be so bad...for her..</span></div></div>",

You're not alone now...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe. But not even my friends can understand me. I'm alone in my own fight against the life itself\"- Blake's comment saddened Joana again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No friendship lasts lifetime. Specially if you're a girl\"- Blake added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're 15, aren't you? We're in adolescence. Soon you'll get a relationship with some guy and I'll have to stand aside. One must not be in the way when a couple wants to be alone...\"- Blake looked away when he said that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's words surprised and saddened Joana. Surprised by the wisdom and maturity from such a young boy, but saddened because he doesn't know the truth. Also, felt sightly flattered because she thought Blake probably associated her \"attributes\" to an older age. But she was confused because Blake's words could be interpreted literally, or using her intuition, which tells her that Blake is hiding his feelings behind those words.She thought that maybe she was just thinking what she wanted to happen. She wnated to find out, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm 14. Do I look older?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"On some people, one can't tell age. I only said 15 because once you said you were older than me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Yeah but just one year\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"One year, two years, doesn't really make a difference\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"So... by what you said, you expect that everyone will get a relationship by next year?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Most of people will, if not next year, in the following ones. However, that doesn't work for me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Huh?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Love... I know its meaning, and at the same time, I don't know what it is... I don't understand it, and it's not meant for me.\"- Joana wanted so much to hug and kiss him and shout that she loves him, but she knew that being that drastic wouldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know?\"- She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Simple. Only three people ever cared about me, and they're all dead. From everyone else, all what I've got is hate and disdain...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even from me?\"- Joana asked, saddened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Except from my friends. The few friends I have...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Joana remained silent for a while. Joana now knew for true that Blake was deeply hurt, and she barely knew why. Also, he said that the people who cared about him are all dead. She wanted to know who were they, and where does Blake's attitude toward love come from. Karina told her once that she knew, but that if she really wanted to win Blake's heart, it was better that Blake tod her himself. Joana considered that maybe Blake and Karina had an early relationship that didn't work*, but there were no hints nor evidences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, she thought that if Karina was once Blake's girlfriend, then it wouldn't be likely that she stayed as one of his best friends, and there would be the typical tension between ex-lovers, which none of them showed. Joana had discarded the possibility but sometimes still considered it. She knew that definitively there was no relationship between him and Claire, because she was almost in Joana's situation. Those thoughts tormented her because she believed that if she didn't act soon, Claire might be the first one to speak and maybe to get Blake (Personally, I don't like being a trophy, but that was the situation...).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Am I one of them?\"- Joana asked, still trying to dig into Blake's thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you ask? Well, I guess...\"- Blake answered, scratching the back of his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You guess?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm not so sure... Usually girls think that boys are stupid...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think you are\"- Joana said sweetly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Anyway, I'm not the kind of guy a girl would like even as a friend...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why do you say that?\"- Joana almost slapped herself fr being that obvious, luckily Blake didn't get the tip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm a lone one. I'm low class. I'm not rich. I have scars, and I know absolutely nothing about relationships other than friendship\"- Again, Joana's instincts were kicking her inside for her to kiss him already. But she didn't, instead she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't need to be anything but yourself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that supposed to mean?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That you don't need to pretend to be like the others\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's what I do. I said that relationships simply don't work for me because of how am I. Not like I care...\"-  Blake didn't realize that what he was saying was saddening Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How do you know that there isn't a girl who likes the way you are?\"- Joana said the most obvious line and Blake still didn't realize!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I doubt it. Being latino doesn't help either, c'mon, all girls like blond boys with green eyes, like Anthony...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't like him. He just makes me laugh because of how he gets slapped all time\"- Joana said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, even if not all girls like blonds, they either like brown or red haired ones with green or blue eyes... again, I'm almost the exact opposite, a latino with nothing special... not even money\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Of course you're special\"- Joana said, and for the first time Blake opened his eyes wide. She added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Being different from the others makes you special. You don't need to be like those guys with hundreds of girls following them. You are very wise and mature for your age, and you don't do the stupid things other boys do<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like...\"- Joana blushed -\"Spying on girls...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remained silent. He DID NOT get it, and just said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... why do you feel like this?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><b>*Actually, Almost everyone (before 7th grade) thought that Karina was my girlfriend, or my love interest (like I had one at such a young age).

Geez..\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana now sensed something she hadn't before in Blake: Frustration. Frustration because he was overpowered, and proven weak (in an unfair fight). She felt that Blake's response showed anger, not toward her, but to himself. She said, calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I didn't mean that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was the point then...??\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was scared Blake\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Scared. Of what?

Also, If you conclude that I don't deserve to live here, let me go...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why would I?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Now you'll know\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">[Background Music: Linkin Park - In the End]</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was already hated before even being born. The woman who gave me birth tried by all the means to kill me before I could be born. My father stopped her and got her admitted in a hospital under strict surveillance. Months later, exactly in September 15th, I was born... and their minds wouldn't change\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Their? But your father cared about you didn't he?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The rest of the woman's family. They are pure blooded Spaniards. My father was just half Spanish. One of his friends told me that the marriage was because she got pregnant from him. It seems that they arranged the marriage because of their strict familiar traditions. However, nor her nor her family approved the idea of having descendants give that my father was an 'impure' as they call him. Since the beginning they wanted to kill the 'product of a sinful union' a.k.a me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I was finally born, nobody was pleased. And in fact, they denied any support to me, so did the woman. She never cared about anything but herself and money. My father was the only one who cared about me, and he raised me against the woman's family's will. They always said that I was an 'faulty being, impurer than my defective father'.. They also called me \"the contaminated blood\" Since I couldn't speak until I was 3, again, they accused the impurity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father was the only one who saw that I had potential, and he taught me to write and read and to count, finding out that they were wrong. However, Since I can remember, my father had a strange behavior... I can't tell exactly what, but it seems that he already knew many things. Also, after I could understand the language, I heard the woman's family arguments with my father. They said that I was destined to fail, and that they had to kill me before I grew older. The woman's older brother said that I would bring disgrace and misfortune if kept alive. Eventually my father got fed up with that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeptember 15th. 1996. I became 5, but it wasn't the happy birthday that many people believe. My father was the only one with me as always, but this time, the woman and her family came in. They said that it was as far as I would go. They were there to kill both me and my father. The fight began between the woman's borther and my father. At my current age, I could do nothing, so I hid, but kept watching...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana gasped and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The woman you talk about... is she your mother?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I've never called her like that, never. And after I learned the meaning of 'mother', I found out that I was right. I have no mother, never had one.\"- Blake answered, and continued the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"As I was saying. My father was fighting the woman's brother, and both got badly hurt. But my father got the upper hand and quickly he grabbed me and jumped through the windows. I didn't get hurt by the fall but I'm not sure if my father did. He ran away with me in his arms. After he had gone quite far, he stopped running, and told me that he didn't want me to see that. He also said that he knew I was smarter than most of children at my age, and that I surely understood most of what was going on. I still can't understand how could he know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever... We walked for a while, until we got attacked by robbers. My father defeated them with no problem, though he got weirdly distracted at moments. But another man appeared. This one vaguely resembled my father, though it would be more like an evil version of him. He introduced himself as my father's brother, and wanted revenge. That man tried to take me as hostage, but my father wouldn't let him and they fought... to death...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana again gasped, and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... that's so sad... I didn't know... but... why would I hate you? It wasn't your fault\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"It was... Because of me my father had to marry that woman. Because of me he suffered and died... But that's not all...\"- Blake said as he would continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I stayed with my father's dead body. It was night, It was dark. And I was alone in the world. I wanted to die with my father. I wanted to close my eyes, never to open them ever again. But it seems that destiny had other plans. A young teenager walked by and saw us. He walked near to see if we both were dead, and was surprised to see I was alive. He asked me my name. He also asked if he could take me home, but I replied that I had no home, nor family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suggested me to go with him. At first I didn't trust, but since I hadn't much of a choice, I accepted. I found out that the boy's name was Robin, and that he had no home either. He lived in streets. He said that it was a difficult life 'But orphans must help each other, right?'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin taught me to live. He worked on his own, repairing electrical machines. However, sometimes we had to steal food from markets. With the money he earned, he paid school for me, and despite not having a house, I felt that streets were my home. We slept in parks, sometimes with newspapers as covers. Some other times, we slept in boxes to protect us from rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years passed. We had typical conflicts with gangs because of what they considered their 'territory'. At first it wasn't that bad, but soon the conflicts became more often and more violent. One day, we were attacked by surprise by many of the gang members, and we fought back. Robin had taught me to defend myself, though I already knew some moves my father had taught me. That day, we almost won, until a guy deployed a gun and shot at me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever... I wasn't dead. Robin had pushed me so I would dodge it, but his right hand took the impact. The gang left cowardly, and because of our wounds, both of us passed out. When I woke up, I was in a hospital. I hadn't serious wounds, but Robin wasn't that lucky. He lost his right hand...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'm sorry\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't need to excuse yourself... again, it was me who caused it...\"-</span></div></div>",

She raised me for a year and then she died by old age... After that, nobody's left...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I care about you too...\"- Joana said shyly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"But not that much... I only consider the people who taught me to live and that honestly believed in me...\"- Blake said, again, unknown to him, that phrase had hurt Joana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How can you tell how much I care about you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Simple logic. You know me for only a year. I'm not that important in your life. So by this logic I can say that you only care about me as one more of the friends you don't really mind about. With this same logic, Karina knows me for longer, but still, I'm not a relevant part of her life. Maybe my other friends care about me but just as buddies, comrades... Simply, I'm not that important to anyone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't believe Blake thinks he's not important to me!! He totally misunderstood!!' Joana thought, and definitively now was far more frustrated. She decided to try to show more of her feelings subtly because maybe Blake would be the one to shy away. His current situation didn't help either</span></div></div>",

But he was staying anyway, and for Joana that was great (She shouted in her mind a big YES!! which she wouldn't in real life because she's shy to Blake)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you want to do?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nothing... Simply stay somewhere alone...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"C'mon... don't be like that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Like what?

Or that you were alone in the school?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Okay... you got me, but only with the first one... I'd actually prefer to be in school and live by myself...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't you think that the world is dangerous for your size? What if you encountered a scorpion or a spider?\"- Joana said, worrying, and actually, imagining the scene<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I'd fight...\"- Blake said, and Joana sighed.

His only protection was his brown jacket, and Joana's department had no heating. Soon, he curled, trying to sleep, and kept moving because hw wasn't able to get to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later, he opened his eyes, and stood up, he was thinking about walking around so he would get tired and sleep, but when he turned around, he saw Joana staring at him. He gulped and quickly asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why are you awake? Weren't you supposed to be sleeping?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Weren't you?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I...uh... I... I was...\"- Blake didn't have an excuse<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're cold...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can withstand it... I've slept in streets with cold and rain, you know...\"- He said, and noticed that Joana was still staring at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I know you aren't telling truth\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't know me enough to say that...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake... that's not an excuse...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Whatever... I'll just go back to sleep, ok?\"- Blake said, angry because he was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Joana grabbed him with her hand and placed him on her belly. Blake was annoyed and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What was this for?!\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Because you WERE cold. You don't need to act tough in front of me\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Act tough?! I'm not acting, I can withstand this and worse things...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You couldn't sleep. There's no problem if you lay on my belly, right?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"...\"- Blake was silent, lacking an argument to that, though still annoyed because he despised to receive help from anyone (except his father and Robin, though both of them are currently dead). Seeing that he hadn't a chance opf escaping from a girl almost a hundred times his size, he sighed and tried to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever. Joana's breathing movement kept him from sleeping, and his own thoughts. He kept moving around trying to get in a position to sleep, and soon he heard Joana giggling. She picked him up and brough him near her face. She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That tickles. Why can't you sleep?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I simply can't... I'm angry because that crazy witch shrank me... and now I can't even live on my own...  I have insomnia anyway...\"- Blake replied. Joana looked softly at him. Blake hardly ever mentioned anything about himself. In more than a year and a half, Joana barely had an idea of what Blake truly is. For example, he hadn't mentioned that he had no family, nor anything about his life outside school. And she would have never figured that Blake had sleeping problems... though it's logical after what he's been through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Insomnia?\"- Joana blushed slightly because she had thought of a solution to Blake's problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Don't worry... I've had it since I can remember... I'll just...\"- He was interrupted when Joana placed him on her (already ample) chest. Blake's tanned skin became red, and he immediately stood up. He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"WH...WH-What the hel do you think you're doing?!!\"- He was about to climb down Joana's big breast, but when he realized what he was doing, he stopped and tried to jump. Joana stopped him with her finger and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's wrong?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Everything!!. This doesn't feel right!!\"- Blake replied, and tried to push away her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- Joana asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Even I know what's right and what's wrong... And this can't be right...\"- Blake said, and a flashback came to his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake remembered of his days raised by his grandmother, Irma. He was 9 years old and was found by her while wandering in the streets, managing to get food and the money to go to school. She had told him that he looked almost identical to his father, Blake always kept a silver tag with James' name in one side, and Blake's name on the other, this one written with golden letters, and that was the proof that he was James' son. She told him that, she couldn't get to know him much because she had to leave him at an orphanage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer living conditions were too low and she thought that it'd be unfair for James to suffer. However, her husband was furious at that, saying that he would be treated worse by american people. She also didn't trust her husband too much. They had an older son, Brandon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment she said that name, Blake's mind flashed. He remembered... Brandon... the man who killed his father... that evil man who tried to kill him as well... He remembered everything of that fateful day... the rain... the thunders, the lightning,,, the blood... the grief... his father's death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was clenching his fists and his grandmother noticed it, when she asked him about that, and she asked her to continue. She said that Brandon's raising was a failure, the boy only dedicated to get into fights and to steal. Then, she asked Blake again, and with grief (but not crying, Blake made a promise to himself of that the only time he'd ever cry was at his father's death, though he cried at Robin's too... However, he hasn't cried ever since) he told her that James was dead, and that he and Brandon killed each other. Irma started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma said that she was happy to at least know James' son. As she knew Blake, she was realizing that Blake was wiser and maturer than the rest of the boys, though she lamented that it was by the \"bad way\". By suffering. She was always afraid that Blake became an unsensitive person, just like her husband and her oldest son Brandon. She also was shocked to know that Brandon had a son as well, and that the boy, Alexander, had sworn rrevenge on Blake. By this, she knew that Blake had already fought several battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted that to stop, brothers killing each other... the hate taken to the next generation... she wanted all of that to stop. She also found out that Blake only fought to defend himself. She was surprised when Blake said that he wasn't searching revenge, thar bringing more death and pain wouldn't bring back his dead father. But, his coldness was what she was worried about. She noticed that he had few friends, but was nearly totally closed toward them. He rarely got involved in children's games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came to Blake's mind was one of their last conversations...</span></div></div>",

A mother?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well, if the Goddess you're talking about is almighty, then why doesn't she use her power to stop these kind of things?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe we'll never understand that Blake... you're just a kid... I'm an old woman and I still don't understand many things... But let me tell you something. As you know, I'm mexican. My mother was a Mayan woman. My father was descendant from Aztecs. They alwas taught me about Goddess. They told me that she was the mother of everything, that she was the Earth herself\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That still doesn't explain why she does nothing about anything\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I was taught that mankind was given free will. So, she must be watching them from somewhere. I think that, she must cry when she sees her children dying. I think that when it rains or that when there are thunders, it's her grief...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No offense grandma, but I still think that if Mother Earth is a goddess, she definitively doesn't care about anyone... Not even children as you said...\"- Blake's grandmother perceived what Blake meant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I think that she has protected you in a way... Blake... I could say that you're really important to her...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Why?\"- Blake asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"She's preserved your life by almost any means... Somehow... James and your friend Robin were your guardian angels... I think that Mother Earth has efforted on protecting you...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"If you mean that there were two deaths to save my life, then I disagree with her methods... I'm not worth those lives...\"- Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You're worth them. I'm sure that when you grow up you'll understand...\"- She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father said the same about love but I no longer believe in it...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"You don't believe?\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"My father and Robin died... that means that I'm supposed to be left alone... I don't believe anymore. I just care about family...well...you... my only family left...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How sweet, son. But...

The only girl I know wants to punch me for no reason**...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"About that... it's strange isn't it? You aren't like the other boys who make girls cry... but... you haven't any female friend\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I don't think that some girl would understand life... Girls my age only care about dolls... older ones only care about movies and purses...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Maybe not now... but I think that you should have a girlfriend... older than you... one that would take care of you... I think you need affection of that kind...\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I can take care of myself, thanks....\"- Blake replied stubbornly, annoyed.

What do you want to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- Joana was convinced by Karina or Lillian to use a potion to seduce Blake quickier, and he shrank. (accident)<br>\r\n2.- Joana was convinced to use a special perfume to seduce Blake and she grew (or Lillian spiked her drink) <br>\r\n3.- Evil Joana? At this year, when they\u00a1re about to be lovers, I'm not sure. If you have an idea add it please.<br>\r\n4.-Hmm...do I have to say something here?...Well Blake shrinks by whatever suddenly and is alone...Nobody knows about it...<br>\r\n5.- Here Lillian may shrink Blake, or she may grow.</span></div></div>",

Blake was just talking with Ayrton about a new film that had just come out. \"Hey, Joana,\" he replies. He calmly accepts her hug. She also gives him a quick peck on the cheek. After that, both Blake and Joana turned as red as tomatoes. Ayrton said, \"I'll see ya later, Blake.\" He winked at Blake before walking off. This causes Blake to blush more. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to come to my house Friday?\" Joana asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I might be doing something Friday. I can't remember.\"<br>\r\nThe bell rings for first period. He smiles at her and walks to Math. She watches him walk down the hall. 'If only I could find a way to make him open up for me. I want to know if he loves me back.' She sighs and follows him into Math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, Joana plops her tray down at the table and sits down across from Blake. \"Hi,\" she starts. \"Hey,\" he mumbles back. <br>\r\n\"Why don't you want to come watch a movie with me?\"<br>\r\n\"I...uhhh...I need to go to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\nHe gets up and walks away. Joana sighs again. Karina sits down next to her. \"Hey Jo! What's wrong?\" she asks at seeing Joana's troubled face. \"I can't convince Blake to ask me out,\" she groans back.<br>\r\n\"You didn't get this from me,\" she produces a small blue bottle, \"This is the nectar of a Peruvian Dismunicion flower. My grandfather sent it to me. He's a biologist studying plants in south america. Anyways, this nectar will cause anyone who drinks it to tell their deepest secrets. Then you can find out if he loves you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n\"Quick he's coming! Slip it into his drink!!\"<br>\r\nJoana pours the nectar into Blake's drink. Then she continues eating, smiling nervously. \"Hey Joana, did I see you put something into my drink?\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" she replies quickly, \"I saw a fly go in there and swatted it out.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Okay.\"<br>\r\nBlake sit down and continues eating. He takes a few gulps of his drink. Joana looks at him. Karina gets up and says, \"I'm gonna go find Ayrton.\"<br>\r\nBlake continues to drink his drink until it is all gone. Joana looks at him expectantly. <br>\r\n\"Well?\" she requests.<br>\r\n\"Well, what?\"<br>\r\nAren't you gonna tell me anything?\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Blake sees purple spots and falls unconscious.

He slowly gets up and looks around. When he turns around, all he sees is a light blue shirt. His eyes follow the shirt up, past the enormous breasts to the face of his friend Joana, except she's huge!!! His eyes nearly pop out of their sockets. He nearly passes out again. As he slowly backs away from her he trips and falls. This causes her to giggle. She carefully uses her hand to get him back on his feet again. <br>\r\n-\"What happened?!\"- He asks again.<br>\r\n-\"I don't really know, you were eating lunch when you passed out. As soon as you did, you got smaller and smaller.\"-<br>\r\n-\"Oh. Well how did it happen?\"-<br>\r\n-\"I don't know\"- Joana replied, feeling a little guilty deep down as she thought, <br>\r\n'Not what I was expecting, but know I can be with him always. But that flower potion thing probably caused it' She looks back down at Blake. He's sitting there, thinking. Joana starts smiling. He looks up and sees her smiling at him. He was planning on escaping, but all thoughts of that soon escaped, to be replaced with the idea that, after all she is his best friend, and did always try to protect him from harm when he got into a fight or something, and she always nursed him back to health.  He still has his doubts, though. Joana knew what he was thinking, and added, -\"I'll look after you. Don't worry, you'll be safe.\"- She gives him a big hug, leaving him flabbergasted, and said, <br>\r\n-\"Come on, let's go to my house. Now where to put you?\"</span></div></div>",

Ferdinand and Cinthya are 18<br>\r\n-In the first two choices, Blake and Joana are already lovers.<br>\r\n-The rival for Joana may be Cinthya, Thania or Lillian<br>\r\n-Blake regained some physical strenght due to his aging and he would be a very though rival to Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the first two choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.- Blake may have shrunk because someone spiked his food or drink while he was on a date. Or fought Blaze who shrank him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the last four, they are kinda \"What if...?\":<br>\r\n <br>\r\n2.-Blake had made a choice earlier and became Claire's boyfriend before he met Joana? This would be the hardest rivalry one and also, Blake's choosing would be very difficult, as in the other cases, he finds easier out that Joana loves him because the other girls he could be with have a major fault, but in this case Claire's almost the same as Joana (And Joana some times is kind of violent... Meh...don't ask me about it...experience tells me (And yeah, most of these people except Blaze and the shrinking stuff are real)<br>\r\n3.- Blake hadn't asked Joana out and she hadn't done anything else, Lillian could have gotten the chance and seduced Blake with her body (despite he isn't shallow), and finally asked him out?<br>\r\n4.- Cinthya convinced Blake that Joana only used him to protect her and feeling betrayed, and slightly seduced by the popularity, he accepted to be Cinthya's boyfriend? (In this line he probably would have left Joana and his friends because of the popular ones)<br>\r\n5.- Joana didn't show her feelings in time to Blake, and Thania, who was always nice to him (almost as much as Joana) did and Blake went with her because he thought nobody else loved him? (In this one, Blake would still feel something is missing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fact or main theme about these last three would be that Blake and Joana realize that they both always loved each other and despite it was a little late they finally go together...Only a suggestion...</span></div></div>",

Her hazel brown eye's danced with the life of the evening. She gazed at Blake, her heart pounding to unheard music. A smile flickered briefly onto Blake's face as he felt Joana's hot breath seep onto his neck. He looked at her, shaking slightly. Her face was close to his, probably too close...  And her eyes are shut. Blake held his breath, Joana wanted a kiss. His head tilted towards the fireworks, hoping to get the idea out of Joana's mind. Yet his blush gave his true desires away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed. Fire works boomed across the night sky as the grass waved in celebration. A spark flew through the hills and the tree's as glowing bugs flapped there patterns around the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"How sweet...\"- Blaze said, his white hair whisped about in the wind as he stepped out of the black portal. A cruel smile crept over his face, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake doesn't even know his true power yet... perfect. My plan is falling into place. This time Blake, Omega 17 shall rise! And all will bow down before it!\"- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed, his cloak fell to the ground like a leaf. His hand was absorbed in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I gave you a chance... I won't make the same mistake... your not going to do it Blake... shit!\"- Blaze gasped, jumping into a tree. He watched the cocky young version of himself step forward, observing Blake with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Blaze smirked, watching Blake's date.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-\"He has the power? Pfft, it's not fun if it's not active... -\" Blaze shook his head, so sure of himself. He brushed back his hair as he stood, cloaked in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"A white cloak? I don't remember being that cocky...\"- The other Blaze commented, watching his former self with disgust. He shook his head, aiming his magic enfused hand of darkness towards to couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake screamed, standing up in seering pain. He cried tears of blood as his voice became many. He clutched his heart, a high squeal came into his ears, blocking out Joana's cry. He looked up, a word fell over his lips as he saw a god like woman stride towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Lith\"- He mouthed, watching the girl in green walk into his chest. He felt a wave of nausia as the mystery girl passed through him. Yet... he felt like he knew her. Was she Lith? That was Blake's last thought as he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze stepped back, unsure what to do.<br>\r\n\"Omega?\" He questioned as a plain card dropped from the sky. He glared down at it. \"A... Joker card?\" He mumbled, picking up the playing card. The Jokers cried with pain. The card was dipped in blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sighed, <br>\r\n-\"I hate time travel... it's so confusing...\"- He looked at his former self one last time before dissipating into darkness, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Blake's dead... let Omega 17 rise\"- Blaze muttered, before he vanished. Leaving his former self to walk away without confidence, scared and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Wake up Blake!\"- A voice boomed. Blake peeled open his eyes. He took a deep breath as his vision cleared. <br>\r\n-\"Joana? You're so big! Or... am I... small\"- Blake sighed, his memory of Lith had almost vanished, like a dream that didn't want to be found.</span></div></div>",

This story happens mostly BEFORE the events of \"Shrunk with your Girlfriend and has no relation with this story, it's like an alternative dimension. These are the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake: Tall and strong latino boy (black wavy hair, which is kinda long and black eyes). He used to fight a lot at school (only fought bullies who threatened him, his friends or Joana) By the way, He's very smart and even gets high notes without studying for exams, just bad in Math and Physics (number things). His age may vary between 12-16 years old. Tanned skin and muscular body due to fighting and playing soccer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoana: Very beautiful girl (dark brown long wavy hair, hazel eyes,D-cup boobs and big ass). She loves Blake since 7th grade when they met. She is his best friend and is the one who almost always stays with Blake and heals his fight wounds. She is not his girlfriend yet, until he's 16. She's a year older than him and her age may vary from 13-17 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondary Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarina: A good friend of Blake (later Joana's also), she's cute but isn't Blake's type. Blonde with green eyes and short hair. She's Ayrton's girlfriend. Thinner body than Joana (B-Cups and smaller hips, green eyes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinthya: Beautiful and very popular latin girl who wanted Blake for herself and almost did it until Joana appeared. Her feelings toward Blake now may go from still wanting him for her to hating him (she hates more to Joana). She has black hair,dark brown eyes, small boobs and a nice butt. She's a year older than Joana (2 years older than Blake).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire: Blake's friend since 3th year, second longest since Karina. the only one who could rival Joana. C-Cup breasts and a big butt (slightly smaller than Joana's, still better than Cinthya's). She has Asian-like black eyes which look very sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Joana's thighs are thicker, Claire's seem slightly thinner and longer. She has black straight hair worn as a ponytail. She hugs and kisses Blake (in cheek) more often than Karina, causing Joana to be jealous of her. She also seems to be jealous of Joana as she spends very much time with Blake (almost same as herself, but she knows him from longer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feelings to Blake have never been clear as she acted as protective as Joana in the time they didn't know each other. Some times it seems Joana wants to just kill her (And Blake has to appear to prevent it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's very likely to help and taking care of Blake, but due to her relationship with Joana, it's not very probable she'd give him to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyrton: Blake's second best friend. Short and tanned. He fights along Blake sometimes but he really isn't a fighter, just an average guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerdinand: Some sort of mixure between a goth and a nerd (He has practically the same intelligence level as Blake but he's better in Math and Physics while he's better than him in the rest of subjects). He's Blake's third best friend. And is stupidly in love of Cinthya (Physic: a bit shorter than you,thin,dark brown curly hair).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillian: A Joana's, Blake's and Ayrton's friend. She seems to have a crush on Blake and Ayrton but hides it because of Joana and Karina. She's the tallest girl with long black hair, small but round breasts and a HUGE ass. Dark brown eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: Nerd/Geek girl. Cinthya's friend and accomplice. she hasn't practically own will and does every thing that Cinthya tells her to. (red hair, blue eyes, small breasts and a very big butt. She's not really pretty because she's flabby and a bit fat)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThania: Average popular girl, Cinthya's friends but she's the least evil one. She seems to have a crush on Blake but she respected Joana since she had known Blake more time than her (light brown wavy hair and not-so-curvy body, like Karina, and Thania's shorter, hazel eyes darker than Joana's).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze: Character made by teniko. Weird long white haired boy who has monster fighting abilities and probably would overwhelm Blake in battle (except in 7th). He could appear only to make Joana grow or shrink Blake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n-No gay/lesbian stuff<br>\r\n-Joana's not evil.Even if she turns into a giantess. Unless in most lines. I'll leave some to an evil Joana story. Most likely would be an exaggerate love. (the younger she is the more she will be)<br>\r\n-No parents<br>\r\n-If it's about ass just butt cheeks.<br>\r\n-Feet are ok but Blake doesn't like them more than an average boy.<br>\r\n-Other characters are free and could do whatever, no matter how crazy it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add and enjoy!</td>",
