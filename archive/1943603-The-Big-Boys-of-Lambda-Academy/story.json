They are a diverse group of different ethnicities, talents, sizes and shapes, but they all come together to learn\u2026 and to have a little fun. I mean, they ARE teenagers, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at this school, some changes are in store. Big changes. \u2026 I said, \"BIG\" changes. Is it obvious enough yet? C'mon, you know what this means. \u2026 I'm waiting\u2026 Okay, if you haven't gotten it yet, you should probably just go to a different story, because this one's clearly not for you.

Let's take a look at some of these choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke, 17 years old, 11th Grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Dublin, Ireland<br>\r\nAppearance: Caucasian; pale skin; short, spiky, red hair; 6'3\" with an athletic build.<br>\r\nPersonality: A bit of a jock, but with such a great smile (and body) that nearly everyone in school has a crush on him (including most of the teachers). Average student, star player on the basketball team. Is currently single, though he's dated several guys around school.<br>\r\nWhat causes his growth: He gets a supplement from one of his teammates that he has a unique reaction to.<br>\r\nType of growth: gradual, continuous height growth with muscle development<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon, 12 years old, 7th Grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: New York, New York, US<br>\r\nAppearance: African-American; medium-dark skin; short curly black hair; 5' 0\" with a skinny build<br>\r\nPersonality: Comes from a broken home with little-to-no support from his family, he nevertheless pursued his love of theater, becoming one of the best child actors around his age. This is what lead to his being selected for admittance into Lambda High, but since he's brand new to the school and is facing a completely different environment than he's used to, he's facing a huge identity crisis. Just starting to feel an attraction to guys.<br>\r\nWhat causes his growth: Brandon has worn a small, simple, silver ring since before he can remember, as it was the only memento of his father, whom he never knew. However, this ring turns out to be enchanted, and activates at the point where Brandon needs it most.<br>\r\nType of growth: Once he realizes the power he has, Brandon completely controls when and how much he grows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonas, 15 years old, 10th grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Bergen, Norway<br>\r\nAppearance: Caucasian; fair-skinned; long blonde hair; 5'10\", average build.<br>\r\nPersonality: Coming from money, Jonas is a bit of a rich snob. His family was able to buy his way into school, and he thinks he's better than everyone else. Is a bit of a slut.<br>\r\nWhat causes his growth: Another student who's jealous of Jonas tries to sabotage him with a shrink spray, but it backfires and grows Jonas instead.<br>\r\nType of growth: quick, one-time growth with each spray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik, 13 years old, 9th grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Dubai, United Arab Emirates<br>\r\nAppearance: Arabic; brown skin; medium-length black hair; 4' 10\", slim build<br>\r\nPersonality: Cheerful, friendly, and very outgoing, Malik is the youngest boy in the ninth grade, yet everyone knows and likes him. He is very intelligent, smart enough to be put in the eighth grade when he started at Lambda High, but he is also very humble. Has his eyes on several guys but has never gotten the chance to pursue any of them\u2026 yet.<br>\r\nWhat causes his growth: Malik goes through hyper-puberty, one that won't end any time soon.<br>\r\nType of growth: powerful growth spurts affecting not only his height, but also his manhood.</span></div></div>",

As one of only three boys from the Middle East at Lambda Academy, he knew from the day he started that he had to be outgoing and make friends from all over if he wanted to have a good time at the school, and that he did; nearly everybody seemed to like him. As happy and outgoing as he was, however, he still couldn't seem to find that one special guy that he could call his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he heads into the classroom, however, he doesn't know that his body is on the verge of going through some major changes. You see, he's one of the few boys in known history who has a rare genetic mutation that will cause his pituitary gland to go into overdrive, and cause him to go through a hyper-puberty. His body will change in sudden, dramatic ways, and could leave Malik anywhere from 10 to 10,000 feet tall when all is said and done, along with a very pronounced package. All of this starts right now, in his first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, what is his first class, by the way?</span></div></div>",

You've probably marked it on your calendars since the beginning of the semester. Yes, today we're going to talk about sex ed. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if each and every one of you knows everything I'm about to say already and have utilized it repeatedly in your daily life, but the school board still requires me to teach it to you, so here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifteen or so boys in the class giggled at this, all except for Malik, who sat in the front row at the far right corner of the classroom, closest to the window. Sure, he knew the mechanics, more or less, but he'd never actually USED them, at least with anyone but for himself. Part of this was an age thing, he was sure, being almost a full year younger than the next youngest boy in the class, but he knew plenty of thirteen-year-olds at the school who were active. No, it was more the result of being a little ashamed of his underdevelopment. Even for someone his age, he was short, and he wasn't exactly packing when it came to his manhood. Maybe, once puberty kicked in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought this and stared at the picture of the male reproductive organs that Mr. Greggors was displaying on the board, he felt his skin begin to tingle a little. He tried to concentrate on what his teacher was saying, but the feeling began to spread throughout his entire body, and he soon couldn't hear anything outside of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, he saw flashes, images of several of the boys at school that he found particularly attractive. Except\u2026 they all seemed to be looking up at him, as if they were significantly smaller. These images were intense, more erotic than anything he had ever seen or imagined before, and Malik felt his pants tightening. <i>Stop it</i>, he thought to himself. <i>This is the worst possible time to get a hard-on.</i> He imagined everyone laughing at him for getting aroused at a sex ed presentation, and tried to push those thoughts out of his mind anyway he could. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now, since all the giggling has subsided you paragons of maturity, let's get down to brass tacks.\" Mr. Greggor said calmly, raising his pointer and lightly touching the image on the board. \"We can't very well talk about Sex Ed without first discussing the time of your life that sexual desire truly begins. And that time is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puberty!\" Everyone called out, eager to get to the good stuff rather than this fifth grade level nonsense they'd all already heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Mr. Greggor said, voice calm and unflappable, even in the presence of such impatience. This wasn't his first time giving this lesson and it certainly wouldn't be his last. \"Now, I'm not going to bore you all with the facts about puberty, you already know them. Hair in strange new places, heightened sensitivity, desire, cracked voice, bigger muscles, \"enhanced\" sexual organs, and all that. However, research has shown that there is a 0.000001% chance that young males experiencing puberty will, in fact, go through a sort of \"hyper\" puberty if you will, with all the common benefits of puberty vastly increased. Of course, this has yet to happen and the odds are so astronomically low, there's a very good chance that we never WILL see anyone undergo that change. Still, I've been told it's now a required part of the curriculum to discuss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik had been tuning out this whole discussion, too focused on his own body to listen to anything Mr. Greggor was saying. The images in his head refused to go away and the tightness in his pants was only getting worse! It felt like he had a balloon in his pants that someone was slowly inflating, his briefs getting tighter with every passing second! He had never experienced anything like this before in his life, his cock seeming to refuse to soften no matter what images Malik tried to fill his head with. He was starting to sweat as he heard a soft, though undeniable creaking sound. Trying to be casual, he leaned back in his desk, looking slowly own at his lap. He was dismayed to see that the front of his uniform pants were bulging out rather obscenely, making it look like he was trying to smuggle a sausage down there! He gulped slightly, amazed not only by how big it looked but by how incredible it felt! The zipper on his pants creaked again, pushing outward. If this kept up he was likely to have the most embarrassing, public hard on in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst!\" A voice suddenly hissed in his ear, a large hand clapping him on his back. \"Wouldn't that be awesome Malik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" Malik practically grunted back, glancing over his shoulder. Chase Springer's bright, mischievous green eyes met Malik's own dark ones, a grin on his slightly freckled face. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase's eyebrow lifted slightly as he saw the haggard look on Malik's face, slightly shiny from sweat, his breathing heavy and deep. \"Dude...are you okay? You're looking kind of...sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik's eyes widened slightly as he suddenly was presented an out. \"O-Oh...yeah...I'm feeling a little...off, you know?\" He quickly lied, trying to ignore another, louder, creak from his zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase's easy going grin was quickly replaced with a look of concern. It was a testament to how well liked Malik was that when he wasn't his usual, cheerful self everyone got concerned. \"Hey, you should go to the nurse's office then. Lay down for awhile, you know?\" He brushed a lock of his chestnut hair out of his eyes, only for the offending bang to fall immediately back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're...mmm....I think you're right.\" Malik said, a soft groan of pleasure escaping from his lips before he could stop it, a blush suffusing his cheeks at the sensual sound. He turned around in his seat and raised his hand. Mr. Greggor, who had his back to the class as he continued his lesson, didn't notice him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase noticed this and was about to call out to the teacher, his hand raised, when Malik let out another little gasp, accompanied by a rather loud, metallic creak, his hand curling as his arm flopped back down to his side, as though it had lost all feeling. He tentatively looked over Malik's shoulder, his eyes going wide as he saw what the small boy was packing! He could feel his own cheeks flush, his cock stiffening just slightly. \"Wow...who knew little Malik was so...big!\" He thought to himself, imagining just what kind of \"weapon\" Malik was packing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo absorbed by this site was Chase, that he jumped a little when Mr. Greggor said, \"Yes, you have a question Mr. Springer? Or, wonder of wonders, are you actually offering an answer to my question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Chase said, his head snapping up from Malik's lap, looking at Mr. Greggor with a slightly slack jawed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" Mr. Greggor said, tapping the board as a few laughs erupted around the classroom. \"So, what's your question? Do you need to use the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no sir, it's just that Malik isn't feeling very well and...\" Chase said, trailing off as Mr. Greggor raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want to escort him to the nurse's office.\" Mr. Greggor said, shaking his head a little. \"Very well, you both can leave but you, Mr. Springer, can expect extra homework tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase sighed as he got to his feet, hands in his pockets. \"This is what I get for crying wolf so many times...\" He thought to himself, shrugging, a little smile on his face. If it meant helping Malik, he didn't care how much extra work he got. He looked down at the panting boy and said, \"Come on, let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure...\" Malik said, quickly putting his books in front of his lap. He shakily got to his feet, really looking like he was sick rather than just shaky with the pleasure his growing dick was affording him. Chase's touch, innocent though it was, was like pressing an electric wire against Malik's skin, a loud tearing sound suddenly very audible in the classroom. Mr. Greggor stopped mid sentence, giving the pair another pointed look. They were starting to disturb the lesson now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase chuckled and quickly led Malik out of the room, practically carrying the younger boy out the door, amid the giggles and whispers of the other students. Malik's face was flushed completely at this point, his hands gripping his books tightly. Chase sighed as he leaned against the wall. \"So...I take it you're not actually sick, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course n-not...\" Malik said, his eyes widening slightly as another jolt of pleasure shot through his body. \"I just...ah...needed to get out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Chase said, grabbing Malik by the arm again, pulling him towards the boy's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you doing?!\" Malik asked, both boys entering the thankfully empty bathroom. Chase pushed Malik into a stall with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you clearly have something you need to take care of in there, right? So go for it! I'll keep a lookout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik, sitting down on the closed toilet, didn't really have space to argue. He needed relief and he needed it FAST especially if he was going to hide his growing cock effectively. Finding out exactly WHY his cock was suddenly growing beyond what was normal for him would come after his mind was cleared of the clouds of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Malik was about to get started...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bathroom in the classroom building wasn't exactly Malik's idea of the best place to get himself off, but he wasn't very picky right now. His zipper had already started to come undone under the increasing pressure his cock was putting it under, and it was a tad difficult to get it down the rest of the way. Once he did, the bulge in his underwear poked so far out that the elastic band stretched a good three or four inches from his waist. He tried to pull his briefs down too, but they had to stretch so far that they ripped slightly. \"Well, so much for that pair,\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw what was underneath, though, he was left speechless. His cock jutted out way farther than it ever had before, almost half as long as his forearm and more than twice as thick as it had been before, while underneath two billiard ball-sized spheres clung tight. The skin around it was still smooth and mostly hairless, though a dark, small-but-thick tuft had sprung up since the last time he checked. What's more, his cock seemed to move along with his heartbeat, jerking with each pulse and leaking a small amount of clear pre each time it moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the most amazing thing he'd ever seen, Malik thought to himself. Why, he probably out-sized most of the seniors, let alone the rest of those in his class. Licking his lips, he reached his hand down and wrapped it around, the pleasure intensifying leagues more than it had before. I can't believe this, he thought to himself as he began to slowly stroke himself. This is the most amazing--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malik! Someone's coming!\" Chase hissed, and Malik froze, his heart pounding in his chest. He heard the door open, and the heavy steps of a larger person walking in, either one of the upperclassmen or a teacher. Hormones surged within his body but he tried to maintain a sliver of control, at least until he was alone in the bathroom again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase gulped as he made eye-contact with the vice-principal. Mr.Ulrich was known for being the sternest authority figure on campus, and he'd probably have the two of them expelled if he found out what was going on. He tried to play it cool, though he knew his voice sounded shaky. \"H-hi, Mr. Ulrich. How are you doing this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man's eyes narrowed and his lips turned downward in a frown. \"What're you doing out of class, Mr. Springer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer, a loud grunting sound could be heard behind them, along with what sounded like something hitting the wall of the bathroom stall. Wincing, Chase hoped that Ulrich had somehow missed that sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" The vice-principal turned his head towards the stall. \"Is someone in here with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes.\" Realizing his breathing was getting faster, Chase closed his eyes for a second, trying to calm himself down. He figured he might as well tell something close to the truth, to be on the safe side. \"Malik's in there. He wasn't feeling very well, so Mr. Greggor told me to take him to the nurse's office. We were on our way there when... well, an emergency happened.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ulrich's eyes darted back and forth between Chase and the stall for what seemed like hours, before he finally gave what looked like a small shrug. \"Fine, then, just be quick about it. And as soon as he's at the nurse's, you head straight back to class. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, sir,\" Chase nodded. He leaned against the sink, facing the other direction as Mr. Ulrich used one of the urinals and then washed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was leaving, though, Ulrich turned and glared at Chase. \"I sure hope, for your sake, that Mr. Greggor verifies your story. Otherwise... you'll answer to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase barely squeaked in acknowledgment as Mr. Ulrich walked out the door, then let out a sigh of relief, sweat starting to appear on his forehead. \"Whew, thank god he's gone, Malik.\" He waited a moment, not hearing any reply, then stepped a little closer to the stall. \"Malik?\"<br>\r\nAgain, no response, except for the sound of soft grunting and moaning. \"Malik, are you okay?\" Placing his hand against the stall door, he gently tested to see if it was locked, then, seeing it wasn't, pushed it all the way in...</span></div></div>",

He stumbled back, hitting the wall, sliding down it into a sitting position, listening as a series of sharp moans was punctuated by more splats, warmth coating Chase in various parts of his body, weighing his clothes down, soaking into the material. A long, satisfied sigh signaled the last of the splats, leaving both boys motionless, Malik, a sweaty, half dressed mess, while Chase was covered head to toe in copious amounts of the young boy's spunk. Chase wiped his eyes clean as best he could, widening them as he stared at the young Middle Eastern boy in front of him, sprawled out over the toilet, his eyes closed in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Malik!\" Chase said, his voice slightly hoarse. His eyes were glued immediately to the thick cock jutting out from Malik's undone pants, the rock hard appendage slowly softening, still dripping small ropes of cum onto the floor. Malik fumbled for a bit of toilet paper, scrubbing his crotch area clean, barely aware that Chase was still in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...I just couldn't help myself! I had to...to stop it or I would have ruined my pants...\" the younger boy mumbled, still unaware of the mess he had made of Chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase didn't answer. He looked over his body, his uniform caked in the thick white spooge, soaking him to the skin. Even with the impressive size of Malik's cock, there was no way he could produce THIS much cum! Something very strange was going on here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Chase!\" Malik suddenly shouted, his exhausted, half lidded eyes springing open as he saw the state of his classmate. \"Oh geez! I'm so sorry! I had no idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fumbled as he did up his pants, nearly tripping over himself as he rushed over to the slightly older boy. He stopped a few feet away, holding his nose. \"...You stink.\" He said simply, stifling a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and I wonder who's fault THAT is.\" Chase dryly remarked, getting to his feet only to slip in a puddle of spunk and fall back onto his ass. Malik snorted before bursting out in laughter, doubling over as he clutched his stomach. The laughter was brought to a stop when he felt something lukewarm smack him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooogh, gross!\" Malik squealed, rushing over to the sink to wash off his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now imagine it all over your body and see how you hard you laugh.\" Chase said with a wicked grin, carefully getting to his feet this time. \"Anyway...I always knew you were pretty confident for a kid but I had no idea WHY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik raised his eyebrow and said, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase suggestively grabbed his crotch and said, \"Uh, what do you think I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik blushed and grabbed some paper towels, wiping his face vigorously. \"Oh...that. Well...you're not going to believe this but...that's actually new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Chase just stared at Malik, crossing his arms. \"New?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, I'm not usually so big and I don't normally...cum so hard.\" His blush intensified. He had never talked so candidly with someone before about something so private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding? Maybe it's just a puberty thing.\" Chase said, shrugging unconcernedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik scratched his cheek, the word triggering something in the back of his mind. Hadn't Mr. Greggor been talking about something like that? Neither Chase nor Malik had been paying much attention to the lesson, so the answer to the dilemma was completely eluding them both. Malik shrugged and said, \"Either way, I guess I can go back to class now...thanks for your help Chase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had taken barely three steps before Chase grabbed his shoulder, pulling him back. \"Ooooh no you don't! You're not getting away that easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Malik asked innocently, looking up at Chase with those big eyes of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I can't exactly go back to class like this! Come on, you have to help me get back to my dorm room so I can change! If you go back to class without me, Mr. Greggor is going to think I was lying to get out of class and THEN I'll get in trouble with Ulrich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik sighed and said, \"You're right...which dorm are you in anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Block Hall, on the other side of the Arts building.\" Chase said, opening the bathroom door, making sure the halls were still clear. All the names of the dorms were taken from previous professors, directors, administration officials and, of course, wealthy donors. It led to some...interestingly named buildings. \"Come on, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair quickly began to make their way down the hall, heading for the nearest exit, Malik keeping watch behind them while Chase focused on what was coming up ahead. Greggor's class was on the third floor of the Science and Health building, the nurses office being on the first. If they ran into any one while still in here, the claim of heading to the nurses office would still hold water. Luckily for them, they didn't run into anyone in the building. Chase held the door open for Malik, pointing out Block Hall in the distance. \"Almost there!\" He said with a smile. \"Good thing too...I need to get out of these clothes and take a shower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set out down the sidewalk, making a beeline to the building in the distance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malik looked around nervously with every step closer to the dorm hall, fearing that at some point they'd be stopped and asked for an explanation, and that he'd have to explain this incredibly awkward situation. It was bad enough that Chase had gotten dragged into this, but if any of the less friendly kids in the school found out about it, he knew he would never hear the end of it. Thank goodness everyone seemed to still be in class, and none of the faculty was patrolling this section of campus at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooms at Lambda Academy actually were fairly nice, as dorm rooms go. Two students shared a bedroom, and for every two rooms there was a bathroom with a shower connecting them, so that none of the boys had to go through the often humiliating (or, for some of the more adventurous students, exhilarating) experience of communal showers. Chase's room, which he shared with another boy their age who was probably the most popular kid in their grade, was at the very end of the second floor, right across from a stairwell, so they were able to make it there without incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Chase exclaimed as he closed the bedroom door behind him, stripping to his underwear and throwing his pungent shirt and pants into a pile of dirty clothes on the floor. \"I'll take those to the washing machine in a few minutes. But first thing's first: I need to clean myself up!\" As he rushed to the bathroom, he motioned to the computer desk next to the foot of his bed. \"You can use my PC while you're waiting, Malik. Just... don't go to any websites that will get me in trouble or anything.\" Chuckling and smirking, he closed the bathroom door, and a few seconds later, Malik could hear the shower start running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing a little, Malik decided against using the computer, instead just sitting down on Chase's bed, kicking off his shoes and then lying back, looking up at the ceiling. Today had been a crazy day, probably the craziest day of his life, at least in the last half-hour or so. He had no idea what had caused his sudden giftedness, as far as his manhood was concerned, and the flood of emotions and sensations was too much for him. He had heard that puberty would be rough, but this was kind of ridiculous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain he tried to think back to what Mr. Gregor had been talking about in class this afternoon. Most of it had been ignored in favor of the overwhelming thoughts and urges that had come upon him suddenly, as well as the enlarging problem in his pants, but the words \"hyper puberty\" stuck out at him. He didn't remember what Gregor had said after that, but he imagined that if anything could be classified as that, then this certainly fit the bill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik shook his head and covered his eyes with his arm, trying to clear his mind and relax. As he did so, the sound of running water returned to his ears, and he again saw the image of Chase stripping, except this time it seemed to happen in a much more seductive manner, almost like a striptease; also, Chase didn't stop at the underwear, going completely nude, at least in Malik's head. Chase did have a rather attractive body, Malik thought. He was slightly more developed than Malik had been; certainly not as muscular as some of the high schoolers, but with just the right amount of definition in his chest and stomach. It was his eyes, however, that Malik was attracted to the most, and they seemed to sparkle like emeralds, getting brighter with each article of clothing that Chase removed. The images were so real, so vivid, that Malik could almost reach out and touch the chest of his friend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapped open, and he became aware of a building pressure that had returned and gotten even more intense than earlier. Looking down to his crotch, he noticed that his bulge had indeed gotten bigger yet again, but it wasn't the only thing that had grown. All of his clothes squeezed his skin much tighter than they had before, the hem of his shirt now riding several inches above his navel, while the seams at the shoulders slowly started to rip. His pants were in much worse shape,  the zipper having forced itself apart and the cuffs barely reaching past his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening,\" Malik said, noticing his voice, too, seemed louder than before, even though he had been trying to keep quiet. He jumped back up to his feet, causing several more loud tears in various areas of his clothes. He nearly lost his balance at first, the ground further away than normal and everything seeming smaller. Rushing to the door, he was stunned to see that his head nearly reached the top of the frame. Somehow, whether it was the hyper puberty he had thought about earlier or some other unknown force, he had grown to be over six feet tall! And it didn't seem like he was stopping yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to yell for Chase, but thinking about seeing his friend's naked, dripping wet body rush out of the shower to see what was wrong sent a slight tingle through his skin and caused his cock to twitch, finally ripping the fabric of both his pants and underwear. It lurched forward, springing out of its cloth prison and slapping against his stomach, every bit as aroused as before and nearly twice as big as he remembered it being in the bathroom! \"Nnnng...\" he moaned, the aching somehow even more intense than before. He tried to resist grasping it, but couldn't help himself, firmly grasping it at the base, amazed to see that he couldn't wrap his hand all the way around the shaft. In response, his cock oozed out a sizable amount of pre, hitting his leg before splashing in a puddle on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik staggered over to the bed, sitting back down on it while leaning back, accidentally banging his head against the wall. His new size was definitely still causing him to be disoriented, and the pleasure coursing through his veins gave him very little control over himself. But, for the moment anyways, he didn't care, and as he started to stroke, he only barely recognized that the rate his body was growing seemed to be picking up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only been going for a minute or so, however, when he heard a loud and sudden gasp in front of him. Startled and panicked, he opened his eyes, seeing in front of him the shocked face of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malik felt his blood run cold as heard the gasp, his hand immediately going from trying to stroke his cock to hiding it, his legs drawing up slightly. It was a futile effort with his clothes almost completely destroyed, his hands large and imposing for a boy his age but nowhere near big enough to cover his throbbing, still erect manhood. He quickly grabbed the top blanket of the bed, drawing it clumsily over his lap, his erection tenting it impressively, refusing to soften even in the middle of this humiliation. Malik's body was still pulsing slightly, growing bit by bit, his black hair nearly scraping against the ceiling, even from his sitting position! He was quite a sight to behold to the small crowd that had gathered just outside Chase's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading the group was a boy Chase's age, with short, spiky brown hair and a more bulky build, clearly a jock into sports. His dark brown eyes were wide with shock as he gazed up and down Malik's growing body, a slight smile on his lips. His school uniform was extremely relaxed, the tie undone and the shirt untucked, a few of the top buttons open as well. Behind him were at least five or six other students, some craning their necks to see over the lead boy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Darren! What's the hold up?\" A voice shouted from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, did you leave a porn mag out or something?\" Another joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren looked over his shoulder and said, \"Yeah right, like I'd need that. Shut up for a second, there's something I got to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door behind him and locked it, turning back to face Malik. \"Teammates. Football. Nice guys, but not too bright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik blushed, unsure of what to say to this stranger. He had of course seen him around the school, had even talked to him on occasion, but he had never found out his name or his interests. Malik wasn't the most sporty guy in the world as it was, so the various teams were unknown to him. Was...this how they normally acted, so casual about something so insane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren whistled as he took Malik's form in, from his wide, bulging pecs to his rock hard, perfectly formed six pack. \"Damn kid, you look like you've been working out all day every day for your whole life! Though I guess working out doesn't exactly make you tall, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Malik could reply the bathroom door opened and Chase came out, towel wrapped around his waist, low enough that Malik could easily see the smooth lines of his hips. Malik could feel his cock twitch again, more pre oozing out, soaking the spot on the blanket that was covering his lap. \"Sorry that took so long.\" Chase said, drying his hair with a separate towel over his head. \"You REALLY got me covered there...that uniform is ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be the first one.\" Darren said nonchalantly, sitting down next to Malik, his hand accidentally (?) touching Malik's own, a strange feeling like an electric current running through Malik's skin again. \"This blanket is going to be ruined at this rate too...\" Malik thought guiltily, unable to stem yet another burst of pre. The bed creaked slightly as Malik's head pushed up against the ceiling fully, his long legs stretching across the floor, his large toes digging fitfully into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase jumped as he heard Darren's voice, whipping the towel off his head. \"J-Jesus! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...class is over.\" Darren said simply, raising an eyebrow. \"Hence, I'm back here, with the guys, like always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase groaned and smacked his forehead. \"Can't you just...get rid of them? I mean, Malik is kind of having an iss-UEEEEEEEAAAAAHWHATTHEHELLYOU'REHUGE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice shrieked into almost incoherence as he got his second shock, unable to process how enormous Malik had gotten in such a short amount of time. Malik groaned and said, \"I know! I just started...growing again! And...it's not stopping! I-I think I have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed embarrassed, at his lap, the blanket now thoroughly wet with pre, the pungent smell of sex filling the air. Darren grinned as he saw what Malik was indicating. \"Yeah, that does look pretty uncomfortable. Here, let me help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whipped the blanket off Malik's lap before the massive teen could protest, the bed cracking suddenly as Malik's weight became too much for it, his shapely ass smashing it to the ground. Malik grunted, almost falling backward in surprise, unable to stop Darren as he gripped Malik's throbbing cock in his hand, barely able to get his hand even halfway around it! \"Damn, it's even bigger than I thought...\" Darren said, slightly awed, his hand gently moving up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop you're just going to make things worse!\" Chase shouted, rushing over to the scene, grabbing Darren's wrist. Malik shuddered as a tug of war ensued. Chase wasn't strong enough to remove Darren's hand so all he ended up doing was pulling his hand down slightly, only for Darren to tug it back up, the series of gestures resulting in a crude hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the erection is making him grow right?\" Darren said reasonably, pushing against Chase's bare chest somewhat, making him start to lose his grip. \"And it's not going down by itself so he's still growing. If we get him OFF, he'll stop growing. Simple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so casual about this?\" Chase said incredulously, hesitating as he considered Darren's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I see a dick this huge I'm not going to ask questions.\" Darren said matter of factly. \"I'm just going to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have at least asked Malik about it first...\" Chase said grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik let out a loud, intense moan, his deeper sounding voice rattling the pictures on the wall. \"Just DO something!\" He managed to get out. \"PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard the man!\" Darren said eagerly, shoving Chase aside. \"Let the master work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down on his knees before the younger male, gently grabbing his dick again, stroking it lightly. Chase hovered in the background, fidgeting slightly as he watched Malik's body continue to swell, his head already nearing the ceiling again, his giant foot inches away from Chase's own. He surreptitiously measured his own foot against the light brown skin of his new friend's, marveling at how the entire length of his foot was slowly becoming dwarfed by Malik's big toe alone! He gulped slightly, his eyes traveling over Malik's huge arms, his broad shoulders, his heaving chest as his entire body heated up, sweat beading out on his caramel skin. The already musky, intense smell in the room only got heavier, giving Chase an erection beyond his will, his body taking a step closer to the scene in front of him. Darren had progressed from stroking to licking, his tongue expertly running up the shaft to the head, tasting the pre cum there, sucking gently on the tip, Malik's toes clenching all the harder as he was serviced for the first time, his growth beginning to accelerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better wrap this up or I won't be able to fit it in my mouth...\" Darren murmured, his voice a low purr deep in his chest. He quickly took as much of Malik's head and shaft into his mouth as he could, his throat relaxing as he sucked, saliva streaming down the sides of his mouth. Malik's moans became even louder, the walls themselves starting to shake now, his head pressing inexorably up against the ceiling, cracks radiating out from the point of contact, plaster starting to rain down on the trio. Just when it seemed like Malik's head was going to burst through the ceiling into the next floor, Darren pulled away, Malik's hips bucking slightly, his hand grabbing his erection instinctively, pointing it forward as he erupted like a volcano, cum spewing forth in hot, thick ropes, splashing against the wall before puddling on the floor! Load after load shot from his slit, Darren and Chase having to quickly get behind Malik to avoid getting drenched, the puddle swiftly expanding along the carpet. After what seemed like minutes, Malik's orgasm ended, his growth tapering off as he collapsed backward in pure exhaustion, breathing heavily, his cock finally relaxing in a softening mess on his abs. Malik himself hadn't been able to avoid his own seed, his torso covered in the stuff as his feet were resting in the puddle surrounding the bed, almost extending to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now THAT was an experience.\" Darren said with a chuckle, breaking the silence. \"But...I think now you guys should probably fill me in on what the hell's going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could even begin explaining...</span></div></div>",

He hadn't even finished catching his breath when he started to feel light headed and the large slab between his legs begin to tense up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, Malik?\" Chase asked, eyeing his friend with a worried look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Malik shook his head and held his hands up. \"N-nothing!\" He closed his eyes and tried his best to concentrate on the most unsexiest things he could think of, things that would turn him off no matter what. But everything that came to mind served only to arouse him even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting!\" Darren tapped his foot as he crossed his arms over his chest. \"How'd we end up with a fifteen-foot tall Arabian Adonis on our hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say more like twenty, or maybe even twenty-five by now,\" Chase replied, turning and looking at Darren straight in the eye. \"But I don't really know! When I started my shower, he was shorter than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, images of Chase naked and showering came to Malik's mind, his body glistening as he the suds rinsed off of it. His head twitched, and he leaned backwards, his shoulder blades pressing against the corner where the wall met the ceiling, quickly filling up the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" Darren grinned as he pointed at the pile of dirty clothes where Chase's uniform still lay, his back still towards the young growing teen behind him, \"why were your clothes covered with cum when I walked in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Well-- HOLY SHIT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase's eyes went wide as he saw Malik's back push up against the ceiling, forcing up and out the ceiling and walls. Darren spun around just as Malik's left foot took out the window, not only breaking the glass but tearing out the frame itself. Malik was curled up nearly in a fetal position, his chest pressed up against his bent knees, moaning while the head of his cock was peaking out from in between his thighs, a stream of clear pre pouring from his slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren stared at the swelling giant in front of him, nearly licking his lips in anticipation. \"This... is hot.\" His hand travelled down to his own crotch, squeezing his bulge once before finally just unzipping his pants and letting his own cock out and beginning to stroke it, much smaller than Malik's but no less aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, Chase still had a worried look on his face, though battling with his own attraction to his growing friend, as evident by his tenting pants. He tried to fight it off, biting his bottom lip, but at the back of his mind he knew he could only battle his raging hormones for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnng!\" Malik's voice boomed throughout the floor, and he knew he was clearly losing whatever battle he was waging to stay within the confines of Chase and Darren's room. Taking a deep breath, he began to sit up, and as he did, his back took out the rest of the ceiling, sending plaster, tiles, and wood flying everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren and Chase both had to dodge the falling debris coming from the room above, jumping next to Malik and letting his huge body shield them as the bookshelf and desk from the room above fell down and crashed into their room. Luckily, no one seemed to currently be in that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to do something!\" Chase exclaimed. \"Before it's too late!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think it's already way past that,\" Darren answered with a smile. \"Now's the time to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\" Chase sputtered, his eyes dashing back and forth between Darren, who had removed his shirt and was working his way closer to Malik's cock. His mind raced, trying to come up with what his options were; at this point, it all seemed beyond any hope of a positive resolution. He had to do something, he thought, but what could he possibly do?</span></div></div>",

He WAS the health teacher after all and it was from him they first heard of this \"hyper puberty\" that Malik seemed to be going through. Then again, he had also mentioned that the chances of any human male actually EXPERIENCING it was so low that he barely thought it was worth talking about in the first place? What else had he said? Something about...it was different for everyone just like regular puberty...the smaller you start out, the bigger you end up...there's not enough research that has been done on it so the effects could be enhanced but minor to something incredibly major...or was he just getting his own fantasies mixed in with the actual information now? It was so hard to think!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought process was interrupted again as Malik's foot smashed through the wall, the boys gathered outside shouting in fear as an enormous brown foot suddenly appeared, stretching across the hall and pressing against the wall on the opposite side of the hall. \"Dude! What the fuck?!\" They heard someone shout, Malik whimpering while Darren chuckled, now standing before the towering dick. It stood taller than him by a wide margin, swaying lightly in the air, nearly level with the ceiling as Malik's head was swiftly beginning to approach the ceiling of the second floor, his shoulders so wide they were scraping opposite walls in the room! Another massive crash indicted his other foot going through the wall, both appendages now filling the hallway, effectively trapping both Darren and Chase between Malik's tree trunk like legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...fuck it!\" Chase shouted, whipping his towel off and running up to Darren, nearly colliding with his taller friend's broad back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah! Slow down guy. This was MY idea so I'm going first.\" Darren said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, who cares who goes first, let's just DO this!\" Chase said, shifting from foot to foot, his erection obvious. He had completely given in to his emotions, wanting nothing more than to mount his friend's cock and ride it like a horse, feeling his own erection rubbing against that rock solid pillar of manliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, so sad. Too slow!\" Darren said, giving Chase a playful shove, knocking him back a few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys?\" Malik's voice, still sounding as young as ever, if not more booming at his new size, said from above. \"W-What...what are you...nnngh...doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax big guy! Darren's going to take gooood care of you.\" Darren said with a chuckle, pressing a firm, slightly calloused hand against Malik's dick. \"Jesus...it's almost wider than I am!\" It was hard to imagine he had just serviced this dick not five minutes ago and now it was big enough to practically swallow him! Darren shivered at the thought, wrapping his arms around the shaft as best he could, his hands not quite meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik let out a room shaking moan, his legs jerking forward as he leaned back slightly, bulldozing the wall and crashing into the room across the hall, another shout audible. The entire building was beginning to shake now as Malik continued his inexorable growth, growing taller and wider, his muscles bulging bigger and stronger, his manhood growing longer and thicker! He could already feel his balls churning as they produced gallons upon gallons of cum, further stimulated by Darren's feet as he climbed on top of them for better purchase, his toes kneading the sensitive skin. \"O-Oh God...oh Jesus...o-oh fuck!\" Malik moaned, his hands twitching, not wanting to grab on for fear of hurting Darren or Chase, trying to keep his body as still as possible even as his head exploded through the second floor, his half closed, pleasure filled eyes looking at a confused and frightened teen at his desk, staring wide eyed at the gigantic head that just erupted from the floor of his room! He screamed and fell out of his chair, stumbling as he ran for the door, the floor collapsing around him! \"N-No...everyone...get out!\" Malik shouted, his voice like a rumbling loudspeaker, audible to everyone in the building. Those who hadn't already begun to leave swiftly exited their rooms, the rumbling building confusing and frightening them as they made their way to the exits, catching glimpses here and there of Malik's expanding body! Walls were coming down all around the towering Middle Eastern boy, his body now easily taking up multiple rooms on the first, second, and even third floor now! If this kept up, there wouldn't be a building left to hide him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase, momentarily mesmerized by his expanding friend, quickly clambered onto one of Malik's balls himself, climbing up Darren's back, stepping on his shoulders and leaping up to the purple, throbbing head, clinging tightly to it, rising above Darren's head! Darren laughed before grunting, rubbing his whole body against the shaft, licking it, feeling his own erection spurting pre even as it flowed down over Malik's shaft, dousing both boys in the musky liquid. \"Not bad Chase!\" He complimented, watching as his roommate clambered monkey like on top of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why this is happening...I don't know how to help or who to ask for help...but I do know you stop growing when you cum! So...t-this is totally for your sake!\" Chase muttered to himself, spreading his body out on top of the warm, tight flesh of the head, rubbing his hands and feet all over it, thrusting his hips as well, his minute pre mixing with Malik's own. All three teens were soon moaning as they pleasured themselves together, Malik's hands now gripping tight to the floor, his thick fingers driving through carpet and concrete, ripping it up as he was lost in the waves of pleasure, barely registering as his head smashed through the fourth, the fifth, the sixth floor, rapidly approaching the roof, his feet already nearly pressing against the outer wall, taking up a few floors of their own! The flooring started to sag under Malik's tonnage, the basement pipes exploding, flooding the basement! The gathered students, and even a few teachers, watched in amazement as the building continued to collapse, revealing bits and pieces of Malik's immense body, his growth completely out of control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, Malik could feel climax building, his hand shakily reaching up to aim his cock, only for it to erupt, firing load after load of thick, ropey streams of cum directly upwards, the stuff raining down on top of him even as it burst through the ceiling like a bomb, splattering the lawns outside, covering some of the other boys as well! Chase was practically knocked off, barely managing to cling to Malik's foreskin, hanging for dear life from a cock that was now stories tall, his body pressed up against it enough that he could feel the streams of cum rush past as they flowed from Malik's slit like a river, the entire area filling with cum. Darren, having cum himself, fell back down on the ground, chuckling as he realized he was standing knee deep in the stuff, the level constantly rising around him. \"This is INSANE!\" He shouted, laughing as he looked up, watching the cum flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik let out a shuddering gasp and leaned back, smashing through the wall behind him, falling into his own cum, his eyes closed tightly. Sweat was standing out on his body as his dick finally softened once more, neatly pinning Chase between Malik's manhood and his thick pecs, slowly scraping him off as the cock softened. Chase just laid there, panting, his entire body feeling tired, his hands lightly rubbing the pecs on either side of him. Darren quickly began scaling Malik's body again, standing proudly on top of the younger boy's leg, looking around at all the destruction. This was like something out of a movie, a truly exciting event that was a once in a million experience! How could he NOT be enjoying himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalik slowly sat up, moaning, Chase tumbling down his friend's body until he landed softly in the nest of pubes. \"Oh no...oh this is bad...\" Malik said, regaining his senses, looking around in terror at all the damage he had caused, how completely on display he was. \"I've...I've gotta get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted Darren on his leg, quickly grabbing him, depositing him next to Chase in his pubes, pushing both boys down deeper into the tangle of hairs, keeping them safely in place, surrounded by the slightly prickly hairs. Stumbling slightly, Malik got to his feet, the dorm buildings around him barely reaching his waist as he swiftly made his way off campus, each booming step knocking aside the fleeing students at his feet. \"S-Sorry!\" He said, stepping carefully. \"Just...just move! Please! To the sides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malik slowly leaves the area...</span></div></div>",

How about these choices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob &amp; Ryan, both 18 years old and in the 12th Grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Jacob - Denver, Colorado, US  &amp; Ryan - Atlanta, Georgia, US<br>\r\nAppearance: Jacob - Caucasian; pale skin; Medium-length dark brown hair; 5'8\" with a skinny build. Ryan - Caucasian; bronzed skin; thick, shaggy, sandy-brown hair; 5'11\" with a slender build<br>\r\nPersonality: Ryan and Jacob just started dating each other a few weeks ago. Both are nice guys, and friends with most of the boys they know. They each get good grades; Jacob is on the track and field team while Ryan is on the soccer team.<br>\r\nWhat causes their growth: While sneaking out to the nearby woods to make out, an alien UFO comes across them and bathes them in a weird light. <br>\r\nType of growth: they grow in spurts, each occurring about an hour apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin &amp; Kyung, identical twin brothers, both 14 years old and in the 9th grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: both from Seoul, South Korea<br>\r\nAppearance: both Asian; olive skin; crew-cut black hair; 5'6\" with a swimmer's build<br>\r\nPersonality: Quiet, studious, and dedicated to the swim team, Shin and Kyung are relatively unknown at the school, and they're happy that way.<br>\r\nWhat causes their growth: Their growth happens for an unknown reason, at least at the start.<br>\r\nType of growth: They grow during their sleep, although no one else but themselves seem to be aware of their growth, everyone else treats it as natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsim - 12, in the 7th grade; &amp; Collin - 16, in the 10th grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Asim - Dehli, India; Collin - Perth, Australia<br>\r\nAppearance: Asim - Indian; light-brown skin; shaggy black hair; 4' 8\" with an average build; Collin - Caucasian; tanned skin; medium-length blonde hair; 6'5\" with an athletic build<br>\r\nPersonality: Not only are they at opposite ends of the age spectrum for the school, but Asim and Collin have very little in common otherwise, Collin being much more into surfing and sex, while Asim is more studious and less sociable. However, they are the only boys in the school who were born on February 29th.<br>\r\nHow they grow: While celebrating their birthday separately (on a leap year), when they blow out the candles, they both suddenly begin to grow very fast, meeting up when they each see that the other has become a giant as well, and that their shared growth also has a same side effect.<br>\r\nType of growth: Fast, continuous, and colossal growth, with their \"maleness\" growing even faster than the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate - 13, in the 8th grade; &amp; Julian - 15, in the 9th grade<br>\r\nOriginally from: Dallas, Texas, US (both)<br>\r\nAppearance: Nate - Caucasian; fair-to-tanned skin; long, thick brown hair; 5'6\" with a slim-to-average build; Julian - Hispanic; light brown skin; shaggy, emo-style black hair; 6' 0\" with a slender build.<br>\r\nPersonality: both boys skater-types, Nate and Julian have been friends for nearly a decade, having grown up on the same street. Julian was the reason that Nate even tried to go to Lambda Academy, as he has a huge crush on Julian and has for several years. He sees the older boy as half-big-brother, half-best friend, but he's too scared to make a move (until now). All this time, Julian is oblivious to Nate's interests, and just sees him as a friend, but has never given one thought either way on anything more happening.<br>\r\nHow they grow: Desperate, Nate has found a spell book and tries to read a spell that will make Julian notice him and hopefully fall in love with him, but the language is hard to decipher, and Nate instead reads a spell that makes the two boys grow whenever they're around each other. When they're separate, they don't grow.<br>\r\nType of growth: slow, steady, and only when both boys are within 10 feet of each other.</span></div></div>",

For the first time in four years, he was able to celebrate his birthday on the actual day, February 29, and this made him very excited. Celebrating on the 28th or on March 1st just wasn't quite the same for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the residence hall, where the high school boys stayed, the exact same thing was happening with Collin. A small group of friends had joined him, having brought a cake that looked very similar to the one Asim had, but with four more candles. Both boys ran in different social circles and had never met; the only thing they had in common was their shared birthday, the only two boys in the school who happened to be born on February 29th. Of course, all of that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, they each were about to blow out the candles at the same time. And, whether through coincidence or fate, they both closed their eyes and made the exact same wish: \"I want my life to become more exciting.\" Taking a deep breath, they each blew out all the candles in one blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the last candle flickered out on Asim's cake, he suddenly felt his whole body begin to tense up and rapidly start to expand. Before he realized what was happening, he was already eight feet tall, adding on a foot in height every second, his shirt and pants, then finally his underwear, stretching and then ripping apart. His friends fled the room screaming, leaving Asim stunned, confused, and naked, ten feet tall and getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin's growth began only a split second after Asim's, as he had a few more candles to extinguish. Once it started, however, it was every bit as quick, as he too burst through his clothes, passing eight, nine, ten, eleven feet tall. He rose to his feet, only to thump his head against the ceiling and fall back down on his chair, crushing it into splinters underneath his now-ample posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, both boys had filled their respective rooms, but their bodies wouldn't stop growing, as their heads pushed against the ceiling. Asim cried out, a little scared, while Collin had already begun to delight in his sudden and dramatic growth spurt, laughing and standing up to his full height, smashing through the second and third floors and then the roof above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing the debris off of his body, the first thing Collin noticed was that, while the rest of his body stayed more or less within the same proportions, his manhood seemed to be be receiving a much more significant boost. Whereas before his cock was somewhere between six and six and a half inches, it seemed to almost have doubled those proportions, while each of his balls had grown bigger than his fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin thought about wrapping his hand around his shaft and seeing just what this new monster could do, but at that moment, he was distracted by something exploding out of the opposite side of the residence hall. He was somewhat shocked to see what looked to be the dark-haired head of another boy forcing its way through the roof, and then saw the boy's kneecaps, realizing that he was still seated. As more of the boy came into view, Collin realized that the other giant was much younger than he was, probably from the middle school grades. However, if he was also a giant, Collin reasoned, it probably wouldn't hurt to at least introduce himself. Stepping over the walls of the residence hall, he walked over towards the younger giant and reached his hand down towards him. \"Here, let me help you there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled at the loud booming voice, Asim jerked backwards, knocking down even more of the residence hall walls than he already had. He looked up at the boy in front of him, realizing that he seemed to be every bit as big as he was, though a few years older. He hesitated for a moment, then finally grabbed a hold of the extended hand, standing up to his full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're both in the same boat here,\" the older boy said as he grinned. \"Name's Collin, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm Asim.\" Steadying his footing, he looked at Collin, realizing that, even though the giant next to him was older, they both appeared nearly the same height, which looked especially odd considering they had both retained their earlier proportions. At first, he was embarrassed that they were each naked, but when he noticed the size of Collin's package, he whistled in admiration, feeling a twinge in his own cock. That's when he looked down and saw that he, too, had benefited from an enhanced endowment, nearly as big - if not maybe a little bigger - than Collin's was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin noticed this as well and chuckled. \"Well, Asim, I would say that we're both pretty excited about the situation we're finding ourselves in, if you know what I mean. But first thing's first: do you know why this has happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have no idea.\" Asim shook his head. \"I mean, one minute, I'm blowing out the candles on my birthday cake--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Collin interrupted. \"Today's you're birthday too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsim's eyes went wide. \"Y-yes, it is! I wonder if that has something to do with it. Nah, that's silly, right? I mean, there's got to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, who were born on a leap day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys had gotten so caught up in their introductions that they didn't notice they each were continuing to grow, now twice as big as they were when they burst out of the school building, growing at a steady pace of around a foot a second. As they looked down, though, they noticed that the world was still getting smaller around their feet. Looking back up at each other, they both had the same idea at the same time, though Collin was the first to voice it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nate opened the mysterious door and inside was a room filled with dirt and cobwebs. \u201cGross!\u201d, Nate said. He looked around some more and noticed a book. He got curious and walked over to it and read the title aloud. \u201cMagic Spells\u201d, he read. Nate thought for a moment, what if there was a spell to make Julian fall in love with him. He smiled and got so excited, he decided to take look in the book. He flipped through the pages and found a spell he thought that would work, so he decided to try it. However, the spell was hard to read and Nate had trouble reading it. When he finally finished reading it, the book began to emit a bright light, which absorbed into Nate\u2019s Skin and Julian\u2019s as well, but Nate didn\u2019t feel anything and Julian didn\u2019t notice somehow . \u201cDrat what a waste, Stupid book!\u201d,Nate said.

The camera hit a picture hanging on the wall and knocked it down. Dane swore and went over to pick the photo up, but he paused.

Reaching in, he pulled out a large, oddly designed camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, how long has this thing been in there?\" Dan wondered out loud. The picture had been hanging there forever, so Dan never really touched it, but who would have thought there would be something like this hiding in the clubroom?

It looked like an old fashioned instant camera, almost like a Polaroid, but with a different design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this thing still works, then I can at least still take SOME pictures.\" He said, inspecting it.

He was fifteen and very athletic. He also had one of the highest GPAs of the school. Everyone either loved him or hated him. He is very self-centered and thinks he\u2019s better than everyone. He had hit the squirrel with a homemade slingshot and brought it as his offering.<br>\r\n\tSeymour had pale white skin and black hair of medium length, stopping just above his eyes. He was 17, six feet tall, and very slim. He rarely talked to anyone, and usually stood with his arms crossed. He had a peculiar gaze that some considered sinister.  Nobody knows where he got the cat head.<br>\r\n\tLucas was white with very curly blonde hair. He was 17, but looked younger. His family was very wealthy and let Lucas do whatever the hell he wanted. As you can probably guess, he is a brat. He could get very horny over basically anything. He is very well known at Lambda, as well as at the police station. He bought a snake at a pet store, starved it, then cut its head off so that he could bring it as his offering.<br>\r\n\tDennis was 16, and was very muscular. He had wavy dirty-blond hair and a pointed chin. He has always enjoyed humiliating or even tormenting other kids who \u201chave a problem with him\u201d. He had assaulted a teacher at his last school and was expelled. The only school that would take him after that was Lambda, where he fit in perfectly. He\u2019d been raising a crow for several days, but decided he was tired of it and brought its head as his offering.<br>\r\n\tCameron was Dennis\u2019s 13-year-old brother. He had short, dark brown hair that was wavy like Dennis\u2019s. He was the youngest of the group, and was often teased by the others, but he knew they all loved him, or hoped they did. Cameron was very shy and could get nervous easily when talking to other boys. Dennis brought him into the group because he thought it would help him. After school, when nobody was around, Cameron took a net and captured a catfish from the school\u2019s aquarium so that he could bring its head as his offering.<br>\r\n\tAll five of them craved the same thing, and that thing they were all fated to have. It was power. The wanted not only the power  to increase their sizes, but also the power to control other people\u2019s minds (seduce them, make them feel pain, aggravate them, make them go insane, etc\u2026). The bigger the boy was, the more people he could control. Each boy could be any size that he pleased. <br>\r\n\tNow that all of the animal heads were piled together, it was time for the ceremony to begin. The boys all stripped down to nothing. Cameron was nervous, because this was the first time he\u2019d ever been naked in front of another person. The other boys, however were unfazed (with the exception of Lucas, who was starting to get an erection. <br>\r\n\tThey all held hands and made a circle around the pile. They began to chant ancient voodoo, which, for your own safety, I will not repeat in this story. Each boy could feel the energy get absorbed into his body. When it was over, they discussed where they would try out their powers. They agreed they would<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mother sighed- this argument had been going on for hours longer than she would have liked, and it was starting to wear on her patience.<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man, for the last time, this is not up for debate. Your grandparents have generously given you an opportunity that you can\u2019t even begin to appreciate. You\u2019re going to have the best education in the state, with some of the most helpful students in the <i>nation</i>, and you\u2019re going to be a better person when you graduate because of it. End. Of. Discussion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of being an only child to an only parent, Eli had grown up being as ordinary as any other kid- at least, initially. But at a young age, Eli had gotten beaten up badly by some bigger kids in his class, and since then he'd stayed as far away from other boys as he could. He got worse and worse, getting more introverted all the time, and at the end of his elementary school years, his mother saw a problem that needed to be nipped in the bud before it got worse. She got on the phone with her own parents, and between the three of them they had just enough cash to float Eli through an esteemed private school within the state, with just enough to help him with college if his grades were sufficiently excellent. Eli would make friends with other boys, and if he couldn\u2019t do that, he could at least learn to cope with them, whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli\u2019s complaints about other boys were heard, but discarded as nonsense then it became clear that was all they could be. Sure, the boys Eli went to class with had always been a bit large, but they certainly didn't grow at a rate you could track by looking at them. Eventually, Eli stopped talking about the matter, and it was decided that he had other reasons for not wanting to have other male friends- but what those were, his mother could only guess.<br>\r\nWell, fine, then. It still came to the same thing: Eli couldn\u2019t keep being guy-shy for all his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled into the parking lot, filled with hundreds of other boys, teenagers, and faculty, and began unloading Eli\u2019s things from the car. At that moment:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Eli!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chipper and jubilant teenager, obviously one of the seniors, waved at them. It was obvious he had been waiting for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Matthew. I\u2019m supposed to be your mentor for the first month of classes, to help you adjust. Everyone in the senior class has to do so, it\u2019s school tradition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew had messy brown hair and a winning smile. Modest muscles on his arms and legs showed he kept active, but they didn\u2019t bulge like a weightlifter\u2019s- he was probably into some endurance sport, like tennis or swimming. He wore light-tan cargo shorts and a dark blue three-button shirt with folded over collars. On both of them were printed \u201cLAMBDA ACADEMY\u201d, in white on the left pectoral for the shirt and at the bottom of the left leg for the shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli missed most of this, however, because he was busy keeping his gaze tightly fixed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Eli mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s optional, but most of the time, we start by giving the new guys a quick tour of the campus before bringing them back to their dorms-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know the layout.\" Eli muttered.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I know the layout, I saw it on the school's website.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? So you know you\u2019ll be staying-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cIn the southern wing, with all the other new first-class students. Cafeteria\u2019s at the eastern building, with vending machines in the science and liberal arts buildings, which are on either side of it. My room is G-9, second-to-last room from the end of the hall on the bottom floor.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really <i>are</i> amazing, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nEli said nothing, his eyes firmly on the sidewalk pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, is there anything else you need from me, or should I take off?\u201d Eli\u2019s mom asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we can take it from here- one of the student guides will take his stuff to his room.\u201d Matt whistled loudly, and a luggage handler in a uniform identical to Matt\u2019s came and hoisted the suitcases in his arms. \u201cG-9, please, and don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d<br>\r\nThe handler laughed and took off with his cargo while Eli\u2019s mom said her blessings for the school year.  Shortly after, she left, leaving Eli and his guide alone in a teeming parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess you\u2019ll just want to get to your dorm room, then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli\u2019s silence at this point was going past \"awkward\u201d and getting to the point of \u201cimpossible to ignore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019re shy, I can respect that. Lots of kids have their first time going to private schools as awkward things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause here was indicated for Eli to say something. He continued not to do so. What was the point? No one would believe the truth anyway. No one even noticed it. If you couldn\u2019t explain how the bullies that you\u2019d been arguing with had grown several inches over the weeks following- and then several more in that fight that was insanely one-sided- how could you possibly explain why you wouldn\u2019t want to risk arguing with anyone else again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was where they all demanded a response. They always did, and he\u2019d have to lie about enjoying coming here and keep it up for six miserable years, and probably the rest of his miserable life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt didn\u2019t do that, though. \u201cIf you want to stay quiet, you can do so. The smartest ones always are the most silent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli looked up at him. This response was not what he was expecting. \u201cI promise you this, though, Eli- these people are some of the nicest folks you\u2019ll ever meet. Just try to give them a chance, keep an open mind, and you won\u2019t regret it for an instant. I promise you, Eli-\" and for emphasis here he slung his arm over Eli's neck and shook his shoulder, \"-you're going to love it here!\" with that, Matt dropped his arm and turned to lead him to his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli could've sworn that he was a millimeter taller when he pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered internally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The halls of the southern wing bustled with the same energy and activity as the parking lot had been. It seemed like every other first year student had arrived before Eli and was already in the process of moving in, getting their boxes unloaded, and socializing with each other and with the other students who had all come down to see the newcomers. Everyone seemed super outgoing and talkative-- the polar opposite of Eli. <i>How can you have an entire school be full of type-A personalities?</i> he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the end of the hall, Matt stepped up to the second-to-last door that had a white plaque with black \"G-9\" letters printed in the middle of it. \"Here you go, Eli,\" Matt said as he took out a small keyring with two keys on it from his pocket. \"Your new home for the year!\" He opened the dorm room door, and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eli followed him in, he had a momentary pang of hope when he saw that both beds, closets, and desks were completely empty. Only his own suitcases, delivered a few minutes ago by the luggage handler, sat on the floor. Could it be possible? Could the school have made a mistake, or perhaps there was an odd number of students in the incoming class and he was lucky enough to be living alone for the year? <i>Maybe I'll be able to squeak by unnoticed and out of the way of everyone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" Matt said as he looked around the barren room, \"it looks like your roommate hasn't arrived yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli's heart sank. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt flashed a reassuring smile, placing his hand on Eli's shoulder as the bottom button on his polo came loose, revealing the top of his firm chest. \"Don't worry, he should be here anytime now. His name is Kai. He's already been on campus for the last week for football practice, but the team stays in a nearby hotel until the rooms are open and ready for everyone to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Football. Great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and get yourself unpacked and everything,\" Matt continued. \"There's an all-first-years' meeting in an hour at 6 o'clock in the gymnasium. It'll be fun, they'll be bringing in a whole bunch of pizzas, and the teachers and staff all do these little sketch bits to introduce themselves. Dumb, but hokey fun. And,\" he reached his arm out towards Eli, holding the keychain he had opened the door a moment ago with, \"These are yours. The small one is for the mailbox, the big one is for the room door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli quickly grabbed them, avoiding eye contact with the senior, and uttering the bare minimum politeness allowed. \"Thanks.\" He turned around and grabbed his suitcase, hoisted it up to the bed and then opened it, beginning to put away his clothes into the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt softly chuckled as he moved to the doorframe to leave, noticing that the bottom of his shirt had become untucked. \"Don't worry, Eli,\" he said as he smoothly undid his belt and tucked the shirt back in, then refastened it. \"You'll be a proud Lambda before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older teen turned and left, leaving the door wide open. Eli quickly walked over and firmly shut it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot more than three minutes had passed before he heard the sound of a key being inserted into the lock of the door. Eli kept his eyes focused on his suitcase as he tried to look busy, praying this would be over as quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, Kai,\" an older boy's voice came in from the hall. \"And I see Eli has already arrived. Eli, this is your roommate, Kai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli picked up another stack of shirts out of his bag and moved them over to the dresser, not even turning his head. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey.\" The voice seemed wavering and unsure, without any of the confident bravado Eli had been expecting from a jock. Turning his head slightly, he saw a skinny, long-haired tan boy holding a single box standing in the doorway. The boy was around Eli's height, maybe even an inch shorter, and had a somewhat nervous look about him as he walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai's senior mentor followed him in, as chipper and energetic as Matt had been. \"Here's your keys, Kai,\" he said, handing him a keyring identical to the one Eli had received. \"Remember, the intro session is at 6. I'll be seeing you too there! And,\" he said as he turned to leave, \"try and leave the door open, guys. It'll help you get to know everyone better!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older teen left down the hall, leaving Kai standing near the door, still holding his box. After a few awkward silent seconds, he cleared his throat. \"Um... do you mind if I close this for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli shook his head, and Kai shut the door. He then walked over to the empty bed and set the box down, standing and staring at it for a moment, before he slowly and wordlessly began to unpack. Eli continued to put away the last of his clothes as well, until his suitcase was finally empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned around and finally took a full look at his new roommate. Kai was definitely not what Eli had been expecting when Matt first mentioned him, seeming even more shy and awkward than himself. He also only seemed to have a few possessions in the box: a couple of sets of clean but plain-looking clothes, a single small picture frame that appeared to be of him with a large group of similar-looking people (his family, Eli guessed), and a laptop computer that looked to be several generations out-of-date. It didn't take long for Kai to put everything away too, and as he turned around and noticed Eli looking at him, he blushed slightly, avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so,\" Kai finally stammered, \"where do you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli blinked, feeling his defensiveness ebb a bit. \"Jeffersonville, at the other end of the state. You?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai leaned back against the bed. \"Hawaii, actually. Hilo, on the big island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawaii? Really?\" Eli had never met anyone from so far away before, or even been more than 100 miles outside of his state. The thought of someone coming from so far away seemed really exotic. \"What made you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on a partial athletic scholarship,\" Kai responded. \"And, you know, family saying it was the best opportunity, all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sounds familiar</i>, Eli thought. \"You play football, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKai nodded. \"I'm the kicker for the team, at least primarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Eli knew next to nothing about football (other than those who played it tended to like to take out a lot of their aggression on him). But kicker sounded like something that was a little different from the rough-and-tumble image he had of the sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say something else, but before he could open his mouth, the PA system in the dorm made a loud BEEP tone. \"Attention all incoming students,\" a warm, inviting adult voice came on, \"the Intro Session for First Year Students will begin in the gymnasium in five minutes. It will be a fun, informative meeting where you learn more about life at Lambda Academy, and pizza will be provided, so you don't want to miss it. And I remind everyone that attendance is MANDATORY. So we'll see you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli sighed. \"I guess we should go to this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kai replied. \"Go ahead, I'll be just a few more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" Eli patted his pockets to make sure he had his keys and phone, and stepped over to the door. He still felt nervous as hell about being at this all-guys school with absolutely nobody he knew, but after the past few minutes, maybe, <i>just maybe</i>, he thought it wouldn't be 100% completely unbearable.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Growing in school. Yeah, I know, it's been done. A LOT. BUT what if this school was a little different than others? A little more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 fabulous? Like a boarding school exclusively for queer youth. Would that interest you? If so, then Lambda Academy is the place for you. If not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 well I'm sure there's some other story on here that you could turn to. Now, the causes can be whatever you want, and there can be other side effects as well, but keep the main focus on the characters getting bigger in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't particularly like rules, but here are some anyways. BECAUSE I'M THE AUTHOR AND I SAID SO! HAHAHA!<br>\r\n1) If it isn't obvious, the characters that should grow are the students, all gay, bisexual, and curious males between 12 and 18 years of age. Females and non-gay guys can be characters, but shouldn't grow. <br>\r\n2) There will be a section where the teachers can grow, but their growth should be restricted just to this section, although students can grow along with them if you so choose. All the teachers and faculty are gay/bisexual males as well between 22 and 35.<br>\r\n3) As stated before, other things can occur besides growth, but growth should always be a factor.<br>\r\n4) New characters can be added if you wish. Please put a description at the beginning of the chapter and I will move it to the one preceding it so that people will be able to see the description when making their choice. Each type of story has a slightly different style of introduction; try and keep it similar if you can.<br>\r\n5) The first few chapters will be rather short and have several options. However, after the choice of the story, try to refrain from simple, one-sentence \"choice chapters\". Also, don't worry about leaving an option for someone else whenever you add your chapter; I'll manage that on my end. So, for example, there shouldn't be any chapters along the lines of: \"How bout this type of growth? Yes or No.\" I'll make sure there's always an open chapter for someone else's ideas, and change the choice to reflect what you write.<br>\r\n6) I might add on more rules as I see fit, and I reserve the right to edit or delete chapters as well. I probably won't, though, unless they're realllllly bad or the flow of the story needs to be fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny questions? Email them to me on this site and I'll do my best to answer, though it may take me a few days to respond. Otherwise, I hope you (and I) have fun!<br>\r\n</td>",
