            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry had noticed Hermione on the train, she was a very uptight person from what he could gather but she seemed nice. Now she was lounging in the griffindor common room reading one of the many textbooks the shops in diagon alley supplied, she noticed Harry staring and looked behind just in time to see Harry briskly walk away. \"Strange...I would've thought this \"boy who lived\" would able to stomach a girl looking at him\" she said as Harry walked up into the boys dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was completely empty except for the Weasly twins who were huddled in the corner, Harry locked the door behind him as he approached them, \"what are you two doing\" he asked confused. The continued working but smiled as they said, \"making a polyjuice potion; but Weasly-fied\" Harry raised an eyebrow before saying \"Polyjuice potion? What's that?\" The twins finally stopped and turned to face Harry, \"polyjuice potion is a potion that allows the user to become anyone they want as long as they have some biologically linked to the person and usually lasts 25 minutes averaging of course\" Fred said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge continued where his twin left off, \"or at least, the ORIGINAL potion does that, we modified it for our shop that we'll make once we're out of school, the new potion has no side effects the original has and has a longer time too\". Fred then picks up, \"or at least, we THINK that's what it does, we haven't tested it yet...hey wait a minute!\" He says with a smiling face as he suddenly looks directly at Harry. \"Harry, how'd you like to be our testing subject?\" Harry thought about it, the potion was largely untested and if anything went wrong he would probably take the hit, he might even die! The twins saw his grimace and added, \"come on Potter, isn't there anyone you want to become? Any girl perhaps\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mind was the assaulted by images of Hermione, some lewder then others, his face blushed but managed to say, \"yeah, i guess I will\". The twins smiled and Fred says, \"epic Potter! all you gotta do is collect something biological of the girl, hair, blood, saliva, it all counts\" \"then come back here and give it to us, we'll mix it with some off of the potion, whatever you do we won't care, it might even be funny!\" Armed with this new info, Harry exits the room and heads downstairs, Hermione is no longer there but a few off her hairs are stuck on the red chair she was sitting on, Harry grabs a couple and heads back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins are waiting for him as he approaches them, they raise their eyebrows at his quickness. \"Must be a griffindoor girl for you to have came back that quick, we'll keep you in here then\" Fred says as he hands Harry a vial holding a muddy like substance. Harry takes it and drops the hairs in it, they dissolve quick and Harry breaths heavily, \"bottoms up, i guess\" he says as he gulps sown the now enchanted drink, causing him to gag slightly as he drinks half. \"Nice Potter, how please don't explode\" George says as he casts a defensive charm around himself and his twin causing Harry to get nervous, the risks were still there and he could sense that they weren't pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Harry's body coursed with pain causing him to fall to his knees and grip his stomach, \"ahhhh! This hurts!\" He cries as the twins remark, \"ok so still painful\" George writes something on a notepad. Harry would've yelled at the twins for not explaining how painful the potion really was but suddenly he felt his body begin to change, his hips widened and his stomach thinned causing his organs and bones to rearrange, his arms and legs thinned and became more feminine along with both his hands and feet. The twins laughed in astonishment and said, \"the potion works! It works!\" But Harry was not celebrating as his penis was sucked into his skin and was replaced by a sensitive clit. His torso slimmed as well except for his chest which grew two small perky breasts that pressed against Harry's uniform, he gently touched them with his now very dainty hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neck became longer and thinned and his face became an exact replica of Hermiones except for his glasses which shifted as his face molded, in fact his vision became better until he couldn't even see out of his glasses anymore. His skull became smaller and his dark black hair turned light brown and frizzed off his head until they were a mess a mess of brown all across his now smaller frame. Finally his skin changed into Hermiones tone and all the other tiny features she owned until he was an exact replica of Hermione, he stood up only for the pants he was wearing to fall as they were too large for her frame leaving him looking like he just got pantsed. The twins snickered at that as harry blushed and pulled them back up hoping they would stay this time but too no avail, \"stop embarrassing yourself, Potter, those pants won't stay on, wait here while I go get you a girls uniform\" George says as he disappears down the stairs. Fred continues snickering and says Harry \"soooo, Hermione huh? She is kinda cute, I can see why you chose her\" Harry blushes and walks towards his bed just as George returned with a full girls uniform, even a pair of panties \"had to cash in a couple favors but I got it done, here ya go Harry\" \"thanks George\" Harry says with Hermiones voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry strips out of his now too large clothing causing him to be completely naked, the twins looked away thankfully, and he slip into his new uniform. He had difficulty with the bra and asked the twins, \"uhh can I have some help please?\" \"Sure\" they both respond and rush over to him helping him place the training bra over his small breasts. The rest was quite easy, the shirt, tie, and uniform was placed tightly over his torso while the panties and skirt were placed around his waist, he finally took off his shoes and placed on the now smaller shoes that now fit perfectly on his smaller feet, he then took off his glasses allowing him to finally see clearly with Hermiones eyes. He was now an exact replica of Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry was ecstatic, he was finally in Hermione's body! All he had to do was listen and follow whatever the twins wanted for him to do to make sure the new-and-improved polyjuice potion was good and he was homefree! There was still one problem however, the real Hermione Granger was still very real and was probably sleeping in the girl's dormitory, \"alright Harry, now let's see if the potion really does last for an hour\" Fred days as he sits next to Harry on his bed \"umm actually, I have to go to the bathroom, sorry\" he said with Hermione's soft but confident voice. \"But what if you get caught!? We'll have to stop out experiment!\" George says as he also sits down next to Harry, \" I'll be fine and I'll make sure no one spots me, just calm yourselves\" Harry said getting off his bed and heading downstairs hoping no one was in the common room to wonder what Hermione Granger was doing in the boy's dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully only Ron was in there but he was fast asleep much to Harry's luck, he briskly walked fast the open fire towards the girl's dormitory to stupefy Hermione, that way she couldn't be around to rat on him. However his plan was stopped in its tracks as he heard a voice, Ron's voice, from behind him say, \"Hermione? What are you doing up? I thought you went up to bed fifteen minutes ago\" . Ron sounded drowsy so Harry could attempt to persuade him to go back to sleep, Harry turned around to face Ron and said, \"you were clearly mistaken, Ron, besides why does it matter where I go and where I don't go past curfew? You and Harry do it all the time!\" Harry says perfectly imitating Herminone's tone and mannerisms by placing his hands on her hips while eyeing him down, Ron instantly quiets down \"sorry Herminone, didn't mean to get in your business\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shakes his head and says \"it's alright, Ron, it's been a stressful first day and you were just curious, I'll try not to freak out at you\" Ron lies back down on the couch and begin to drift off before saying \"goodnight Hermione\". Harry turns around and starts heading towards the girls dormitory while saying \" goodnight Ron\". Harry walks up the stairs hoping that the charm for the girl's dormitory didn't kick in, thankfully it didn't and Harry was able to get up the stairs and to the dormitory's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his ears towards the doors to check for any movement or sounds to indicate wakefulness, Harry heard none and acted as such. He gently opened the door to see girl's in their bed's of many different ages, in the far right corner was Hermione, asleep and tucked away. He crept over to Herminone's bedside and pulled out his wand, \"stupefy \" he whispered as he pressed the wand's tip to her temple and watched her body stiffen, \"sorry Hermione, but It's my turn\" he says as he uses Wingardium Leviosa and his invisibility cloak to make sure he was the only leaving this room to everyone else's awareness. He walked away from the dormitory and gently closed the door, he didn't want anyone waking up now that he had what he came for, he walked downstairs as quietly as he could to make sure Ron stayed asleep and walked back up the boys dormitory to Fred and George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there he noticed Fred and George smiling at him, \"what's the matter? Is there something on Hermione's face\" he says as he puts his left hand up to touch his face to see if there was anything he had accidentally put on his face in his small adventure. They smirked and Fred said \"Flipendo!\" As he pointed at Hermiones stiffened body causing the cloak to fall off and revealing Harry's real point in leaving. \" C'mon Harry, did you seriously think we wouldn't use the Marauder's map to see where you were going? \" George says as he points to the map in his hand as Fred takes Hermione from Harry. Harry blushed and says, \"I just wanted to be Hermione for a while\" the twins chuckle at hearing Hermione's voice explain itself in such an uncharacteristically small, unconfident voice \"of course you would, Hermione's really cute, (cute enough to kidnap is none of our business) but don't lie to us next time\" George says as he levitated Hermione's unconscious body onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge suddenly pulled out his notepad and a quill and Fred looked towards him and asked: \"So...how long was he out George\" George looked at something on the notepad before answering, \"longer than the regular potions normal time limit, going on 43 minutes since he took our modified batch\" Fred nods and looked over at Harry \"hear that Harry. This stuff can (so far) keep people in someone else's body for 43 minutes!\" Harry nodded as he sat on his bed wondering how much longer he'd get to stay in Hermione's body. Fred noticed his predicament and said comforting to him \"Just hold on for a little while longer Harry, we'll let you reapply the dosage once we're sure how long someone can stay as something or someone\" Fred comforted Harry as he stared at the clock watching the time tick by. Soon the click read 55 minutes, then 56, then 57, then 58, Harry's impatience was getting the better of him as he turned towards Fred with an upset expression on Hermione's face \"come on guy! It's clearly going to be an hour!\" They shook their heads in disapproval \" you never wanna jump to conclusions when dealing with potions, Harry, trust us\" they said in unison making them both smirk and causing Harry to pout with Hermione 's full lips and place his elbow on his skirt covered knee. The clock signified it had been an hour and Harry's body had not changed leaving him to sigh, \"ugh, let me just do it now, it's been an hour\" George wrote something down on the little notepad and Harry heard him mutter \"can go for an hour\" before Harry got up and was going to pluck a few more hairs out of Hermione's bushy hair when his body once again ached and caused him to double over in pain as he felt his body begin to change back. Not only that, but Hermione was beginning to wake up, the stunning spell had wore off and Hermione was asleep due to her own tiredness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry's vision began to blur and his clothes began to get tight he decided to...</span></div></div>",

Soon enough his body stopped changing back and started to rearrange to Hermione's form, his vision stopped blurring and his clothes stopped being uncomfortably tight. \"Phew! That was a close one\" Harry said as the Twins George continued taking notes while Fred came up to Harry and guided him to the side of the room \"Not that it's any of my business, but I don't know how much longer you'll be able to keep this act up\" Harry smirked and said \"why? Do you not think I'm a good Hermione Freddy?\" George snickered as he saw his twins gave flush while Fred said \" N-no, but I'm just saying, If you're Hermione then who's gonna be Harry Potter\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry put his hand up to his chin and thought about that point, If he took over Hermione's life then people will start to wonder where the most famous child wizard disappears to, Until suddenly Harry had an idea. \"Hermione will be me! It'll seem like I'm never actually gone and we can  be eachother!\" Fred scoffed \"yeah, except you just superuser and probably made her very mad, No what'll she go forward with your plan Harry\" Feed said (surprisingly) matter-of-factly. Harry smiled as he pulled out his wand, \"trust me, this plan is foolproof\" he said as he pointed his wand at Hermione and said...</span></div></div>",

Harry wanted them to know he would do anything to have this new life, anything at all, he watched as Hermione got up out of the bed and stood before him. \"You are now Harry Potter, the boy who lived, you will act as such and will have all my memories about being Harry Potter, is that understood?\" He said to Hermione who had a blank look on her face, \"yes, I understand\" she said in a voice like she was somewhere in la la land, very distant. \"You will forget all about being Hermione Granger, the muggle-born with with promise, you will forget your relationship with Ronald Weasly and you will forget all your immense knowledge and place all of it in this vial, is that understood?\" Harry continued as he held out the now empty vial. Hermione grabbed the bottle and said, \"yes, I understand\" and placed her wand to her temple and pulled out many memories and placed them in the vial causing it to shake but it held all the immense knowledge and memories, \"Good...now collect all of Harry Potters hair on this bed and return with me over here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione did so and collected all of Harry's hairs that covered his pillow and held them tightly in her hand, Harry smiled as he grabbed another spare via from his suitcase and dipped it in the Twins batch of Polyjuice potion, \"that bit's for free since you helped us thus far\" George said as he finished his notes. \"Place some in this vial\" Harry said and Hermione took a couple strands and placed them in the murky liquid causing it to bubble and shine, \"now cut off most of your hair\" Harry says and Hermione takes out her wand and says \"Diffindo!\" Causing most of her bushy hair to fall to the ground in heaps. Harry pulled out a small purse that he had swiped from Hermione's bedside and said \"place all the hair in here\" Hermione did so and the purse took all of the long strands with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry then said, \"take off your clothes and place them in the purse\" Hermione did so as she stripped out of her uniform, Hermione always made sure to wear her uniform so that she wasn't late for her classes, and placed them neatly inside the purse. Now Hermione was staring blankly at Harry while also being naked showing off her nearly shaven pussy and perky breasts, \"Drink the potion\" Harry said as he watched Hermione drink a good dosage before her body started to change and shifted until an exact replica of Harry was staring blankly back. \"Put on Harry Potter's pajamas\" Hermione did so and soon enough a fully clothed replica of Harry was standing before him, \"listen carefully now, You will go to sleep on Harry Potter's bed and will dream of catching the golden snitch for Hogwarts' Griffindor team once you do this you will be freed from the imperious curse but you will not remember who you are and will only know what Harry Potter's memories, you will take a sip of this every thirty minutes, Understood?\" He said and gave her the vial,  Hermione said in Harry's voice \" I understand\" and grabbed the vial and placed it under her bed then went under the covers and fell straight to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Blimey Harry! That was actually kind of scary\" Fred said as Harry put his hand to his temple and placed most of his memories into Hermiones....or rather Harry's head. He shifted in his sleep but other than that caused no other disturbance, Harry then took Hermione's memory contained vial and placed his wand in it, the wand sucked up all the memories and Harry placed it to his Temple causing his mind to be flooded with all of Hermione's knowledge, memories, mannerisms, feelings, emotions all of it was now in his mind....or now her mind. The new Hermione looked up at Fred and smiled, \"it's Hermione now, Harry's over there sleeping\" Fred and George nodded before George said, \"umm okay, we'll need you to come back later for some more testing though\" Hermione smiled before saying, \"sure, just don't pull another Aguamenti in the toilet like you did that one time in the girls bathroom again, my ass hurt for more than a week\" Harry said as he watched the twins expression change from a grimace to embarrassment as Harry said such a private prank that only Hermione and they could've known about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled before leaving them in the boy's dormitory, with her purse in hand, down to the common room. She found Ron still fast asleep by the open fire and was flooded with every memory she had of Ron, both the good and the bad....but mostly the good, causing her to stagger a bit but shook it off, Ron was no longer her best friend but her Boyfriend . She smiled before walking up him and planting a kiss on his cheek before heading up to the girl's dormitory, there she found almost everyone asleep and casually walked towards her bed where she say down on and was flooded with all the memories she had ever had sitting on this bed. She pulled back the covers, kicked off her socks and shoes, and slid underneath them, she placed a blanket over her throbbing head hoping that would soothe her headache sadly it did not causing her to resort to putting a sleeping charm on herself this finally soothed her aching head and she became extremely drowsy as she fell asleep upon the soft cushions and pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

She walked out of the girls dormitory and into the common room where the fire was no longer lot and bright sunlight was flowing through the Windows causing her to smile and look down to see Ron still fast asleep. She giggled at his dropping face and walked up and bent down so she was on his level then pushed him awake, \"wakey wakey Ronald, It's time to get up\" he stirs and his eyes open to see her smiling down at him, \"enjoy your first night back?\" She asked him as he smiles and says \" yeah, especially since I spent a bit of it with you\" he gets off the couch and she stands back up so she could stand next to him only slightly smaller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wanna head to breakfast?

Suddenly Harry comes rushing down wearing barely tucked in uniform \"come on, guys, we got to get there for mail! I want to see what Hedwig has for me\" Hermione smiled as she remembered all the good times she had of comforting Hedwig while she was still at the Dursley's, unfortunately Hedwig wouldn't be here anymore it would be Harry's, a sacrifice she needed to make to keep her new body. Ron ran off with Harry leaving Hermione alone in the Common room, as she stood there she tried to access everything she had taken from Hermione and luckily mostly everything had been implanted into her already, except for a few.memories which would go in as she ate breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of breakfast, Hermione realized that she was really hungry having skipped the welcoming feast last night to get some early studying done, she ran to catch up with the boys as she exited the common room and out into the grand staircase. She saw them already at the bottom and rushing towards the exit so they could get to the great hall, she would have to catch up more than she expected as she crossed each and every enchanted staircase until she too was at the bottom, she walked towards the exit and ran towards the grand hall. She found a seat next to the boys who were already devouring some ham and eggs that was provided by the house elves, you still didn't fully agree with this but we're hungry enough to stomach it for now (get it). She poured herself a bowl of porridge and a little scrambled eggs before eating alongside the boys who were already in their second plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, owls came in through open windows as mail delivery happened, Hermione herself had no Owl so any delivery 's she got was from the schools domesticated owls, they weren't very nice however and would usually step o people's food while delivering, Hermione included. \"Agh! Stupid Owl\" she says as it knocks over her porridge and leaving behind a package went from...Fred and George. She's suddenly became on edge as she said \"Diffendo!\" Quietly towards the packages and watch its cover shred to pieces revealing a box full of their modified politics options nd a note which Hermione picks up and reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dear Hermione, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope you enjoy yourself with your new....well you know. We left what was left of our modified stuff to you seeing as you had already contaminated it with that goal and we can always start anew, we have the recipe of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway feel free to come up at any time to help further our understanding of the options limits and give us feedback, we really do appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSincerely, The Weasly Twins<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled at the letter, thanking them silently for their contribution and taking out her purse so she could shove the package into it. \"What was tha, Hermione?\" Ron says as he finishes his fifth plate and finally seems to be satisfied \"It's just something from a couple friends here at the school being nice and considerate, have you sent anything to me yet Ron?\" She teases him as he whistled and looks the other way causing her to smirk and look back at her now ruined breakfast and signed as she ate the now sopping wet eggs, disgusting or not she wasn't letting good be wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater during transfiguration, she learned how to turn a lot of things into a mouse but got pretty bored with it pretty soon, so she mainly read a textbook for the rest of class. She would periodically look up to see Ron and Harry attempting to turns there stones into mice but failed again and again, and again and again they would ask her to do it for them \"if I do it for you you'll never learn! What'll you do if one day I'm not around to turn a pebble into a rodent for you?\" Ron and Harry chuckled and Ron says \" first off Hermione, why would we want to turn rocks into rodents and second off\" He put his hand on her small dainty one \"I'll never let you not be around\". Everyone's heart skipped a beat as she heard that, she blushed slightly before thinking and saying \"even when I have to go to the bathroom?\" Now it was Ron's turn to blush \" I I-uh mean, honor course not have your privacy! What I-i meant w-was\" she giggled as she put a finger on his lips to shut him up, \"your cute when your nervous, Ronald Weasly\" they both smile at each other as Professor Mcgonagal assigned homework and dismissed them for their free period to relax in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she wanted to hang out with the boys outside the castle to visit Have is since she hadn't seen him since last year, she owed it to the twins to give them her time. \"Tell Hagrid I'm sorry, I'll make it up to him, I swear!\" She told the boys as she headed up to griffindor tower, she found that fallacy hadn't changed the password yet and used the password she had been given by the prefects, \"Merryshoson\" she says casually to the fat lady as she steps into the passage behind the portrait and into the common room. She saw it mostly unoccupied, except for a few first years, she would've stopped to comfort them but she was beginning to feel her body change and decided to drink her second dose of the day with Fred and George, so she hurried up to the boys dormitory and saw it empty except for the twins who were experimenting with a new batch, \" oh, hey Hermione, thought you'd be spending time with Hagrid? \" George says as he tends to the grimy liquid while adding a few drops of some unknown substance. When felt her hair begin to thin as she took a filled vial out of the package within her purse and dropped a couple of her hairs within it waiting slightly as it began to shine and move before taking a gulp and ceasing the oncoming changes. \"Heh sorry, need it to become a habit, yeah I was going to hang out with Harris but felt that I owed it to you guys for helping we with the you know\" she awkwardly said as she placed a dainty hand behind her neck and rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nervously said, \"sooo yeah, if you need me for anything let me know\". The twins both looked at each other and grinned before turning their attention back to Hermione, Fred.stepped forward and...</span></div></div>",

Hermione thought about it for a while, on one hand and didn't want to do anything too outside the school's rules but in the other hand she did owe it to the twins, \"hmmm well....okay, who do I need to get this item from and what even is it?\" She asked Fred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fred smiled before saying, \"oh just a bunch of Snape's special stuff\" Hermione's eyes widened \"S-snape!?
