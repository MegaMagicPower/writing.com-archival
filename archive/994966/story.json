Getting bored, I glanced over at her book that was laying on her desk. Picking it up, I skimmed throuh a few pages. I picked a random page and said the \"spell\" aloud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediantly after saying the last verse, I grew a bit dizzy and I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up and looked around my surroundings to see to my horror I was...</span></div></div>",

I felt a wrenching in every fibre of my being and everything went black....<br>\r\n I fell into a restless unconsciousness full of what would be half remembered ghosts of dreams. <br>\r\n Time passed; how much, I don't know, but when I awoke, it was dark. I was lying on the ground, but as to where I was I had no idea. Confusion filled my mind. Wherever I was it wasn't Sam's bedroom that was for sure. It was dark, but it felt far larger. I couldn't see any walls through the gloom. The ground was odd. I was actually perched on top of six inch fibrous tufts which covered the ground, and gave slightly under me. They didn't feel natural and I couldn't figure out what the hell they were or where I was for the life of me. There was a breeze but not much. <br>\r\n  I remembered the spell. Surely not? I'd always tried to take an interest in Sam's magick, but it just hadn't occured to me that it would amount to anything. No. That was ridiculous. I couldn't possibly have been teleported to some weird otherworld place by magick. Could I? <br>\r\n  As my eyes adjusted to the dark I listened. I could here a very distant rumbling, as if from many miles away. It was barely audible at all. And, also from far away, a noise like a kind of 'deep wind', rhythmic and slowly pulsing. I'm sorry, I don't know how else to explain it all.<br>\r\n  Through the murk I saw something in the distance . A dark shape, like hill. As I set off, scrambling over the rough surface I called out for Sam, but there was no reply. No signs of life at all. <br>\r\n Soon, I reached the structure. Or hill. Or something. Walking about, it seemed to be roughly shaped like a boot on it's side. It was about twenty to thirty feet tall. It was really just a dark sillouhette to me, so I can't tell you more. At the lowest point a whole surface ringed a cave entrance some thirty feet across. <br>\r\n Perhaps this would make a good place to camp out till dawn?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Then I realized what Sam had meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in your sister's PANTIES?!\", I screamed. Not like anyone but us could hear it though. We were hoisted up after a second leg veered through on my other side, and we both were looking upwards, at the speeding waist that was Amy's.

Breathing deep, I saw we were in pink panties. Pink. Hello Kitty pink. I bet that's what these were, too. I heard a muffled Sam on the other side, and climbed on my belly to get to the front, amazed that Amy had not spotted us, or felt us.

She stopped writing down notes and slid a hand under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...That...feels good.....\", Amy said, sliding a hand down into her pants, but no one could see. She sat in back and her hand was under the desk. She slowly started fingering herself, rubbing the tip of her finger around the entrance to her hole, and felt a sudden surge of pleasure as she felt something slip inside. She didn't know what it was, or care...it was moving and she plunged straight towards the opening, shoving something else inside as well, that also squirmed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...as Sam slid in, a giant hand came from above, flooding light into the humid pantie-space. A single finger traced the opening to this cave, and I heard a muffled giggle from inside. I scrambled to get in, but Amy's finger got there a minute before I was fully inside, and unmercifully shoved me inside as well. I could barely see but for the light now coming in from Amy's pleasure trip. I found Sam, and hugged her tight, realizing the walls had begun squeezing lightly. We moved further inside, and stopped. The squeezing got faster and faster and harder...and then a wave of that strong, sticky liquid passed over us, pushing us to the exit, and out, and Amy climaxed and finished. We could hear her panting from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\", I said, amazed. Then Sam pulled me into a kiss, her mouth forcing mine open, and shoved a mouthfull of her sister's juices into my mouth; It was a powerful aphrodesiac. I broke the kiss, and Sam decided she wanted more adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that was fun....how about we go to the other on now?\" She smirked, licking off the juice that was everywhere in the front of Amy's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose....\", I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe climbed to the back of her panties, and hugged each other tight, pushing head-first into the large pucker.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Amy panted. She had had the biggest orgasm of her life. She smiled, and pulled up her fingers and licked them like they had chocolate or something on their tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....was....awesome...\", she panted...and layed her head on the desk. No one seemed to have noticed, not that she cared. She was just purely happy for now. Not a care in the world. She squeezed her butt muscles together gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was that? Huh. I guess it was nothing, I'm just being paranoid I suppose...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...The two of us climbed out, into the large cave that was her sister's intestine. I certainly know why it's called large now...the smell overpowered us, and Sam tackled me to the floor of our cave, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun?\", she asked, smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually. I am!\" I smiled, pulled her off me and got up. I was really hungry. And judging from Sam's growling stomach, she was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what're we gonna eat?\", I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. We could try and get to her, and have her feed us. It must be almost lunch time by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran to our puckered entrance. I was surprised how well I could see, even though everything was still fairly dark. I pushed. Nothing. I tried again. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sam....? I think we're stuck...\", I said, a little fearfully...</span></div></div>",
