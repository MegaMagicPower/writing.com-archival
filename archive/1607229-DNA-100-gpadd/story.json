            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Megan. I am 5'5, 145 pounds, I am white with long brown hair that comes down to my shoulder blades or on top of my breast. On that topic, my babies are in the 24 CC range. Not to be big but manageable for a 22 year old like myself. My eyes are hazel and my butt is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are interrupted as the phone on the counter rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan can you come over, I think I may have stumbled onto something.\" Mark says in an excited voice.<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess.\" You say a bit aggravated looking at the computer as it continues to record your speech before shutting it off and getting in your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark did this all the time he would find something that he considered world changing and run to you for approval. It was cute in its own regard. But, recently he was making more and more \"discoveries\".  You, being a Graphic Designer/Animator/Storyboard Freelancer and on the edge of starting your own internet based company always made time for Mark. It was not your fault really. The guy was just simply cute and innocent and had other attributes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark is 24 5'10 135 lbs  with brown hair and hazel eyes he was tone and had a cute tight butt and a rather large.. But, his physical side was not why you fell in love with him. He would mess up from time to time, but he always made it better and drew you closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up to Marks small home and park your car in the shared driveway. Mark was very smart even as a kid, and he quickly progressed through the ranks becoming the second youngest professor in the history of the university. So with some proper investing Mark had managed to grab a repossession within a half an hour from the university. He rented out the upstairs to a student at the university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Rachel. The little 19 year old was pretty like most girls are, and it was not something that missed Mark's eye. You had been jealous of her in the past as her figure closely resembled yours except for her bust, which was considerably larger in the 24 DD range. The fact that in your mind was a slut that lived right above your boyfriends house did not help either. Mark had promised you that he will terminate her lease on the grounds that he wants to sell the home, but she still has two months left on the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the stairs and hug Mark tight giving him a kiss on the lips and then walking over to the microscope. You are about to peer in when Mark looks at you a bit absurd.<br>\r\n\"No, not over there in here.\" Mark says walking into the closet, and you follow him before he pulls a cage out  you look down at the sight of the small furry creature inside.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask a bit caught off guard.<br>\r\n\"A squirrel and a rabbit cross\" Mark says noticing you look at the little lopped eared creature as it rummaged through the cage quietly.<br>\r\n\"How did you? I mean..\" You ask wondering what you were looking at.<br>\r\n\"That is why I called you over here. I just had to show someone.\" Mark says looking at you.<br>\r\n\"That's not the only reason is it?\" You ask a bit seductively<br>\r\n\"No.\" he says with a little laugh.\"But, here watch mark pulls one of his lab mice from its cage and set it in a cardboard box. He then  pulls out some scissors and clipped off a small piece of the mice's hair. Mark pulled out what looked like a cell phone and flipped to open the lid and dropped the hair inside and then pointed to the cages containing a few bunnies handing you the scissors.<br>\r\n\"Cut off a bit of  hair off of one and put it in this in the empty compartment.\" Mark says as he hands you the cell phone looking thing.<br>\r\n\"Mark, I really don't think.\" You say wondering what he is up to knowing this is unlike Mark.<br>\r\n\"I know it is weird, but you have to see this\" Mark insist as he watches you put the sample inside and then snatches the device back plugging it in.<br>\r\n\"Now, watch.\" Mark says as he points the phone at the small mouse in the cardboard box. Mark pushes a button once and then scrolls down and pushes to enter. A beam of light hits the mouse and it freezes before it hunches over.<br>\r\nYou watch as the mouse's ears slowly become longer as its body seems to double in size. It's tail shrinks and the short hair turns into a bright white as it grows. The paws thicken and the nose sets back in the face more. The beam stops and the small creature rummages through the box and looks up at you.<br>\r\n\"That is why I wanted you here. It is a new species. And I want you to name it\" Mark says looking at you with anticipation.<br>\r\nYou look at Mark and...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">One night your lover , a biochemical genetics professor at the university of California calls you and tells you that you need to come over to their house and see something. Upon arriving, there is a sudden fight, and you find yourself/  and / or someone else changing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n-Only(mammal) changes. No snakes, insects, amphibious etc. <br>\r\n  ie Man into a dog etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You need the DNA of both the donor and the recipient before you can change the recipient.<br>\r\n  ie hair, blood, etc you need an original sample to change them back(so get a few).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Recipient receives half the traits of the donor.<br>\r\n  ie  If Bill 5'10 20 is shot with a newborn female kitten DNA. You now have a 11 year old  3' 1\" furry Herm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-In this story memories/instincts/ traits are transferred with DNA.<br>\r\n   ie Sara is shot with cat DNA, and she sees a mouse Sara is going to be very interested in the   mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can remove traits from the DNA making them Dormant or Dominate. But, only at the first dose and another DNA sample is needed after that.<br>\r\n ie Bill (above) does not have to be a herm the shooter can pick his sex, etc<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The more times they are shot them more shots it will take to bring them back to normal.<br>\r\n ie Bill is shot with Sara's DNA making him a herm, then shot with female bunny DNA making her small/furry. Then shot with baby mouse DNA making her smaller/younger and a female mouse/rabbit/human mix. It will take 10 samples(5 shots) to restore Bill back to his old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Killing is allowed(especially is it is what mother nature would do ie mouse/cat)<br>\r\n-Dead is dead (eaten=dead, crushed=dead, etc)<br>\r\n-Age Regressing under 1 year or progressing over 60-year  results in death(to stressful)<br>\r\n-Sex(especially if it is comical ie dog catcher turned into a bitch) is allowed.<br>\r\n- At least 3 sentences per chapter.<br>\r\n- If you end the story, please leave \"a way out\" and do not end it until the 9th chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd as many characters as you want. The story starts out with YOU, but you can make it 2/3rd person after introducing the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry for all the rules. But I am knocking out the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device is shaped like a flip phone. You set both samples inside close the lid and cycle through a screen with options(dormant/dominant traits) before pushing a red button. The device runs off of 110 volts and must be plugged in order to operate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will give 100 gp per add<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthors adding to this(by add count)<br>\r\ncerial</td>",
