What?\"<br>\r\nHarry and Ron looked at their friend who dozed off after their potions class.  Classes were getting increasingly harder and Hermione wanted to make sure that she finished all her work.  But in order to do that, she skipped out on most of her meals, only grabbing a biscuit to eat every once and a while, and spent most of her nights studying and writing.  Now, she was a wreck in between classes.  She paid attention during classes, like she normally did, but when they were over, Hermione would fall fast asleep.  Ron and Harry found it harder and harder to wake her up each time she blacked out.  It took them ten minutes to wake her up this time.  Luckily, there wasn't any class for several hours.  <br>\r\nHermione shook off the sleep and said, \"Thanks guys.  It has been difficult staying awake lately.\"<br>\r\nRon sarcastically replied, \"Nah, all that food and sleep you're getting must surely be helping Hermione.\"<br>\r\nShe was about to snap back at him until she realized that he was right.  Sluggishly, Hermione drifted off and went to the dining hall to get something to fuel herself.<br>\r\n\"Blimey Harry, she looks like a car wreck.\"<br>\r\n\"I know Ron.  Hopefully she can get things back on track soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione grabbed a bunch of food and started to eat.  Ginny stopped by and looked a little shocked to see her friend scarfing down her meal.<br>\r\n\"Well, hello there brother.  I didn't know that you turned into a girl.\"<br>\r\nHermione barely looked up at her and muffled through the food, \"Not funny Ginny.  I haven't had any food for several days and I am trying to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n\"Slow down there Hermione!  Eating too much like that isn't healthy for you.  Your stomach might burst from cramming all that food down like that.\"<br>\r\nWith a big gulp, she sighed and said, \"Well what would you recommend?  I can't stay awake lately and I need the fuel.\"<br>\r\nGinny thought for a moment.  \"Hmm... Ease into the eating.  That might help.  And get some sleep too.  I can see wrinkles on those wrinkles under your eyes.\"  She showed Hermione a mirror and she looked like a mess.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!!  Look at me!\"<br>\r\nGinny glanced down and giggled a little bit.  \"Yeah, look at your stomach.  Looks like you're....\"<br>\r\nHermione looked down and her stomach was bulging from the food.  Terrified, she darted out of the hall and into the bathroom.  Ginny sighed and went after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was washing her hands when Hermione went sprinting in and collided into her.  Dazed, Luna got up and gained her bearings.  <br>\r\n\"Ow... oh, hello Hermione.  I didn't expect you to run into me today.\"<br>\r\nHermione, a little hysterical, pointed to her stomach and shrieked, \"Look at my belly!  It looks like I'm fat beyond belief!\"  She began shaking her head, stuttering, \"What am I going to do??  What am I going to do??\"  <br>\r\nLuna grabbed her shoulders and calmed her down, \"Hermione, settle down.  You don't need to get worked up like this.  Here...\"<br>\r\nLuna reached for her bag and got a book.<br>\r\n\"Take this.  It's a book full of spells, charms, and hexes that alter people's appearance and body functions.  Some only work for an extended time, while some work until you cast the counter charm to cancel it.\"<br>\r\nHermione stared at the book in wonder and smiled greatly.  \"Thanks Luna!\"<br>\r\nShe dashed out of the bathroom and went off to her dorm.  Ginny had only managed to get there only when Hermione left.  <br>\r\n\"*pant* Hey Luna.  Have you seen Hermione?\"<br>\r\nLuna picked up her bag and answered, \"Yeah, she was here a minute ago.  I gave her a book and she dashed off with it in anticipation.\"<br>\r\nGinny sighed.  \"Thanks Luna.  I think I will check the Gryffindor house then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione eagerly opened the book and flipped through it, looking for a spell to increase her metabolism.  \"... Ah!  Here it is!\"  <br>\r\nShe immediately cast the spell and looked down.  Her stomach shook about a bit and reduced in size in seconds.  <br>\r\n\"Success!.... Hey, what's this one?  The... Vorium Gorgeous Charm, otherwise known as 'Vorius'?  Let's see... cast this on yourself and you will be able to devour anything you wish.  Your body becomes elastic, thus letting you swallow anything whole.  Be warned:  This charm is very dangerous.  If you wish to not digest anything, you must cast the Protectous Digestous charm in conjunction with the Vorius charm.  Hmm... this will let me eat as much as I want and get all the energy I need for my classes!  Excellent.\"<br>\r\nShe looked at an extra footnote at the bottom of the page.  \"Warning: Casting this charm may cause increased appetites with each use.  Multiple uses of this charm will make the user even more hungry each time, causing you to eat objects, and even people, that would not be possible to swallow whole before.  Too many uses may cause the user to become uncontrollable to the point you need others to return you to normal.\"<br>\r\n\"This seems to be a risky charm.  Is it worth the risk?\"  She looked at her stomach and growled.  \"Maybe this one time.\"  She cast the Vorium charm and looked at her stomach again.  <br>\r\n\"Huh.  Nothing feels different...\"<br>\r\nBehind her, heard someone coming into the common room where she decided to read the book.  It was...</span></div></div>",

Now I can eat anything I want and look normal while getting the energy I need.\"<br>\r\nA growl came out of nowhere.  Ginny, confused, asked, \"Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\nHermione rubbed her stomach and giggled, \"I guess I'm still hungry.  But it feels, much stronger now.\"<br>\r\nHer stomach grumbled and rumbled.  \"Geez Hermione.  Your stomach is really speaking huh?  Want to grab some food?\"<br>\r\nStarving, Hermione got up with the book.  She was about to say something when she paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vision came to her.  A darker form of herself appeared to her.  The darker version looked at Hermione and raised her hand out to her, beckoning her to come forward.  <br>\r\nIt said, \"You summoned me and here I am.  I give you the power to eat anything you desire.  But, in return, you are under my control.  You are mine.\"  The figure drifted towards her grabbed her and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hermione!  You there?\"  <br>\r\nGinny shouted at Hermione.  She snapped out of it and looked at Ginny.  \"... oh, it's nothing.  I just had a... vision.  A strange one...\"<br>\r\n\"I bet it was nothing.\"<br>\r\nHermione added, \"But it seemed so real.\"  She whispered to herself, \"Who was that girl?  Was that me?\"<br>\r\nHer stomach gave another loud growl.  \"Hermione!  Tell that stomach of yours to be quiet!  We'll get you food soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice said, \"Go ahead Hermione.  Eat.  Ginny will provide you well.  She will be delicious....\"<br>\r\nHermione looked around frantically.  \"Where did that voice come from?\"<br>\r\nShe noticed Ginny and drool crept out of her mouth.  Hermione wiped it off her mouth and jumped back.  \"Eat her.  Come on.  You can't go ignore me.\"  <br>\r\n\"What should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Quickly, she gulped, bringing in Ginny's slender shoulders, which she devoured with gusto. Hermione gently nibbled on Ginny's small, but curvy breasts, before moving away from them. <br>\r\nGinny's stomach proved no resistance, and Hermione soon slurped up Ginny's legs. Inside the other Gryffindor's stomach, the redheaded girl found no solace as her clothes were quickly and brutally digested. It seemed her fate was to slowly digest, and become a part of Hermione Granger. <br>\r\nShe screamed as she digested, her body becoming a soup of nutrition for Hermione, who admired herself in the mirror the following morning. <br>\r\n\"Bigger boobs, bigger ass-darn Ginny, you added to me fine!\" She remarked to herself.

A charm that had the power to hide an entire group of people within one person.<br>\r\nIt had been nicknamed the Ediba Charm by both Light and Dark magicals of old. <br>\r\n(A few days before Hogwarts began its semester for the year) <br>\r\n\"I'm bored,\" Susan groaned. \"Why can't school start earlier?\" Despite her own reassurances that Hogwarts would be fairly quiet this year, she deftly stood up, walking to the manor's library. <br>\r\nSince her aunt, Amelia Bones, worked long hours at the ministry and normally asked Susan not to poke around in her study, and that if she did so, the next day when Amelia was at work Susan wouldn'tbe allowed to walk around nude like she normally did if she didn't poke around. <br>\r\n\"Oh? What's this?\" You teased. <br>\r\n\"Nothing (Y/n),\" she muttered. Susan walked out of the room, letting you see her (admittedly) decently large butt. Once she was at the library, she gently looked around in, what appeared to be, a long forgotten corner of the fairly giant library, and she spotted a lone book laying on a chair. Susan walked over, opening the book.<br>\r\n\"Warrior's battlecry, Ediba Charm...what's the Ediba Charm?\" She asked herself. Looking around carefully, she sat down in the chair. \"The Ediba Charm is most commonly known as the Voracious Charm, since using it causes people to gain an unnatural hunger, one that cannot be stopped unless the user ends the charm...people can be eaten by the user any way they please...anti-digestion charms are highly recommended if you decide to use it...\" Susan blushed.

Hungry you try to go for it then Susan grabs you. \u201cNo no no cheeky boy\u201d she plops you on her plate you feel warmth than you realise, your laying down on sausages. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this\u201d Susan says \u201cThe boy who lived, eaten by me.\u201d She grabs ketchup and spurts in your face. You see nothing but red then you are picked up smelling her breath  feeling her tongue licking you plopping you into her mouth then closing it shut.</span></div></div>",
