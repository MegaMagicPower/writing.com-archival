His scales have changed color to match that of Dratini's and his fur is the color of a Terrapinch, the color of his head though us the color of Gible's head.

Now do you know why he is so shy.... Because most of the time his friends betray him!!!!). Most of the time he evolves into D6E1 to protect his friends, but if the bully won't quit he goes a step further and evolves into D6E2 which rarly happens because most bullies are scared of his first evolution.  Some might say Dracore is to powerful for his own good, but other people disagree to be specific Dracore's best friend and his strongest rival.</span></div></div>",

These Pokemon are Lucario, Magmortar, and Machamp. Brawl has the entire stature of Lucario. He has four arms, with hands like Machamp but with style similar to Lucario. His hands also have a small hole in them that can shoot out flames like Magmortar's. His fur has the coloration of Magmortar, but has the style of Lucario. Brawl wears a belt like a Machamp, and his shoulders have \"flames\" on them like Magmortar. His head is exactly like a Lucario's except for the coloration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature that approached me was very menacing looking. He was more than twice as big as me.

I felt a warm hand on my shoulder. I looked up and saw Brawl. He was smiling, \"I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eased up and tried standing up. He was more than twice as big as me. I decided to ask him, \"Where am I? Who are you? Why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you have a lot of questions kid\" he said. \"But I'll start at the beginning. This place is a human organization to make stronger Pokemon. They take the DNA of selected Pokemon and fuse them together, making us. Some of us are wild Pokemon, others are trainer's Pokemon. I was once a wild Lucario, until this place captured me. I was fused with Magmortar and Machamp DNA. Now, I am Experiment 31F, or Brawl as my codename. But, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrawl walked over to the container that held me, and looked at it. He stopped at a white label, \"Ah! Here it is! You are Experiment 12O, or Unova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say Unova?\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperiment 09D<br>\r\nCodename: Mindmeld<br>\r\nHeight: 4' 7\"<br>\r\nWeight: 135lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindmeld is a Pokemon fusion of Alakazam and Gallade.

Mindmeld's legs are like a Gallade's but has Alakazam's coloration. His head is like a Alakazam's, but has the crest and eyes of a Gallade.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother experiment walked in. It looked kinda menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say Unova?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" said Brawl, \"Does it sound familiar Mindmeld?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unova is the fifth known region in this world. Unlike the others, Unova has all different Pokemon; none from any region live there. That's why we couldn't recognize the Pokemon parts when this kid came in, all the Pokemon DNA is from Unova.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked at me in shock. Even I couldn't believe it. Suddenly, alarms blared. One man dressed in a lab coat ran in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up!\" he yelled. \"I'm going to take one of you at a time to a different room. Don't try anything funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in holding a staff that sparked a little. Brawl approached me, \"When I tell you to, run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I asked silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read his mind. He is going to destroy us. The International Police found where they were hiding, so they're going to destroy all evidence of what they have done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stepped away from the door, and Brawl made a bolt for it.

He turned to the other experiments. \"Everyone, we're free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the experiments ran out the door. I followed Brawl to the best of my ability, but I lost him.

One day there was word that the international police had found the facility and was launching an investigation. Fearing being caught and arrested they where planning to terminate the experiments however one of the experiments got free and destroyed the facility freeing most of the experiments in the process. In the end the international police arrested them and sent the remaining experiments to a special home to live out there lives happily however where about of some of the other experiments is unknown. How will you, a Pokemon cross breed turn out in the normal world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will take the role of a Pokemon experiment that has escaped from the lab or a trainer that finds one of the experiments. You will create your own Pokemon cross breed and decide what happens to it. You can be rescued by a trainer, live in the wild or Pokemon reserve, or be transferred to a Pokemon only world.<br>\r\nNote: In this story Pokemon aren\u2019t limited to 4 moves so any move a Pokemon can learn it can use. Also they can make there own original moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1:I want people to be able to make there own story if they want so if you make a character please leave the option to make another character. <br>\r\n2:On your character page when you make your cross breed please be very descriptive on what it looks like. <br>\r\n3:Please no sad or cruel endings.
