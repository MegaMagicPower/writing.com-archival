You are small, weak and slow, with no experience in fighting or surviving. Unless you are smart, you will probably die a lot. At least if you do die, you will be reborn as your brain is cloned, although dying still promises pain and humiliation. Consistently poor gladiators will eventually stop being reborn for being too useless, leading to permanent death. For your first fight, you are going to be given a fairly easy fight to evaluate your capabilities and ease you into your new life. You are made to wear only a loincloth and are given no armour, although you are at least given a small knife so that you have some means of defending yourself. The arena master tells you this will be the only time you are given such a privilege, however. The pit master gives you three choices to take for your first fight. None of them look TOO threatening, although each seems to promise a pretty tough fight.</span></div></div>",

As you are both equipped the same and both lack experience in fighting, you decide it would be the easiest fight of the three choices. You recognise her vaguely - she was probably abducted at the same time as you. The arena master nods at your choice, and sends both of you to the gates on opposite sides of the arena. As this is a new pair fighting, you have been put into a smaller side arena rather than the large, main arena where well known gladiators fight. As you walk towards the gate, you can hear the crowd cheering in anticipation of the bloodshed. You know that people will be watching. You become a little embarrassed - you hope that you aren't overpowered by a young girl in front of thousands of people. You can see her through the gate on the other side of the arena. You don't have time to notice much other than her small size and lack of armour - much like you - before the announcer booms the pre-match commentary. It is in a strange, alien language, and you don't understand, although you realise the announcer is hyping the fight, explaining who is taking part and trying to get people to bet. After a minute of his talking, the gate in front of you crashes open, and you are pushed into the arena by a forcefield. The girl stands looking at you, trying to find a weakness.

As your eyes adjust, you see you are in a clean white room, like a doctors office. There are strange alien machines marked with odd runes from the aliens' language. You try to move your arm, but you can't; it seems to be strapped to the chair you are sat in, as are your legs. You look down and realise the precarious situation you are in. You are completely naked, and are strapped to a large chair, like what you might find at a dentists. Your arms and legs are shackled to the chair, and you can't move them an inch. You wonder where you are - is this hell? You clearly remember getting stabbed in the chest, yet your chest feels fine and you can't see any signs of injury or surgery. Before you can ponder too much though, an alien enters from the door behind you. You can't get a good look at him, but he is bipedal and large bodied. He is wearing a metal outfit around him, leaving only his head exposed. He has grey, wrinkled flesh and two black eyes. His mouth must be inside his outfit, because you can't make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are awake.\" The creature notes in an accented voice. \"At least you can be reborn properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't respond, as you feel terrified and confused in equal measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I shan't hurt you. After all, why would I have revived you if that were the case?\" The creature asks, chuckling to himself. \"I suppose I should explain what is going on. You are a slave to us. We don't expect you to work - rather to fight in our arena, as I'm sure you are aware. Your first fight was rather pathetic, though. I hardly wanted to rebirth you. How does that work, I suppose you wonder? Well, we clone your brain straight from your corpse, and use your DNA to create a new body. You are exactly the same as you were when you died, physically at least. Anyhow, I shall let you go. I doubt much was explained to you before your fight. Sorry about that, but one of our champions didn't show up so we had to arrange your fight quickly. Come, walk with me, I shall explain your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, your shackles unbuckle, and the alien leaves the room, humming a strange song. You look around, and finding nothing you can take, decide to follow him.</span></div></div>",

You are still naked, and feel embarrassed as you walk past several other aliens, as well as the odd human, although barely anybody cares enough to look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the rebirth station. When you die, if we choose to, we can recreate you exactly the way you were when you died. This is what happened to you. After all, abducting humans is dangerous and expensive. If we get seen, we are in huge trouble, so we have to do it carefully. We can't take too many at once either - if a bunch of people go missing, people would get suspicious. We brainwash you as soon as you are aboard - nothing too much, otherwise your brain would get fried, but just enough that you don't worry about going back, and that you accept us as your leaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn a corner, and one of the walls is decorated by large, floor to ceiling windows. Through them, you can see a huge city, the most predominant building being a large oval structure that you think must be a stadium - probably the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of you can be put to work, but most get brought here to amuse us. We enjoy watching you tear each other to pieces. You are a barbaric race, but you come up with fantastic ways of killing. Very entertaining. And so you fight for us. You die for us. And then you are reborn, if we choose it. This time we did choose it, but if you are a disappointment...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we bring you back? No fun in watching someone pathetic. Usually we just execute you - have you butchered in the most brutal ways imaginable - and leave you dead forever. Anyway, you lost your first fight, and with it, your only equipment. We don't give out freebies. You want something, you have to take it. Ah, that reminds me. You never got to see the planet before your fight did you? You see, this structure is not where you will live. It is where WE live. When you are not wanted to fight, we leave you to roam on a wilderness planet. There are no shops, so you have to find or make things yourself. Sometimes we leave loot lying around to spice things up. There are safe zones that we patrol and keep clear of wild beasts. Yes, you heard me. You have to survive down there. Its televised of course. Sometimes watching a human die spontaneously is great fun. But anyway, there are safe zones where you cannot be harmed by the wilderness or other humans, but don't expect to find much there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien stops in front of a row of glass tubes. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are teleporters. They move you around the planet and our fine city. I shall give you a choice now... you can go to the planet, and try to survive until we need you, or go to the arena and see if there are any fights available. Of course, you will be summoned to fight eventually anyway. The choice is yours.\"</span></div></div>",

As you know, humans fight and die in them for our entertainment. We group you by age and capability, so unless we want a bloodbath, you should stand a chance. As for you, your pathetic performance in your last fight means you are the lowest of the low. Lose a couple more times, and you will find yourself in that great arena being executed in a horrible way to entertain us. So my advice is don't lose a couple more times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature takes a minute to laugh at his own joke, before continuing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will fight in the lowest arena. There are several arena ranks, and each arena adds something new and more exciting. Your fights will be harder, but you cannot be permanently left dead unless you are in the lowest few ranks. Its far too expensive to kill seasoned, capable warriors off for good. You will never be given weapons, clothes, armour or food. You must take them from your dead opponents, or find them on the surface. You will find safe places to sleep on the surface, and you humans tend to stick together down there. You must still be careful though. We televise the surface for a reason. When you are wanted for a fight, a ship will come and collect you as soon as you are available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads you to a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will lead you to a locker room in the lowest arena. Prepare yourself, and go to the gate when we call you. You will be fighting that boy I was talking to, You are both unarmed and unclothed, so it will be an even fight. Because you both fought pathetically in your first fights, the loser of this fight will be executed. That should encourage you! Now get out there and put up a good fight!\"</span></div></div>",

Well, not for you.\" He cackles as he retreats back to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A huge, reptilian creature, a little taller than a girraffe, but far more muscular and well built, stomps in. You can't help but be reminded of a dinosaur, what with its small, cold eyes and broad, flat mouth full of inward facing teeth. It has a narrow, stretchy underbelly for storing large prey, and runs on four large, clawed legs. And it is bearing down on you. Fast.</span></div></div>",
