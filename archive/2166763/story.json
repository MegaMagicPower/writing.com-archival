Having helped organise the dinner she already knows what's coming next and assures you it's something really good this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chat some more with the other colleagues at your table and have a look around. Ashley is sitting at a table on the other side of the room. She is enjoying herself, chatting with other people. When she sees you looking she waves and smiles at you. Maybe you have a chance to talk to your friend later that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the starter course it's time for a short break. People go to the restrooms, go out for a smoke and try to mingle a bit with other tables.</span></div></div>",

They must all still be chatting and doing their make-up in the bathroom together. It's always the same with them, if they don't hurry back they may miss the next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the waiters enter the room to serve the next course.

Then they lift the dome to reveal the special surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your shock you see Linda from Human Resources there. She is completely naked and tied up, lying in the middle of the table. And her being naked isn't even the most shocking part. Her body is golden brown and shiny, she is lying on a large platter with vegetables and she has an apple in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat nice woman that was just a while ago sitting next to you, chatting to you, is now lying completely naked in front of you and the other guests. She looks exactly like some roast animal, served as your dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize this must be the surprise act they planned this year, but this is really extreme. Seeing how well she's tied up your not even sure if she planned this and is doing this willingly. She does look like she has a smile on her face though, but it's hard to see with that apple in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head waiter smiles and says \"Enjoy your meal\"</span></div></div>",

But when you look closer it looks like Linda isn't even breathing, she is completely still. However beautiful her body is, it looks exactly like a roast piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your colleagues picks up a knife and to your shock he slices a piece of Linda's butt. She doesn't move at all, she is clearly roasted for real. After that example the others also start slicing and put pieces on their plates. They start laughing and eating, and the chatting resumes.

However, you try to select a bit that doesn't feel too private, maybe off her leg?<br>\r\nCarefully you slice a small piece off and put it on your plate. It must be very tender, it is so easy to slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a sip of wine you start eating and find she is very tasty. It now feels okay to feel good about it and have a chat with your colleagues. Automatically you keep filling your plate with more meat and you're enjoying yourself. It is becoming a very sociable evening, you're talking about work and other topics. Of course also the food is discussed, everyone likes the meat very much and you discuss which bits are best and point out good parts to eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda turns out to be the best meal you have ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you're becoming full.

A naked women, nicely prepared and roasted golden brown. She looks like the woman from marketing that you briefly talked to when she was still sitting at that table.

You smile to yourself as you realize that you're thinking about which of the two woman was the best meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you suddenly realize something: Both these tables had one woman sitting there and now have one large human main course, and you haven't seen Ashley after the break. As a matter of fact, none of the women had returned when this course was served.<br>\r\nSurely this isn't something they organized together? Not all women?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look around you see a large platter of meat on each table. Then you look at where Ashley was sitting, smiling and waving at you, but she isn't there now. On her table is a large platter as well, but most of it is eaten already.<br>\r\nSomeone is chewing on a bone, others are slicing off some more meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it can't be... she would never...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Ashley's pretty head lying on the platter, a colleague pushes it aside to get to what's left of her meat.<br>\r\nIt feels like the floor is falling away from under your feet as you realize she was one of the meals tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst thing is that you're not even sure that you feel so bad because your best friend is gone, or because she wasn't at your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Pete is working at an engineering company for several years now. The company is growing, both in profit and in size.<br>\r\nBecause of the nature of the work there are a lot of male colleagues, unfortunately women are still a minority in this business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not an all male company though. There are also a sales department, phone support, human resources, marketing, which are more diverse and create a little bit more balance in the work force gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course there is Ashley, the only female engineer in the company. Pete and her have worked together for a long time now, and have become good friends. Ashley enjoys the engineering department, she doesn't want a special treatment and is happy to be 'one of the guys'. Everyone respects her for her knowledge and abilities.<br>\r\nShe occassionally chats with the other women and tries to look a bit feminine, but mostly hangs out with her male colleagues and likes to keep a low profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach year there is a large company dinner in a luxury restaurant, meant for networking and relaxing with colleagues.<br>\r\nUsually the female colleagues prepare something special together. Like last year, when they rehearsed and performed a song together. It was more funny than professional, but produced a lot of laughs for the whole company.<br>\r\nThis really isn't Ashleys thing, being on stage in the center of attention, one of the 'girls-club', doing girly stuff. But each years she goes along with it, not to be a spoiler, but also because she secretly does like the compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
