            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seemingly overnight, a previously unheard of hotel chain had become the most talked about venue to wine, dine and party in London. Bachelors, families, influencers and celebrities alike had flocked to see what spectacles the place could offer. Little did they know that the hotel was run by an obscure egomaniac with a penchant for chaos the likes the world has never seen. Now they're not just gambling for personal profit- they're gambling with their very lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Damon Holden and his family, they were completely oblivious of this as they wheeled in their suitcases. Damon was your typical man's man, a chocolate skinned gym rat with a shaved head and infectious smile. He cradled two cases in the crooks of his arms as he waddled forwards, his biceps rippling as he went. His wife, Cindy, was trying hard not to show her blushes as she watched him from behind. She brushed a lock of blonde hair into her face to disguise the rosy complexion rising to her cheeks. Their daughters on the other hand seemed to pay no attention. Kenya and Keely, seventeen and thirteen respectively, were too glued to their devices to notice. Kenya straightened one of her edges with a long milky nail as she exchanged raunchy texts with her secret boyfriend. Her oversized silver hoops jangled as she laughed at a racy sext. Keely meanwhile was busy mashing the screen of her tablet, savagely gutting the enemies encountering her fearless samurai avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beeps and anguished cries eventually piqued Cindy's attention. \"Honeybun, you know violent games like that aren't appropriate for a little girl of your age,\" Cindy reasoned as she took a knee beside her. Keely huffed, dropping the device crossly and marching away with her arms folded angrily. Cindy's shoulders slumped dejectedly. Damon made to follow after her but Cindy put a dainty hand on his shoulder. \"I've got this, honey,\" she said as she gave him a quick peck and disappeared and started following Keely. \"Off she goes,\" Kenya smiled from behind her screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon groaned quietly. Fits like this were common between Cindy and the girls. Following the tragic circumstances of their mother passing away he could empathise that they didn't want a replacement. But five years of sadness and grieving had passed. He'd found love and remarried to someone just as caring and as compassionate. The girls hadn't warmed up to the premise of Cindy but Damon had hope. \"She's just trying to be good <i>for</i> you guys.\" Kenya scoffed as she pulled her suitcase up to the desk. Meanwhile Damon had dropped his own bags and had rung the bell for assistance. A cute looking young woman rushed over, stumbling slightly in her black stilettos, and parked herself into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/04/d6/5404d6016aba4b9253c1a16e8e7f083d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/54/04/d6/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bonjour</i>,\" the woman said in an eloquent Parisian accent, \"How can I be of assistance, <i>monsieur et mademoiselle?</i>\" Damon looked away for a moment as her stunning blue eyes focused on his. \"Erm, well...\" He looked down at her nametag. \"...<i>'Butch'?</i> Er, we'd like to book one...\" Kenya shook her head. \"...no, <i>two</i> rooms. But there needs to be a way me and my wife can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be acceptable if I offered you two rooms with en-suite facilities, one romantic king-size for you and your wife and another conjoining room with two queen-sizes for your beautiful daughters with access to one of our private pools, <i>monsieur?</i>\" Damon's jaw dropped as the lady's hands danced along the keyboard. \"How did you-. W-what the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Deverne told me in advance you were coming. We had all the accommodations prepared hours ago.\" Butch smiled as she handed them both their cards, Damon a gold one and Kenya silver. \"These are you room keys, credit cards and passes to get through the hotel grounds. Keep them close but feel free to come back if you require new ones.\" Kenya smiled as she turned the card in her hands- oh yeah, she could do <i>a LOT</i> of damage with this. \"Don't get too ahead of yourself, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Holden,\" Butch continued, \"Your father's is a Master Key that can control and monitor any and <i>ALL</i> transactions you make, not to mention monitor where you wander off to.\" Kenya frowned; suddenly this card was a lot less fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to Damon's mind. \"How much does this cost exactly?\" Butch flashed a set of pearly whites as she said, \"<i>Monsieur</i> Holden, I assure you that your stay is well within the parameters that your discretionary income allows. Ms Deverne herself has agreed to annul some of your expenses as long as you give our establishment a review <i>magnifique</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tell this Ms Deverne that I assure her this trip will be <i>'tres magnifique'!</i>\" They both laughed (much to Kenya's behest) as Butch put in the final details needed to enhance their living experience. Damon moved over to Kenya and draped his all-encompassing arms around her neck and shoulders gently. \"Cheer up, my little continent. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, I promise.\" She squirmed playfully as he kissed her forehead. \"Kenya's not a continent, dad,\" she laughed to which he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Cindy's found Keely yet,\" he finally said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh...my...f*cking...days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenya squealed excitedly as she surveyed the lavish room in front of her. A classy chandelier hung from the ceiling, refracting bright beams of sunlight through its iridescent crystals. The carpeted floors were spotless and created a sharp contrast with the red velvet bedsheets adorning the bed. She ran a finger over the aged mahogany wardrobe, feeling the natural ridges and notches of the varnished planks. The French desk attendant smiled profusely as she vicariously experienced the thrill and awe of the room through the young lady. \"Does it satisfy your expectations, <i>Mademoiselle?</i>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" Kenya pressed a button on the wall to reveal a revolving flatscreen TV that spanned the whole length of one of the walls. She squealed as she flicked it on, excited to see that it already had prepaid subscriptions to a myriad of digital streaming services. As she hopped on the bed and put on a soppy teen drama, Damon kept to himself at the back corner of the room and spoke quietly into his phone. \"...Good, I'm happy you found her,\" he breathed a sigh of relief, \"How's she doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fine as could be,\"</i> he heard Cindy say, <i>\"Thank God for ice-cream or I'd have no idea how to win her over. She's a wonderful kid, hon. Is it ok if we were gone for another half an hour or so? She kind of made me promise to play with her in this ball pit on one of the upper levels.\"</i> Damon chuckled- that girl had a silver tongue. He laughed back, \"You think I'm going to turn down any... <i>*yawn*</i>... any opportunity for you guys to bond? Nah, have fun Cindy.\" He sent a kiss down the line as he hung up. He yawned again, stretching out his arms to their fullest extent. Weird, he never felt this drowsy in the middle of the day like this before. <i>Must've been the drive,</i> he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger still it seemed like his exhaustion was contagious. He looked over and saw that Kenya had slumped over, the remote still clutched tightly in her hand. He turned around to thank Butch for all her help only to see an intimidating black gas mask latched onto her face. The exhaustion seemed to intensify now and his limbs slowly began to lose all sensory capabilities. What seemed to be green smoke curled up into the air, coiling and writhing menacingly as it invaded his orifices. \"W-What is...\" He reached for the bedframe but felt his fingers slip as he crashed into the cushioned layer of carpet. His mind spun and he watched as Butch leaned in close, her sharp blue eyes shining behind the black rimmed eye sockets being the last thing he saw before he blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright, fluorescent bulbs flicked on as the dim room illuminated. The silver glint of stainless steel reflected off the meticulous array of medical paraphernalia set up on an equally spotless dolly. Jars of human parts lined the shelves of the dank laboratory, some reserved for future use whilst others were simply trophies garnered by the Doctor himself. The smell in here was putrid, the stench of repeated bleaching and other assorted chemicals lingered in the air. The Doctor himself had long become accustomed to it. His cute button nose only wrinkled slightly as he stepped out from the shadows. He flipped his dark brunette hair out from his silvery eyes, exposing two equally silver dangling hoops. His manicured hands were deftly tucked into the front pockets of his ripped blue jeans as he stood in an effortlessly seductive pose. A flawless nail tapped out out Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, setting up a dramatic ambience for the procedure he would do shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://img.ltwebstatic.com/images2_pi/2019/06/26/15615386472136747834_thumbnail_600x799.webp\" target=\"_blank\">https://img.ltwebstatic.com/images2_pi/2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed a lock of hair behind his head as he carefully observed the father-daughter-duo strapped onto the operating tables in front of him. <i>Fascinating,</i> he thought as he used his hands to trace across their sleeping bodies. He felt the copious amount of muscle tissue on Damon's body, analysing its dissimilarity to his daughter's soft, feminine ones. He caressed the bulge encased inside his tight khakis, admiring its meaty girth and length. He was to do the same on the girl when he heard a familiar clacking of heels coming down the back stairs. He quickly manoeuvred himself away as two female figures came into view. The first he recognised as the pretty blonde desk attendant, Butch. As always she had that perky little smile on her face that was the perfect mix of warmness, ignorance and naivete. Beside her was a woman of average height with straight raven hair, large DD-cups and a figure that was fit of a model. Her face was imperceptibly attractive, alluring with no real explanation, and the Doctor could feel his snatch moistening slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Deverne,\" he said melodically in a quaint accent that amalgamated German, American and English intonations, \"I was not expecting you to be here today.\" He awkwardly fiddled with the white lab coat draped over his halter top-jean combination in a feeble attempt to portray confidence. Ms Deverne smiled, her red lips curling into a sly grin. \"Lawson, please,\" she said as she crossed the room, \"When my good little girl Butch here told me that my special visitors had arrived, I just knew that I had to come and witness the transformation process myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeverne playfully scratched behind the girl's ear, eliciting a low, pleasurable moan from the blonde's mouth. \"And I'll have you know, Mr Swanson,\" she continued, \"I'm completely entitled to enter each and every area enclosed within my premises. Understood?\" The Doctor nodded meekly. He turned back towards the lab setup and moved to the kitchen basin, thoroughly scrubbing his dainty hands before he rummaged inside his coat pockets and upturned a small white container. Deverne frowned as he popped a couple blue pills into his gaping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still struggling with that girl's body rejecting you after all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwanson nodded his head briefly before turning around and smiling warily. \"The implications of my earlier experimentations still tend to show up at the most inopportune moments. This is just a temporary precaution before I find a way to complete the assimilation.\" A loud slap sounded as he pulled on a fresh pair of medical gloves. He plonked down his shapely rear on a nearby swivel chair and rolled himself towards the 'patients'. \"Anything you want done in particular?\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeverne thought about what she pictured for the nuclear familial unit. \"How about...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damon's eyes snapped open. He heaved in heavy breaths as he sat bolt upright in the queen size bed's in Kenya and Keely's room. The images of the green smoke and bright blue eyes swirled round in his mind like a poisonous nightmare. His head shot towards the other bed and breathed a sigh of relief as he looked at Kenya while she absorbed her teen drama with a single-minded focus. <i>Must've been a dream,</i> he thought to himself as he rolled out of the linen sheets and trudged his way to the bathroom. He rubbed his eyes groggily as he sat down to relieve himself, hearing a short whizz before he pulled a couple tissues from the roll and wiped himself clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned profusely as he stood in front of the mirror and stretched his arms out. <i>'I look like a right mess,'</i> he sighed to himself as he took note of the tiny hairs growing on his slender arms and in the little caves of his armpits. He quietly observed the runny make-up adorning his face, scrutinising the black eyeliner and contour that Kenya had helped him apply just hours before. He unzipped a small pouch placed on the bathroom table, extracting a small makeup kit hidden inside. He  unscrewed the top of one of the lipstick bottles and carefully applied the Congo-pink colouring before smacking his plump lips together. Damon looked down towards his black bodycon dress. He hoisted his pert C-cups upwards, pressing them together so they'd look slightly bigger (an innocent idiosyncrasy that he'd unknowingly picked up from his daughter). He then pulled a small pair of tweezers and began plucking out the annoying stray hairs from his fleeky eyebrows. He struck a playful pose in the mirror, clutching his dark locs in his manicured hands as he put on a forlorn expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://catalog.21buttons.com/d6c8bb8d6b0f706e00e4079c3576c543cec97a8f.smedium.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://catalog.21buttons.com/d6c8bb8d6b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon laughed melodiously as he pulled out the phone that he normally stashed inside his bra for safekeeping. Damon frowned as he turned over the glittery pink case with cat ears in his hand. \"Kenya,\" he hollered as he stepped out of the bathroom, \"How've I got your phone stuck in my bra?\" Kenya swivelled round, her trimmed head turning bleak as she jumped towards him. Unfortunately for her, <i>Secret Boyfriend #3</i> decided to reveal himself as Damon heard the chime noise of an incoming message. Damon stopped Kenya in her tracks with a stern hand up gesture. He placed his finger onto the home button and, though he expected the fingerprint scanner not to recognise him, the phone unlocked himself and revealed a... well. let's just say it wasn't exactly family-friendly-PG-clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenya-Rose Folade Holden!\" Damon quaked with anger as he looked up towards his apprehensive daughter. His hoops wobbled uneasily as he held up the screen for her to see. \"Is this what you do behind me and your mother's backs?! Exchange lewd pictures and tarnish your innocence for these... scumbags?!\" He paced up and down the room, unwittingly swaying his backside sensually as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" she stammered with her masculine voice. \"...We're not even going out! That f*cking perv's been stalking me online for months now after I dumped his sorry ass! Dad, please, listen to me: I am <i>not</i> involved with that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then why did you reply, only a week ago, <i>'Garry, you were one of the best I've ever had'?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she not had a dark complexion, Kenya would've blushed bright scarlet at that moment. She scrunched her face up as she screamed back embarrassed, \"Well, OK, maybe I <i>DID</i> send that but you would've maybe been informed of it if you weren't such a freaking control freak!\" Damon winced. \"God, if you'd relax your grip on all our lives and stop being such a narcissistic d*ck, maybe we'd feel more comfortable telling you what we do with them?!\" Kenya slapped her hand over her mouth as she processed all she'd said. She picked up her card and ran out of the door, slamming it behind her with a soft thud (thanks to the cushioned air pockets installed into the doors).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Damon peeked out into the corridor and sighed dejectedly, a camera positioned up above precisely zoomed in and captured his picturesque features and transmitted them back to the dark subterranean laboratory. Doctor Swanson watched the screen intently as he brought a small dictation machine to his lush watermelon lips. \"Swanson's initial observations,\" he spoke into it, \"subjects seem to have remained oblivious to their bodily exchange, thanks to the soon-to-be-patented mental regulation chip. Preliminary tests have been successful and all sampled subjects seem to respond instantaneously. Could possibly lead to a cure to my own current bodily ailments...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...As for the family, it seems like the familial roles have remained intact following the brain transplant. Neither party seems to have developed any serious changes of mannerisms from their host bodies apart from the ones programmed in. All in all, a very good test pool. While I do not understand Ms Deverne's fascination with these ones, it's clear to see that it will be very interesting to observe them for the time being...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you,\" Cindy said as she collected the ice-cream cones from the vendor's coarse hands. \"No problem, ma'am,\" the vendor boomed in a low voice as Cindy smiled back with gratitude. As she walked away she commented on the vendor's perplexing appearance: she'd first thought they were a woman judging by their round face and large breasts but the deep voice, strange goatee and copious amounts of hair on their body suggested otherwise. They seemed nice enough though and Cindy wasn't one to assume. Heck, she'd seen a lot worse from some so-called 'Gen Z'-ers in their neighbourhood before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode forward confidently in her platform wedges, unknowingly catching the eyes of a couple passing men (and a handful of women too) as she flipped her blonde hair out of her eyes and made her way over to the ball pit. She squeezed herself into the midst of the other weary carers and crossed her legs effeminately as she watched Keely jump around and mingle with the other children. Cindy laughed awkwardly as she watched Keely reenact a mobster icing a treacherous lieutenant with another child in the pit, his submerged little head smiling wholeheartedly with his cute buckteeth. <i>She's a weird one but you've got to love her,</i> Cindy thought as Keely poured a bucket of multicoloured balls atop the boy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Jacob!\" Cindy turned round to see a muscular figure with tan skin, a rugged beard and a generally focused feel about them. If she hadn't already been married she would've swooned at his knowing dark green eyes and chiselled jaw. The man looked down and grinned as he noticed Cindy's blushes. \"Hi,\" he said as he stretched out a hand, \"I'm Sydney but all my friends call me Syd.\" Cindy returned his handshake and introduced herself. They quickly started their own conversation, laughing as they shared stories about the ups and downs of parenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see someone here that isn't a complete dinosaur,\" Syd laughed, \"Most of these guys look like they've gone twelve rounds with a hurricane. I absolutely love kids. Me and my husband are trying for our second now.\" Cindy looked to the man's rough knuckles and, lo and behold, there on his third finger were two rings, one a simple gold wedding band and the other holding a ridiculously large diamond on the top. \"Wowee, congratulations,\" she said as she stared at the expensive rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyd lifted his hand up and admired the ring for himself, replying, \"Thanks, my Martin <i>loves</i> to spoil me. Ooh, here he comes now!\" Cindy craned her neck to the side. Coming towards them was a handsome young man wearing a designer suit, expensive gold watch on his wrist and a mischievous twinkle in his sapphire eyes. <i>Oh lord, what a catch,</i> Cindy said to herself. The man continued to walk towards them...and then past them. However, behind his tall frame stood what looked to be just another adorable little girl in a fluffy pink pullover hoodie with teddy bear ears and matching little booties. Cindy stared closer and noticed a small black mobile clutched to her ear as she marched closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Jose, listen to me Nina, if you don't get me those files on my desk by Monday, I'll-\" The 'girl' hung up the line as Sydney beckoned 'her' forwards. A few moments later and Syd had hoisted the small figure onto 'his' lap where they began to passionately make-out, exchanging saliva disgustingly whilst the small girl's tiny hand tenderly pawing Syd's engorged manmeat. Cindy quietly gagged. She was happy that Keely was preoccupied in the ball-pit so that she didn't have to watch the scene. In fact, she felt quite mortified that a majority of the parental onlookers barely batted an eyelid- surely this violated <i>at least</i> half a dozen child sexual abuse laws. After a few moments more the two broke the embrace and smiled lovingly at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, meet my wonderful sugar-daddy, Martin. Martin, my new friend Cindy.\" Cindy cringed as she took the dainty little hand in hers. \"Pleasure to meet you,\" Martin squeaked in his prepubescent voice, \"Any friend of Sydney's is a friend of mine. Isn't that right, smoochiekins?\" They made tiny little air kisses to themselves before Cindy felt physically uncomfortable sitting around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I really need to go. I've got to meet my husband and, well, the ice-cream's melted so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we need to leave as well,\" Sydney said, \"Me and my hubby have got a little <i>'reacquainting'</i> to do, don't we sugarlumps?\" Cindy heaved, cursing herself for having stocking up on extraneous portions of ice-cream over the past hour or so. Martin hollered at Jacob from inside the pit and it was clear to see the boy was reluctant to go. He stood up and shook off the balls, making Cindy gasp as she observed the overtly female body sat underneath his bucktoothed head. Furthermore judging by the swollen breasts and prominent bulge on his midriff the boy <i>himself</i> was the one carrying the couple's soon-to-be newborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I don't want to know how that happened,</i> Cindy shuddered as the trio walked away, Martin cradled in Sydney's arms while the young Jacob waddled behind rubbing his baby bump. Cindy motioned for Keely to follow her and they both moved away from the place briskly. \"Let's go and find your dad, sweetie,\" Cindy whispered- whether to reassure herself or the child, she wasn't sure- as both of them stepped into the elevator. As they descended Keely laughed to herself,  saying to her stepmother, \"That Jacob kid was so weird. He kept crying about somebody 'kicking' him as we played even though all of the other kids were too much of babies to come near us. He even complained when I tried to touch his belly flab- Daddy told me it's perfectly normal to have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'd use the word <i>'normal',</i> honeybun,\" Cindy chuckled apprehensively as she kissed Keely's cocoa-brown forehead. <i>Let's just hope that things are unexceptional when we get back to the room,</i> she thought as the elevator doors opened to allow an influx of new passengers inside before it continued its journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kenya sighed as she stared at the tiny ripples suffusing through the gentle aquamarine pool water. She stared into the water, her reflection staring back blankly. Her shaved head gleamed in the golden hour light and her muscular frame was coiled up tight into an awkward ball of pensive thought. <i>You know what you told your Dad was right,</i> a disembodied voice in her head whispered to her. It did little to relieve her guilt nonetheless. Fights between her and her Dad weren't a rare occurrence at any rate- well, they hadn't been ever since... She wiped a stray tear with one of her manly paws. No, she was <i>done</i> crying with that memory, she'd shed too many tears thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed uglily as a soft hand came from behind to rest on her shoulder. The fingers were stubby lengths of a burnt umber complexion, adorned by jade rings and trinkets that led to a myriad of multicoloured bangles on the wrist. The pudgy arm leading to it was swathed in a material of bright patterns and intricate weaving indigenous to many West African nations. Kenya turned round and observed the heavyset body and native dress, admiring the figure's buxom body and voluminous curls cascading down their scalp. She examined the person's face, noting the handsome features and light stubble planted atop it. Though the skin of his face was tanned darker than the average Caucasian, there was still quite some contrast between the chocolatey skin around his chin, ears and temple to the forefront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" the matronly voice emerging from his rugged mouth coyly said, \"Mind if I sit here?\" Kenya turned and shook her head- she didn't want this cute guy thinking she was some kind of emotional wreck. The dude huffed as he plumped his mammoth behind on the tiled poolside, dipping his painted nails into the cool water. He flashed her a reassuring smile as he used his dark cankles to force a tiny wave to the other side. They sat in silence for a minute or two before the man finally uttered, \"I'm Drake by the way. Nice to meet you,...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenya stayed silent. Her gaze stayed firmly affixed to the pool. Drake rolled his eyes as he playfully nudged her shoulder. \"Come on, you gotta give me something to work with here,\" he laughed, \"Alright, I'll start: this is my third week working at this joint and I've got to admit, you're the first beautiful girl that I've seen sit here alone and just think.\" Kenya blushed.Drake waved his hands apprehensively as he continued, \"Not to say that's a bad thing! No, I think that it's a good thing that you're here! I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake groaned exasperated, unintentionally eliciting a tiny chuckle from Kenya. \"See, that's better,\" he grinned. He re-positioned his plump physique as he scooched towards her, scolding himself for not wearing a bra whilst he used his hands to rearrange his Brobdingnagian breasts. A light breeze picked up and the inky wisps of his hair rustled in the breeze as he stared wistfully over the hotel grounds below them. \"Sometimes I come here myself, just to remind myself how small and insignificant I am in the wider scheme of things,\" he lamented in his soft Nigerian accent. \"There's something about knowing there's more to life than your own problems that just relaxes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind whooshed quietly as they both sat silently and enjoyed the tranquillity. Suddenly a wry smile stretched across Kenya's face. \"So you think I'm beautiful?\" Drake smiled again. His flabby arm cradled his hip  effeminately as he cocked his head to one side. \"Aha, so she speaks!\" he laughed triumphantly as they both devolved into a momentary fit of giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake held out his palm. \"Let's try this again,\" he said, \"I'm Drake, Drake Adderley, lifeguard and general heartthrob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenya took his small hand into her own and replied, \"Kenya, just Kenya. And why does a hotel and casino need a lifeguard anyway?\" Drake laughed dolefully with a sad smile. \"Let's just say we're more useful than we're given credit for. A lot of people try a lot of stupid things, whether out of ignorance or arrogance, and Mother Nature is one cruel mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about your... <i>size.</i> Wouldn't it be hard for you to jump in and swim to rescue someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, insulting my weight <i>and</i> my life-guarding capabilities?\" They both laughed, Kenya chuckled genuinely for what felt like the first time in a long time. Drake grinned from ear to ear as he gestured at his rotund motherly build. \"Yeah, sometimes the extra mass <i>is</i> a bit of a nuisance but it has it's pros; I can clear space quicker because it's easier to see me in the water, my body's soft enough to cushion the victims bodies and,\" he said as he jumped in the pool with a loud splash and revolved onto his back, \"if I turn round my blubber acts a buoy!\" Kenya giggled heartily as she whipped off her soaked wife-beater and wrung out the chlorinated droplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a jokeman,\" she laughed as he clambered out of the pool. She tossed him a fresh towel as she admired the way the drenched clothing clung to his voluptuous bod. He thanked her before they both sat on one of the benches reserved for the waiting area. He shook his head ferociously, scattering water from his curls in every direction like a dog after having a bath. \"Refreshing,\" he exhaled as he slunk backwards into his seat. \"You have to try it tomorrow when we open up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll check my calendar,\" Kenya remarked. There was a mischievous twinkle in Drake's eye as he said, \"Better make a reservation between twelve-thirty and two. Otherwise you won't be able to see my handsome mug in action on duty.\"  Wistful silver eyes met downcast brown eyes for an extended moment, neither party seeming to be willing to pry theirs away. Kenya shifted apprehensively in her seat, edging closer with her mouth slightly aghast. Just as they seemed to be centimetres from sealing a kiss, Drake suddenly cast his head down leaving them both flustered and embarrassed. Kenya cursed herself for her eagerness while Drake meanwhile twiddled an inky wisp of hair between his ringed fingers nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not rush into anything,\" he spoke in a soothing motherly voice, \"What are you, like sixteen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seventeen, but I'll be eighteen in five months so I'm <i>basically</i> an adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake snorted innocently as he tied his long locks into an impromptu ponytail. He hopped off the bench quickly, staring deep into Kenya's eyes as he said, \"Basically isn't the same as definitely. But who knows, anything can happen in this place. Remember, twelve-thirty to two. Maybe we can talk about why you came here in the first place.\" Drake grinned for the last time, gesturing with his thumb and pinky for her to 'call him' before sashaying away in his open-toed sandal pumps. Once he was completely out of sight Kenya squealed excitedly. Her guilt from before had completely escaped her mind. She sighed as she pictured Drake\u2019s figure in her mind, her phallus throbbing eagerly as he pictured scenarios of them both stealing another intimate moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in another hotel room a few floors up ahead, a slightly aged woman by the name of Mrs Adesina stirred in her bed. She\u2019d taken a quick nap to recover from her long flight and yawned as she rolled out of the linen sheets. She gave a quick kiss to her husband\u2019s forehead before she groggily tiptoed her way to the bathroom, scratching her tanned ballsack idly as she went. The rough stubble on the underneath of her chiselled jaw ended abruptly as it met up with her meaty brown face caked with heavy blush and thick eyeliner. \u201cUgh,\u201d she groaned in a manly Bermudan accent as she scratched her bulging Adam\u2019s apple. She tousled her messy brown hair before reentering the room and lying back next to her sleeping husband, both parties completely oblivious of her strange facial predicament.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy tapped her feet impatiently as she and Keely waited outside the hotel room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd hurried out of the elevator with Keely's hand clasped tightly in her own as they approached the front desk in the lobby. Keely played around with the service bell chime as Cindy swivelled her head round uncertainly. <i>God, please hurry up,</i> Cindy had thought as they stood there. From the corner of her eye she spotted another strange couple huddled closely together, their middle aged heads perched onto the awkward bodies of two gangly teenage girls. Cindy overheard them comparing waxing techniques as they walked away, shuddering as she heard the male of the pair go into a bit too much detail about his hairy buttcrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice had gone slightly hoarse from screaming for help when she heard a disgruntled groan come from an adjoining room behind the desk. She watched as a petite woman stepped out of the creaking door and plopped herself onto the black swivel chair behind the desk, her legs splayed out nonchalantly as she booted up the computer system. <i>Her face seems familiar,</i> Cindy thought, her mind likening her to the pretty blonde desk attendant she'd seen in the same place earlier in the day. However, this petite woman had a grim charcoal-black ombre in place of the other's blonde along with a dark attitude to go with it. Although she still wore the customary hotel staff uniform, more than a few of her shirt buttons had been undone to expose a buxom bra-less chest with a chest tattoo sprawled across it. The woman wore a tight black choker on her slim neck as well as a multitude of skull rings and clunky Velcro Doc Martens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a sharp contrast in demeanour to this woman than Butch. Whereas the cute Frenchwoman had eagerly flashed that perky little smile beforehand, the raven-haired woman at the desk had her black-lipped mouth drawn tight into a bored line that yielded little comfort to Cindy. \"Yes ma'am, you rang?\" the lady brusquely remarked with a surly Brooklyn accent as she idly scratched the silver nose ring slipped through her left nostril. Cindy was normally <i>that</i> type of mother so it was a struggle to hold her tongue and not break into a spontaneous rant like a true Karen. Instead she composed herself and calmly said, \"Sorry to disturb you from whatever you were doing before, but I was told that earlier today my husband and my stepdaughter checked our luggage into our assigned rooms. I was wondering if you could tell me where those are so we can have a little... <i>discussion</i> about our stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed loudly, flicking her dark hair from her piercing blue eyes as she typed in a few commands into the database. \"OK, gimme a second,\" she said as she read a list of information on the screen, \"Alright lady, your rooms are E-25 and E-26 respectively, fifth floor up. Hurry up and you can catch those elevators before those fat little tykes start playing with the buttons again.\" Keely giggled mischievously as she watched two tubby little bastards from inside the glass walled lift begin to jam different buttons all at once, laughing heartily as they did so. Cindy gave the desk attendant a solemn glare. \"Thanks for your assistance,\" she spat, \"I'll be sure to tell your manager how <i>helpful</i> you were Miss...\" She took a quick glance at the woman's nametag. \"...<i>'Cuddles'.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty noirette laughed as Cindy's cheeks flashed bright scarlet- yep, being cursed with a stupid name did have its own silver lining. Cindy snatched the silver key from the woman's glossy black nails before stomping off, Keely waving goodbye to the curt desk attendant. \"Don't let the doors close on you on your way there!\" Cuddles chuckled mischievously as she twiddled the bulky skull on her ring finger. Now back to current time and Cindy was still waiting outside the mahogany door- it seemed like the Master key had been slotted inside the room's scanner and was somehow overriding Cindy's own, much to her annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon! Kenya! Anyone, open up!\" She heard a quiet moan and looked over to Keely who had started hopping from foot-to-foot nervously. <i>Crap, she's gonna explode all over this place in a second,</i> Cindy thought as she banged on the door one last time, cursing herself for letting the little girl coerce her into buying two Deluxe Extra Large SlushyCups from one of the vendors situated near the ball pit. She was content to beat the wood until her knuckles bled when she heard the sound of a shower-head stop abruptly from inside. Following a soft padding of footsteps and distinct click of the latch being pulled open, the door creaked open to reveal the damp seventeen year old form that Cindy recognised as Kenya. Keely, due to her youth and desperate need to relieve herself, didn't even bother to greet the figure and instead pushed her way past their slight frame and scurried towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a handful, I'll tell you that,\" Kenya's velvety voice laughed as Cindy stepped through and splayed backwards onto one of the comfy queen beds. \"You can say that again,\" Cindy agreed as she nestled herself into the soft mattress. She closed her eyes in a vain attempt to process what she'd seen earlier, oblivious to her husband in his daughter's body sidling up to her beside the bed. She exhaled an exasperated sigh as she clutched her temples. Soon she felt the tender touch of dainty fingers massaging her shoulders from behind. She laughed quietly as Damon kneaded out the bundled tension that'd accumulated over the stressful day, his slender digits working over all her usual sore spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feeling better?\" Damon whispered softly. He moved slowly but assertively, slotting his rounded chin into the cradle of her shoulder and breathing quietly as he rubbed. A sensual moan escaped Cindy's lips as she felt her collarbone shift satisfyingly. A gentle nod from her spurred on Damon and he meekly pressed his glossy lips onto her neck. Whilst Cindy appreciated the uncommon TLC her 'daughter' had been giving her, she was still slightly on edge and the kiss finally pushed her over. She quickly squirmed away from the massage, giving Damon a once-over much to his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's wrong honey?\" Cindy shook her head apprehensively as Damon continued, \"Did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, no, no, no...</i> she thought as she backed away. Damon stepped forward cautiously, raising his milky nails upwards in an innocently inquisitive manner. \"No, stay back!\" she screeched as her back pressed against one of the white walls, unintentionally causing a scenic painting of a sunset to come careening downwards. She noticed how Kenya's (or whomever was currently piloting her body's) eyes seemed to look increasingly more alarmed and concerned. \"You don't seem to be yourself right now, Cind. Let's see if there's a doctor on the resort, get you checked out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Cindy roared as she threw the nearest object directly at her stepdaughter's body (unfortunately it was just a pair of balled up socks but the thought still counts, right?). Damon momentarily stopped as the socks bounced off one of his breasts harmlessly. \"Fine, I'll stay back but you still... you still need...\" Cindy's mouth gaped as she watched the impostor's eyes roll up into their head before crashing haphazardly onto the carpet below. Suddenly she began to notice a green fog beginning to suffuse across the room, feeling her body go limp as she inhaled its noxious odour. She groaned as her legs collapsed, leaving her in an awkward bundle on the floor. Before she blacked out she thought she saw a ghostly apparition of the dark-haired desk attendant with her bright blue eyes obscured by a bulky gas mask. The figure waved menacingly as her vision turned completely dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery for one Lawson Swanson!\" The Doctor groaned as he watched Cuddles wheel in a three-tiered dumbwaiter with a thick shawl barely obscuring the lopsided bodies hidden underneath. He harrumphed effeminately as he carefully lowered his disposable face mask and curled his rosy lips into an exasperated frown. \"Can't you see I'm in the middle of something,\" he sighed as he gestured his creamy nails towards the two figures laid on the gurneys in front of him. On the left was what Cuddles assumed was a fairly affluent male judging by his expensive slacks, shoes and lavish cologne. On the other was a fairly pretty woman that would've looked a great of a deal better had it not been for her extravagantly bloated facial features and other assorted augmentations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's hard enough to work in these conditions as it is,\"</i> he muttered quietly in German as he deftly sliced off the sinews connecting the woman's augmented breasts to her chest. Cuddles rolled her eyes sarcastically, making a great deal of admiring her painted nails as she bluntly stated, \"Sorry Doc, just delivering orders straight from the Boss. Said these ones were of <i>'highest priority'.</i>\" Lawson scoffed, flicking his brunette hair out from his eyes as he lifted the flabby breast tissue onto a disinfected cloth on the table beside them. <i>Highest priority my arse,</i> he thought as he slipped off the nitrile gloves and disposed of them in a bin beside his feet. For someone who didn't do the procedures themself, Ms Deverne sure had a lot of nerve to impose her will on him whenever she felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But she's still the one that pays the bills,</i> he smirked as he studied the bodies of Damon, Cindy and Keely. \"What'cha thinking, Doc?\" Cuddles called out as the Doctor tenderly caressed their sleeping forms. His bewitching features relaxed into a perverted grin as he said, \"My dear girl, I think I'm in the mood today to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cuddles looked bewildered as the Doctor carefully wiped down his stainless tools with an old washcloth coated by antibacterial solution. \"Why not do something to the kid, Doc,\" she asked as he manoeuvred the tables to slot in the gurney's holding Damon and Cindy's sleeping forms, \"You've never struck me as someone that discriminates his victims by what age they are (or seem to be after their ops).\" The Doctor smirked slyly as he flicked the extraneous liquid away from the top of a dark needle. He deftly injected the anaesthetic into the small cannulas inserted into the duo's arms with soft pushes of his slender fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>'Subjects',</i> not victims.\" Cuddles rolled her eyes sarcastically as the doctor pulled on a fresh set of gloves and began his work on Cindy's motherly body. Though the middle-aged woman couldn't be definitively classified into the MILF category or the less than pleasant soccer mom category, she still possessed an attractive charm despite the occasional flab deposit on her motherly body. Cuddles strode forwards and hopped backwards on a black swivel chair by the staircase, pushing the seat closer to Swanson with her beaten black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly observed as the Doctor used a dainty finger to trace the portions along Cindy's body where he would cut down, unwillingly admiring how the man was able to perfectly picture the forms in his mind and plan what he would do instantaneously. He unscrewed the lid of a tub sat on the tabletop and dipped his gloved fingers inside- there was a sickening squelch as he collected a large amount of the iridescent goop inside and slathered it onto the edge of a sharp tenon saw. The Doctor finally hoisted it up and began his work, slowly but firmly pressing the blade against Cindy's pale neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuddles swivelled round quickly as the sickening sound of bones being severed echoed throughout the dark room. Her eyes began to scan the assorted trophies placed on the Doctor's shelves whilst she fought the urge to heave-  though she wouldn't have admitted it, the experiments had always had an adverse effect on her stomach and she'd always felt uneasy around the lab. Swanson chuckled sardonically as he listened to her gag, joking, \"Feeling nauseous over there,Cuddles? I might have to bring your sister in to console you.\" Cuddles turned round and scowled murderously at the laughing Doctor. It was bad enough that she felt squeamish around the surgical procedures, but what disgusted her more was the fact that her ditzy doppelganger, Butch, seemed to have an uncanny indifference to all the blood and gore. Cuddles had mentioned this as a point of contention multiple times but her counterpart just shrugged it off absentmindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuddles snapped back to reality as the Doctor finished slicing off Cindy's head, her pretty face falling to the stainless bed with a light thud. Though there was still a steady trickle of blood seeping out of the base of her neck, her head inexplicably continued her passive exhalations despite its disembodiment. The Doctor spent little time admiring his work, wiping a bead of sweat pooling on his plucked eyebrow as he turned to the other woman. \"Cuddles, pardon my rudeness, but can you please use one of those gauze sponges to clean up Mrs Holden's leak?\" Though the idea of coming anywhere in the vicinity of the Doctor's test subjects revolted her, she plastered on a disingenuous smile as she picked up the damp sponges and came forward. She wiped the glimmering rim of Cindy's head hesitantly with one of her eye-lined eyes closed impishly. Cindy's facial features shifted uncomfortably as she felt a strange tickling but she didn't stir awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Doctor Swanson had finished with the other female and he grasped the woman's bloated face in his dainty hands as he walked towards Cindy's disembodied body. He applied another layer of the goop before cautiously screwing on the woman's head downwards, smiling as both parts synced together with a wet squelch. Cuddles handed Cindy's head over to the Doctor and he repeated the same on the woman's curvaceous body. \"Just a few minor amendments,\" the doctor giggled melodically as he picked up a scalpel and began deftly slicing out the woman's synthetic implants. He took a large hypodermic needle and gently sucked out the excess fat from Cindy's former body. He smiled as he carefully injected the excess tissue into the places where he'd just taken out the enhancements, Cindy's new rump and bust inflating slowly as he pushed down the hilt of the syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuddles nodded with reluctant approbation as she surveyed the svelte body underneath the cute mother's head: her pale skin contrasted slightly with the tanned complexion of the rest of her body. Her new figure was supple and curvy despite its small frame and possessed a toned stomach from countless hours spent doing core workouts in the gym. She noted a rebellious black rose inked across the lush outside of her right thigh and smirked in envious regard. She stood cross-armed as the Doctor scrawled down the changes in a small black pocket book. She watched as the Doctor tapped the nub of his pen against his cute mouth as he analysed his work with a stern unbiased glare. \"Vertical cut on the thyroid cartilage slightly sloppy,\" he mumbled as he reminisced, \"But seems to have not greatly impact the success of the procedure. All in all, pretty rudimentary surgical operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a sly grin Cuddles' way, laughing as the young woman huffed angrily and adjusted her chafing cleavage. \"<i>'Rudimentary'?</i>Is that secret scientist talk for lazy,\" she scoffed as she blew a stray lock of black hair from her bored blue eyes. Doctor Swanson chuckled playfully as he lifted another syringe from his surgical paraphernalia. He measured out four equal proportions and moved his way around the room, first to the businessman then and swapped  cosmetic connoisseur before inserting the final doses to Keely and Cindy. He gently removed the long needle from Cindy's scalp, smiling knowingly as he used a creamy nail to activate the foursome's mental regulation chips. He commandeered Cuddles' seat and spun towards his technologically advanced computer setup. His digits whizzed around the keyboard as he input new programmes and protocols into the nanotechnology's processing units.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, he installed neural inhibitors that restricted them from accessing their outdated memories. Numbers and text flashed past his silver eyes as he made it so they would all accept their new reality and their minds would warp around it. However, he implemented a mischievous string of code into Keely's chip so that, though she'd still be unable to tell that something was strange with her family's 'conditions', she'd still retain a small portion of her old memories and be uneasy with the rest of her family's new appearances. Cuddles grinned as she read the line of code specially reserved for Keely. \"Nicely done, Doc,\" she muttered, \"But if you'd scooch over, I'd show you some <i>real</i> carnage.\" The Doctor made way for the eager goth, a smile rising as he watched her code some 'interesting' personality changes to the Holden partners and the wealthy couple. Cuddles grinned as she pushed down the 'enter' key- there was sure to be a considerable change once the Doctor roused them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've been practising your coding outside of our lessons,\" Swanson remarked. Cuddles looked away as she blushed slightly, telling herself to pack it in to maintain her pride. \"Yeah, of course,\" she awkwardly replied after clearing her throat loudly, \"What else was I supposed to do during my breaks, listen to that airhead Butch talk about her favourite type of hair conditioner? Pfft, no way.\" The Doctor held his arms up in innocence, a coy laugh twitching at the corner of his rosy mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh!,\" she spat. \"You know what Doc, one day when your old ass keels over and you get buried in some unmarked grave off the side of a highway, I'm gonna be <i>here,</i> in this lab, performing my own experiments and doing a way f*cking better job than you ever have, could or would've ever done!\" There was an admirable twinkle in Swanson's eyes as he replied, \"I hope you do, Miss Cuddles. I hope you do.\" The nose-ringed attendant stomped her feet in frustration as she bolted up the dark staircase, her head buzzing with both a jealous rage and a satisfying sense of relief. The Doctor shook his head wryly. <i>That girl is a handful,</i> he thought to himself as he played with the silver hoop dangling from his earlobe. He swivelled back round to the rich couple, picking up a scalpel as he proceeded to finish his modifications from earlier before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy groaned quietly as she regained consciousness. Her eyelids fluttered slightly as she stirred, her silvery-blue eyes taking in the scene in front of her as she sat up. The warm decor of the room around her seemed artificially hospitable, the various posters and mint walls designed to bombard one with subliminal messages to stay relaxed. She pushed against the soft mattress with her tanned palms and groggily sat up, her eyes blurring slightly as she came face to face with a very attractive womanly figure in a lab coat. <i>Mamacita,</i> she thought, biting her lip as she surveyed the doctor's cute figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mrs Holden, welcome back to the world,\" the scintillating voice emanating from the woman's creamy lips said. Before Cindy had an opportunity to return a witty quip about blackouts, she heard an excited whimper erupt from the chair beside her before a slender pair of chocolatey arms wrapped around her neck and enveloped her. She was helpless to stop the barrage of kisses that rained down onto her lips, forehead and general face. \"Babe, it's <i>fine</i>, I'm fine!\" She pushed away her husband's feminine form just as it seemed he was about to make love to her right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, puddin',\" Damon whimpered uncharacteristically as he wiped his bleary eyes (accidentally smudging his previously applied black eyeliner), \"But you really had me scared for a couple moments there!\" Cindy studied her devoted husband's face and noticed black streaks had trickled down from his cheeks from his crying. <i>How does he always know how to look like a snack even when he's upset,</i> Cindy smiled to herself as she pulled him in close, putting his sobbing face on her shoulder so she could smush his pert C-cups against her own bust. \"It's all good baby, I'm still here,\" she said as her dainty fingers gently caressed his back. He gradually began to lower them towards Damon's juicy behind, squeezing it playfully and eliciting a small giggle from Damon. \"Ooh, cheeky,\" he laughed as he pushed his black locs out of his dark brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy turned back to the attractive doctor. She dutifully observed as they rose from their chair and strode across to her side, their succulent hips swaying sensually in their ripped blue jeans. \"Hi there Mrs Holden,\" she said as she crouched down beside Cindy, \"My name's Dr. Swan but you and your husband can call me Lena. I'm your resident medical professional at the Hotel. Sorry to disturb you so soon after you wake up, but I need to conduct a few tests before I can let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do whatever feels right to me whenever you want to, <i>Lena,</i>\" Cindy winked as the Doctor pressed down gently on her toned stomach. A devious smile stretched over the Doctor's face as she asked Cindy to take in a few deep gulps s and exhale. Whilst she did this she could feel Damon's soft hands clutching her own tenderly. Cindy's eyes flitted round and she made out Keely sitting right near the back of the room with her eyes wide and body clutched tightly. \"You okay, little buddy?\" Cindy called out as the Doctor slotted a cold otoscope into her ear canal. The little girl nodded uneasily. Cindy watched as her expression changed from confusion to disbelief and then confusion again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Weird kid,\"</i> she muttered before Dr Swan used a tongue depressor to suppress her speech. As the Doctor flicked on a small handheld flashlight and used it to illuminate Cindy's irises, a loud crash suddenly sounded as a burly musclebound figure stormed into the room. \"I am... <i>so</i> sorry... I came... as fast as I could...\" The figure collapsed beside Keely- making the thirteen-year-old squeal anxiously- and began panting heavily. Damon rolled his eyes as he walked to console the lumbering giant. \"Calm down Kenya,\" he whispered softly, \"You haven't missed much. Doctor Swan's just in the middle of examining your Stepmum.\" The teenager's intimidating figure relaxed and breathed a sigh of relief. Cindy laughed as she wiped off a bead of sweat coming down from her shaven head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now follow my finger ma'am,\" the Doctor said as she raised a slender digit up to Cindy's face and watched as the middle-aged woman's head's movements corresponded. Satisfied, the Doctor grinned as she put her hands back into the front pockets of her jeans.\"I'm happy to say that you are in perfect health from what I can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy scoffed sarcastically as she replied, \"Are you sure Doc, 'cause I'm feeling a little tender right between my thighs. If you could just duck your head down a little and check it out...\" Doctor Swan chuckled heartily, flicking her brunette hair to expose a couple silver hoops as Damon punched her with kittenish quality. Cindy feigned hurt as she said, \"Just kidding babe, geez, give a woman some faith. Pardon my questioning Lena, but how did I get here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what your husband tells me, you experienced a brief period of psychosis when you entered your daughters' hotel room. He said you started yelling at him to stay back, throwing clothes at him and scaring the life out of him before you backed into a wall where you caused one of our paintings to fall on your head.\" Cindy's mind was perplexed- in some deep crevice stashed at the back of her consciousness she distinctly remembered the painting crashing beside her instead of on her. <i>Eh, must've been the concussion,</i> she thought as she rubbed her blonde scalp. Unbeknown to her, the MRC (also known as the 'mental regulation chip') was working overtime, fervently chopping and rerouting her neural pathways to make her accept her new memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled mischievously as he watched Cindy's expression soften, the new reality firmly implemented into her psyche. He watched as Damon nuzzled close to his wife's side, effeminately stroking her face as he said, \"It's fine though, honeykins, no-one was hurt and we brought you straight over to get your head checked out.\" Cindy nodded warily, her befuddled mindset making way for boredom instead. She pulled off the duvet and stood shakily on her toned new legs, exposing a well upholstered butt through the untied back of a revealing dressing gown to a blushing Damon accidentally, before saying, \"Thanks for hospitality Miss Lena, but me and my family have other places to be and other wonders to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you completely Mrs Holden. Normally the resort has a protocol to keep concussion patients in for a mandatory night's rest but I'm more than willing to pass you into your husband's doting care. Oh! Sorry, I nearly forgot, here's a voucher for \u00a3500 worth of free currency to spend at our casino! We hope that it makes up for any inconvenience you've suffered. Feel free to pop in any time, maybe after your Dinner if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was enamoured with the prospect of testing her luck as she gazed at the crimson and black insignia but the mention of dinner piqued her curiosity. \"Dinner,\" she said, \"Wait, what time is it?\" Kenya pulled out her phone from a pocket and handed it over. The digits <i>'18:37'</i> flashed in luminescent blue letters on the screen. <i>God, I must've been absolutely clattered,</i> she thought. She tied the behind of her gown before clutching Damon's slim shoulders for support. \"Thanks again Doc. Might have to hit my head again so we can get reacquainted sometime...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor laughed sardonically as he ushered the foursome out of her office, locking the door as the last of them left. He breathed in the fresh fragrance of the potted plant he'd placed by his desktop monitor as he closed down the phoney examination form. A moment later and the moving images of the Holdens returning to their rooms filled his screen. He chuckled as he kicked up his chunky heeled pumps and interlaced his dainty fingers behind his head. <i>'Ah, nothing like a successful batch of changes to unwitting subjects,'</i> the Doctor mused before discarding the nametag with <i>'Lena Swan'</i> emblazoned onto the white background into one of his lab coat pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick press of a button and the feed changed over to a young businessman stirring beside the promiscuous escort he'd solicited a meagre amount of hours prior. He observed the man as he slowly stretched out his arms and rolled out of the bed. <i>Why is it always the bathroom they go into first,</i> he remarked as the man stumbled his way into the toilet, scratching his motherly hips with coarse knuckles as he went inside. Meanwhile, the woman sleeping beside him had also awoken and had begun to start dressing herself again. The Doctor sat silently as the woman pulled a lacy thong up her hairy thighs. She struggled to pull it over her engorged equipment however and her slightly stubby fingers fought to push down the raging beast. Eventually she gave up and tossed them onto the bed, opting to go commando as she pulled a revealing top over her flat chest and flabby midriff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither party was none the wiser at their predicaments and the Doctor revelled in the dramatic irony of it all. A dainty hand moved to his now moist nether regions and he whimpered unapologetically as he fingered himself to both monitors. The beady eyes of an innocent cat poster with the caption <i>'Sunshine is the Best Medicine!'</i> watched intently as Swanson pleasured himself, the gradually increasing moans muffled to the outside world by the insulation covering the doorframe.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"F*ck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon swore under his breath as he looked at the jagged line racing down his face from the black eyeliner he\u2019d been applying. He ripped off a couple tissues and dabbed the smudge away in the reflection of the bathroom mirror. He applied a new layer and grinned genuinely as he stared at his reflection. <i>Looking sexy there, Damon,</i> he mused as he blew a sultry kiss to himself with his glossed lips. He turned slowly to admire his curvy form: he was accustomed to Cindy\u2019s wandering eyes (in his new reality at least) and he wanted to make sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to take her eyes off his skintight bodycon dress, strappy roman heels and golden door-knocker earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at the way his C-cup cleavage peeked out of the floral-print dress\u2019 boob window. He winced slightly as he cupped his bust and moved his erect nipples into a more comfortable position- the chafing fabric was more flashy than practical on his bra-less bust but alas, that was the price for beauty. He was again jolted by a noise from outside the open bathroom door. He growled unwomanly as he peered outside, the door creaking slightly as he observed the complete decimation of the hotel room with bags tossed haphazardly and clothes strewn over the perfume stained carpet. Damon watched in shocked silence as a frenzied Cindy furiously discarded items of clothes over her shoulder, her pretty blonde face screwed up in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, baby,\u201d Damon said softly as he quietly clacked his way to Cindy\u2019s side. He moved tentatively to place his hand on her shoulder when Cindy swivelled round and bared her teeth angrily. Damon squealed and jumped backwards. Unfortunately for him, a balled up sundress thrown to the side had caught underneath one of his stilettos, leaving him helpless as he crashed downwards. <i>Ow...</i> Damon whimpered as he felt the air get knocked out of his lungs. Cindy paid little attention to him however, her interest more focused on the beaten hoodie clasped in her right hand. \u201cYou ok, babe?\u201d she asked nonchalantly, barely glancing at Damon as he slowly picked himself up and brushed down his straightened black hair. \u201cJust <i>peachy,</i>\u201d Damon snarked with his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Damon\u2019s sarcasm, Cindy cursed under her breath as she collapsed onto the floor out of exasperation. Damon rolled his eyes before sliding onto the ground beside her and nestled his cute face onto her shoulder. Cindy sighed deeply as she cradled her husband closer, kissing his forehead gently before whispering, \"I don't get it. Why should we have to dress up for dinner when all we're gonna do is go into a packed room of strangers that are more concerned with what they're ordering than what we turn up in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon chuckled wryly as he felt Cindy's slender fingers stroking her dark mane. \"Oh,sugarlumps,\" he said as he booped his spouse\u2019s nose affectionately, \u201cIs my <i>big, strong</i> wife feeling self-conscious about dressing up for dinner?\u201d Cindy scowled as she pulled out a skimpy red cocktail dress from a pile beside her. \u201cLook at this,\u201d she whined as she gestured towards it, \u201cThis barely even covers <i>half</i> of my entire body! I\u2019ll look like a bloody faggot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon pressed a finger to her lips and replied, \u201cLanguage. We don\u2019t want the girls to hear you say something like that. Anyways, I think a skimpy dress like that makes you look sexy as hell\u2026\u201d Cindy grinned as Damon leaned in sultrily, their lips locking into a brief but meaningful kiss. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d look good in a garbage bag with a paper bag over my head,\u201d Cindy mumbled but there was a reluctant smile on her lips. She slowly pushed herself upwards, mischievously sneaking in a subtle grope of Damon\u2019s juicy arse, before she grabbed a dress from the floor and sprinted into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, babe,\u201d Damon laughed as he looked down at his phone screen: <b>\u201920:17\u2019</b>. <i>Cutting it mighty close,</i> he thought to himself. <i>But I didn\u2019t spend almost two hours undoing my braids just to look slightly pretty.</i> Soon Damon heard the telltale squeak of the door opening and gaped in awe as Cindy stepped out in a beautiful sandy gold satin dress that was the perfect moderation of skimpy and suave. The neckline plunged deep, down from her tanned collarbone to her muscular midriff, allowing most of the mass of her buxom E-cups to spill out whilst keeping her nips tucked safely inside. Damon\u2019s leering eyes scanned downwards and he noted Cindy\u2019s slender legs leading to sock-less toes encased in translucent block heels. Cindy clutched her hands behind her back boyishly, her stance awkward, impish and uncharacteristic to the unapologetic braggadocio that Damon was (programmed to be) accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, my wife has finally become a woman!\u201d Damon giggled effeminately as he twirled Cindy around in a neat pirouette. Cindy blew a stray blonde lock that\u2019d fallen into her face as Damon continued,\u201dMy, my, you clean up well Cindy.\u201d Cindy coughed to hide her blushing cheeks. \u201cErm, well, me doing this, it\u2019s only temporary. I\u2019m just gonna do it tonight for your sake and tomorrow I\u2019ll hit up the hotel gift shop and buy something less... <i>revealing.</i>\u201c Damon giggled girlishly and planted a wet kiss on Cindy\u2019s rosy cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask, baby.\u201d A surly look flashed over Cindy\u2019s face and she brought Damon in closer to herself, her white nails curled affectionately around her smaller husband as they walked together into the girls\u2019 adjoining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Kenya snapped as she stared at her phone. The compassionate, regretful and pensive husk she\u2019d displayed mere hours before had been shed and her hollower, egotistical inner persona had re-emerged much to Cindy\u2019s dismay. She\u2019d chosen to wear an elegant yet casual pairing of a classic white dress shirt and black slacks along with a smart grey fedora to cover the reflection of her waxy head. Unbeknownst to the Holden parents she\u2019d already sent a stream of pictures of her in her attire (and some without, dare I say) to the cute lifeguard she\u2019d met earlier in the day. She was currently enjoying the handful of pictures he\u2019d returned of him lounging handsomely with his curvaceous black body in a silk nightgown and his mismatched face set into an attractive smile that made her middle-aged nutsack churn with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeely meanwhile had perched herself innocently on the edge of her queen bed. Her dark plimsolls swung in the air as the pigtailed, bucktoothed girl in her frilly black dress watched her family with quiet curiosity. Cindy noticed the girl staring slightly and self-consciously moved to cover up her exposed pieces of skin to Damon\u2019s chagrin. \u201cKeely, stop staring at your beautiful mother,\u201d he reproached the child, \u201cAnd you, compliment your mother on how wonderful she looks tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenya sighed. \u201cI guess if I was into other girls that <i>weren\u2019t </i>my Stepmum, I\u2019d think you looked moderately attractive to mate with.\u201d Damon jabbed her in the ribs. \u201c...I mean, I\u2019d totally smash you because you look very dateable and, pretty and... cute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy flashed Kenya a big smile as she moved in to hug her hulking form. \u201cThank you, hon, I know that took a lot.\u201d Kenya pushed her off slowly and backed away to the exit- that was enough for the shows of affections tonight. Cindy chuckled slightly as she walked to the door, opened it and gestured for the rest of the family to go through. She winked as she said, \u201cLadies first...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Men just before!\u201d Damon interjected as he sashayed out of the room confidently whilst sliding his fashionable faux fur coat onto his elbows like a wealthy aristocrat. Cindy bit her lip lustfully as she observed the way her husband\u2019s young butt jiggled in the tight dress- the things she fantasied she would do to that thing tonight were too graphic and lengthy to list at this moment but know, reader, that there was nothing pleasant to say in front of one\u2019s parents. As the children walked out after Damon, Cindy followed behind, closing the door behind her and smiling as she heard the satisfying click of the lock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A mischievous smile was set on Kenya\u2019s face as she and her father waited for Cindy and Keely to return. The lobby was still bustling with people and she could sense that Damon was getting a bit claustrophobic from the swathes of people going about their business around him. She listened to him sigh whilst he drummed impatiently on the side of his suitcase, an early sign that his patience was starting to wear thin. Kenya herself wasn\u2019t discomforted in the slightest- she\u2019d already slipped in her AirPods and put on one of her playlists. She closed her eyes as the scintillating piano intro of Chance the Rapper\u2019s <i>\u2018Nostalgia\u2019</i> came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon meanwhile was feeling a lot less content to sit around and wait. Cindy and Keely had taken a lot longer than anticipated and he was worried they\u2019d miss the evening he\u2019d planned to diffuse the family\u2019s tensions. He looked back over to Kenya. There was an eerie indifference to her behaviour as she hopped her head to the music. She seemed almost <i>pleased</i> by the others omission as she leaned against a marble pillar and idly rifled through her phone. Damon rolled his eyes. This trip was supposed to bring them together as a family, not separate them in this strange new environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled politely and moved out of the way for an elderly couple to pass them by, even holding the door for them to walk out. He scoffed as Kenya didn\u2019t even bother to step aside, her black locs still bobbing up and down as she reached the climax of the song. He mumbled something as he excused himself to go to the bathroom. Kenya shrugged. She could care less about her dad having a fit. She looked back to her phone screen and bit her nail seductively as a muscular figure with mixed skin and a bushy Afro popped up. <i>\u2018Don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d</i> she giggled to herself as she sent an intentionally flirty DM to him. Though he seemed slightly more mature for her age-wise, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first older guy she\u2019d secretly contacted behind her Dad\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more minutes passed and even Kenya was tiring of waiting about. She popped her Air Pods back into their case and crossed her arms in boredom. One of her favourite pastimes back with her girls in school was critiquing the appearances of those around her as they walked by. With no other alternatives she decided to try it out now. She held her nose high as she surveyed all the passersby going past her. <i>Ugly, ugly, ugh... uber ugly...</i> She stifled a giggle as she watched a reasonably above-average woman walk by wearing a bland, stained wife-beater, frumpy khaki shorts with an equally as horrible socks and sandals combo. Kenya held in a gag as she watched the woman rummage deep into her underwear before pull her hand out and sniffing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a tramp,\u201d she muttered to herself as the woman went into the next room. Kenya considered herself as somewhat of a fashion aficionado she knew in her eyes that whoever picked out the woman\u2019s wardrobe deserved to be shot. She rolled her eyes and thought, <i>Seriously, doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort to NOT look f*cking homeless. God, invest in some new clothes, buy some jeans at least.</i> She was no authority on clothing but she still expected others to have some shred of decency, to put some consideration into how they came across, to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Look like her,\u2019</i> she said to herself as she watched a shapely woman come into view. The woman was a bit on the heavier side but used her extra weight to her advantage and fill the area around her hips and waist of her tight black cocktail dress. Kenya noted the pointed black stilettos that clacked as she strode on, making a mental note to order the same pair for herself later. She even admired the painted acrylic nails on her fingers that curled around a pretty tote bag in their clutches. \u201cNow <i>that\u2019s</i> a woman,\u201d Kenya remarked. She carried on making observations as the woman came closer towards the help desk. As the lady placed her card and bag on the front desk Kenya couldn\u2019t help but mentally weigh up herself against her. The woman noticed Kenya\u2019s staring and turned towards her, angling her body in a way that perfectly exposed her buxom assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Kenya didn\u2019t personally have a taste for the female specimen but she could understand why many other people could be left practically foaming at the mouth by her. Kenya picked up her dropped jaw and tried to make a proper introduction. \u201cSorry for my gaping, it\u2019s just... you\u2019re so...\u201d The woman giggled. There was something strange with the way it sounded, like it came from her mouth but wasn\u2019t natural to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie, I get it all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might\u2019ve just been her ears but she could\u2019ve sworn a distinctly masculine voice emanate from her lips. She\u2019d expected a sensuous, possibly matronly voice but instead got a crude growling that she\u2019d assumed would\u2019ve come from a lifelong smoker. Kenya did a double take and noticed a small protrusion on the woman\u2019s neck. <i>An Adam\u2019s apple?,</i> she thought. Kenya reasoned that the lady might\u2019ve transitioned prior but a gut feeling told her that something was amiss. \u201cS-sorry anyhow. Erm, you know what excuse me,\u201d she mumbled as she turned to leave. But as she did so she felt a soft hand gently grasp her wrist. \u201cSorry I made you uncomfortable, stupid me, didn\u2019t even make an introduction.\u201d The woman let go of Kenya\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cName\u2019s Nathan. Hope it\u2019s not too much to ask, but how on Earth do you get your hair like that? My boys keep teasing me \u2018cause I\u2019ve been trying for ages to get someone to braid mine like yours and, I know it\u2019s kind of weird to ask, but can you please help a lad out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, s-sorry but you\u2019ve completely spooked me out.\u201d Her eyes were on stalks as she retreated from the woman, no, the man, no, wo-man? Whatever, all in all she was getting a bit too freaked out to understand what was going on. <i>Please, someone, come and bail me out of this,</i> she prayed as she looked to her phone for a miraculous interruption. Lo and behold, by some mighty stroke of luck, she heard Keely\u2019s familiar voice say, \u201cKenya, hey.\u201d She breathed a sigh of relief. Kenya turned round to thank her for saving her from an awkward situation when she saw that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cComing through, you old fart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon ducked to the side as a rowdy group of skaters fumbled into the hotel foyer. If he\u2019d reacted a second slower he probably would\u2019ve been flattened underneath one of their wheels. He\u2019d lost his footing in the process and he watched as the group circled round him, laughing all the way. Damon was about to curse them out before he realised something was amiss about them. As they stopped and stared down at him he took a quick double take of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the left was a little girl, definitely not a teenager but no less than eight-years-old, with a missing tooth and a mischievous grin. What was strange about her was that she had a large V cut into her wispy brown hair, a classic sign of male pattern baldness that Damon had recognised from some of his older coworkers. Not only was her receding hairline out of place- no, inside the dark Thrasher T-shirt she wore were a pair of engorged D-cups that distorted the fabric around her lactating nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman on the right however looked a tad more \u2018normal\u2019 in the sense that her features were more befitting for her. She had dark olive skin and beady eyes with close cropped hair and a hint of stubble on her chin. Though she was quite heavyset and lugged around a fair amount of weight on her, her chest was remarkably flat and a thick mat of hair peeked out through the top of her tank top. Damon couldn\u2019t be completely certain as he\u2019d only seen from a single glance but he\u2019d seen a slight bulge in the front of her baggy jogging bottoms that he sincerely hoped was her phone inside the lining of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the middle came his biggest shock. For there stood a wrinkled old prune of a man with rickety knees, sunken features and a noticeable hunched back that brought his face nearer to Damon. Scattered across his face were an assortment of different piercings and tattoos; there, beneath his left eye, was a dainty black raindrop, across his forehead ran a jagged barbed wire fence and in his nose was a fat door-knocker that looked like it\u2019d come straight from the snout of a prize bull. Another strange addition were the pair of vibrant blue pigtails that twirled lazily as he craned his neck to stare down at Damon. Despite the man\u2019s apparent age, there was a playful burning in his eyes that sparked with life that made Damon shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth grandad chuckled as he gestured for his \u2018posse\u2019 to follow him. He expertly flicked his board up and pushed his board forward mongo, putting his weathered fingers into a pair of stereotypical skater hand-horns. His cohorts followed soon after, heckling Damon mercilessly as they rode by and flipping him the bird for good measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBunch of hoodlums...,\u201d Damon muttered as he levered himself upwards. No one heard him though or at least no one cared much that he\u2019d been bowled over. The majority of the guests in the lobby seemed unperturbed by the incident and waved it off like it was a regular occurrence that they\u2019d all begrudgingly become accustomed to. Kenya had been too engrossed in her phone to bat an eyelash at them and even the blonde desk clerk been preoccupied with the next set of guests, working diligently albeit with a strange smile on her lips. Damon rubbed his back tenderly- yes, he\u2019d taken a slight bump on his way down but it\u2019d mainly been his pride bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there was something amiss with that trio, something about them that was inherently wrong to Damon. He just prayed that Cindy came back before anything else happened so he could regain a sense of normalcy and get into the holiday festivities.</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s try and find you some more options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, how about a <i><b>THIRD (technically fourth but who\u2019s counting?)</b></i> instalment of my personal favourite <i>\u2018Literal Trait Thieves\u2019</i> series? Whether you start with the original group, the  new group or an entirely unique collection of Thieves is up to you, the reader!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about this? Ok, a mysterious artifact is discovered by one of the hotel patrons that they use to spread confusion, discombobulation &amp; total and utter chaos. The swaps, morphs and/or other changes can be used specifically or act completely uncontrollably. Again, it\u2019s completely up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no? Geez, you\u2019re a hard one to please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, ok, let me think for a second... Erm, ok, this one may seem insensitive considering the situation we\u2019re currently facing so I apologise in advance, this is an idea I\u2019ve had for a while and it\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s coming at this time. But what if there\u2019s some kind of contagion that spreads through the hotel that causes either random changes to guests or even a single uniform change that mutates them all into genetic clones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot into that? Fair, I\u2019m just throwing up ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat else? Maybe an extraterrestrial visitor comes to hide in the hotel and maybe assimilate a few more followers into their horde. Along with the basic trait theft powers, one could include tales of possession, body hopping or possibly showcase any other abilities that an alien visitor might possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan\u2019t be satisfied? Screw it, reader\u2019s choice.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Good afternoon ladies, gentleman and the wider spectrum of humanity. I'm your host, <b>P-Two-Three-Four</b>, and I'm back with a new story that might interest you or might not. However you may perceive it I still hope you can appreciate the effort put into it. This isn't necessarily in the same continuity <i>[hint, I said continuity and NOT canon]</i> as my <i>'Trait Theft'</i> series but you may find a familiar face popping up here or there. As always, there are no major rules to go over. My only nit-pick is that <b>if you make a short choice chapter, do not make the subsequent chapters just other choices.</b> And, as always, <b>have fun!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(PS. Stay safe for those reading this in lockdown.) </i><br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly overnight, a previously unheard of hotel chain had become the most talked about venue to wine, dine and party in London. Bachelors, families, influencers and celebrities alike had flocked to see what spectacles the place could offer. Little did they know that the hotel was run by an obscure egomaniac with a penchant for chaos the likes the world has never seen. Now they're not just gambling for personal profit- they're gambling with their very lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's out of the way, let's get onto some characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>MS. DEVERNE:</b> very little is known about the owner of the eponymous hotel. While it's known she has a lot of economic resources at her disposal, there is scarce knowledge about how she acquired them. While she's mostly been identified as an infamously beautiful woman of average height with straight raven hair, large DD-cups and supple figure, rumours persist of her changing forms at will in order to seduce, confuse or confer with the residents. Whether these rumours are baseless or not, the mystery shrouding her and her hotel makes her a very unpredictable person indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DR. LAWSON SWANSON:</b> perverted and partially psychotic, this ostracized surgeon fled from America after grafting a child's head onto his mother's body in a twisted attempt to cure the boy's terminal illness. Since then he's come into Ms Deverne's employ and begun conducting <i>'experiments'</i> on some unfortunate visitors. One of his first successful operations was to put his own mind into the body of a beautiful Bavarian model. He can be frequently spotted wearing tight clothing- underneath a professional white lab coat- to accentuate his svelte, female body. <i>( if you want to have an example of his appearance, look at <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://img.ltwebstatic.com/images2_pi/2019/06/26/15615386472136747834_thumbnail_600x799.webp\" target=\"_blank\">https://img.ltwebstatic.com/images2_pi/2019/06/26/15615386472136747834_thumbnail...</a> )</i><br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore characters to be added later on. If you have any additions or amendments you would like just send me an email on my writing account. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's get into the story!</td>",
