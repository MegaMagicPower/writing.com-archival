Unfortunately, it seemed that he was wide awake now. He grumpily sat up and climbed out of bed. Deciding to make the most of the situation, he headed to the bathroom to get a shower before either of his sisters got a chance to use up all the hot water. Once clean, he dried himself off, headed back to his room, and got dressed. Now he was ready to start his day.</span></div></div>",

Since no one else was there yet, he rested his head on his desk and zoned out, still feeling tired from waking up so early. He hated days when he had English first since he had no friends in the class. That meant he didn't have anyone to chat with while waiting for school to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it came time for class to begin, Ms. Barnes stood up and started class. The class had just recently finished reading through Romeo and Juliet and they were going to be discussing the most recently assigned reading, the final few scenes. Cameron wasn't particularly interested and only slightly listened as they went over the guided reading questions. He tried to pay a little more attention once they got to discussing the work as a whole, since that was stuff they might have to write a paper on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Ms. Barnes said once discussion had wrapped up. \"I've got a little assignment for next class. You'll be breaking yourselves up into groups of two to four and selecting a scene to practice and act out for the class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students began murmuring as they began talking about who they wanted to work with. Once Ms. Barnes finished explaining the project, and handing out the handout to go with it, she let the class start picking their groups. Cameron hated when he had to pick groups in English since he had no friends in the class. Of course it seemed everyone else did, and they picked out their groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone who doesn't have a group yet?\" Ms. Barnes asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron immediately raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect,\" Ms. Barnes said. Cameron, Amy, you'll be working together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron turned in his seat to look at Amy Townsend, the girl who sat behind him. Cameron didn't know Amy very well. She moved to town three years ago and hadn't really made any friends since. She was rather shy and socially awkward, but she did seem nice the few times Cameron had talked with her. She was pretty cute too. She had a nice smile, and shoulder-length light brown hair that she usually kept in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we're partners then,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Amy said. \"Wanna meet up later and start planning this out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore class ended, Ms. Barnes assigned each group their scenes based on how many people were in the group. Cameron and Amy received the scene where Romeo and Juliet first met. Before heading off to their next classes, Amy and Cameron made plans to meet up after school and go over to Amy's house to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She actually seemed a lot like his friend Jordyn. Despite her feminine and girly appearance, Amy was a bit of a tomboy, Cameron learned. A bit more of a tomboy than Jordyn, but less so than Jordyn's friend Jen and especially less so than Cameron's friend Kat. Cameron thought it was awesome that Amy liked video games and action movies, and other stuff typically thought of as guy things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them also got along quite nicely and became fast friends. Cameron told Amy that he would definitely introduce her to some of his friends. He felt that Amy would get along well with them, Jordyn especially. He also thought she'd get along well with Jordyn's other friends. Amy was thankful for Cameron's offer. She explained how she had had a really hard time making friends and that Cameron was the first person she'd really clicked with since moving to town three years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they arrived at Amy's house, the two were definitely friends and Cameron was starting to think he had a bit of a crush on Amy. He didn't share that last part with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the two got to work on reading through their scene a few times. Their scene was, of course, the scene at the party where Romeo and Juliet first meet. The two characters actually kissed in the scene, but Cameron and Amy were just doing a dry read from the book and not acting anything out yet. That said, Cameron did find himself thinking that he wouldn't mind kissing Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Amy's older sister arrived home. \"Hey, Sarah,\" Amy greeted her older sister who walked into the kitchen wearing heels. \"What's with the heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know,\" Sarah said in a teasing tone. \"I need to wear heels more now that my little sister is taller than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to mention it, Cameron had noticed Amy having quite a bit of a growth spurt in the last year or so. It was dramatic enough that he had noticed even though he never interacted with her much before today. It was a part of puberty after all. Looking at Sarah, Cameron correctly guessed that she would be right around 5'3\" without her heels on, making her one inch shorter than himself and Amy. Cameron knew he was short for a guy, but he'd gotten used to it by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your friend here?\" Sarah asked, looking over at Cameron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Cameron,\" Amy said. \"We got assigned to work on a project together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameron?\" Sarah asked, seeming to recognize the name for some reason. \"Like Cameron the boy you have a crush on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sarah!</i>\" Amy shouted in dismay, her face flushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah simply giggled and walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a crush on me?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, well ... yeah,\" Amy said, embarrassed. \"She wasn't supposed to say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Cameron said. \"You're kind of cute, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's, uh, just get back to reading,\" a flustered Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that they did. However, when they got to the kissing part of the scene, Cameron decided to just go for it. He leaned in and gave Amy a kiss, catching her by surprise. After a moment, she relaxed and leaned into the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how Cameron ended up getting his first girlfriend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They mostly just read from the book, but they did make one attempt at memorizing the lines before they finished. It didn't go well. Amy fared a little better than Cameron, who was barely able to remember any of the lines, but they both needed work. That, however, they agreed, would be something they would do tomorrow. They both needed a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they played some video games together in Amy's room. They both had a lot of fun, and they really felt a connection with each other. Cameron was really glad that they had been given this assignment. He hadn't expected that he would get a girlfriend out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it started to get close to when Amy's parents usually got home, Amy insisted that Cameron leave. Her dad would be mad if he found out she had a boy over without permission, she explained. Cameron understood, but they planned to meet up again the next day after school to keep working on their assignment, this time at Cameron's house. Plus, they would see each other at school too, and Cameron was going to introduce her to some of his friends. After a goodbye kiss from his new girlfriend and exchanging phone numbers with her, Cameron headed back home in a good mood.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later than night, after Cameron had dinner with his mom and sisters and finished his other homework, he couldn't help but share the good news about his new relationship with his two best friends Jordyn and Mitch, and texted both of them. Mitch was very excited for his friend, and a bit jealous that he had gotten a girlfriend before him, especially one who was into gaming. Jordyn was also happy for Cameron. She always teased him about girls and tried to set him up with some of her friends in the past. She knew who Amy was, but like Cameron, she hadn't interacted with her much because she was shy and awkward. Jordyn was definitely interested in getting to know Amy more once Cameron told her that she would like her and that he thought they would be good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chatting with his friends via text for the rest of the night, Cameron went bed and got a good night's sleep. Then he was off to school the next morning. He didn't have English today, which happened to be his only class with Amy, but they were going to meet up at lunch. The good news was that his first class was History with Jordyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll really like her,\" Cameron found himself saying to his best friend as they waited for class to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already said that,\" Jordyn said, playfully punching her friend in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Cameron said. \"But she's just really awesome. We clicked right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're so sappy,\" Jordyn teased, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Cameron said, just before Mr. Daniels began his lecture, boring as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter History class, Cameron's next few classes were a bore since none of his friends were in them. Lunch came soon enough. Since it was Thursday, Cameron had first lunch period, as did Amy, which was fortunate. On Thursdays, Cameron's friends Mitch, Kat, and Sam had second lunch period, so he usually ate with Jordyn and her friends Maggy and Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cameron suspected, Amy fit right in with Jordyn, Maggy, and Jen, and all three girls seemed to like her. Cameron didn't participate much in the conversation, but he was content to sit with Amy leaning her head on his shoulder as she got to know Jordyn and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, Jordyn pulled Amy aside briefly and got a bit serious. \"Cam is like a brother to me,\" she warned Amy. \"If you hurt him, you'll have to answer to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the first person to ever really take the time to get to know me since I moved here,\" Amy replied. \"I would never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordyn smiled. \"Then you have nothing to worry about. Maggy, Jen, and I are hanging out at the mall this weekend. Why don't you join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's eyes lit up. \"I would love to! Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to Cameron, Amy gave him a kiss before heading off to her next class. \"So, what do you think?\" Cameron asked Jordyn once Amy had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a good fit for you,\" Jordyn said, patting Cameron on the back. \"Don't mess this up, I'm just starting to like her.\" And with that, she headed out with her two friends in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed rather quickly, and soon school was over. Cameron met up with Amy outside the building, and they walked back to Cameron's house together, holding hands of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have plenty of time to practice before anyone gets home,\" Cameron said as he walked into his house with Amy. Cameron's older sister Christina had softball practice after school, his twin sister Anna had some extracurricular club meeting to go to, and his mom would be at work for a few more hours yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Amy said. \"Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two got to work trying to memorize their lines again. Amy seemed to have a natural talent for it, but Cameron was still having a bit of difficulty. About an hour in ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their scene was short too, since they were only reading the interaction between their two characters and not the full thing. The class was a bit large, so Ms. Barnes couldn't give each group too much time; she only wanted it to take up one class session after all. Despite all this, Cameron was having trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer,\" Amy said, reciting her line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,\" Cameron recited. He then looked to Amy expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Amy asked. \"You have another line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron furrowed his brow in confusion. \"Don't you need to say 'Saints do not move' first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy laughed. \"No, silly,\" she said, playfully hitting Cameron in the arm. \"How is it you can remember my lines and not yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember,\" Amy continued. \"The rest of your line is 'They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know my lines so well, why don't you read them then?\" Cameron said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's not a bad idea,\" Amy said. \"The handout Ms. Barnes passed out with the grading criteria said thinking outside the box will get us more points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you getting at?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirked mischievously. \"I'm saying you should be Juliet and I should be Romeo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you know this will get us more points. And you're having trouble with Romeo's lines anyway, so maybe you'll have an easier time with Juliet's. Can't we at least try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright,\" Cameron agreed. \"Let's try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, for whatever reason, Cameron was able to do better by switching lines with Amy, and Amy had no trouble at all with her new lines. Not too much later, the two of them had their lines down perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Barnes will love this,\" Amy said with excitement. \"We'll get an A for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" Cameron said. \"Anyway, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Amy said ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pointed out his TV stand which had all his video game consoles neatly arranged in the compartments below and his television standing on top of it.  His collection of games was displayed on a shelf directly to the right of it, all of them sorted by platform and then alphabetically by series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Amy said. \"You're really organized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when it comes to games,\" Cameron laughed. He pointed to a pile of clothes near the foot of his bed. \"I'm a bit of a mess when it comes to everything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're a lot cleaner than most boys,\" Amy said, leaning her head on Cameron's shoulder. \"I like that about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amy laughed again. \"Alright, let's see what games you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Cameron and Amy played video games together for a while.  Cameron kept thinking about how it was so awesome that he now had a girlfriend that seem to like games as much as he did. He just felt so lucky to have found Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours, the two of them got a bit bored and decided to watch a movie together. They headed back downstairs to the family room and Cameron fired up the streaming device hooked up to the TV so they could pick out something to watch. Cameron again felt lucky when Amy picked out an action movie that she said she had been dying to see. Again it seemed like their interests were lining up amazingly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron started up the movie and he and Amy settled in on the couch. As the opening credits started to roll, Amy leaned up against Cameron and let him put his arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, Cameron heard the sound of the door opening, and a few moments later his sisters walked in. \"Hey, bro,\" his older sister Christina said, seeing him on the couch. \"Who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is--\" he started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Amy,\" Amy cut him off, introducing herself. \"Cam's girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time,\" Christina blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, sis,\" Cameron said, shooting her a brief annoyed glance before turning back to Amy. \"Amy, these are my sisters, Christina and Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my Biology class, right?\" Anna asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm,\" Amy replied. \"But it's nice to be properly introduced. I didn't know you two were related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, twins, actually,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll get out of your hair so you two can enjoy your movie,\" Christina said, turning to leave. \"But it was nice meeting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem nice,\" Amy said once Cameron's sisters had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're great,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then returned their attention to the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cameron was glad that they didn't need to talk about how Amy was Romeo and he was Juliet for their scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner wrapped up. Amy announced that she needed to head home. Cameron saw her to the door and they parted with a kiss before she headed out. \"See you tomorrow, Cameron,\" she said. \"Be sure to brush up on your lines so you're ready for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" he replied. \"See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed nice,\" Cameron's mom said once he came back inside. \"Let her know she's welcome to come by any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure,\" Cameron said, feeling slightly embarrassed. He then headed upstairs to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amy was there already, sitting in her seat just behind his own, so he turned around the chat with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for our scene?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Cameron replied. He did feel prepared, but he was still a little bit apprehensive about being the girl in the scene. He kept that last bit to himself though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron did feel a bit better once some of the other groups started. Some groups that were all guys or all girls had scenes with both male and female characters, and he took comfort in the fact that he and Amy weren't the only group playing characters of the opposite gender. However, it seemed they were the only group to do it when the gender ratio of the members matched that of the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the misgivings he had, Cameron still got up and did the scene with Amy when the time came. There were a few snickers from some of the students at first, but for the most part they were all fine with it, especially when they did such a good job reciting the lines. They even did the kiss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job you two,\" Ms. Barnes commented when they had finished. \"You did a great job memorizing the lines and acting out the scene. I also love how you thought outside the box and didn't go with the obvious choices when selecting who would be which character.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" Amy whispered to Cameron once they had sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right,\" Cameron replies. \"Good call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to be done, Cameron relaxed and watched the remaining groups perform. As far as he could tell, he and Amy seemed to get the most positive critique from Ms. Barnes out of all the groups. At the end of class, Ms. Barnes announced that there wouldn't be any homework for the weekend to give a little break to the students before they started the next book.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The day passed mostly uneventful, and Cameron had a class with Jordyn, and then one with Mitch. Before he knew it, it was already lunch time. Cameron and Amy had the same lunch period again, and they were joined by Jordyn and Mitch too. None of their other friends had that lunch period so it was just the four of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an enjoyable lunch, and Amy and Mitch got to know each other a bit. Amy also talked about their good performance in English class. Both Jordyn and Mitch were amused that they had swapped who was Romeo and Juliet, but they didn't linger on it, which Cameron was glad about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the topic changed to the upcoming weekend. Since Amy would be hanging out with Jordyn and her friends on Saturday, Cameron and Mitch made plans to hang out then. It had been a good while since they had done that anyway, so Cameron was looking forward to it. Cameron and Amy also made plans to hang out after school as well, since they wouldn't be spending time together the following day. Before long, the bell rang, and it was time for them all to head off to class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her parents were still at work and her sister Sarah was going to be out with her boyfriend, so they would have the house to themselves for a while, not that they were going to do anything naughty; they were still too early in their relationship for that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs had seemed to become their normal thing to do, the two of them played video games in Amy's room for a while, and then decided to watch a movie together once they grew bored. However, the movie ran a bit long and when it was ended it was later than either of them thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot,\" Amy said. \"How did it get so late? You should probably go before my parents get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Cameron asked. \"What's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just my dad,\" Amy explained. \"He's a bit ... overprotective. You should have seen the crap he gave Sarah's boyfriend when they started dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron definitely didn't want to deal with that at the moment. \"Alright, I'll get ready to go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got the chance, Amy's mom walked in the door. \"Hi sweetie,\" she greeted her daughter. \"Oh, hello,\" she then said, seeing Cameron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is my boyfriend Cameron,\" Amy introduced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Mrs. Townsend,\" Cameron said, trying to make a good first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad my girls seem to gravitate towards nice boys,\" Amy's mom said, before letting out a little laugh as she turned to Amy. \"Even so, I bet your father won't be happy to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find out what?\" Amy's dad asked, walking into the room, having arrived home just after his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey,\" Amy's mom greeted her husband. \"Amy was just introducing me to her boyfriend Cameron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, now both my girls are dating,\" he said as he sized Cameron up. \"What are your intentions with my daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Amy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Bill,\" Amy's mom said. \"Relax. He seems like a nice boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he agreed. \"But I'll be keeping an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cam was just leaving anyway,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Cameron said. \"I need to be home for dinner, but it was nice meeting you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy saw Cameron to the door and gave him a goodbye kiss. \"Talk to you later I guess,\" she said. \"Maybe we can meet up on Sunday or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Cameron said. \"Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uneventful end to his evening, Cameron headed to bed. He woke up the next morning looking forward to hanging out with his buddy Mitch. However, it wasn't to be. Shortly before when they planned to meet up, Cameron got a text from Mitch saying his mom was dragging him to some family event for the weekend and he had to bail on hanging out. Cameron wasn't upset about it since he and his best bud would have plenty of other chances to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was bored and it was still relatively early, Cameron decided to shoot Jordyn a text to see if she had time to hang out before meeting up with Jen, Maggy, and Amy. Since she lived next door, it wouldn't be much of an issue for her to get where she needed to get. Jordyn replied a few moments later saying that Amy had arrived already, but the two of them could head over for a bit if he didn't mind since they were still waiting on Jen and Maggy. Cameron of course didn't mind getting to spend a little more time with his new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the two girls arrived at Cameron's house and he let them in. As they were deciding what to do, Cameron's mom appeared, looking like she was about to head out. \"Oh, hello girls,\" she said upon seeing Jordyn and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mrs. Brewer,\" Jordyn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you both,\" Cameron's mom said before turning to her son. \"I'm going out to run some errands,\" she said. \"If you're planning to go out, don't forget to take your laundry out of the dryer before you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mom,\" Cameron replied. \"I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you still wearing those jeans?\" she asked. \"They're more torn up than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked down. His mom was right, one of the legs looked like it was about to tear off at the knee. There was just one problem. \"They're the only pair I have left,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you wore them to shreds too,\" his mom said, letting out a bit of a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've got an idea,\" Jordyn said. \"Since your plans with Mitch got cancelled, why don't you join Amy, Jen, Maggy, and I at the mall and we can help you pick out some new clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great idea,\" Cameron's mom said. \"You could do with a lot of new clothes. You've worn out or grown out of a lot of your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Cameron agreed. \"It's not like I have anything else going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need some clothes, why not take a look in here?\" Cameron's older sister Christina said, suddenly appearing, a large cardboard box in her arm. \"My friend Lizzie and I collected a bunch of our old clothes we don't want anymore that I'm gonna donate. There's some unisex and boy clothes in here from her tomboy and punk phases she went through a couple years ago that should fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" Cameron said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well take a look,\" Cameron's mom said. \"Anyway, I need to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Mom,\" Christina said as her and Cameron's mom headed out. She then turned to her brother. \"Well all leave this up in your room if you want to take a look,\" she said before heading upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Cameron replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've got time to kill before Jen and Maggy show up,\" Jordyn said. \"Might as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. C'mon, it might be fun,\" Amy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked at the two girls, who both looked a bit excited by the idea, and gave it some more thought. After a moment he said ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Amy then began fishing around in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, this will look great on you,\" Amy said, laughing as she pulled out a black pleated skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron rolled his eyes. \"Yeah right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just making fun,\" Amy said, putting the skirt aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are cute,\" Jordyn said, pulling out a pair of lacy panties. \"Sure you don't want to try 'em on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon guys,\" Cameron said. \"Be serious about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Jordyn said. She then spent several minutes rummaging around in the box before pulling out a pair of jeans. \"Here we go,\" she said, tossing them at Cameron. \"A pair of boys' jeans. Oh and a couple t-shirts.\" She passed a few more items of clothing to Cameron. They were two generic logo t-shirts that weren't girls' cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something,\" Cameron said, placing the clothes on the bed. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's these,\" Jordyn said, holding up a pair of black skinny jeans. \"And a couple other pairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys wear skinny jeans all the time, you know,\" Amy pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not like these are particularly girly or anything,\" Jordyn said in agreement. \"They're pretty unisex, to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should at least try them,\" Amy said. \"Or maybe a skirt? This one's cute.\" she then teased, this time holding up a camouflage print miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd much rather see you wear that,\" Cameron told his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I will wear it,\" Amy said, holding it up to herself to check the fit.

Moments later, he stepped into the black skinny jeans and pulled them up. The first thing he noticed was how tight they were compared to his regular jeans, but other than that, they didn't feel uncomfortable nor that different from his own jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess these aren't so bad,\" Cameron admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look pretty good on you too,\" Jordyn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Amy agreed returning to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked over to see his new girlfriend standing in the doorway wearing the camouflage print skirt and holding her skinny jeans in her hands. \"And that skirt looks good on you,\" he said, admiring how she looked in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks,\" Amy replied.  \"You really know how to flatter a girl.\" She walked over and gave Cameron a peck on the cheek before tossing her jeans onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about trying on a few more pairs?\" Jordyn suggested, holding up another pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, I guess,\" Cameron agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Cameron tried on a few more pairs of jeans. First, he tried on the pair of regular guy's jeans Jordyn had fished out earlier. After determining those fit, the girls had Cameron try on the rest of the skinny jeans in the box. There was a dark blue pair and a gray pair that were torn at the knees slightly and then there was a red pair that Cameron tried on after the girls had convinced him by showing him pictures of guys wearing similar red jeans. Finally, there was a light blue pair that Cameron tried on without questioning it as he had gotten used to trying on skinny jeans after four pairs. However, after he pulled them up and fastened them, his two friends started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny? Cameron asked, not sure why the girls were laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are mine,\" Amy explained between giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked over at his bed and, sure enough, Amy's jeans were no longer lying on top of it. He then looked down to confirm that he was, in fact, wearing his girlfriend's jeans. \"Oh, come on,\" he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be like that,\" Amy said. \"We're just proving a point about how skinny jeans are totally unisex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron sighed and then let out a laugh. \"I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" Amy said, grinning. She walked over and gave Cameron another kiss. \"And I have to say, you look pretty good in my jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Cameron said, laughing a little bit. If trying on a few pair of jeans was enough to get his girlfriend to kiss him, then he was okay with it. \"Anyway, now what?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fitting rooms in this particular store were surprisingly spacious, so Cameron and all four girls were able to fit with room to spare. Eyeing the pile of clothes the girls had brought, Cameron gulped. He wasn't sure how too feel about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Cameron found himself wearing a blue top with loose-fitting short sleeves and a pair of white capri pants. \"I look ridiculous,\" Cameron said, looking at his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look kinda cute like that,\" Amy teased, poking her boyfriend in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm let's try something else,\" Jordyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron was soon back in his boxers as the girls selected the next outfit. \"Hmm,\" Jordyn said as she looked at Cameron's slightly hairy legs. \"Try this.\" She then handed him a pair of black leggings which he proceeded to put on. They fit snugly, pressing his boxers tight against his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good,\" Amy said, playfully slapping his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to complete the look,\" Maggy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, the girls had dressed Cameron in a short denim skirt over the leggings and a loose gray and white striped top with a low neckline. \"Aw, you look super cute,\" Amy said, giving her boyfriend a hug from behind and a kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" Cameron said. He didn't admit it, but he actually was starting to have fun, and this outfit was surprisingly comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it, you're having fun,\" Jen said as she looked through the pile of clothes for the next thing for Cameron to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's less fun things I could be doing,\" Cameron said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, Cameron was in a different outfit. the leggings remained to cover up the hair, but he was now wearing a pleated black and red plaid skirt and a black cami top with a bit of a lace trim around the neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do pull off skirts well,\" Amy said into his ear as she gave him another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron laughed. \"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while, with the girls dressing Cameron in many more outfits. By the end of it, he really was starting to have fun, not that he admitted it. It was obvious to the girls, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they had all had enough and they returned the clothes to the shelves, except for a few items the girls decided to buy for themselves in addition to the things they'd already picked out for themselves. They then headed to the checkout. Cameron purchased the clothes the girls had helped him pick out earlier, and the girls bought their items as well. They then made a quick stop at the fitting room again and Cameron changed into one of his new pairs of jeans and gave Amy's back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where shall we head to next?\" Maggy asked once the two had returned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were nearly falling apart. \"I messed them up real good at the skate park the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that settles it,\" Maggy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the five of them walked into the shoe store. As the girls went to check out some shoes, Cameron wandered off on his own to find himself a new pair of skate shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long to find what he was looking for. The store had skate shoes from most of the popular brands, and several different styles, but he still picked out his shoes relatively quickly. After looking at a few pairs, Cameron settled on a black pair with white laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shoe box in hand, Cameron headed over to the women's section to find the girls. When he finally located them, he found Amy walking around in a pair of black ankle boots with a 2 inch heel that she was trying on. Since she was naturally the same height as Cameron, he noticed that they made her taller than him when she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find your shoes already?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast,\" Jordyn said. \"We only just started having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at his best friend, Cameron saw she was wearing heels too. In fact, all four girls were trying heels on, making them all taller than Cameron, except for Maggy since she was so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun being taller than me,\" Cameron joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can join us in being taller too if you want,\" Amy said, laughing. \"We won't tell anyone.\" She then stepped out of the boots she was wearing. \"Here, try these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Cameron said, deciding what to do. <i>I already tried girls' clothes on today, so might as well try this too</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how Cameron ended up in a pair of high heeled ankle boots. \"How do you walk in these things?\" Cameron asked, almost falling when he tried to take a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One foot in front of the other,\" Maggy said. \"Toe first.\" She took several steps to demonstrate, and Cameron mimicked her, finding it easier to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're a natural,\" Jen teased, punching Cameron playfully in the arm. This caused him to lose his balance. Cameron quickly grabbed the shelf to keep from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or not,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes, Cameron tried on several pairs of heels with the girls and he had to admit he was kind of fun. Plus, being short for a guy, he did enjoy being taller. He kept this all to himself, though, not that the girls didn't notice anyway. Eventually, they grew bored and decided to leave. Each of the girls ended up picking out one pair of shoes to buy before they all headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the purchases had been made, their next stop was ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Back at the mall he'd kept his own underwear on the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bet was that we could make you look like a convincing girl, wasn't it?\" Jordyn pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it was,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls turned their backs to Cameron to give him some privacy as he changed. Moments later, he was now wearing nothing but the panties. He had to admit that they were much softer than his male underwear and actually felt quite comfortable, not that he vocalized it to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those look cute on you,\" Amy said when she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever you say,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it,\" she replied. \"Now, let's get this bra on you. Hold out your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of that?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an old padded bra of mine from before I finished developing,\" Amy said. \"It'll help give the illusion of breasts, and we can stuff it a bit to make you look convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron rolled his eyes. \"You really want me to lose ten bucks,\" he said, laughing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron had to admit that he felt rather silly as his girlfriend slid her old bra over his arms and then clasped it shut. And even sillier as the girls put a few balled up pairs of tights in the cups to fill them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're starting to look like a girl already,\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Cameron asked, folding his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing,\" Jen said, causing all the girls to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this next,\" Jordyn said, holding out a pair of short denim shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Cameron asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said not too girly,\" Maggy said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, whatever.\" Cameron took the shorts off his friend, stepped into them, and pulled them up. Surprisingly, his junk had a bit of room so they weren't too uncomfortable. In fact, they fit rather well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good,\" Amy said, giving him another kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Cameron said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you are enjoying this,\" Jordyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little,\" Cameron admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on next,\" Amy said, handing Cameron one of her t-shirts. It was light blue with a simple graphic on it and it had a tight, feminine cut to it. It did have a lowish neckline, but not low enough to reveal that he had no cleavage, and the sleeves would cover up his armpit hair. Cameron pulled the garment over his head and straightened it out. In clung tight to his body, and combined with the stuffed bra, it really did make it look like he had small breasts on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally,\" Jordyn said, holding up a pair of long black knee socks. \"To cover up your leg hair,\" she explained when she saw Cameron give her a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Cameron said. He sat down on the bed and slid the socks up his legs. They came up quite a ways past his knee, leaving only a portion of his thighs on display. His hair was sparse enough that it was practically unnoticeable in the exposed region of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute in that outfit,\" Amy said. She walked over and gave him another kiss on the cheek, probably to encourage him to keep going. He certainly wasn't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the fun part,\" Maggy said. \"Hair and makeup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout allowing Cameron to look in the mirror, the girls sat him down in a chair and got to work. They started with his hair first. Since it was getting kind of long, it didn't take much work. They just brushed it out to make sure it was neat, then styled it a bit femininely before securing it in place with a headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time for makeup. They explained what they were doing as they went, or rather stated what they were doing to make him look more feminine. They didn't go too overboard, giving him a natural feminine look, plus a nice smokey eye look and a coating of pink lip gloss on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jen said when they had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's even more convincing than I expected,\" Jordyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Amy said. \"You look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that very much,\" Cameron said. \"I bet I look ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself,\" Maggy said, spinning his chair around to face the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron's jaw dropped when he saw himself. His reflection didn't look like a boy dressed like a girl, but an actual girl. If he didn't know he was looking at himself, he would swear he was looking at a real girl. \"Wow,\" he gasped. \"I guess I owe you ten bucks, Jordyn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only joking, you know,\" Jordyn said. \"I'll just take the bragging rights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bragging rights for what?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, girl,\" Jordyn said, slapping Cameron on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Cameron protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you certainly look like a girl,\" Amy pointed out before giving her boyfriend another kiss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Frantically looking around, she spotted the copy of Romeo and Juliet for school sitting on her desk. \"And Juliet,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, because her mom smiled. \"Nice to meet you all,\" she said. \"Anyway, I was just checking to see what you wanted for dinner,\" she continued. \"Looks like I'll be cooking for a lot more now, though,\" she added, laughing. \"You're all certainly welcome to stay for dinner, or even the night if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great,\" Jordyn said. \"Thank you, Mrs. Townsend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's mom smiled. \"I'm just glad to see Amy finally finding some girls to hang out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mom ...</i>\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Townsend laughed. \"Okay, I'll stop embarrassing you now.

He didn't want to admit it, but he was thinking that it might be a fun experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other girls got in touch with their parents to let them know they would be staying over at Amy's, Cameron sent a text to his mom letting her know he was staying over at a friend's house. She wasn't too worried and didn't ask him who, likely assuming it was Mitch or Sam. So it was official, Cameron was going to spend the night as a girl at a sleepover at his girlfriend's house tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, the girls spent a few moments teaching Cameron how to talk like a girl and some common female mannerisms in order to help him blend it and not make Amy's mom suspicious. They didn't spend too much time on it, but it would help him get by as long as he didn't say too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they all headed downstairs and figured out what kind of Pizza to order. They ended up getting one cheese, one pepperoni, and one veggie pizza. It was certainly more than was needed, but it would keep everyone happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Amy's dad also came home. He seemed a bit overwhelmed to have so many girls in the house, and said he would make himself scarce for the night. Much like Amy's mom, he also didn't pick up on the fact that his daughter's friend Juliet was actually her boyfriend Cameron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were hanging out in Amy's room waiting for the pizza, the girls broke out the nail polish like a stereotypical slumber party. They all did each other's nails, until just Cameron remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn, <i>Juliet</i>,\" Jordyn said, teasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come onnnn,\" Amy said. She put her hand on his exposed thigh and gave him a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what color do you want?\" Amy asked. \"Red? Pink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there blue?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Cameron soon ended up with his fingernails and toenails painted baby blue. The polish had just enough time to dry before the pizza arrived, and Cameron soon forgot all about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate their pizza, Amy's mom engaged the girls in conversation, wanting to learn more about her daughter's new friends. For his part, Cameron remained quite. \"Juliet's really shy,\" Jordyn had explained, and it seemed to be a valid reason for Amy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating, the girls decided to put on a movie. Fortunately, they were all into nerdy stuff like Cameron, so it wasn't some dumb chick flick that he had no interest in. That said, he didn't do much focusing on the movie while it was on, as he was snuggling with Amy on the couch under a blanket. Amy was finally fulfilling the promise of letting her boyfriend get to second base for dressing up like a girl. As they cuddled under the blanket, Amy let Cameron touch her boobs, and one point she even put her hand on the crotch of the short shorts he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the movie was over, they all decided to get ready for bed because it was pretty late. Amy's parents provided a large air mattress on the floor that could fit three girls easily, plus Amy's bed had room for one more besides herself. Of course, Amy let Cameron share the bed with her, while the other girls would sleep on the air mattress on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sleepover hadn't been planned, no one had PJs with them, so the girls just slept in their tops and underwear for the most part. Cameron ended up going to bed in just the borrowed panties and t-shirt. Of course, he needed to remove the makeup to sleep, but the girls said between the hair and clothes he could still pass as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they all went to sleep, they chatted for a while. The girls even got Cameron to admit that he had fun with them and didn't mind the whole dressing up as a girl thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Cameron woke up before any of the girls, and found himself being spooned by Amy. She must have put her arms around him in the middle of the night. As he had to pee, Cameron got up slow and quietly so as not to disturb his girlfriend, or any of the other girls for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron made his way to the bathroom and without really thinking about it, took his penis out of the panties he was wearing and peed standing up. That turned out to be a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry,\" he heard a voice behind him as he was finishing his business. He turned his head to see Amy's older sister Sarah walking into the bathroom. She had come home late last night and had briefly met her sister's new friends before they went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" Cameron said he surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait ... Cameron?\" Sarah asked, recognizing this girl in the bathroom as her sister's new boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain,\" Cameron said defensively. \"It was Amy's idea and ... please don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed. \"Don't worry,\" she said. \"My boyfriend and I did crazy things to get around my dad when we started dating. Your secret is safe with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks,\" Cameron said, before hurrying out of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and by the way, you really do make a cute girl,\" Sarah added before shutting the bathroom door to do her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling embarrassed, Cameron went back to Amy's room to see the girls were all awake now and chatting. \"Hey you,\" Amy said upon seeing her boyfriend returning. She quickly noticed his embarrassment, however. \"What's up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, your sister walked in on me in the bathroom and recognized me,\" Cameron told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" Jordyn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she wouldn't tell anyone,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sarah's cool like that,\" Amy said. \"Although, she'll probably tease me about it later. Just be glad it wasn't my dad who walked in on you. Anyway, let's go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, they all headed downstairs, finding that Sarah was the only one home. \"Morning girls,\" she said, winking at Cameron to let him know she was keeping his secret. \"I'm making pancakes if you want some. Mom and Dad left already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now you don't have to pretend to be a girl,\" Amy said, slapping him on the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron just gave her a mildly annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Amy asked. \"She already knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I promise not to tell,\" Sarah said. \"By the way, Amy, you're doing crazier things to see Cameron without Dad knowing than Ryan and I did,\" she then said to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just kind of happened,\" Amy said vaguely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sarah said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating breakfast, Amy and her guests headed back up to her room to get their stuff. Most of them had homework to do and needed to go home. As Amy's parents weren't there, Cameron was able to change back into his male clothes. The girls then helped Cameron remove the nail polish. They all forgot about his toenails, though, because he had already put his shoes on, so only the polish on his fingernails was removed. After checking that all the makeup from the day before was thoroughly cleaned off, the girls deemed him good to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was time to go home for everyone. Before Cameron left, Amy gave him a goodbye kiss. \"See you at school tomorrow,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya,\" Cameron said before heading out with his purchases from the mall yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, Cameron ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cameron's mom and sisters weren't home when Cameron arrived, so the house was quite quiet. With the bags of new clothes he had bought at the mall in hand, he headed up to his room and dumped them on the bed next to the clothes Amy and Jordyn had picked out from the box Christina had given him, which was still sitting on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron sat down on his bed, then removed his shoes and put them aside. He didn't need them anymore as he had just bought new shoes, which he took out of their box and placed where he normally left his shoes. Then he got to sorting out his new clothes. Taking both his new purchases, and the t-shirts and jeans from Christina's box, and put them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, Cameron's eyes fell on the box again. Jordyn and Amy had only briefly looked through it, so there were probably more unisex clothes in it he could wear. As it turned out, that wasn't really the case. Most of the remaining clothes were feminine styles. At the bottom of the box, he also found a few pairs of shoes, most notably a pair of black punk rock style high heeled boots. Those definitely used to belong to Christina's friend Lizzie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermining there was nothing else he wanted from the box, Cameron began putting everything back in it. However, curiosity began to get the better of him. He did have fun dressing up like a girl before, as much as he didn't want to admit it. No one was home at the moment, so now would be a good time to try some of these things on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron picked up the pleated black skirt that Amy and Jordyn had jokingly suggested he try on before they went to the mall and held it up against himself. Was he seriously thinking of doing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will look cute on you,\" he suddenly heard Christina's voice say in a joking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked over to see his older sister standing in the doorway. He hadn't even heard her come home! He immediately got red in the face and tossed the skirt back into the box. \"I was, uh, just putting all this stuff away,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you were,\" Christina laughed. \"I saw what you were doing. It's okay to be curious, bro,\" she continued as she entered the room. \"For real though, was there anything in there you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I grabbed a couple pairs of jeans and guys' t-shirts,\" Cameron answered, still feeling a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Christina said. \"And you got some new clothes too I see.\" She looked over at the now empty bags from the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Amy, Jordyn, and the other girls helped me pick out some stuff,\" Cameron told his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cameron?\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sis?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wearing nail polish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron looked at his sister and saw that she was looking at his bare feet. He did the same and noticed the light blue nail polish the girls had put on him last night. He had only removed it from his fingernails and forgot all about the toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Amy did that,\" Cameron said, going red in the face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nail polish and holding a skirt up to yourself?\" Christina asked, letting out a laugh. \"Something you're not telling me?\" She playfully nudged her brother with her elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being a particularly good liar, Cameron just decided to tell his sister the whole story. They had a good relationship, so he felt okay telling her. He started with how Amy and Jordyn had got him to try on Amy's jeans without him knowing, then explained how the girls got him to try girls' clothes on at the mall, and finally told her all about what happened at Amy's house and how he spent the night disguised as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sounds like you had an interesting experience. I wish I could have seen you dressed up,\" Christina said, laughing again. \"Was it fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, I guess,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have been if you were considering dressing up again,\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron folded his arms. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bad liar, bro,\" Christina said. \"I saw you holding that skirt up. I know what you were thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron rolled his eyes. \"Okay, <i>maybe</i> I was,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina smiled. \"Well, go for it,\" she said. \"I wanna see you dressed up like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know ...\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already done it, so what's one more time,\" Christina said. \"Anna's studying with her friends for a few hours, and Mom's gonna be gone until late tonight, so it's just us here for a while. Come on, let me dress you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron sighed as he thought over what to do. Part of him really had enjoyed dressing up like a girl and wanted to do it again, but another part of him told him it was wrong and he shouldn't.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then went back into the box to find something else. \"How about a punk rock look?\" Christina said, holding up a black women's Ramones tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Christina replied. She then handed Cameron a matching black bra and panty set. \"Put those on. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his sister left the room, Cameron stripped and changed into the bra and panties. He really had to admit to himself that they were actually pretty comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, bro,\" Christina said, walking back into the room. She had several pairs of tights in her hands. She set a black pair aside with the rest of the outfit she had picked out, then used the rest to stuff Cameron's bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get these on,\" Cameron's sister said, grabbing the black tights. With Christina's help, Cameron got the tights on without ripping them. Looking down, he could see they did a good job of covering his leg hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was the tank top, which Cameron pulled over his head. Looking down at himself again, he could see that the stuffed bra under the top gave the illusion of breasts. Then it was time to put the skirt on. Cameron stepped into it, then Christina slid it up and zipped it up. She then instructed Cameron to sit so she could put the boots on his feet. Standing back up, Cameron was now taller than his sister thanks to the heels he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to finish the look,\" Christina said, holding up a denim jacket. She held it open, allowing her brother to put his arms in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron turned around to see his older sister smiling. \"Man, you do look cute like this,\" she teased. \"But we're not done yet.\" She then paraded her brother to her room so she could do his hair and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina more or less gave him the same natural look the girls gave him yesterday. She styled his messy hair as femininely as she could, but made a few alterations to the makeup to make him look punkier. Christina made sure to give him heavy black eyeliner, and went with a bright red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina was finishing up applying the lipstick, Cameron suddenly heard his twin sister Anna's voice. \"Hey Christina,\" he heard her say from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're home early,\" Christina said, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we finished studying earlier than we thought,\" Anna said. \"So, uh, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really,\" Christina replied. \"Just dressing Cam up like a girl.\" She then spun her brother around so Anna could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, wow,\" Anna said, looking quite shocked. \"Cam, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" Cameron said, smiling sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Anna said. \"You look totally like a girl, but, uh, why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Cameron explained the previous day's events for the second time today. He filled Anna in on the shopping trip, the sleepover, and how Christina found out and wanted to see him dressed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna just laughed. \"You're not exactly doing a good job at keeping this a secret,\" she said. She was right. He kept asking people not to tell anyone, yet he kept letting people find out. \"But you really do make a cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron rolled his eyes. \"Everyone keeps saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's true, bro,\" Christina said, slapping him on the back. \"Or should I say sis?\" She and Anna both laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" Cameron said. \"Can I get changed now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all that work?\" Christina asked. \"Mom won't be home for a while, so why not stay like this till then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He actually kind of liked being dressed up like this, he just didn't want to tell his sisters that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, the three of them just hung out and did stuff together. Even though they had a good relationship with each other, they didn't have much in common and hadn't spent time hanging out together like this since they were younger, and all of them really did have a good time together, hanging out as \"just the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, Cameron got a text from Amy asking him what he was up to.<i> Well, my sisters found out about what we did yesterday</i>, he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>LOL</i>, Amy sent back. <i>How'd they react to that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>By doing this to me</i>, Cameron told her, sending a picture of himself dressed up like a punk girl. He actually really did like the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>OMG that's super cute</i>, Amy texted. <i>You look great like that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron hated to admit it but he was glad that Amy liked him dressing up like a girl. He secretly hoped that he would get to do it with her more often. He really was starting to enjoy all this. In fact, he decided he would tell her as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is actually kind of fun</i>, Cameron typed into his phone. <i>Maybe I'll let you dress me up again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd like that</i>, Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh would you now?</i> Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yup :)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that conversation, Cameron continued hanging out with his sisters for a while. They even got him to admit how fun it was and to agree to let them dress him up again in the future. It wasn't too hard because he really was starting to enjoy this whole crossdressing thing, especially when it was helping him be closer with his sisters, his female friends, and his new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly before their mom was due to arrive home, Cameron changed back into his boy clothes and Anna and Christina helped remove the makeup. Cameron left his toenails painted, though, because no one would see them most of the time. He then stashed the box of girls' clothes away in his closet. His sisters had talked him into keeping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Cameron's mom got home and they all had a family dinner together. Anna and Christina gave Cameron knowing looks at the table, letting him know they wouldn't tell their mom about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Cameron did his homework that was due the next day. He had quite a bit, and he had put it off all weekend. By the time he was done, it was quite late, so Cameron decided to just go to bed. When he went to bed, instead of sleeping in his boxer shorts with a t-shirt, Cameron decided to sleep in a pair of panties. He really liked how they felt. Once he climbed into bed, it didn't take him long to fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the girls had said, his new wardrobe of mostly skinny jeans and tighter t-shirts went unnoticed. It wasn't that out of place for guys to wear such things. A couple of his friends did comment on his new clothes, but they thought it was normal too. What they didn't know about were the girls' clothes he had in his closet at home that he had found he enjoyed wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were spent as they normally were. Outside of school, when he didn't have homework to be working on, Cameron was hanging out with his friends Mitch, Sam, Kat, or Jordyn, or with his girlfriend, or some combination of them. Amy assimilated quiet easily into his friend group, and before long she was good friends with all of them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron was also glad that Amy, Jordyn, Jen, and Maggy remained tight-lipped on the crossdressing shenanigans they got him into. Amy's sister as well as his own sisters kept quiet about it too. He wasn't too keen on anyone else finding out, especially Mitch, Sam, or Kat. He knew it would be super embarrassing if they found out and he knew that Mitch and Kat would likely tease him about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, Cameron would occasionally try on some more girls' clothes when his mom wasn't home. He didn't care about if his sisters were home, since they already knew about his new habit, and they had fun dressing him up. It was actually a fun bonding experience for the three of them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend after the shopping trip and slumber party, Cameron had a fun Saturday planned with Amy. Her parents were going to be gone until late that night, and Sarah was out with her boyfriend and would be spending the night at his house. That meant they would have Amy's house to themselves. Cameron was certainly looking forward to spending more time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't going to be spending the entire time at her house though. This weekend was going to be their first 'official' date. The afternoon was spent hanging out and playing video games. The whole time Cameron kept thinking how awesome it was that he had a girlfriend who liked games as much as he did. She was a real catch alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the evening rolled around, they went out to get food together, and then to see a movie. Again, Cameron was glad he had a girlfriend with the same interests as him, so they got to enjoy a fun action movie together and didn't need to compromise on what movie to see. It was an all around fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got back to Amy's house, her parents were still out, and they certainly capitalized on that. Amy was very happy that she didn't have to worry about her overprotective dad being upset with her for making out and starting to get intimate with a boy she had only been seeing for a little over a week. She remembered how long it took for him to warm up to Sarah's boyfriend Ryan. Her staying the night as his house would have been unthinkable even like a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making out for a while, Amy decided that she wanted Cameron to dress up for her again. She had never really thought of herself as being attracted to girls or even feminine guys, but seeing her boyfriend dressed like a girl last weekend really turned her on. The idea of dressing him up again was so enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron certainly didn't mind either, finding that he really liked dressing up. And so, Cameron soon found himself in a cute cami top and a denim skirt, with panties and a bra on underneath, and his face all made up. And then he was making out his his girlfriend again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but I find this so hot,\" Amy confessed. \"I guess I must have a fetish or something,\" she added, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind,\" Cameron said. \"This is actually exciting for me too for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I need to reward you for indulging me,\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Cameron knew what was happening, Amy had hiked his skirt up and pulled his panties down. She then proceeded to give her boyfriend a blow job. Neither of them knew things were progressing really fast, but it just seemed right. They just had such a connection. As this was both of their first time doing anything like this, it was fast and messy. This new pleasure that Cameron hadn't experienced before was way more satisfying than masturbation, which was something he'd done plenty of as a teenage boy, and he quickly climaxed. As a teenager herself, Amy was also no stranger to masturbation, but she'd never been with a boy before, and had certainly never given a blowjob before. She gagged when Cameron shot his load into her mouth and ended up needing to spit instead of swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a awkward as one might expect, which much apologizing to each other, but it all worked out. It was a natural, intimate moment of discovery for both of them. Even though their relationship was moving quick, it felt right.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cameron wasn't particularly hairy at all, but they both agreed it was better to cover up a bit to make sure he was well disguised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Amy's mom poked her head in. \"Everything alright in here, Amy?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom,\" Amy replied. \"You remember my friend Juliet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" her mom said. \"Nice to see you again, dear,\" she then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Cameron said, trying to talk in a softer, quieter voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be staying with us again tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if that's okay,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" her mom replied, smiling. \"I'll leave you girls alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're locked into this now,\" Cameron said with a laugh once she had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fun,\" Amy said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from being dressed like a girl, the rest of the night was like a normal hangout session for them. They played video games for a while, then headed to bed because it was so late.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Amy's parents were still around, so Cameron couldn't leave the house looking like himself. Instead, he and Amy decided they would go to his house. First, Cameron changed back into his regular clothes, which all things considered were very unisex, with the exception of the stuffed, padded bra to keep the illusion of breasts. Amy then did her boyfriend's hair and makeup so he would still look like 'Juliet' and not Cameron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked, and neither of Amy's parents realized that Juliet was actually Cameron. After saying goodbye, the two of them set out for Cameron's house. On the way, Cameron texted Anna to make sure his mom wasn't home. His sister confirmed that their mom was out running errands, so Cameron and Amy hurried on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at Cameron's house, the two of them went up to Cameron's room and Amy helped Cameron remove the makeup. Cameron then removed the bra he was wearing and handed it back to Amy. She took back her tights that were being used to stuff the bra, but she told her boyfriend to keep the bra itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron and Amy hung out for a couple more hours, playing games and the like, and having a little more intimate time together. Amy did head home after a while though. Both of them had homework due the next day after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Monday rolled around again and it was back to the grind of the week again. Over the next few weeks, things began to settle into a groove. Weekdays after school Cameron spent hanging with his friends and Amy in various combinations, and hanging out with just Amy became a regular thing on Saturdays. They would hang out together at either of their houses, depending on when no one else would be home. They would play games together and watch movies and normal stuff couples did. That also included getting intimate. They hadn't had sex yet, but there was lots of making out, fingering, handjobs, and almost everything short of sex itself. They were horny teenagers after all. About half the time, Cameron was dressed as a girl during their hangouts, whether they were just hanging out or getting naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver these weeks, Cameron also had a few more 'girls' nights' with his sisters when their mom wasn't home. They continued to be great bonding experiences for them. Cameron's female wardrobe also began to expand with donations from his sisters, from Amy, and from Jordyn and her friends who had been kept in the know about Cameron's continued dressing. They weren't judgemental at all about it, being open-minded girls.In fact, there were a couple of times when Cameron dressed up when hanging out with Jordyn, sometimes with Jen and Maggy too. Cameron continued to keep his crossdressing habit a secret from his other friends and his mother, though.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One particular Saturday several weeks later, Cameron was hanging around the house just doing nothing. Amy and his other friends were all busy this weekend, so he had nothing to do really. It was also getting close to Summer and it was hot out, so he wasn't planning on going out. Cameron was just sitting at his computer wasting time on the Internet -- as he frequently did when he was bored -- when Christina suddenly walked into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro, you're not doing anything today, are you?\" his sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not really,\" Cameron answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a beach buddy today because my friends had to bail,\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you ask Anna?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's busy too. That's why I'm asking you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Cameron agreed. \"I'm bored anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Christina said as her brother stood up. \"I was hoping I could take you dressed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? In public?\" Cameron asked. He didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Christina said. \"C'mon, it'll be fun. I'll make you the most convincing yet. No one will be able to tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if you say so.\" Cameron had never been good at standing up to Christina when she'd set her mind on something, so he gave in rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let's go,\" Christina said before dragging Cameron to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing here?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Christina said. \"Now strip naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing I haven't seen before, little brother.\" Christina had never been one to get squeamish in situations most people would find awkward or embarrassing. And so Cameron stripped buck naked in front of her and she wasn't bothered at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now I'm going to spray you with this,\" Christina said, shaking a spray bottle of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A depilatory,\" his sister explained. \"Hair removal,\" she said when he gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to look convincing in a bikini, right? It's maybe a bit harsher than shaving or waxing, but I think it's easiest given your situation. Don't worry, it'll grow back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for a response, Christina proceeded to spray her brother down all over below the neck. Soon, Cameron began to feel a tingling sensation as the chemicals began to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now wait a few minutes, then hop in the shower,\" Christina said before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron stood there for a few minutes like his sister said and he felt the tingling grow more intense and unpleasant. When he was sure enough time had elapsed, Cameron got in the shower. Sure enough, as the water ran over him, it took his body hair with him. As he ran the soap over his skin to wash up things felt way different. It was quite a strange sensation indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stepping out of the shower and drying himself off, Cameron took a look at himself in the mirror. He was now completely hairless below the neck and his skin felt so much more sensitive to the air. It really did look and feel strange. As he didn't have anything to change into, Cameron wrapped the towel around himself, then headed back to his room where he found Christina waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see it worked,\" she said, noting his missing body hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels weird,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina laughed. \"I'll bet. Now let's get you ready for the beach. I think this should fit you.\" She held up an old blue bikini of hers that no longer fit her just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to wear that?\" Cameron asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Christina said, smirking. \"It'll look good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron had to admit it felt kind of good as he slid the bikini bottom up his smooth, hairless legs. Once the bottom was on, Christina helped her brother with the top. As it was an older one of hers from before she'd developed all the way, it fit nicely over Cameron's flat chest without hanging loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't it look weird with nothing in the cups?\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will look fine. People will just think you're a girl whose chest hasn't developed all the way,\" Christina assured her brother. \"No one will think you're a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bikini on, Christina picked out some clothes for Cameron to wear over it. She chose a pair of short jean shorts and a loose, short-sleeved gray top, and then gave him a pair of her flip-flops to borrow. Once that was done, Christina did his hair and makeup. Looking at his reflection, Cameron agreed with his sister. Even though he was flat, no one would think he was a guy like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's hit the beach!\" Christina said excitedly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And so Cam found himself wearing nothing but a bikini on a public beach while his sister applied his sunscreen where he couldn't reach himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning the favor and helping Christina with her sunscreen, Cam laid back on his towel to tan like his sister. As the two began to chat, Cam almost forgot where he was. That is until Christina announced it was time to turn over and tan their backs. According to her, that meant it was time to untie their tops so their backs could tan evenly. Cam, of course, was hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be lying on our stomachs, silly,\" Christina said. \"No one will see anything, not that you've got anything to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCam just rolled his eyes and laid down on his belly and allowed his sister to untie his top.

Christina soon started up conversation again. \"So what are you getting Mom for Mother's Day?\" she asked her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap, that's tomorrow</i>, Cam realized. He hadn't yet got his mother anything. \"Uh, I don't know yet,\" Cam admitted to his sister. \"What are <i>you</i> getting her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna and I are treating her to a day at the spa and the salon,\" Christina informed Cam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" Cam said. \"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should join us,\" Christina said, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no,\" Cam said. \"I don't want Mom to find out about this,\" he continued motioning at the feminine attire he was garbed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she probably won't care, right?\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know ... but I'd just rather keep it private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you haven't been doing a good job of that, have you?\" Christina teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCam rolled his eyes. \"You know what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Christina pulled the car into the driveway and the two siblings got out of the car. Once in the house, they were greeted with an unexpected surprise: their mother was home early from her errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom what are you doing here?!\" Cam instinctively reacted. He instantly regretted doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother blinked, processing the scene in front of her. \"Cam is that you?\" she asked. \"What are you doing dressed like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain!\" Cam blurted out, starting to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, sweetie,\" his mom said. \"You're not in trouble and I'm not mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCam breathed a sigh of relief. Christina had been right, of course. Even so, this was a very awkward situation to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had calmed down enough, Cam began the process of explaining everything to his mother. He started from the beginning, the day he went to the mall with Amy, Jordyn, Jen, and Maggy. He told her about how the girls got him to try on some clothes, how they gave him a makeover back at Amy's house and roped him into a sleepover, how his sisters had found out later, how the three of them had been having 'girls' nights,' how he got dressed for fun with Amy, and of course how he went to the beach with Christina today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCam's mom took it all quite well. At worst, she was a little sad to have been left out of the 'girls nights' he'd been sharing with Anna and Christina. Cam did have to state several times that he wasn't gay or transgendered or anything. She would've been accepting if he was, she was just trying to process everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, it all worked out. Cam had been nervous about his mom finding out about his new crossdressing habit, but now that she knew it was like a weight had been lifted. Now there was one less thing to worry about.</span></div></div>",

Since no one else was there yet, he rested his head on his desk and zoned out, still feeling tired from waking up so early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cameron felt a tap on his shoulder. He looked up to see Jordyn, one of his best friends, sitting down next to him. \"Hey sleepyhead,\" she said. Cameron grunted some sort of greeting in response. \"What's up?\" Jordyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" Cameron told her. \"Just tired.

Once the lesson began, Cameron started to zone out. He liked history, but Mr. Daniels's lectures were just <i>so</i> boring. He always found it so hard to pay attention. After what seemed like forever, Jordyn tapped Cameron on the arm and passed him a handout, snapping him back to attention. Mr. Daniels was apparently assigning a project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will work in pairs to research a particular topic related to the Byzantine Empire and prepare a report for the rest of the class,\" the aging History teacher explained. \"There is a list of topics on the handout, along with the particulars of this assignment.

She had seemed nice enough in the few exchanges Cameron had had with her in the past, but her gothic fashion sense and the dark and strange stuff she said tended to make most people avoid her. Even though she acted like she didn't care about anyone, Cameron always seemed to get the feeling that she was actually kind of lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen class was dismissed, Cameron got up out of his seat and walked over too Bethany. \"So, uh, Bethany,\" he said to her. \"When do you want to start work on this project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how about today after school?\" she asked, turning to face him. As she did so, her shoulder-length raven hair fell down into her face, almost completely blocking it from view. \"It's not like I have Friday night plans anyway.\" She swept her hair back with her black-nailed hand, revealing her heavy black eye makeup and deep maroon lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure. I don't either,\" Cameron responded with a slight laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Here's my address,\" she said, pulling one of her notebooks out. Cameron couldn't help but notice her apparel as he watched her scribble something on the page. Her outfit consisted of a short and tight black dress with a low neckline and short sleeves, a pair of purple and black striped thigh-high stockings, and a pair of knee-high gothic combat boots with a ton of buckles on them and quite a sizable platform and heel, which made her a bit taller than Cameron. He also noted a black choker necklace with metal studs and a silver chain with what looked like a pentagram hanging from it around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany finished writing in her notebook, then tore the corner off and handed it to Cameron. \"Uh, what does this say?\" Cameron asked, unable to read the messy handwriting. His own was pretty bad, but at least he could actually read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty-three Willow Drive,\" she clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Cameron said. \"See you later, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Bethany replied before hurrying off to her next class. Cameron followed her out the door and made his way to his next class.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Christina had taken to wearing briefs most of the day since they fit better under her clothes, especially when she wore skirts. At night, she would wear boxers to bed. They were actually kind of comfy to sleep in. Cameron, meanwhile tried to stick to the less girly options when it came to Christina's underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still the only ones who knew about the bet too, not letting their friends find out about it. They kept it from their mother too. Not even their sister Anna found out. A couple days after their bet started, it ended up being just the two of them in the house for the foreseeable future. Anna went on a three day trip with some of her friends to one of their beach houses and their mother had to go on a rather long business trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Christina suggested they step things up. \"It's clear neither one of us is going to give up so easily,\" Christina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Cameron agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I think, starting today, we should trade an addition item of clothing every day until one of us gives in,\" Christina continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on,\" Cameron said. \"But what are we going to trade today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some discussion, the siblings agreed to trade ___ first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thought that perhaps it had been gotten stuck on his jeans in the wash and his mother missed it when sorting the laundry. To him, that seemed like the most likely scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron tossed the thong onto his bed for the time being, then got back to work putting the rest of his clean clothes away. He then returned the laundry basket to the laundry room before figuring out what to do with the thong that had found its way into his laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking they must have belonged to one of his sisters, Cameron went to ask them. His twin sister Anna's room was closer so that's where he went first. Poking his head through the door, Cameron found her lying on her bed with her nose buried in a book. That was unsurprising, as she was quite fond of reading. \"Hey Anna,\" Cameron said, taking a step into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Cam,\" she said, marking her place and putting the book down. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to ask you something,\" Cameron replied. \"These aren't yours are they?\" he then asked, holding up the underwear to show his sister. \"I found them in my laundry today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna let out a slight laugh. \"Nope,\" she said. \"They must be Christina's,\" she then offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Cameron replied. \"Thanks.\" He then set out to find their older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking a little further down the hall to Christina's room, Cameron found her browsing the Internet on her laptop. \"Hey, bro,\" she said, seeing Cameron enter her room. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering if these are yours,\" Cameron said, showing his sister the red thong. \"Found them in my laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina shook her head. \"They're not mine,\" she said. \"Maybe they're Anna's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asked her already,\" Cameron informed his older sister. \"She said no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I doubt they're Mom's,\" Christina said, letting out a laugh. \"Unless you've been hiding something, I don't know what to tell you,\" she added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No,\" Cameron responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina just shrugged then turned back to her computer. Cameron sighed then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hall, he spotted his mom exiting her bedroom. \"Hey Mom. These aren't yours are they?\" he asked, showing her the panties. \"I found them in my laundry and I'm trying to figure out whose they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine? Of course not,\" Cameron's mom said with a laugh. \"Try asking your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that already,\" Cameron mumbled under his breath as his mother walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Cameron headed back to his room. \"Whose are they then?\" he asked himself.

Let's do another Grand Prix, 150cc, whoever loses has to do something the winner wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Cameron said. \"I can agree to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then jumped into the game, and Cameron got an early lead, winning the first race. Jordyn was right on his butt, though, coming in second. In the next race, things were reversed with Jordyn winning, and Cameron coming in third, having been hit with Jordyn's red shell right at the end. The third race played out like the first, with Cameron winning and Jordyn coming in second. Going into the final race, it was more or less tied. If Cameron won, he'd have three first places and would win, and because he came in third in race two, Jordyn would win if she won this race. Jordyn was quick off the starting line, getting the boost while Cameron messed it up, but Cameron got some good items and was able to catch up. Cameron built up a good lead, but Jordyn managed to catch  up and overtake him. Cameron then closed the gap, and the two were then neck and neck going into the finish line. Cameron was starting to pull ahead, but then Jordyn used a mushroom she had been saving and rocketed ahead to clinch the victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Jordyn cheered in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Cameron said. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm ...

The two then sat at the table and chatted while they ate chips and had their drinks. Finishing his first glass, Cameron picked up the bottle to refill, but he made the mistake of being lazy and not standing up to pour. As a result, the bottle slipped out of his hand and spilled over the table, dripping down onto the floor and his lap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Cameron shouted in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordyn quickly picked the bottle up than ran to get something to clean up the spill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Cameron apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, it's fine,\" Jordyn assured him. \"I got this. Why don't you go back to your house and change while I clean this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Cameron agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to his house, Cameron found that the doors were locked. He had locked himself out! Sending a quick text to his mom, Cameron asked how soon until someone would be home. His mom then reminded him that he had the house to himself for the next week ... or at least he would have if he hadn't locked himself out. Cameron had completely forgotten that his mom and sisters had left that morning for their annual mother-daughter vacation. They had invited Cameron, of course, but it was knowing that he would decline. They typically went to do girly things together, so Cameron would have just been bored at the hotel while they did stuff. Knowing her son was locked out, Cameron's mom suggested that he stay with a friend for the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed that he was stuck with Diet Coke soaked jeans, Cameron returned to Jordyn's house. Having finished cleaning the spill, she was waiting for Cameron to return. \"I thought you were changing,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accidentally locked myself out,\" Cameron explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordyn laughed. \"Nice going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best part is that my mom and sisters are on vacation for the next week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that sucks. You can stay the week here, you know,\" Jordyn offered. \"My mom would be fine with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Cameron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jordyn said. \"But what are we going to do about your pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question. They're soaked through. Underwear too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch ... Well I'm sure we can find something for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went up to Jordyn's room, and she told Cameron to wait there while she found something for him to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think any of my dad's clothes will fit you,\" Jordyn said, returning empty handed a few minutes later. She was right; her dad was a tall and muscular guy. \"The good news is that we're the same size,\" Jordyn continues. \"I'm sure I can find you something more unisex to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's the only option,\" Cameron said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordyn laughed, then handed Cameron a pair of plain pink panties. \"Here,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you'd find something unisex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just underwear. My laundry hasn't been done in a while, so that's all I can give you. It's going underneath your clothes, so no one will know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" Cameron sighed and took the panties, then went to the bathroom. Closing the door, Cameron pulled off his soaked jeans and boxers, then cleaned himself off with a wet washcloth. He then stepped into the panties. They felt very weird as he pulled them up his legs. They felt even weirder once they were up all the way. They were super soft and felt strange constricting around his penis. He knew he would just have to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, toss me your wet clothes,\" Jordyn said through the door. \"I'll throw them in with the wash then find you something to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Cameron cracked the door open, then passed out his clothes to Jordyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she returned, and then handed Cameron a garment to put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were told that their luggage was to be brought up stairs so Cameron and his family made their way into the all you can eat buffet, where they treated themselves to roast potatoes, curries and rice. Cameron talked with his sisters for a while, before leaving the table to get himself a Coke. He returned with a large glass full and placed it near the edge of the table after taking a small sip. Then, suddenly a small diversion was made when a women who was helping herself to food had dropped her plate. As people went over to help her, Cameron, absent mindedly, reach for his glass before accidently knocking it over. He managed to catch the glass, but the contents inside drenched his jeans, soaking all the way through his jeans, into his underwear. His sisters snickered in amusement while his mother gave him a look of exasperation. \"Cameron please go to the hotel room and change your clothes,\" his mother said, handing him the key card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with him, I'm full,\" Anna said and the two made their way up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Cameron received some strange looks from passers by. \"You look as if you wet yourself,\" Anna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron blushed slightly. \"shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the key card against the door and the two entered the room. There were three rooms in this hotel, one of which being the bathroom, the other containing a queen sized bed, which Anna and Cameron were going to sleep on, and the main room, with two separate beds and a couple of arm chairs, accompanied by a television on the wall. In this room, were three bags. Cameron quickly looked through the bags. \"mine's not here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Anna exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bag, it's not here. Maybe they left it in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not possible. I saw them take out all of the bags,\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I must have left my bag at home,\" Cameron cried, \"Mum's going to kill me, and what am I going to change into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Anna said thoughtfully, \"you could always borrow some of my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Cameron replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean we are the same size, and what other options do you have?\" Anna asked, grinning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron thought for a moment, struggling to think of an alternative and still reacting in pure disbelief that he had forgotten to bring his luggage. \"Ok, I guess I have no alternative. Just try to not make it too humiliating,\" Cameron eventually said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed slightly before saying \"this is going to be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her bag and rummaged through it, pulling out a pair of white cotton panties. \"Do I really have to wear this,\" He complained, giving the panties a dissaproving look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless you wish to wear these instead,\" Anna replied, withdrawing a pair of frilly pink, silk panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting that there was no other option he entered the bathroom and removed his soaked pants and underwear before, reluctantly, pulling up the panties. It was soft, but felt a little restricted around the crotch area. \"Hey Cameron, I forgot to give you this,\" Anna's voice called out from behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron opened the door realizing too late that he had just fully exposed himself infront of her.

Their Aunt was a nice, but could believe anything told to her, which meant you needed to be careful what you told her. She had a daughter of her own, Amanda, who was the same age as Cameron and Anna. They got along relatively well.

She gave both Cameron and Anna a hug before telling them that they'll be sleeping in Amanda's room. Amanda herself came outside to greet them,.

Amanda left to ask her mother whether they could do it or not, leaving Anna and Cameron alone. She was looking at the skirt he was wearing with deep amusement, but said nothing. Cameron felt completely stupid, especially considering he was also wearing a pink pair of panties and a bra underneath. A few moments later Mrs. Grey comes outside, with Amanda standing next to her, looking apoligetic. Mrs. Grey eyed Cameron and said, \"Amanda says that you all want to go for a swim. You may do so, but we're going to have to work out what you're going to wear, seeing as you must've forgot your bathers also. Amanda has a spair pair for you,\" she concluded holding out a one piece swim suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does it look like? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was quick to get into the room and take off the shirt and bra he was wearing. He then proceeded to remove his skirt and panties. He the stepped into the swim suit, and pulled it on. It was a little tight but fit ok. He now felt really stupid, staring into the mirror at his reflection. Giving off a sigh, he walked outside where Amanda and Anna laughed hysterically at him. He gave them angry, indignant looks. \"Sorry Cam,\" Anna said, \"it's just really weird seeing you this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron noticed that Amanda's swim suit was completely black. \"Why aren't I wearing the less... girly one,\" Cameron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed before replying, \"do you really think I wanted to wear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron was angry at the injustice served to him. But immediately forgot all about it, as the three slid down the slide, splashed eachother in the pool and relaxed peacfully in the spa, discussing random topics. They were in there for hours, and it was beginning to get late. Eventually Mrs. Grey called them up for dinner. Cameron immediately felt himself blushing as he passed Mrs. Grey in his swim suit. they didn't change, but enjoyed a nice dinner. When everyone had finished, Mrs. Grey then said to him, \"I think you should just wear a pair of panties to bed tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron agreed, deciding that it wasn't as bad as wearing a night dress for instance. They all got into bed and the lights were turned off. Cameron was wearing a yellow pair of panties, while his sister and Amanda wore night dresses. They talked for a bit before Anna suggested that they try playing truth or dare, but this time including truth, as dares were some what limited in the dark. Luckily, Mrs. Grey slept on the opposite side of the house so they could do things like licking eachothers feet, and eating food off eachothers belly buttons. \"I think we should do one more, before thinking about going to bed,\" Anna said, \"so... Cam let's finish with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron had, had enough of truth or dare by now and considered ending the game right there. But he was still feeling a little better as nothing could be worse than the situation he was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was difficult to do so however, with the traumitizing day he had just endured. He had been forced to wear a skirt, panties and bra infront of every one in the house, he was once again forced to wear a humiliating one piece swim suit and he faced the prospect of one more day just like it.

He's a 15 year old boy and a freshmen in high school. He has straight brown hair that is long enough to just cover his eyes in the front, but it's a bit longer in the back.

He loves rock music, video games, and skateboarding and considers himself to be a bit of a nerd. He only has a few friends, and he is totally fine with that.

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice most of the time but she has a very competitive side and can be somewhat controlling at times.

She's on several sports teams at school, including soccer, softball, and track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen Brewer: Cameron's 48 year old mother. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting on in years but she is still very very attractive.

He would be 50 now if he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordyn Brown: One of Cameron's two best friends. She's a 15 year old girl who lives next door to Cameron.

He's 5'6\" and has longish reddish-brown hair that is a little longer than Cameron's. He's one of Cameron's more nerdy friends. He never knew his birth mother and lives with his stepmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoan Walker: Sam's stepmother. She's 34 and married Sam's father a few years after he was born. She's been his sole guardian since his dad died a few years ago. She's nice, if a bit strict, and works as a lawyer.

She's a petite redheaded 15 year old girl, only 5'1\", and she has C-cup breasts. She keeps her hair in a chin length bob, has lots of freckles on her face, and wears glasses. She's smart and loves science, but is also a total geek when it comes to a lot of nerdy television shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen Peterson: One of Jordyn's best friends (besides Cameron). She's a 5'4\" 15 year old girl with straight, shoulder-length dark hair and B-cup breasts. She's quite a bit more tomboyish than Jordyn, but is still quite feminine. She's into video games and anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany Andrews: A 15 year old goth girl that Cameron goes to school with. She has shoulder-length raven-colored hair and pale skin. Her gothic fashion sense and the dark and strange stuff she tends to say makes most people avoid her, but she's typically nice to people who do interact with her.
