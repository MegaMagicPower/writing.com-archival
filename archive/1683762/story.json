Then, they turned down, into a deep frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks on the woman,\" he said with a sigh. \"I couldn't touch another, not after..... it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" the goblin said with a sigh. \"Lost some of my own family to the Undead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about a trade?\" Revan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you got?\" the goblin asked, his grin returning. \"And what you want in return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Information, for information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The location of a man who is planning to steal from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone is doing any hiring for a guard or some such thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the goblin began stroking his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said. \"There is a small caravan leaving in the morning. I hear that they are looking for a few guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where would they be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are staying at the <i>Brown Dog</i>. It's the stable on the North end of town. I hear the cargo is something rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Revan said as he took a few gold coins out of his pouch. \"Your thief is in the alley across from the tavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, and that will pay for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Revan said as he turned around. \"I'll be back later for the food and room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Revan walked down the street towards the stable, he saw a few people watching him. One was a human man who was armed with a sword. Another was a male dwarf who was armed with a warhammer. A third was a human woman. She seemed to be the one in charge, if the amulat around her neck was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A sorceress from Dalaran,</i> Revan thought. <i>Well, at least getting magic should be easy, if they hire me.</i></span></div></div>",

The human looked young, but his eyes spoke of some experiance fighting, though they mostly said farmer, and that he was scared. The dwarf spoke of experiance, but he seemed to have a lot of anger, more than even most dwarves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took another look at the woman. The only magic that radiated from her came from the amulat. It was a latant spell, one for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a look at the crates he could see. Most were covered with canvas, but the few he could see had no markings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you protecting?\" he asked. \"Weapons? Armor? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's none of your business demon lover,\" the dwarf said angerly. \"Now you get going or I'll crush your skull in.\"</span></div></div>",

I was just leaving them anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, get moving and don't bother anyone else,\" the guard said, as he twisted his hands around the handle of a spear. \"Otherwise I'll spit you with this, and have your hide roasted- good fire ought to burn the demon out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a demon lover,\" Revan muttered as he walked away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty years ago, he'd probably have gotten the job, back when he was a Quel'dorei, or a High Elf. But now, ever since the war against the undead, he'd become a Sin'dorei, or a Blood Elf. This was due to the destruction of the Sunwell, where all High elves got their magic from. But now, most members of that once-glorious race had turned to other sources of magic, especially that of demons. Even those still clung to the High elf way of life had to deal with withdrawal, lest they also turned into Blood elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRevan sighed as he thought about his life. He'd had a wife, a couple of children, with the oldest married, and expecting their first child. Then the Undead came, lead by the Traitor Prince Arthas.

It is not long before the slow moving group runs into the first escape pod using the radar on the P.I.G. There were five men aboard it but only one was wearing any armor and another didn't even have a weapon. They were a sorry lot and two were weeping despite themselves. Zanderfeld knew there wasnt time for this as others could be dieing for every moment they waste. Having been the Commodore of their ship he figured he could use his authority for now to get them to move on but he would have to find a way to increase morale in the long run or there would trouble in his ranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some shouting and giving of orders the five men were on their feet and the unarmed man was given a side arm for the time being. Zanderfeld then decided to send the men to the position to the second nearest escape pods and then give the order to head to the final landing spot of the Laughing Crow. It was lucky that this planet was mainly flat and very lush with only small vegetation. These things showed that first and most importantly the zerg have not infested the planet, and second it showed where the towers of smoke were coming from. Having found the first dropship with no problem was a good thing Zanderfeld decided but to have found it filled with of rank no higher than lance corporal was rather disheartening and created worries about how bad things went in space. They continued to find more escape pods and were heading towards the last two when their radar showed that the large ship they saw earlier was entering orbit. The smoke and clouds prevented Zanderfeld from making out what the ship was so he decided to slip his men and find the escape pods as quickly as possible. Besides that he figured he should start heading for the Crow himself taking one of his men with him.</span></div></div>",

I believe we could take it with minimal casualties if we attacked immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"No attacking now would lead to warn the Dominion of our presence. We need to strike quietly and avoid alerting the populace and the dominion.\" Kane explained then turned to the men crowding the area. \"Mick, Cowboy, and Pizza Boy get over here,\" he called to his favorite squad of men, \"Here is the plan we need to follow the details precisely because there will be no second chances. You will need five volunteers. First I want Mike to enter the com room using his cloaking field. Next Mick and two men will move up and using radio contact and your ability to act like a rock watch the guards from the outcropping .5 miles north of town. They will direct the movements of first Cowboy and his man then the movements of Pizza Boy and his guy. The first group will flank the Southwest side and the second the Southeast side. Mike will then bump his transmitter and in case the dominion are able to pick up his transmitter's frequency his signal was be four quick bumps. If you hear only three wait five minutes then I will send in backup on the central force and it is a firefight for the town.\" Kane looked around at his men who either nodded to themselves or stood patiently. He then finished by asking, \"You fuck ups scan me?\"<br>\r\n\"Sir yes sir,\" was the sober response from each man. <br>\r\n\"Good to hear let's get started then,\" Kane ordered as the men moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike Russel the only ghost in the squad began his 2 mile run to the town. He was the squad's recon, scout and spy meaning that he was the one of the most crucial members in this mission. If he failed the Dominion would likely be here in a few days and they needed time to recover and orient themselves.  He had to infiltrate not only the town, but also the town\u2019s long range com tower which apparently doubled as a missile turret so that meant once he was in the town his cloaking would be useless and it would require him to sneak in the old fashioned way in broad daylight. The fact that this would be done by day would seem to be stupid or illogical but Kane thought he could do it and he trusted Kane\u2019s judgment and reasoning. The townsfolk were in the mines and fields at this time of day which helped the plan of not frightening the people. As Mike was about .2 miles away from the town a sensor in his suit began warning him that he was detectable by the tower\u2019s radar. Which meant that the guard\u2019s visors would pick him up if they looked at him, there was no alert put out by the tower though and that was because he had taken a route similar to the one he saw a civilian go out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the town he decloaked and entered a  building just close enough to the com tower that the scrambler he had brought with him would cover an area just large enough for him to get to the tower cloaked. But he would have to hurry because once the building and anything else the radar could see in the scrambler\u2019s range disappeared a guard would be sent to check the area and if the com man was not dead when the scrambler was found the mission would be a failure. Another added variable would be if the resident came home and found a strange man setting up a radar scrambler in their living room they might be suspicious of an imminent attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the Scrambler set up without issue Mike checked his suits power reserves and connected the scrambler to it\u2019s power source. Moving quickly he cloaked himself and exited the building. He sprinted from the building he used as cover to com tower in a matter of seconds. As he slowed down to enter the door, which was hilariously left open, he drew his knife and his silenced 8mm gauss pistol. Looking into the building he found the com man asleep in the first room. After cracking the man on the back of the head with his pistol, Mike quickly gagged the man with the core of an apple that was laying on the com self and piece of cloth from the man\u2019s own shirt and tied his hands and feet with zip ties he kept with him for things like this. He then sounded the signal to begin phase two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He staggered to his feet and ambled over to the mirror hanging on the wall. His room was spartan, as were most aboard the command cruiser <i>High September</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at himself in the mirror. <i>Ugly as ever, Kyle.</i> He thought to himself, indeed he once was Terran. What looked back at him in the mirror didn't look very Terran. He had large chitin plates protecting his back, most of his skin had been replaced by small chitin scales, as with most Zerg the chitin was a dark brown in color. His feet were stuffed inside of a pair of well used boots, but, had they been visible they would have appeared more like claws then feet. He still had a thick mat of black hair atop his head. Finally his face, a pair of mandibles had replaced the lower half of his mouth, he tried to keep them pressed together most of the time and mercifully he still had lips to try and hide the terrible fangs in his mouth. All in all he appeared to be part Terran part Hydralisk with a bit of zergling thrown in for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he hated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never asked to be pressed into the Confederate militia on Backwater station. He never requested a forward observation post that was overrun along with the rest of the planet. He'd wanted to die when the zerg had experimented with him, in attempts to find viable uses for his species in the swarm. Yet through it all, he'd survived. He'd escaped Char after the death of the overmind brought him freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here he was, Redstone III one of the most hellish planets in the sector. Another day in paradise. Yeah, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle began to don the rest of his on-ship attire his desk comp activated and began to demand his attention with a series of beeps.<br>\r\nKyle poked at the comm key as he finished buttoning on his duty jacket. His voice was deeper then it once was, as occasionally picked up a click or a buzz. \"go ahead\" He stated in monotone. A small holographic image of the <i>High September's</i> Communication officer, Ensign Grav, \"Commander,\" his voice clicked \"Ve may have a zituation, Ve've detected two Dominion Shipz about vive clickz vrom uz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn't help but stifle a chuckle, the young drone tried so hard to speak coherent English, \"I'll be up in 5.\"</span></div></div>",

The bridge was set up in the standard layout for the <i>Behemoth</i> class Battlecruiser, it now had that \"comfortable\" feel to it. Kyle walked over to the holo table and called up the latest sensor reports, a pair of <i>Hercules</i> class Battlecruisers were slowly plotting by. Comm chatter indicated that they were looking for zerg activity in the area, or a place for the lead ship's Comm officer to take a leak, it was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle continued to study the movements of the Dominion ships as his second in command stepped onto the bridge. Andrew Knox was a large man, of all the infested crew, he was one of the hardest to tell from a true Terran. Were it not for his lightly glowing orange eyes and long claws instead of finger tips he'd fit right in with normal society. He kept his brown hair shaved short and his face smooth and clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned to address Andrew, \"Well, this' interesting. We came here trying to escape Dominion activity and get some quick cash. Instead we run right into a patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew growled, \"Wonderful. Have they detected us yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrav had been listening to the comm chatter since Kyle had arrived, he clicked for a moment. \"CkCkCk.. They, Zay nothing. No zound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle drew back, \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrav fed the comm line onto the bridge speakers, the bridge was silent for several seconds that seemed to strech on forever, until.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice finally spoke. \"Ah, that's better! Now'd I miss anything?\"<br>\r\nA second voice responded, \"Nope, quiet as a graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an audible sigh of relief from everyone on the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle chuckled, \"You've gotta be kidding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew frowned, \"Sir, we should bug out once those ships leave, the Dominoin might be lookin' to set up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle scratched his chin, \"They might just have been a scouting party from a larger detachment keeping an eye on things. To be honest there are some zerg planetside....\" He regarded the so-called planet for a moment. \"Well, dirtside anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew considered the second option for a moment, \"Either way, it's your call commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pondered their situation for a moment, an encounter with the Dominion would be bad, very bad. They were also getting dangerously low on resources, Redstone III was rich in said resources. Having made his decision he spoke:</span></div></div>",

The backpack of the suit had been pushed downward so that his natural chitin armor could fit in place and the boots had been modified to allow his clawed feet to be used properly. He sat waiting with 14 equally armored persons, both infested and non. People under his command, people he had to protect. His people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's new.

Priority had been placed on evacuating everyone, SCVs abandoned the mineral veins and pressure mines. They still weren't fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first salvo came out of nowhere. The entire northern bunker network was obliterated, Kyle felt rather glad he'd decided to abandon that area. His marines had dug into a rocky mountain ridge that was to the west of the bunkers, they were preparing a pair of concussion mortars. Kyle knew he couldn't defeat the Dominion, but the enemy's destruction was not the objective today. They had to hold out just a few minutes until all of the transports and buildings had escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle surveyed the terrain around him. He had positioned himself on top of the western ridge that protected the basecamp. Across the plain he could see the Dominion forces; Siege tanks, Goliaths, Diamondbacks, and a host of marines. He couldn't call for air support least his fleet's position be revealed to the enemy. Over the intercom he heard one of the marines grumble, \"We're screwed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle felt rather screwed at that point, once the goliaths got in range they'd tear the escaping transports apart, if they remained grounded the tanks would pound them. Then the second salvo hit. <br>\r\nIt was just a mop up shot, the remaining bunker debris disappeared in a fiery explosion. Kyle pondered his situation, the Zerg were on the Eastern side of the plain where a series of sloping hills offered reasonable concealment. He was sure the zerglings he had on hand could take out the Goliaths and the tanks, if only the marines were gone. The Diamondbacks were push overs, the concussion mortars could take them out quickly. But the marines would over run his position....

The barracks had been hit several times and was badly damaged, the zerg biosteel would heal, given enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXyff and the Zreg were now directly behind the Dominion forces, if they were to attack now the Dominion marines would shred them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marine to Kyle's left screamed in pain and fell backwards rolling down the ridge, he was probably still alive. Infested Terrans were more resilient then the vanilla version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath Kyle's feet suddenly decided to revolt and throw him and his marines. A loud sonic boom split the sky followed by a massive explosion. Kyle stood and looked into the plain below, the Dominion forces were in complete disarray. A trio of CA/F-17B Wraith Starfighters headed back for the upper atmosphere before the Goliaths could get a lock on them. The Grim Angels squadron wasn't really a true squadron, Kyle's troops had found three intact wraiths on a brood wars battlefield and got them back into working order. Most of the marines had been torched by the firebombs dropped by wraiths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled as he psionicly contacted Xyff and ordered him to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle didn't last long after that.
