He fucking attacked you too\u2026\u201d The prideful shinigami drove his muscular fingers into the sand, gripping it while shaking with rage and fear of his assailant. He'd tried everything he knew but the espada was too strong, even his Bankai failed to penetrate the hollow's spiritual pressure far enough to damage his clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnscathed and grinning like the mad man he was, Grimmjow towered over Renji. His exposed muscular chest made little movement even by normal terms; his fight with the lieutenant had not even made him break a sweat. Messy blue hair writhed in the cold wind, and turned silver by the omnipresent moon. \u201cKeh, yer a real dumbass you know that. That hollow is on my side, I told him to shrink me coz you were too much of a sore loser to accept your fate. You kept bitchin' when I was gonna stomp you about how it was unfair that you were so small, and how you could hold me off if we were on even terms. So I let yah go and tracked you here like the pathetic prey you are.\u201d His brilliant blue eyes narrowed to slits and a jagged grin crawled across his face. \u201cNow I'm gonna gut yah, I wish I could at least say it was fun. But stomping your bitch ass is like swatting flies, even when you ain't the size of one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji snarled, he may be a lieutenant, but he had held his own against captain level opponents before, and even when he lost he never backed down. He didn't back down against Byakuya after being lacerated by a hundred million blades passing through his body. Had he had any more spirit energy left he would have killed the captain who had foolishly assumed he was dead. He didn't back down against any of the espada he fought or even his sibilingesque rival, Ichigo. Renji sure as hell wasn't going to back down now. Fueling his muscles with the hatred building up from Grimmjow trampling on his pride he gripped Zabimaru's hilt and began to shakily pull himself to his feet. As his body heaved, red spiritual energy engulfed his body like hellfire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow raised a brow the way one does when someone tells a corny joke, because that's all this man was to him. A joke. Even with his willpower the gap between them was too great; Grimmjow could kill him with one finger alone. \u201cWhat the hell is that? You call that power? Tch, yer only makin a fool outta yerself kid. Flaunting that red crap around like it means somethin, I guess I'll have to show you up, knock you down a peg. I'm not lettin you die with that pathetic look on yer face; it\u2019s insulting.\u201d Grimmjow shoved his hands in his pockets and unleashed the full force of his spiritual energy. The landscape around them was decimated, sand blasted away in all directions forming a massive valley over which Grimmjow hovered. The air became like water and Renji's body like lead. He was immediately floored by the power. His muscles trembled and burned red, straining to keep himself from being killed by the terrible weight alone. He couldn't breathe. The air was too thick or maybe his lungs were already crushed; Renji couldn't tell. One by one his extremities caved under the power, muscles going limp. It wasn't long before Renji was completely paralyzed, only able to stare at his attacker as he awaited the finishing blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, this ain't even real power. Kid you ain't the only ones who improved since Aizen got beat down by that sandle- hat twink. The few of us who survived got stronger too. Lemme show yah what real power is.\u201d He extended his hand toward Renji and black energy gathered at his fingertips. <br>\r\n\u201cBlack cero... in\u2026 an unreleased form!?\u201d The shinigami gasped, the espada must have truly been working just as hard as the soul society. Deep down did they all really hate Aizen that much, to grow this much in power just to stop from being enslaved again? \u201cThe bigger the cero the more your bitch ass is gonna go BANG.\u201d Grimmjow laughed maniacally, the contours of of his unbuttoned coat whipping around torso and his skin sparking with excess energy from the super powered Cero. Renji's eyes widened and his heart felt like it had stopped beating in his chest. This really was the end. There was no way he could survive being hit by even half the power of the cero Grimmjow had prepared. \u201cWhat power\u2026\u201d Was all Renji could say as he stared at the hovering espada... The cero finally reached completion. Grimmjow's eyes went from slits to bulging embodiments of bloodlust, energy and malice glowing in the slitted pupils as he unleashed the cero with an animal like roar. Renji would have braced himself if he could move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The attack must have been much stronger than Renji anticipated. He didn't even remember Yammi or Ulquiorra's ceros darkening the sky but the second Grimmjow had released it the light from the moon became eclipsed. At least that was Renji's line of thought before the true source of the darkness appeared. Just as the raw power left his fingertips something truly massive fell from the sky, burying him beneath it and snuffing out the cero. Renji's breath got caught in his throat as he tried to gather what the hell was going on. Grimmjow's energy was gone, all that insane power from the cero snuffed out into a tiny black puff around the perimeter of the giant object. Renji blinked at the massive thing. It must have been twenty feet across, maybe seven to nine foot wide if Renji were to compare it to his own body. It was attached to a massive pillar of similarly colored gloss with a massive notch where the two parts met. The tower then vanished behind a massive network of cloth that whipped around like a giant, black flag. \u201cWhat the hell is that..? Suddenly, from what sounded like miles above, a voice called out to him. A familiar one filled with an exuberant confidence, a dominant and relentless energy that was infectious to those who heard it, but a voice that while riddled with masculinity lacked the rough pitch of a 'manly man'. Instead this voice was younger and softer; despite the power it had, it was benevolent. \u201cRENJI? HEY WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? BYAKUYA SENT ME HERE TO FIND YOU...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo!?\u201d Renji blurted out, looking up at the sky for the giant sword swinging male who was both a close sibling like friend but also his life-long rival. Then it hit him... that colossus that crushed Grimmjow, and all his power flat WAS Ichigo... and the thing that crushed him was... Renji turned his head back to the massive object, now realizing what he was looking at he could make out muscles, veins, and an ankle. Grimmjow was smashed under Ichigo's bare foot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT DUMBASS... HE BETTER NOT HAVE LEFT WITHOUT ME.\u201d The giant pivoted on his foot. Renji could only watch in awe as the foot shifted and then pivoted on the ball of the foot, twisting around ontop of Grimmjow like he were not even there. And above all, Grimmjows massive display of power... it seemed like Ichigo had not even noticed him or the fact he had snuffed him out with his foot. Ichigo just happened to land in just the right spot. What luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive foot shifted and twisted some more. Ichigo began to become impatient waiting for that idiot brother of his, and naturally he began to tap his foot. The espada below tried to move but each time he could move a single muscle, Ichigo's tapping foot would ruthlessly smash him back into the ground. \u201cUGH WHEN I FIND THAT PINEAPPLE.....\u201d The giant lifted his foot, sand and for a split second, Grimmjow stuck to his sole. Renji watched, terrorized by the effortless power as Grimmjow fell into the sand. The giant then gave the tiny espada a hard stomp out of frustration and then began to walk off, looking for the missing shinigami. The giant heel rose from the sand and the more the foot flexed in mid step the more shadows swept over the sole, making it seem like some horrible monster in and of itself, not even taking in to account the god like creature it belonged to. As the foot rose once more, Renji could see the well defined arch, and the giant toes from which previously gripped sand poured out. Then Renji noticed something, there was a white and blue shape on the bottom of the foot.. it was Grimmjow. Renji couldn't help but find it utterly comical the \u201cawesomely powerful espada.\u201d was now stuck to Ichigo's foot like a piece of litter, with Ichigo not even aware of his tiny presence. He could make out Grimmjow's body squirming to free himself, sometimes in mid step he would succeed but when he'd fall off he'd quickly be glued back in place by the sweaty sole landing on top of him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully now that Grimmjow was... occupied Renji wasn't at the mercy of his spiritual pressure any longer. He pulled himself to his feet and shouted up at the giant. \u201cICHIGO, FOR THE LOVE OF... DIDN'T MY CAPTAIN TELL YOU I WAS SENT TO KILL A HOLLOW WHO SHRINKS IT'S PREY...... LOOK DOWN YOU IDIOT!\u201d the tiny lieutenant had to catch his breath after shouting so loudly. His little red eyes looked up hopefully but Ichigo hadn't responded. Maybe if they were in a room Ichigo might have caught wind of the tiny voice but in this vast expanse the male's rough voice was drowned out by the wind and dissipated before getting even close to Ichigo's ears. He jumped up and down and waved but Ichigo wasn't even looking down. If he didn't notice Grimmjow's light show when he landed he wasn't going to notice the little red head bouncing for attention. Finally Renji decided to try using kido. At first he attempted a tekktekura spell to amplify his voice but... Renji still sucked at the demonic arts and couldn't even get the markings on his arms right for it. Deciding to go a more direct and brutal route he charged an attack spell to fire in the air like a flare. <br>\r\nHis red spiritual energy gathered into a single point between his palms. \u201cYe lord! Mask of blood and flesh, all creation, flutter of wings, ye who bears the name of Man! Inferno and pandemonium, the sea barrier surges, march on to the south!\" The perfect sphere of red energy began to ripple and discharge, as the chant bolstered its strength. \u201cHado 31! Shakkaho!\u201d The whirling flare of red fire blasted high into the air and exploded like a firework. This was actually only to the height of Ichigo's chest, and the explosion only the size of a basketball to the giant. Still it got the giant's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo stumbled backwards a step or two, started by the tiny explosion. \u201cWhat the...\u201d Then he looked down and saw a four inch tall creature with a red fiery residue burning from its arm. The tiny thing must have been what attacked him. Regardless, Ichigo wasn't the type to fight something that couldn't possibly even harm him. Instead of retaliating against the assault he snatched the thing up in his big fist. He assumed this was just another type of hollow life form like the small hollow lizards and insects they had run into the first time they went to Hueco Mundo. He recalled having to make Ishida relinquish his hollowfied pet lizard because it started to hunt the spirits of his neighbor\u2019s dead cats. \u201cAlright bug, I won\u2019t hurt you but just quit throwing ceros at me; if I'm too close to your nest or whatever I'll back off, alright?\u201d He spoke to his closed fist. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However the hand grabbed him with more roughness than he expected and he yelped softly from inside the fist the firm skin and muscular fingers keeping him from squirming too much. If Ichigo were not such a caring guy deep down Renji knew he might just be crushed flat from this misidentification. Not that Ichigo had a problem casually stomping out a bug that was harassing him or simply in his way, and not offer it the dignity of being pulled from the bottom of his shoe or sock. Sometimes he'd even scrape the body off on the floor or just grind it down underfoot until even the guts were practically gone. But those were pests. Ichigo would never harm an animal of any kind in the wild if he thought it was defending its young or its home. Finally the fingers uncurled from around his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... RENJI!?\u201d Ichigo shouted in shock, his voice knocking the poor shinigami onto his ass in Ichigo's palm. \u201cHoly shit, you're really walking small... what happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji huffed\u2026the idiot really didn't remember his briefing back in the soul society!? \u201cYou dumbass, do you pay attention to anything Byakuya taicho says!? I was sent here to fight a powerful hollow that had been shrinking souls to make them easier to hunt down and kill... what the hell do you think happened? You were supposed to be here hours ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo stared at the little man dumbfounded then suddenly he recalled Byakuya saying something about the hollows powers; as usual though Ichigo had just rushed into the manufactured Garganta, unconcerned about his enemy's abilities. He never needed to know that sort of information before anyway. \u201cOh yeah... I do remember that. So... he shrunk you?\u201d Renji just nodded, rolling his eyes at the obvious question. \u201cAnd... did you kill him?\u201d Renji nodded again. \u201cYeah, at least I think I did. I pretended to be weak from the fight and let him eat me. When I was in his stomach I used my bankai and blew him apart with my bone-cannon. He ran off with only half of his body or maybe less, pretty sure he died.\u201d <br>\r\nIchigo canted his head, despite their pretend hatred for each other they shared a close bond and respect for each other. Sure Ichigo was stronger but that didn't mean he didn't respect Renji. Renji always fought his hardest whether or not he seemed like he would die. Ichigo wasn't even sure he'd risk being digested just to kill a hollow. Sure if he was unintentionally eaten he might unleash a getsuka tensho inside the thing but to willingly get swallowed whole... Renji had balls, and despite how stupid he acted he really did have a brain under that ridiculous, spiky, red hair do too. \u201cBut other than being the size of a mouse you're fine?\u201d He poked the other in the chest with his thumb and pinned him under it, teasing him over his puny stature, though the question was of genuine concern. Of course Renji knew the rules and ropes of their rival game and picked up on the concern right away. \u201cTch, who do you think you're talking to 'substitute shinigami'. I'm just fine!\u201d He wrestled Ichigo's finger off of him only to be pinned under another as Ichigo laughed at his little friend. True to his nature, Renji wrestled each finger off of him but got a little too enthusiastic, causing him to stumble off the edge of his friend's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does he fall...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Renji grunted as he was suddenly pinned between Ichigo's arm and his rock hard pectoral. Naturally Renji squirmed for freedom and found it rather easily, though he lost his footing on Ichigo's shihakusho and fell into it. Now he was pinned against Ichigo's abs, eye level with his navel. Ichigo hadn't noticed the fall or felt Renji against his stomach. He looked around for the tiny man, first checking the ground. As he bent over his abs curved around Renji and the males's head was stuck into Ichigo's belly button. That Ichigo felt and, instinctively, he ripped his shirt open ready to smack away the offending critter. The teen lowered his hand when he saw Renji, struggling to pull his face out of his belly button. The teen laughed and allowed the humiliation to go on for a second before pulling him free and ruffling his hair with a massive finger pad. \u201cI always knew you had a thing for belly buttons. Freak.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji's face turned red with embarrassment and he only gave his giant friend the finger. By this time he had completely forgotten about Grimmjow, who was still plastered to Ichigo's foot. They had been walking around for a while now; the poor espada was as disregarded as the object he had gotten himself turned into, a little sweat-soaking insole to a teenager\u2019s giant foot. The actual reason Ichigo was late, aside from forgetting the dire situation presented by that particular hollow's abilities, he had gotten in a fight with another new espada on the way. His outfit was missing tabi socks and sandals due to his spiritual energy being drained a little. After finding Renji and relaxing for this time however the outfit began to repair its self. Around the living insole the tabi socks reformed. The little kitty was now trapped with the heat and sweat of that foot.</span></div></div>",

Prickling sensations shot up his exposed skin, goosebumps from the cold air. \u201cBrr.. its getting cold. Lets find some shelter and sleep.\u201d Ichigo suggested, his arms folding over his pecks protectively. At the same time pressing his little friend deep into the contours of his warm chest. The teen pulled himself to his feet, amber eyes scanning the area for shelter. He spotted an outcropping of sand, that would shelter them from the wind just fine. As he began to trek over to shelter the teen couldn\u2019t help but notice there was a strange feeling in his sock. He pressed his foot harder into the ground, twisting and dragging his foot back and forth as he tried to identify the object. Ichigo shrugged and continued his trek, identifying Grimmjow as a fold in his sock which rested quite comfortably against his sole. Each step he\u2019d feel the \u201cfold\u201d press into his tired feet, like a foot massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji continued to sit on his friend\u2019s stomach, his red eyes watching curiously as Ichigo\u2019s strong pecks rose and fell, he could feel the man\u2019s powerful abs below his feet. It was scary what a change in perspective could do, he was used to always looking down on Ichigo, now Ichigo\u2019s body was like his world. When the cold breeze hit Renji climbed closer to the man\u2019s chest. He looked up at Ichigo only to see his head rising higher and higher, suddenly the chest\u2019s angle was decreasing and Renji lost his footing. Falling as the man stood up he landed on something firm and round. Ichigo\u2019s bicep. \u201cThank\u2019s Ichi\u2014\u201c The bicep didn\u2019t stop rising. The arm lifted until Renji was smashed between chest and arm. The Shinigami lay sprawled out in a contorted fashon against the teen\u2019s chest. Despite the humiliation the warmth felt nice, it seeped through his body the shinigami could feel his muscles relaxing and his form getting lighter. It was like resting in a hot bath. The scent was familiar, a sweaty smell he\u2019d met before when they\u2019d sparred. Sight, well he couldn\u2019t see anything. After a good walk Renji felt the giant drop down and the arm lift off of him. As his own eyes opened he was hoisted into the air and dropped into the sand beside his friend. \u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together Renji, sorry to burst your bubble.\u201d Ichigo stated, rolling over so that his back faced the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours past and Ichigo was becoming quite annoyed with his little friend. Renji had awoken him five times now complaining about being cold. Ichigo had made an impression in the sand for him, given him torn off pieces of his cloak, even started a small fire. It seemed that the little man was always either too hot or too cold. Just as Ichigo began to rest his eyes once more he felt a tug on his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo pretended not to hear the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen\u2019s brows lowered, the right brow twitching slightly \u201cWHAT!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whipped around glaring at the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji crossed his arms and looked away sheepishly \u201cI\u2019m seriously freezing man..

The man closed his eyes, waiting for warm embrace but was met with none. He opened his eyes in confusion only to see the teens chest getting farther and farther away. A thick masculine scent wafted over him followed by heat.

As he forced himself past the ball of the foot blindly he felt something soft and fuzzy under his own foot (which at normal size was a whopping size 14) Curious he wiggled his toes, catching small strands of the soft material between each of his toes. There was a dome like structure that just fit perfectly into the arch of his foot and as he explored it more he felt small features of the object. He pressed his foot into the object further, completely smothering the entirety of it with his foot, still having his toes and heel stick out over the edges. He felt the object stir and then.. a humid gust hit the arch of his foot. A breath? He balled the fingers of a hand and illuminated the sock with kido. There were blue strands between his toes, and below that object he\u2019d been playing with sat a muscular body. \u201cGrimmjow!?\u201d That was the poor hollow\u2019s face he\u2019d been toying with.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThere was a chill in the air in the sandy endless hills of Hueco Mundo. Prickling sensations shot up his exposed skin, goosebumps from the cold air. \u201cBrr.. its getting cold. Lets find some shelter and sleep.\u201d Ichigo suggested, his arms folding over his pecks protectively. At the same time pressing his little friend deep into the contours of his warm chest. The teen pulled himself to his feet, amber eyes scanning the area for shelter. He spotted an outcropping of sand, that would shelter them from the wind just fine. As he began to trek over to shelter the teen couldn\u2019t help but notice there was a strange feeling in his sock. He pressed his foot harder into the ground, twisting and dragging his foot back and forth as he tried to identify the object. Ichigo shrugged and continued his trek, identifying Grimmjow as a fold in his sock which rested quite comfortably against his sole. Each step he\u2019d feel the \u201cfold\u201d press into his tired feet, like a foot massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji continued to sit on his friend\u2019s stomach, his red eyes watching curiously as Ichigo\u2019s strong pecks rose and fell, he could feel the man\u2019s powerful abs below his feet. It was scary what a change in perspective could do, he was used to always looking down on Ichigo, now Ichigo\u2019s body was like his world. When the cold breeze hit Renji climbed closer to the man\u2019s chest. He looked up at Ichigo only to see his head rising higher and higher, suddenly the chest\u2019s angle was decreasing and Renji lost his footing. Falling as the man stood up he landed on something firm and round. Ichigo\u2019s bicep. \u201cThank\u2019s Ichi\u2014\u201c The bicep didn\u2019t stop rising. The arm lifted until Renji was smashed between chest and arm. The Shinigami lay sprawled out in a contorted fashon against the teen\u2019s chest. Despite the humiliation the warmth felt nice, it seeped through his body the shinigami could feel his muscles relaxing and his form getting lighter. It was like resting in a hot bath. The scent was familiar, a sweaty smell he\u2019d met before when they\u2019d sparred. Sight, well he couldn\u2019t see anything. After a good walk Renji felt the giant drop down and the arm lift off of him. As his own eyes opened he was hoisted into the air and dropped into the sand beside his friend. \u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together Renji, sorry to burst your bubble.\u201d Ichigo stated, rolling over so that his back faced the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours past and Ichigo was becoming quite annoyed with his little friend. Renji had awoken him five times now complaining about being cold. Ichigo had made an impression in the sand for him, given him torn off pieces of his cloak, even started a small fire. It seemed that the little man was always either too hot or too cold. Just as Ichigo began to rest his eyes once more he felt a tug on his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo pretended not to hear the man<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchigo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen\u2019s brows lowered, the right brow twitching slightly \u201cWHAT!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whipped around glaring at the tiny man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji crossed his arms and looked away sheepishly \u201cI\u2019m seriously freezing man.. Sorry to bother you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo scowled and grabbed Renji. \u201cFine. Sleep with me then. God you\u2019re a pain in the ass\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji grinned, he didn\u2019t like the idea of sleeping with another man but he was so cold even Ichigo\u2019s hand felt nice against his chilly skin.

The poor espada was vacuum sealed to Ichigo\u2019s foot and had been trampled to a stupor state. Renji grinned and smashed his foot harder into the Espada\u2019s face, twisting his foot before wiping and dirt and debris off his foot into the man\u2019s hair. That jostling seemed to stir something in the espada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue eyes shot open and brows narrowed, he didn\u2019t know where he was, or why he was wet but he did recognize that spiritual pressure that belonged to the foot on his face. \u201cRENJI!\u201d The Espada snarled. With a heave he pulled his arm free of the Ichigo\u2019s foot. And with another heave tore himself free completely. As Renji fearfully scaled up the strange moist, hot object they were both pressed against Grimmjow released his pantera form and began to quickly catch up to the little man. Now adorning his hands and feet were cat like paws, longer hair and a tail. Those claws made climbing the foot much easier. He passed over the last bit of thick muscular object before hitting a space. There were at least five massive rounded objects, at least as thick as a tree trunk. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go Renji?\u201d the Espada taunted. Renji was quiet but the espada had keen hearing and made out a soft rustling to the right, towards the largest of the five structures. He lunged, his clawed hand grabbing onto Renji\u2019s leg. His prey struggled, kicking at him and pulling away. \u201cI got you now you little punk\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ichigo notice?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
