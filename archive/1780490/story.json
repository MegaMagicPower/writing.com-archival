Help tell their stories and that of who they wronged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh is a freshman to college who's on the track team, very competitive and who has a bright athletic future ahead of him.  If only he didn't look down at so many of his peers who weren't as motivated as he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen is a senior in college who has a reputation of being a very successful womanizer, a fitness freak and a preppy.  He's pissed of many of the people at his college through his arrogance, condescension and his cruel tongue.  Almost no one has paid him back for any of his actions, but that's about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is a sophomore in college and she's a cheerleader in addition to being a marketing major.  She's done work modelling and working promotional events and is willing to do anything to get ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad is an up and coming executive for a large company.  He's been placed on the management fast track due to his prestigious education and the connections he's developed over the years.  He's dismissive of many types of people and pretty much anyone that's not as good as he is.  He has the intelligence, looks and build to do whatever he wants and he's almost always successful, but what if that were to change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he reached the field he met up with his friend Nick, who was also on the track squad. While not being quite as good as Josh, Nick was also a nice addition to the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up bro,\" said Josh, greeting Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" responded Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them neared the field, they saw Lily, a 260 pound chemistry major waddling about seemingly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cafeteria is that way,\" said Josh, meriting a high five from Nick. Lily didn't even acknowledge their presence, but was hurt by their comments. Why did those at the top think they could walk all over her? Something was going to have to change, and Lily had a good idea what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Nick finished up a good run and headed to the cafeteria themselves, while Lily was in her lab brewing something up to get even with Josh, that asshole. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She really was brilliant, being able to brew up something in the matter of a few hours. If this formula worked, Josh would turn into a fat chick, a fitting form of revenge for such an asshole. She also had a remedy in the works for once she felt he had learned his lesson, though that could take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-At The Cafeteria-<br>\r\nLily slipped by Josh and emptied the contents of her vial in his soda in a manner so sneaky she herself was surprised. She then sat a few tables away and waited for Josh to take a sip of his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he drank and he drank, but nothing happened! Lily cursed under her breath, what had she done wrong? No matter, she had other things to attend to, she didn't really have time for some elaborate revenge scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh finished his drink just as his girlfriend Cindy arrived. Cindy was a beautiful yet somewhat ditzy cheerleader- though Josh didn't much care about her brains, unless he was fucking them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe,\" she said as she kissed him, \"We on for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he responded, \"I'll text you if anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good for Josh, but things were about to change.</span></div></div>",

Then he felt like, like he was shrinking and swelling up at the same time. He made his way to the bathroom, feeling sick to his stomach, imagining he was going to throw up. However, he didn't even make it to the toilet, because the mirror caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped as he saw himself actually swelling outwards. His entire body was being enveloped in a layer of soft tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat,\" he said absentmindedly as he saw breasts developing upon his belly. His thighs, his ass, his hips, all growing larger and wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and opened them again, only to see his face changing as well, taking on a feminine nature and a double chin. His hair then grew quickly down past his shoulders and to the middle of his back. He was definitely shorter too, a few inches at least. His shirt was stretched to the point where it only covered half if his belly and was tight around his boobs and soft, jiggly arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck,\" he said, also noting his voice was not his own, or at least, quite a bit more feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by instinct, he stepped onto his scale in the bathroom, and he could have sworn he heard it creak under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n262 pounds. 262 pounds?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed between his thighs, hoping to find an old friend, but instead he found an unfamiliar slit in his place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-\" he, or she, stuttered, \"I'm a fat chick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled back and forth, finding all his mannerisms had changed somewhat to deal with all the extra weight and his muscle loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the hell did a track star turn into a fat chick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he had on his mind at the moment was food, it seemed his new fat chick stomach was really hungry, and he fed it as if by instinct. </span></div></div>",

What the hell had happened last night?<br>\r\nRemembering his expanded self, his hands flew to his stomach, but they were met with a familiar six-pack. He sighed with relief, he must have been dreaming. But still, what was up with all of this eaten food around him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt was stretched as well, as if someone bigger than him had been wearing it. When he stood up, he also noticed his pants had torn along the ass, though they had fit him just fine yesterday. Was it all a dream? It didn't seem so. He moved to his bathroom to check his scale, which luckily had a \"Last weight\" feature, he selected this option and a number appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n262.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been real, how else? He thought about what had happened, he had become a fat chick- but now he wasn't one. Why? Would he transform again? He didn't know the answers, but he knew it was best to be prepared. After cleaning up a bit for last nights binge, he made his way to the campus clothes store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the store he picked up some clothes that would stretch with him should he grow again, which he now thought probably would never happen, This was all silly anyway, right? Turning into a fat chick? ABSURD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got the clothes and put them in his bag, then left for the field. </span></div></div>",

There was definitely some movement in the chest area, and soon he felt his whole body, well, jiggling. His pace slowed further has he was now out of breath and he made it to the locker rooms, but barely. His clothes had once again stretched enough to keep him decent, but luckily he had a pair of sweatpants and a shirt that should fit his current frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a second.

He finally did find one, a 38F that was uncomfortably snug, he started to hear some other people enter the locker room and decided then would be a good time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited under a tree for  the crowd of people in the parking lot to disappear.  He realized that probably no one knew which car was his, but the last thing he wanted to have to explain was who he was and why he was in Josh's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempted to just drive home, he knew he needed some clothes.  If this change had occurred during class or somewhere else he'd really be screwed, so thankful that he had that pair of sweats and a shirt that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts driving towards a somewhat run down strip mall in hopes that it wouldn't be too busy.  While waiting for a light to turn green at an intersection, he glances over at the fastfood restaurants off of his right.  In a fit of impatience he makes a right turn and pulls into a dairy queen.  Curious about the two double cheeseburgers for $3 he parks his car and waddles his way to the door.  A cute overweight girl helped him with his order, normally he'd ignore her, but she didn't feel so big in comparison to himself.  In fact his eyes started wandering a bit towards her massive chest, which was surprising given how he treated others who had dated or shown interest in fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And transform he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw as he started to slowly shrink to the ground, losing a few inches of height. Then, the clothes started filling out, his breasts filling the bra nicely, his ass and ample hips touching the jean shorts he was wearing and then filling them out. His belly lazily rolled over his jean shorts, his thighs filled up each leg, and his arms pumped with fat to fill their sleeves. The change was completed by his face turning soft and girly, complete with a double chin, and his hair falling down his back in thick, luscious brown curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger, he thought, it was anger.</span></div></div>",

He twirled his hair, cooking some meals in the microwave and then passing out, not bothering to wash the dishes or glass he used for his dinner if you could call it that.

He starts walking away from campus and towards the nearest place he can find.  He sees a Subway and not much of a crowd so he enters the restaurant.  Maybe it wasn't such a good choice after all as he has to walk by two employees on the way to the bathroom.  He struggles to open it, but it just won't budge.  He knows he's not too far from changing completely, maybe only a few minutes.  Embarassed he knows he'll never make it to another place in time and he can't just change on a street somewhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me... do you have a key for the restroom?\" he asks?  Trying not to make eye contact with the chubby girl behind the counter.  He really needed to pick up some sunglasses.  \"Sure... but it's for customers only....\" she says.  Impatiently waiting for the key, he pulls out his wallet and tosses a few bills at her, grabbing the key and then going to the restroom.  He changes within moments of locking the door behind himself.  Fortunately he brought a change of clothes in his gym bag and begins to change.  He thinks he'll sneak out the back and he leaves the bathroom looking for a way out, but it's obvious that the only way out is the way he came.  The smell of the fresh cooked bread starts to get his attention.  Debating about whether he should just leave or casually go along with it, returning the key and grabbing something small to eat before he goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks to the door.  \"Excuse me s....Miss? I'm going to need that key back.\" the girl behind the counter says.  He hands it over the counter \"Did you see the man that gave you the key?  I thought he was going to order something, but he must've just ran out while I was getting the food prepared in the back.  Anyway he left some money here.\" she says, looking oddly at the key that's for the men's room that he returned.  \"Oh... I'm doing a project with him and we were supposed to meet here, he had to run and it uhhh looks like I'll be doing all the work now...\" he says, surprised he was able to think on his feet like that.  \"Well if he's going to leave you to do all the work, you mine as well get something for it.\"  She says, holding up the ten dollar bill he threw at her.  He makes small talk as he orders a footlong, getting the combo and a cookie along with it.  She starts talking about how much of a jerk that guy she's working is with and isn't surprised that he's leaving her to do all the work on the project.  \"You know he made one of my friends cry once, I can't wait for the day when the shoe is on the other foot\" she says.  \"Oh... I wouldn't worry about that, uhhh holding a grudge never helped anyone...\" he says.  He grabs his food and makes his way out the door.  He goes to a nearby park and finishes his lunch, which calms him down.  He's not too far from home and he can feel as if he's about to change so he heads back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, she checked the footage and saw that a fat girl had never entered the bathroom, and as crazy as this sounded, this was the only explanation she could give. Andrea wondered if she could find the guy on Facebook without a name, she imagined he lived close to the Subway she worked in, probably went to the nearby college. As if by a divine act of God, Andrea found him within 10 minutes of searching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your name is Josh, huh?\" she asked as a smile curled around her face, \"I say Josh, you seem to have gained a few pounds since your profile picture was taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent Josh the friend request, and almost immediately he added her, he was no doubt sitting at his apartment as she typed, probably eating and surfing the web-</span></div></div>",

He's playing around on Facebook, him and Lexi (the salesgirl), were talking on chat.  She was sending him some provactive messages and he started feeling a little hot under the collar.  He found himself looking over her pictures... wondering what her body looked like when it was undressed.  He'd never been attracted to fat girls, but he did enjoy her show the other day.  Not to mention the curious reactions he's been feeling as he saw his female body nude.  He found himself wondering what it would be like to be with a girl with breasts as big as he had, he even found himself squeezing them together and posing a bit.  He wanted to avoid Nick and the rest of campus, but he was bored already and it wasn't even noon.  Perhaps he should invite her over later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought process was distracted by a new friend invitation.  He kind of recognized the girl, but couldn't place her.  Why did she want to be friends with him, but worried that maybe she might have something to do with what's happening to him he added her.  Forgetting about her temporarily he goes back to flirting with Lexi.  Thinking that maybe he should stop and visit her store, after all he's running low on female clothes, when a message comes from the mystery girl.  \"That was an interesting trick you pulled yesterday.  Don't think that no one noticed.\" Andrea wrote.  She didn't want to come out and reveal what she knew.  She was doubting herself and what she saw, thinking maybe she can get him to confess or just brush it off as a mistaken identity.  She didn't need her manager thinking she'd been stalking customers, but she had to know what was going on to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reads the message.  Starting to get scared.  He was sure no one saw him go into the bathroom and no one was waiting for it when he got out.  Did someone see him as he was changing on his way to the Subway?  Perhaps this is a just a prank.  He plays it off for now, but it really does bother him.  Besides he has to find out who did this to him, it had to be intentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could you please ash out the window, better yet put out that damn cigarette!\" he says.  His voice squeaks as he says cigarette.  He cups his mouth and realizes what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, thinking that maybe he's already begun to change.  \"Did it have something to do with anger?  Why was he trying to be so quiet and civil if it wasn't?  Does he think I did this?\" she wonders to herself.  In a few moments it's clear as his body's changing visibly and it looks like he'll soon be the fat girl she saw in the Subway a few days ago.  This changes her plans.  She had hoped to blackmail him a bit and humiliate him in the process.  She didn't have a trust fund to pay her expenses and she had to live in a dumpy apartment without much furniture, work 30+ hours a week and take out a ton of student loans.  He deserved to pay for being such a jerk and she knew that she deserved a break.  They pull up at her place, in front of her 10 year old car and walk towards her apartment.  She smiles, enjoying how different he looks.  By the time they get to her door he looks like a woman from the neck down, but still looks like himself, albeit a slightly fat and feminine version.  She takes her time fishing her keys out of her purse, enjoying watching how nervous he appears.  She opens the door and shows him around her apartment.  He's not at all impressed, but she asks him to get comfortable and familiarize himself with the place.  She disappears into the kitchen and when she returns with two drinks, she finds him in her bedroom trying to fit into the female clothes he brought over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring a bathing suit?  If not go ask the girl across the hall from one, tell her your a friend of mine and that we're going out on my patio to enjoy the sun.\" she says.  He looks at her sympathetically, afraid to be seen wearing one and shy about asking her neighbor.  \"Well?  Are you going to do it or not?  I've made a second video of you transforming and I can upload the two of them if you're not going to be more co-operative.\" she says, smiling wickedly.  \"Fine.... I'll do it...ok???\" as he finishes putting on the female clothes.  She changes into a conservative looking bathing suit and lies out on her back porch, with a drink and a few snacks.  Smiling as a she gets an idea, she picks up her phone and shoots her neighbor a text.  10 minutes later she hears the screen door sliding open and out steps Josh in a two piece that shows exactly how big he's become mincing about in a matching pair of pink platform heels, the swimsuit appeared a little too small up top and below as he keeps trying to tug his bikini bottom so it covers more of his large backside.  She notices a camel toe and realizes that he's fully female as if she couldn't tell that from his G cup breasts.  \"I made you a drink Josh.  Now why don't you lie out and we can figure out what we're going to do about you\" she says as she pulls out some nail polish and suntan lotion.</span></div></div>",

She feels like doing a cartwheel as she enters into her apartment, or rather her old apartment and gets started typing up the agreement, as she wants to make it binding.  She orders the pizza, another wicked smile on her face as she orders two pizzas and an order of breadsticks.  \"Is Frank working today?  Great!  Could you have him stop by with them later, it's no rush.\"  she asked the man who was taking her order.  Fifteen minutes later the agreement was typed, printed and ready to be signed, she also printed up a picture of him in the most 'seductive' pose she caught of him in the revealing bikini.  The food was on it's way and she couldn't wait to get to her new apartment.  She noticed his wallet was on the counter.  \"Hmmmm... how would he pay for that pizza if he was a few dollars short\" she thinks, smiling wickedly and removing all but seventeen dollars from his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands him the picture first, dangling the contract in the air.  She's more than two inches taller than him and she'd have to guess he was 5'5\" at the most.  If he'd kept the heels on he'd have no problems catching it.  \"How do you think you look sweet cheeks? I want you to autograph that to an admirer, after all you look so sexy in it.\" she says smiling, not expecting him to sign it, but just getting an incredible thrill from teasing him.  He grits his teeth, having trouble grabbing the agreement.  Restraining himself from just tackling her and beating the shit out of her.  No, he needed to stay composed.  He'd get everything back, once he figures out what caused this and changes it, he assures himself.  Playing along he takes the picture and pen, writing \"To my biggest admirer\", he was going to add love, Josh, but that'd be just more evidence and sound ridiculous.  Thanks to the makeup she put on him, he decides that will be the perfect goodbye and kisses the picture of him right below where he wrote.  \"There!  Are you happy???  Now give me the contract!\".  She smiles giving it to him, her smile somehow grew even bigger when she saw he'd signed it.  \"Now it's official tubs! Looks like this dump is yours now!  I'm off to MY apartment, but don't worry the deliveryman will be by any moment with your dinner.  Won't that cheer you up?\"  She smiles.  Wishing she had eyes to see what would happen after she left.  Frank, the delivery man had a thing for bigger girls and right now Josh was a very curvy size 24.  She wondered how he'd make up for the missing money, before entering his or now her BMW and leaving.  She made a Facebook event \"Housewarming at my new apartment on Saturday!\"</span></div></div>",

The more he saw her pictures on Facebook, the more attractive she became. He sent her the address for the party, not having a car to pick her up in anymore, and then he hopped onto Andrea;s old bicycle.

He just wanted him gone so he flashed, jiggled and bounced his F-cup breasts for the delivery man as he rubbed up against him, thankful that was enough as the deliveryman left with a huge smile on his face.  All he wanted to do was just kick off his heels and unwind, as he took a pizza box and brought it over to the couch.  Helping himself to a few slices, some of the cheese and toppings falling and landing on his massive chest as he sat sprawled out on the couch.  Thankful the apartment has air conditioning he reaches for the remote to the old tv that is now the centerpiece of his poorly appointed apartment and begins to flick through the channels.  His fat legs lying over the side of the couch, as he dangles his heels and they soon fall off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets a text message.  \"I can't wait to take you shopping for something sexy... my housewarming party is next weekend and you're my guest of honor, doesn't that sound fun?\"  He groans.  Taking another huge slice as he tries to figure out what he's going to do.  Did he really just give up his sweet apartment for this dump?  When he changes back he realizes he'll just have another set of problems.  If he doesn't get his old figure back what will happen to his social life, he wonders.  Maybe there's a way to prevent himself from changing back, at least temporarily.  He can handle looking like this, after all no one knows who he is, but every time he changes back he has to worry when the next change will come and it almost seems like each time he changes back into a man, he becomes more and more out of shape.  Perhaps its time he came up with an identity for her, he knew someone who made fake ids as he'd been going to the most popular bars and clubs near campus since he was 19.</span></div></div>",

His memories had been replaced by Vanessa. He recalled having sex with feminine men, not any type of women. He didn't remember ever going to a sports bar, only gay bars. Images of gay porn flooded his mind pushing out images of naked women. He forgot what Internet sites had the porn he used to like. His confidence was eroding as he was becoming unsure of himself. <br>\r\nMark could see that Ken was shaken. He was overcome by a strong desire to protect and comfort his boyfriend. He froze, but Ken isn't his boyfriend. His thoughts were altering as well trying to adjust to the suggestion Ken instilled in him. Being homophobic, he was very conflicted. He had a low opinion of gays but he couldn't resist his intense attraction to Ken. And if he was gay, his homophobia demanded that he behave in a certain stereotypical way. Try as he may, he couldn't muster any attraction to women. Thoughts of tits and pussies were replaced with cocks and balls. The more he tried to think of women he had screwed, the more boring it became until he finally gave up. He suddenly realized that sex with women was unfulfilling and awkward. But, men! Something inside Mark's mind shattered. He was attracted to men. They were hot, fun, exciting, sexy! Cocks were delicious. But he wasn't gay. Was he? The final barrier came down. Yes, he was and it was wonderful! Still in his mind, gays acted in a certain way so he adopted the stereotypical fag behavior. His wrists went limp. His hip swayed to one side. And he suddenly developed a very pronounced lisp.<br>\r\n\"Oh, thweetie. Come here, let me give you some loving!\" Mark said as he hugged his lover. Ken nuzzled his head against his big, strong boyfriend's shoulder.</span></div></div>",

All he could remember was that they were abstract.  The worst thing about it all was his sex drive seemed off.  His aerobics instructor neighbor was out sunning on her balcony just moments ago.  Perhaps intentionally giving him such an amazing view of her tight, toned body.

He flirted with her and it didn't take much for them to go out and fool around in the backseat of his Mercedes.  After they both came, he was scratching his head at what he just did.  Did he really just fuck this girl?  \"Yeah...yeah baby... I'll call you... we'll definitely do that some time... promise...\" he says as he slowly gets her out of his car.

It was one that Brad had his own a year ago, but it was occupied by Jennings then. It had a better view and 10 square feet more room. 10 square feet may seem trivial, but Brad gets steamed just the same. This Mark is competition. Brad recognizes the type and well he should.

Brad says a little mantra to settle himself down before walking over for an introduction. \"Hello Brad, I want you to meet the newest member of the team. This is Mark Hartman we just stole him away from Sands\", The old man says. Brad takes his hand and sizes him up. Mark does the same. Brad feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.

Mark the offer still stands, If you need anything just let me know\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The meeting is routine. Afterwards Brad returns to his office.

She claps her hands the lights go out and candles all over the room light. Brad sits down. Nancy takes his hands, closes her eyes, and starts mumbling what just sounds like nonsense to Brad. After a few minutes the table starts to shake and a breeze comes blowing through even though all the windows and doors are closed. Some of the candles go out.

Brad calms down for a moment and says, \"Yeh, your right, but this won't work. I don't know anything about how to act as a woman and everybody at the company knows me as Brad, man\". \"Do not worry. The Goddess provides for all. The world, aside from me will not even remember Brad\", Nancy answers. \"No, no, this is crazy. Tell the Goddess she needs to try something else. This is not what I paid for\", Brad replies. Nancy sighs and says, \"Brad, that would be unwise as it would make the Goddess angry and trust me you don't want to make the Goddess angry\".</span></div></div>",

That's what's wrong!\" Brad spits out while gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n\"Oh, pooh. That was just a friendly kiss between two women. Haven't you been telling me that I should become more tolerant of gays and lesbians? You know how disgusting I thought it was. You said that some of your business involves working with that type of people. Well, myself and a few of the ladies from church decided that maybe we should try to 'love our enemy.' Try to be more tolerant. Some of the older parishioners pooh-poohed the idea. But we did remind them that our Lord did administer to prostitutes and thieves. Perhaps we could convert those from their misbegotten path like Sam.\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain what was going on here!\" Brad said, a little less angry but still confused.<br>\r\n\"Well, for the last few weeks a few of us, Sally Anne, Mary Terese, Kelly, Tiffany, and Elizabeth have gone to a lesbian bar for drinks. We want to see what it was like, They were so sweet to us. So many of them bought drinks for us. They sat down and chatted with us about all sorts of things, not just about gay things. They enjoy some of the same things we do. A couple of very religious as well.  We danced and laughed and had a real good time. After just a couple of weeks, it didn't seem so strange. They showed us how women can be close but not gay. We somehow got used to it. It seemed almost natural that women could show such affection to each other and not be gay. We have gone there every single day for, let's see,\" Grace was counting on her fingers. \"About two months.\"<br>\r\n\"Two months?\" Brad interjected.<br>\r\n\"I know, it didn't seem like two months, but it has been. Kelly hit it off with them right away. She really developed a rapport with them, especially this one girl named Muffdiver. I don't know if that her first or last name. Some of the ladies like Tiffany and Elizabeth, you know how impressionable they can be, got tattoos and piercings just the girls at the bar. Sally Anne really enjoyed dancing with them and has them over to her house several times. Mary Terese has invited them to church even and they came. I thought, since Sally Anne has had them over to her house, the least I could do was invite one over for dinner. Sam is such a darling and she said she wanted to meet you too. Anyway, I was showing her our lovely home. She really does think it is quite beautiful. She even compared me to Martha Stewart. Can you believe it? Martha Stewart! Anyway, she I showed her the bedroom, she remarked how warm she felt. So she laid down on the bed and removed her clothes. They do that a lot. I can't tell you how shocked we were the first time they did it. But it really is quite comfortable. But, anyway, at first we were shocked, but we were determined to be accepting of those unlike us. And, you must admit, the female body is so beautiful. That's something else we've come to learn from these women. We've being watching them kiss and caress and hug and touch each other so much that it doesn't even faze us in the least anymore. We've even caught ourselves doing the same thing without thinking about it. I really don't think there's any homosexual with two women showing such affection to each other.Like I said, it seems so natural after going to thast bar for so long. You see it all the time,\" Grace shrugged as if nothing was wrong.</span></div></div>",

It was just like Grace said. Everyone at the bar was friendly and not threatening. Agreeable and fun. It only took a couple of weeks before they saw the acceptance in the church group's eyes. Soon it started to go beyond acclimation but into inundation. Finally, lesbianism seem the norm for them. <br>\r\nNow Brad needed a quicker, more intense treatment. She faced Brad toward a table. She put her laptop on it and began playing a hypnotic loop. It whispered words like fag, gay, feminine, cock-sucker and other trigger phrases. Images flashed of gay porn. Sam theorized that even thought his eyes were closed. The thin layer of skin would still register the images.<br>\r\nSam crawled back into bed with Grace and began whispering commands softly in her ear, knowing her mind was receptive in her somnambulist state.<br>\r\nAfter almost 30 minutes, Brad eyes began to flutter open. His head still ached and a buzzing seemed to be in his ears. He quickly realized that he was restrained in a chair. Drool was formed in his mouth.

Both seemed to be looking at each other, almost as strangers.<br>\r\nSam snickered. Less than a couple hours ago, these to lovebirds were devoted to each other. Now they want nothing to do with each other or even their gender.<br>\r\nHer video worked perfectly. This morning she invited herself in and played the first video as part of a sales pitch for Grace. Grace did think she had spent several weeks visiting a lesbian bar, but that was just to weaken her resolve. It took several hours of conditioning until she completely succumbed to wanting to be a lesbian. Brad was far quicker.<br>\r\n\"Now, now, girls,\" Sam interjected. \"Let;'s go out and have some fun.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah,  just want stay here and fuck some more. Teach me more how to be lesbian,\" Grace demanded.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll go,\" Brad said and minced out the front door.<br>\r\nThe video he had been watching gave him a sense that he had visited several gay bars, but when he went to those locations, none were to be found. Searching his phone, he found a nearby gay bar. In fact, it even had male strippers. Brad couldn't wait to check it out. He just had to have a man.<br>\r\nParking quickly, he swished his way into the bar. Sure enough, three male strippers were dancing. Brad felt an overwhelming urge to suck each one of those dicks. He hesitated for a moment. Something didn't feel right. He wasn't gay. He was married, wasn't he? To a woman? He shuddered at the thought. No, he couldn't be. And just because he wanted to suck dicks didn't mean he was gay. He was merely a faggot. That thought tingled down his spine.<br>\r\nHe ordered a drink from that dark-haired bartender, lingering his hand over his for a bit longer than necessary.<br>\r\nNow, to find a man to date, Brad thought. He was very determined to satisfy his sexual needs tonight. <br>\r\nHe flirted and danced with several good-looking hunks. His cock had been hard for almost an hour with all these sweating men rubbing about against him. Finally, he chose his target. He licked his lips and proceeded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't have a wife, silly.\"<br>\r\n\"What about that blonde that stopped by the office a few times?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's just some dyke I live with. I'm making new living arrangements,\" Brad blew in Anthony's ear.<br>\r\nAnthony was incredibly turned on by that. He could feel Brad's hard cock against his. Anthony could feel himself falling for Brad's charms.<br>\r\nBrad lowered to Anthony's crotch. He kissed the bulge in Anthony's jeans. Anthony's eyes rolled back.<br>\r\nBrad fished out the raging hard-on and enveloped it all at once. For someone who was straight just a few hours before, Brad proved to be an excellent cock-sucker. He made love to Anthony's cock. His tongue rolled around the cock head, savoring each curve. The bulbous tip expanded with Brad's attentive licking. Brad stroked the shaft.<br>\r\nAnthony was about to cum when Brad softly pinched the base of the cock to prevent him cumming and continued his cock-sucking.<br>\r\nAnthony was out of his mind, delirious with sexual delight. He would do anything Brad wanted.<br>\r\nBrad stood up and whispered in Anthony's ear. He continued to stroke Anthony's cock.<br>\r\n\"I've never had a cock up my ass before. I really need you to show me how to be completely gay.\"</span></div></div>",

Didn't he already say that he was already gay all this time?  Brad was acting like this was all a new experience for him.  And what about that blond woman at the office?  Anthony was definitely sure that she was <i>not</i> a dyke.  He saw her kiss Brad more than once and never did he see her checking out other women.  No, there was definitely something strange going on here.

It made her look kind of intimidating, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" Sam asked Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Anthony, my date,\" he answered.  \"He promised he'd butt-fuck me if I brought him home with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Anthony asked.

Anthony moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace, why don't you bring him to the bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" she said, smirking.  She grabbed him, but found it difficult to haul him to the bedroom.  Man, she needed to go to the gym and pump some iron.  She was way too weak.  Eventually, she was able to get him there.

He only had a moment to wonder who this man was and what he was doing in his house, and why he was calling him \"honey\", before the unknown man <i>kissed</i> him!  On the lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad pushed the guy off of him.  \"Ugh.  Who the hell are you?  How did you get in my house?\" he asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, who was wearing a tight shirt and equally tight pants, and had styled hair and an earring in one ear, looked confused towards Brad.  \"What do you mean, sweetie?\" he asked, with a slight lisp.  It's me.  Greg.  Your husband?\"  Then his confused look turned into a smile.  \"Oh, you're just playing around, aren't you?  We haven't done role playing for a while.  So who am I this time?  A cute burglar who needs to be taught a lesson for breaking into people's homes?\" he asked, flirtatiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad just stared at this guy.  Did this obvious gay man think that he was stupid?  That he's buying his bullshit story?  Brad was about to call the cops to get this nutball arrested, but then he stopped.  There was a very noticeable family resemblance with the guy.  He looked a lot like Grace.  He could even be Grace's brother, if she had one.  Could it be?  No, it was impossible.  He just saw his wife that morning.  There's no way someone could have surgically altered her in that amount of time.  But he couldn't stop thinking that maybe this man <i>was</i> Grace.  That somehow she had been turned into this man.  This <i>gay</i> man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hated gays.  Especially the ones that acted like women.  Like this guy right here.  But if this was actually Grace ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he thinking?  This man couldn't be Grace.  It must have been all a put on.  It ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped again, as his eyes landed on a photo hanging on the wall in the downstairs hallway.  He walked over to it, in a daze, and looked at it.  Instead of him and his wife, embracing and smiling at the camera, it was him and this Greg guy.  In fact, <i>all</i> the photos in the house had Greg in place of Grace.  Smiling, hugging, <i>kissing</i>.  He even saw some gay pride memorabilia around.  Could it be that someone photoshopped all those photos and placed all that gay stuff in his house?  The more he saw, however, the more he realized that (as impossible as it seemed) reality had changed somehow, giving him a life where Grace had been born male and gay, and married <i>him</i>.  But wouldn't that mean that Brad was gay too?  He didn't feel gay.  Not in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad had to figure out what happened to his wife and try to get her back.  Because no way was he going to spend the rest of his life with this fag.</span></div></div>",

He needed the time to clear his head and wrap his mind around what apparently had happened to his wife.

But what happened at home was only the beginning.  Apparently, all Brad had to do was accept his life changes and reality would stop being altered.  But, of course, he wasn't giving in.  And so, another part of his life had been changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, the division that he managed at the corporation he worked for no longer existed.  Instead, a new place appeared across the street from the corporation and all of Brad's employees now worked <i>there</i> instead.  But what kind of place was this?  It was a salon, one which Brad now owned and managed.  And to fit in better with the salon (and Brad's new life, which he still wasn't accepting), his employees were changed, each having the expertise and desire to work in a salon and losing all the experience and expertise to work anywhere else, especially the business they worked for in Brad's previous life.  The women weren't all that different, but the <i>men</i> ... they were now all stereotypical flamboyantly gay hairdressers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into his driveway at home, Brad was about to get out of his car and face his new (he cringed) husband.  But paused when he got a call.  Answering his cellphone, he heard an effeminate-sounding man on the other end.  \"Hey, darling.  I'm glad I caught ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'th Thtevie.  Thtevie Thomerth?

And then it all came back to him.  It wasn't all some terrible dream.  For some reason, reality was changing all around him and he couldn't stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up on the couch, he grabbed his cellphone, seeing that he had a number of missed calls.  Another one from Stevie, and other ones from people named Ricky (he knew a guy named Richard at work), Danny (he knew a guy named Dan at work), and Kristy (okay, he actually knew this person, as she was his secretary).  Tossing the phone on the coffee table, he then stretched and looked around the living room.  It looked the same as the previous night, so it seemed that nothing more had changed.  Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creaking on the stairs caught his attention and he watched as Greg walked downstairs, dressed only in a metallic pink thong.  \"Hey, sweetie.  I hope you're feeling better this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Brad said grumpily, turning away from the mostly naked guy.  He really did not want to see another man in his underwear, especially when his underwear was a thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Greg said, with a pout.  \"Well, I know what will cheer you up.  How about I make pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that sounds kind of good,\" he relented.  He skipped dinner last night and he was hungry.  Why not get some food for free?  And if Greg really was Grace, then maybe he made pancakes as good as his wife did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super,\" Greg said, smiling.  Then he swished into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Brad found himself at the kitchen table, waiting for his (he still didn't want to think about it) husband to finish making breakfast.  And it was at this time when Greg turned and said \"Don't forget.  You're supposed to meet Charlie today at noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was a guy he and Grace knew at their Baptist church.  He was one of the church administrators.  But why did Charlie want to meet him?  He didn't remember setting up a meeting.  In fact, the only meeting he knew he had today was with his company's CEO.  He was sure that he was going to get that promotion he was striving for.  Little did he know, he no longer worked there and no one at that company ever <i>remembered</i> him working there.  Instead, he was the owner and manager of the salon across the street from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to Charlie ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants me to meet him at the church?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Church?  What church?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Our</i> church?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, we don't <i>go</i> to church,\" Greg said, concerned about Brad.  \"And neither does Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible.  He <i>works</i> at the church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad, Charlie works for the Center.  You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Center?\"  What the hell was this guy talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked even more concerned, putting his hands on his hips.  \"The LGBT Support Center.  You know, the one downtown, that we go to every week?\"  Seeing that Brad still didn't remember, he added \"The building on 5th and Oak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad's eyes went wide.  That was the location of the downtown Baptist church.  But ... that could only mean that ... the church and everyone who went to it had changed ... they had all turned into homosexuals!  Suddenly, his taste for pancakes disappeared in a puff of smoke.  More than anything, he now felt like throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell was happening to his life?!  Who or what was doing this to him?!  His life was slowly unraveling and there was nothing he could do to stop it!</span></div></div>",

He lovingly gazed upon this 58-year-old woman trying to act and look young, but failing. He didn't care. He knew she didn't know how to suck cock. He knew she still snuck cigarettes, because he could taste it when they kissed. Those saggy tits of hers were like warm bags of jello which now slid to her sides almost under her armpits. Her nipples were extended and looked cracked but to him they were sexy. He licked and sucked them with vigor. He slide him hand between her legs. She was beginning menopause so her pussy wasn't getting wet. He licked his fingers to prepare her.With his other hand, he massaged her soft, jiggly belly. That made her feel a bit self-conscious but she whispered to me. \"Fuck me, baby. Fuck me hard.\"<br>\r\nThat's all the encouragement he needed.<br>\r\nHe plunged his hard cock in her with one strong thrust as he inhaled that old lady smell. It hurt her a bit but she knew she had to fuck this youngster for a happy marriage. She did love him. He made her feel young. He made her life exciting as only a young man could.<br>\r\nHe fucked and she bucked. She began to cum. That would happen every so often at her age. In truth, Brad was the only man ever to make her cum. He continued to pound her like crazy and she grabbed onto him and shuddered with orgasmic pleasure. He made one final, dramatic thrust and came deep inside her, secretly happy that she was well-beyond her child-bearing years.<br>\r\nHe rolled off her and she was hoping he was happy. He smiled and cupped her tits. He nuzzled his face between them just like he remember how his mother would. Grace, of course, had no idea. She thought it was all her.

She had long gray hair kept in a pony tail. She was easily more than 60 years old and the years of smoking showed on her skin which was tanned and wrinkled. Her blouse was low cut, revealing an ample bosom. Her make-up  and mini-skirt indicated an desire to deceive people that she was much younger than she was. Brad gasped as he viewed the sex goddess that he met only two or three times before.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Brad, so sorry. I was looking for the super,\" Babs said flirtatiously. \"I got a small problem in my apartment.\" Her voice gravelly from years of smoking.<br>\r\nBrad gulped. He could feel his pants tent. He wasn't sure but he thought I noticed Babs noticed as well.<br>\r\nBabs leaned in close. \"Would you be a dear and take a look? Hmmm, please,\" she asked coquettishly. A whiff of cigarette wafted up his nostril.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he croaked, holding back an incredibly desire to kiss her.<br>\r\nSheepishly, he followed her to the elevator and downstairs. Strangely, no one else seem to be in the hallways.<br>\r\nShe unlocked her apartment door and invited Brad in. He struggled to hide his erection but Babs stood in the dorrway so he had to rub up against her as he entered. He looked aorund and saw several photos of a younger Babs. She ushered him over to the kitchen sink.<br>\r\n\"My water faucet is dripping,\" she sighed with a non-chalant shrug.<br>\r\nBrad took a glance and knew what was wrong. The super mentioned that Babs liked to loosen the aerator on her faucet in an attempt to get him to give her attention when she was feeling lonely.<br>\r\nWith a quick twist, he tightened it and the dripping stopped.<br>\r\n\"You're such a whiz. Here, let me test it,\" she insisted.<br>\r\nShe \"accidentally\" turned on the water and spray nozzle at the same time. She squirted her blouse and Brad's shirt. Her water-soaked blouse revealed that she didn'y have a bra on anymore. Her nipples hanging, pointing downwar to her crotch. Brad could not stop staring and breathing heavy.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am so sorry,\" she feigned. \"Let me dry that for you.\" She started unbuttoning his shirt and he offered no resistance. She tossed it into the dryer. <br>\r\nWhen she turned around and saw that he was bare-chested, Babs decided that she should be too \"to dry her clothes as well. We're about grown adults so it shouldn't matter,\" she teased.<br>\r\nBefore she could even pull her blouse over her head, Brad had one of her dark nipples in his mouth.<br>\r\nHer tits sagged lower than Grace's had. The cellutlite and pudginess turned him on all the more. <br>\r\nSoon he was thrusting insideof her and she was in orgamsic heaven. Both came in a matter of minutes. Before he could recover, she started sucking his dick and he was hard again as he watched that gray-head bob up and down on his cock. He flipped her over and began fucking her flabby ass, her glorious flabby ass. With each thrust, he could hear those sagging tits flop against her.<br>\r\nBabs was cumming again. She hadn't had this much action in years. She wasn;'t about the stop anytime soon. When she felt that Brad was abpout to cum, she flipped over and shoved his face between her legs. Brad nuzzled the gray-haired pussy and licked as if he was devouring ambrosia. Again Babs came holding Brad's firm as he shoved his tongue deep inside her.<br>\r\n\"Fuck me again, baby,\" Babs gasped and Brad need no more incentive.<br>\r\nHe fucked her and fucked her hard. He could feel the entire length of his cock inside her and he could feel himself cum.<br>\r\nBoth let out a low groan and collasped.<br>\r\nThe bell on teh dryer went off and Brad realized that eh was late for work. Grabbing one final kiss, he hastily donned his shiort and left.

His first meeting wasn't util near lunchtime. The early morning romp helped clear his mind so he was about to get much accomplished. He was distracted only a couple of times when a coupel of secretaries near retirement age could his attention and prompted little fantasies.<br>\r\nThe end of the work day arrived and Brad hurried home.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace was in the kitchen licking chocolate pudding off her fingers. She turned away embarrassed. The strings of the apron she wore were in the tiniest knot possible to accomodate her girth. Her ass was twice the size of Brad's. Her whole body seemed stuffed to the limit.<br>\r\nAt first, Brad was disappointed that the old Grace wasn't back but again his memories were altering to fit his newly-designed spouse.<br>\r\nHis first sexual experience wasn't with a slim cheerleader but a chubby girl who comforted him when the cheerleader dumped him for a football player. One thing lead to another and soon he was losing his virignity to this girl with \"a great personality.\" Memories of every girl he fucked after that was heavier than he remembered. They weren't cheerleaders or gymasts. Instead they were pie-eating, cupcake-eating, or hot dog eating champions. None were concerned about their weight, but rather obsessed with food and cooking. Every satisfying sexual experience involved an overweight girl.<br>\r\nHe now stared at Grace with great desire. His cock rose out of his pants and pointed at his wife.<br>\r\nHer little pig-like face squinted with delight. \"Is that for me?\" she said. She was far too fat to drop to her knees so she pushed onto the kitchen table and gobbled his rigid cock like a popsicle. The one great thing about fat chicks, Brad thought, is that they have oral fixations. She licked and sucked unti he came and she swallowed his cum without complaint.<br>\r\n\"God, that made me hungry,\" she sighed.<br>\r\nShe always said that but he didn't care. She resumed finishing dinner and setting the table. He watched her waddle around. Her arms wiggled was she set the plates. Her legs jiggled as she carried the food. Her boobs could hardly be contained. (She purposely wore a bra one size too small for that effect because she knew he loved it. And she wanted to do anything to please him so he wouldn't stray.) Fat bulged from the sides of her dress.<br>\r\nBrad's head was in a haze of sexual desire as he watched her eat, building up her strength for round two. Before she got to the desert, he knew he had to have her.<br>\r\nShe could see it in his eyes. Desert would have to wait. She couldn't deny her man anything.<br>\r\nHe planted a deep, passionate kiss on those pufy lips and he brsuhed his fingers against those cubby cheeks. Without breaking the kiss, he lead her to the bedroom. He stripped quickly as she undressed slowly. Grace did nothing fast. She undid her apron and slid off her dress looking like a grape peeling itself. Her humugous tits pressed against the bra. he watched as they burst loose and flopped out like pancakes with cherries on top. He had to help remove her stockings and panties because she had trouble bending over.<br>\r\nAs she laid back on the bed, Brad took in the view of her expanse. Those thunder thighs were so inviting. Her flabby tits covering most o her chest down to that rotund belly. She was licking chocolate pudding off her sausage like fingers because she just couldn't wait.<br>\r\nBrad spread her legs and darted tongued first into that pussy dwarfed by the massive skin around it. She wiggled and giggled as her frist orgams build. As was so often the case, she reached over and tried to grab his dick to suck. Her lack of flexibility prevented that so she grabbed the strawberry-flavored dildon on the nightstand. As he sucked, so did she. His tongue traveled out of her sopping wet pussy and over the protruding belly. He inhaled one massive puffy nipple into his mouth as he rammed his dick into her. He shoved it in so hard the dildo fell out of her mouth.<br>\r\nHe pounded away, slapping his thighs against her. He had to fuck her hard because that's how she liked it. She came again, screaming out loud. But he wasn't done.<br>\r\nBrad flipped Grace over and jammed his cock into her ass. She wasn't fond of anal sex but, not wanting to risk any type of rejection, she let him. Fortunately her ass was so big he never really entered her. He was really just fucking her cheeks.<br>\r\nGrace was able to grab the candy dildo and chewed on it like Brad pounded away. He reached around to grab a handful of tit. It felt like a huge warm marshmallow. He could feel the nipple get hard (more from the joy of eating candy than ass fucking). Finally he came, squriting cum all over her ass.<br>\r\nHe fell to his side of the bed.<br>\r\nGrace said, \"God, that made me hungry,\" She got up and waddled into the kitchen to finish desert and enjoy a snack.<br>\r\nHe knew he would fuck her at least twice more that night. she never resisted.</span></div></div>",

With that, he could feel his dick twitch.<br>\r\nHe joined his wife at the table and finished his meal as Grace ate his and hers desert.<br>\r\nAs Grace scooped out the last bit of chocolate pudding with her finger, Brad was hard again. He stood next to her with his hard cock pointing at her face. Without hesitation, Grace began sucking his cock. Brad leaned over and caressed his wife's flab which only made him harder. In moments, he came and she swallowed.<br>\r\nAs he predicted, he did fuck Grace twice more before falling asleep. He felt her great weight tilt the bed as she rolled over to her side of the bed. He dozed off.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Brad was stunned as once again his wife had reverted to her thin self. Disappointed and sexually frustrated, he shower and left for work before she awoke. He had no idea what to say to her.<br>\r\nBrad left a little earlier than usual so he could avoid Babs. He was sure she would lie in wait for him. He slipped into the elevator and made it to the first floor without incident. He turned the corner and knocked over another tenant. Her name was Julie and the lovely lady clearly tipped the scales at 300 pounds.<br>\r\nBrad apologized as he helped her up. He felt her fleshy arm as he assisted her to her  stout feet. Due to his sexual frustration, his arousal was becoming apparent.<br>\r\nBrad was a good looking guy and Julie hadn't gotten laid for almost a year since her ex dumped her. She smiled.<br>\r\n\"Listen, my apartment is right around the corner, if you'd like to stop in for a cup of coffee,\" she sparkled.<br>\r\nBrad couldn't resist her obese charms.<br>\r\nAs soon as the door closed, they were naked and fucking each other. Brad enjoyed every bit of flab he could fondle. He nibbled those flabby tits and grabbed handfuls for that plump ass as he pumped as hard as he could.<br>\r\nAgain he was late for work.<br>\r\nBrad lingered a bit longer than he should during lunchtime as he watched a few of the ladies enjoy their meals.<br>\r\nIt was a terribly long day at work.<br>\r\nBrad left a message that he'd be late. When he finally arrived home, he was in for a surprise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No dinner was ready and Grace was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the front door burst open and in walked a teenaged Grace.<br>\r\nShe was carrying a couple bags of clothes and jewelry. She had to stand on her tip-toes to kiss Brad.<br>\r\nJust like the couple of night before, Brad's head began to spin and his memories twisted around.<br>\r\nHe suddenly began to fear getting old. He did things just to feel younger.<br>\r\nHe suddenly remembered how he met Grace. She's was a waitress at the mall he frequented.<br>\r\n\"Like, I bought some really cute things. You're going to love them,\" Grace chirped. Her Iphone beeped and she dropped everything to answer it.<br>\r\n\"OMG, it Betty,\" Grace turned away from Brad and began chatting away.<br>\r\nBrad was getting hornier and hornier just looking at her. His 19-year-old wife had small boobs and a thin butt. She was a brunette with straight hair. She was a virgin until their wedding night just last week. But she was young and that is what was making Brad so horny.<br>\r\nBrad began nuzzling Grace's neck and she giggled.<br>\r\n\"I have to go, Betty,\" she giggled. \"I have to perform my wifely duties. I know. I'll call you later.\"<br>\r\nShe turned around and began kissing Brad. Her kisses were like little pecks. She only had one other boyfriend before Brad so her kisses were tame.<br>\r\nBoth of them were naked in moments.<br>\r\nGrace blushed and giggled nervously.<br>\r\nBrad's cock was as hard as a rock.<br>\r\nBrad felt Grace's inexperience as she roughly handled his cock, tugging and pulling it. He knew she wouldn't ever put her mouth by it because it \"was eww, so gross.\"<br>\r\nMoving her hand away from his cock, he scooped up the teen-ager and carried her into the bedroom. It was the only place she felt comfortable enough to fool around in.<br>\r\nHe placed her on the bed and gazed at the mall boobs and plain face blushing with excited nervousness.<br>\r\nHe climbed on top of her. His hand covered her tiny boob.  His other hand cupped both her buttocks. He pressed her against his chest. <br>\r\nSome more kissing and he moved his hand from her ass to her pussy. Her pubic hair was wispy even for a 19-year-old.<br>\r\nAs soon as he felt her pussy become wet, he plunged his rock-hard cock into her. She still gasped in slight discomfort. She still wasn\u2019t used to penetration but she knew she had to get used to it. He began to ride her. Sliding in and out. Grace remained perfectly still, not knowing what to do but wanting to satisfy her husband.<br>\r\nThe thought of this young body underneath his older one caused Brad to cum. Grace\u2019s inexperience did nothing to enhance the sexual experience for him.<br>\r\nAs soon as he came, she slid out from under him and cuddled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The elastic snapped against his ear, stinging it sharply.<br>\r\nGrace stood beside him, tossing the mask aside. She was clad in a black leather corset, with exposed her nipples and pussy. In one hand, she held a large, veiny pink dildo and brandished a whip in the other. Long-black fishnet stockings connected to the corset with ribboned garter straps. Her blonde hair tightly pulled back with a jet black scrunchie.<br>\r\n\"Your attitude is about to change. Tom showed me some websites that enlightened me. Women are the ones who wield power.

There was barely any left anyway, so Grace didn't notice that he had purposely stopped himself from drinking from it.  What the hell was he doing?!  Drinking cum?

It was like she was a completely different person.  Was his loving wife Grace gone forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang suddenly, causing Grace to walk out of the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's at the door?\" Brad asked, as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's none of your business, fag!\" she shouted back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shivered with horniness.  He knew he shouldn't feel that way, but Grace calling him a fag was just such a turn-on.  How was he ever going to get back to normal after this?  While Grace was gone, he tried his best to get free of his bindings, but it was no use.  He was securely in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Grace returned with another dominatrix-looking woman.  Unlike Grace who was wearing black leather, this other woman was dressed in black latex.  He focused on her, thinking he must have seen her somewhere before, and then it came to him in total shock.  It was Mary Brown, the wife of John Brown, the pastor of their church!  She would never dress like this.  What was going on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to meet my new girlfriend, fag,\" Grace said.  \"This is Mary.  And she's going to be spending a lot of time with us.\"  She then put her arm around the former very religious, homophobic, and prudish woman, before kissing her, plunging her tongue deep in the woman's mouth.  Mary didn't try to stop it.  In fact, she seemed to like it, a lot.  And after just a few seconds, both dominatrices were madly making out with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just too much for Brad to handle.  His wife had turned into some kind of sadistic lesbian dominatrix, and now the pastor's wife was apparently the same way.  What the hell was happening?!</span></div></div>",

Oh and after that, pick up my dry cleaning and buy yourself lunch one me *looking her over* even though it's obvious that you don't need it.\" He laughs and disappears into his office.  She smiles, she has no idea whether there are any resources their to be secured, however she has been reading various stories about the tribal elders also known as witchmen and the legends of how they've treated threatening outsiders.  Part of her knew it was a cruel thing to do, the rumors couldn't be true, but in such a dangerous place he might find himself killed.  She was having second thoughts, until that last remark.  Not giving her any sort of credit for an idea of that magnitude was inexcusable.  She smiled as she ordered the plane ticket.

Fauzi considers the bribe, but tells him he can't yet take it.  Tim thinks he might be on to something, but is shocked when he wakes up with a few spears inches from his chest, neck and face.  He's dragged out to the center of their camp for a gathering, not too different from a courtroom appearance.

His body went to get up through its usual motions of leaning forward with his core muscles while his leg position them selves to push his mass up from the earth. However he found this to be surprisingly difficult unaware of just how quickly ones muscles deteriorate when left unused. The strange diet had compounded his problem but his lack of a mirror or any critical thinking on the subject left him blind to the changes that were overtaking his physique.<br>\r\nIt only took him a few extra seconds to get into a standing position. Which he managed to accomplish by rocking slightly to one side and pushing him self up with a combination of momentum and what little physical strength he still had. Once he was standing he should have taken a moment to notice just how different the simple act of standing upright felt on his now pudgy body. While any observer could see he was nowhere near as fat or as black as some of the women he saw strutting around here with no modesty, it was clear he would be a little bit less of a sore thumb. His body had developed a noticeable layer of adipose all around. there bumps, rolls, and creases in places they had never been before but he was to busy trying to figure out the best way to sneak around here with out being to obvious to take stock of the odd sensations he was experiencing. Like the way his ass jiggled in counter balance to a very subtle but very foreign new weight on his chest, or the way that weight settled just barely forming a crease between itself and his newly manifested potbelly. All in all he had gained about 25 pounds and most of it was stored in either his \"plumped\" lower half or doughy chest. If he still had access to clothing he would have found a womens size 12 or 14 panties quite comfortable on his rounded posterior.<br>\r\nAs he exited the hut for the first time in weeks he noticed that the high sun did not burn his pale skin as it did the first time his nudeness was exposed to its rays. Had he not been so frantically searching for a disguise he might have figured out the reason for this was his uncharacteristic bronzed complexion. The paste he had been coated in twice a day for the past two weeks and changed his milky white skin to something more ethnic looking although at this early a stage it would be anyone guess as he was still much lighter then any of the Africans. But now he appeared closed to what some might call \"latina\" or a mixed race in appearance. He quickly ducked into the nearest hut where he finds......</span></div></div>",

Do to his snack induced drunken haze he had become much less of a flight risk. Not to mention the affect his \"secret\" snacking had on his figure when ground up and carefully applied to food they caused a slow healthy weight gain and feminization. But when consumed raw and concentrated they caused something of a wicked addiction and were mildly dangerous. They also seemed to be inducing a case of steatopygia that was characteristic of many tribes women. His weight had continued a steady climb and while he could still try to minimize his appearance with careful selection of clothing walking around the village in a drunken haze as naked as the local women did nothing to hide his decidedly more feminine form. He looked like a very fair skinned chubby African American woman with small barely noticeable breasts but thick browned nipples and a nice round \"donk\" not quite a ba donk a donk, but way more ass then any dude should haul. Plump thighs and a curvature of the spine only added to his appearance with the way he was consuming the herbs more of his weight would be accumulating in his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had snuck into the preparation hut to steal more of his favorite dried fruit samples when he heard the tribe leaders and several others in a ruckus. He peeked out the window to see several americans and the tribes leaders gathered around the center of the village. They were talking loudly and gesturing a lot but he couldn't quite make out what was happening. He saw the americans gesture to the East and he followed their pointing to see a large but very distant plume of smoke. 'Oooooohhh, he thought. While strutting his jiggly body around naked in the hot African sun had done wonders for what he called a tan, but was actually a distinctly mochafied pigmentation it seemed the very sun that had cooked his skin to the point that he would have a hard time passing for white had also baked some dried brush nearby and started what he suspected \"based on their hand gestures\" must be a rather large wild fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes darted around the village he noticed all of the tribes women and men were moving, packing, gathering and generally mobilizing. He know what this meant they were evacuating the area for safety. Even in his compliant drunken stupor he knew this was good news for his almost forgotten business venture if the fire kept them off the land long enough or damaged it to the point that it was uninhabitable his company would have no problem annexing the land from these ignoramuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm\" he said out loud as he rubbed his little potbelly thinking of how rich this could make him.

Apparently they made quite a lot of money smuggling in some of there rare herbs and \"special\" treatment products to the major cities. He grabbed pair of what were pretty unassuming black stretch pants and threw them on expecting them to be baggy considering the size of most of the women around here. They were but not nearly as baggy as he would expect. He was too busy and high to consider that In another couple of weeks here they probably would have fit quite snugly.

He knew this must be where all the valuable were stored and as such this is where his stuff would be. After tfinding all of the unlocked ones empty he doubled back to one of the other huts to retrieve some keys he had barely noticed before and quickly bounced back to the chests where his plump fingers and now that he thought about it unclipped nails couldn't work fast enough to get the locks open.

Who knows what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed into his button up shirt feeling the sleeves cut in to his doughy arms a lot more then he remembered. He unloaded all of his stash into his brief case and he flew out the door. Perhaps jostled or maybe sasheyed was a more appropriate description of how he moved now but in his mind he flew like a spy on a mission. He made it to the main road without incident, unless you consider a whole lot of sweating weezing and breaking for snacks an \"incident\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he boarded the bus for the nearest major city he tried to call his firm and tell them to wait for his call to move quickly on their acquisition but he found his cell phone quite dead.

He said  something to the affect \"a lovely seat for a plump and lovely maiden\" in a different language then the tribe spoke but it was all African jibberish to tim and he disregarded it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo and half hours later it was late in the afternoon when the same smiley wrinkled driver gently shook Tim awake to announce that hey had arrived at his destination. The sketchy looking dollar van that had brought him this far wasn't taking him to the 5 star hotel he planned on staying at but it was only a short can ride from where he was currently getting off. As he hoped off the bus  the driver watched his cheeks jiggle and slap against each other. thirty minutes later he breathed sigh of relief as he paid the bell hop a few American dollars for really nothing as he only carried his brief case up to the elevator. Tim wanted to get rid of him as soon as possible as surprisingly he heard his stomach growl loudly which was odd considering how much he had eaten before his \"daring\" escape and how much he had snacked on his way over here. He couldn't wait to sleep in a real bed and eat some real food while he went over the details of his acquisition in his head he was rubbing his tummy again as he plopped down in the bed ordered room service and passed out asleep with his ass creating a very girlish hill as the bed sunk in all around his new weight.

You can still use magic. You just have to clear your mind and do your best.\", said Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the image of Zoey's popped like a bubble leaving Alice as bread.

Trying to edit pictures of Steve along with pictures of girls in compromising positions.  Steve nearly burst out laughing.  At first he did a few believable ones, with him flirting and grabbing some girls nowhere near his league, girls that were chubby.  As he posted them randomly to various college related websites.  It was only a matter of time, days, weeks at the longest before his friends saw them.  He laughed as he wondered what Jake would say then, when his friends were the ones giving him a hard time.  Laughing he subscribes Steve to a few trial issues of some plus size adult magazines in addition to some fashion catalogs.  Wonder what his buddies would say if they saw them lying around his apartment or hanging out of his mailbox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to his work he just imagined Jake's new reputation as a chubby chaser and how it might affect his social life.

Still, he took a few pills, as well as some to sleep as well- a few adjustments here could really alter Jake's life- maybe a medicine that also tended to slow down metabolisms and one that was laced with estrogen to promote softness and weight gain- those could really do a number on both Jake's social life and his waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a few adjustments, Steve switched him over to the medications in question- could be very interesting to see how this stud handled gaining weight and dealing with much more estrogen in his system.</span></div></div>",

The other pills would slow down his metabolism, Steve did the calculations and by the time this prescription ran out he would have the metabolism of a couch potato.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had been the butt of a lot of peoples jokes on campus thanks to some more edited pictures.  The worst ones were of what appeared to be him doing a panty raid, he didn't even notice that the panties he was raiding were pretty large.  He was furious and needed to get to the bottom of it.  His mind was so distracted that he found his usual quick wit nowhere to be found and after a few debates and exchanges with his feminist women's studies professor he retreated into a state of introversion for the rest of the day.  He wanted to say something terrible to the fat girls who were sitting in his row, but after his failed attempts at debate he wasn't willing to risk any further interactions with the professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one bright spot on his day was his cooking class.  He didn't recognize anyone in the class and for the first couple all he had to do was watch and sample a bit of his teachers creations.  He knew there was a lot of group work coming up, but that was the last thing on his mind.  He wanted to get his schedule sorted out, but the guidance counselors all said the same thing to him since the add/drop period had passed.  By the time he might be able to file an appeal, it'd be more than a month into his classes and he would have trouble adding anything new at that point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was determined to beat the shit out of whoever was messing with him.  Some of his friends believed him, but more and more were having too much fun teasing him.  Jake had always given his friends a hard time to let them know who was on top and now that his friends smelled blood it was time for some payback.  Jake deserved to be humbled.  Steve was amazed when he saw a few days later that some rumors were spreading on their own.  Steve relaxed, because had Jake gone to the school right away they might've been able to trace it all back to him.  Now he was able to focus on his studies and enjoy his college time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith any luck Jake would be too busy with everything else to give him a hard time.  Steve smiled and deleted all of the edited photos.  Encrypting the contents of Jake's hard drive that he'd copied over to a spare of his.  With his training, he was almost certain that there wasn't even the slightest chance anyone could trace any of this back to him at this point.  He was tempted to delete what he copied from Jake entirely, however he might need to cover his tracks later when it came to the prescription information.  Perhaps if Jake learned his lesson Steve could have him go back to his original prescription before things got too out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a chubby girl, but her huge tits in her loose fitting laundry clothes made her appear more voluptuous to him.  She was bigger than girls he would usually flirt with, so he just went about loading up the washer and occasionally stealing a glance at her huge tits.  She looked at him again \"Don't you hate laundry day?  I'm glad we've got this laundry room in our apartment complex, I would hate for anyone in public to see me and think I always dress like this\".  He caught himself smiling.  After the day he had it was nice to have someone flirt with him, even if she was a little thick, those breasts... he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I really need to get some more clothes.  Everything I seem to wear really shows off a look that I'm not really sure is me right now.\" he said.  It was a nice way of phrasing that his underarmour and other tight fitting clothes weren't so flattering anymore.  It's not that the weight he gained was too obvious, but he remembered the teasing him and his buddies used to give to overweight guys at the gym that thought they should be wearing those kinds of shirts.  \"Oh, well I thought you looked really good the few times I've seen you.  You're in college too, right?\" she says.  He nods and she says \"I always kind of avoided you, you seemed kind of irritable, but it's nice to know that you're actually pretty friendly.  If you want, now that we've both got our wash going, you're welcome to wait at my place right down the hall.  I'm in room 102.\".  He looks around the laundry room, noticing that the other guy that was there is gone.  A bit upset about his ill deserved reputation, he couldn't help, but be protective.  \"Sure\" he says as he follows her back to her place.  \"Oh and I'm Ashley by the way\" she says.  \"I'm Jake\" he says as he enters her apartment after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few hours later when he was going back to his place, that he nearly forgot about the laundry he'd left in the washing machine.  He'd needed that, although she was bigger than he was expecting.  She was able to hide a lot of her figure underneath those baggy clothes of hers.  At least her tits were pretty nice, he thought as he broke out into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We won't make you work much, you can be our designated taste tester if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's eyes lit up, maybe Ashley did spill the beans, but she seemed to have done so at least in a respectable way- plus, the idea of simply tasting things and getting a grade was very inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Jake, stretching out his hand to shake, \"I'd be glad to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said gleefully as she shook his hand back, her arm jiggling softly,\"Care to meet our group members?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure-\"</span></div></div>",

Snacking on a few of the small pastries and letting his guard down a bit as he talked with Claire and the rest of the girls in his group.  Pretty soon he was helping to roll dough and learning how to make a few very tempting desserts.  He was tempted to make a remark about their weight and waistlines, but they were snacking less than him and they were friendly enough to let him join in on the class.  He couldn't help, but catch a few glances at Claire's cleavage either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon made his way to the final class of his day.  Stage makeup, before it had all been theory, but later in the week they would be expected to apply what they had been learning to a group partner that would be assigned.  The professor came by to let him know that he was going to have to shave regularly.  Stubble just wouldn't be fair to his partner who would be working on him.  He also started talking to Jake about his skin, commenting that he'd get better results and therefore a better grade if he took better care of it.  He handed Jake the list of cosmetics he'd need to acquire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked at the list and was about to be upset, when the professor explained that he was saving money since he didn't require people to buy a textbook for the class that cost well over a hundred dollars.  \"If it's a problem I do have a few things from that list you can borrow, but not everything.  You're welcome to some of the skin lotion we use though.  I get samples of it all the time\" the professor said as he left a by Jakes desk.  He didn't think to mention that the lotion would also lighten up your skin substantially, as that was one of the big reasons it was used in theatre.  After listening to his professor critique his skin he did get a little insecure about it, wondering if maybe that lotion would actually help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was having second thoughts about his schedule.  While he did enjoy how isolated his new classes were from the rest of the campus, including from the people who had teased him so badly, did he really want to learn cooking or makeup?  As he walked near a crowd of people he'd partied with and overheard some of their comments and looks, those second thoughts were pushed from his mind yet again.</span></div></div>",

He wiped his eyes lazily and looked around his room, which was littered with empty food wrappers and other items that were indicating that someone had been stuffing themselves silly last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second!\" he called out as he tidied up a bit, though he still left some evidence of fattening foods. He tried readjusting his sweatpants and his underwear, yet try as he might, he really couldn't get them back to a point where they were legitimately comfortable, he would have to go shopping soon if he kept this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to the door, pulling his underwear out of his butt crack one last time before doing so, and opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this girl named Mindy, she was his neighbor and she was also pretty chubby, hourglass shaped, but perhaps more bottom heavy than most hourglasses. Before greeting her, Jake thought momentarily about how he had been hanging out with a lot of overweight women lately- in a sense making those original pictures slightly truthful, but he pushed the idea out of his mind as he greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how can I help you?\" he asked simply, taking in her wide hips and plump backside. (Wait, plump backside? Being into a chubby girls tits was one thing, but liking her fat ass was another entirely, what the hell was up with him?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said coyly, fiddling with her golden hair as a smile played upon her cute face, \"Well I needed some sugar and was hoping maybe you could lend me some? I've just been so busy I forgot to go stock up on groceries yesterday-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cursed herself inwardly- stock up? It sounded like she would buy for 10 when she went grocery shopping, she must have sounded like such a pathetic fat chick to this guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake licked his lips as he looked her over, what had come over him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he said, \"Just come inside, I'm sure we can figure something out-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey conversed momentarily, but soon enough things got heated, Jake couldn't resist her any longer and he took off his shirt, revealing something that sort of shocked Mindy. She had imagined he was in far better shape, he was by no means fat, but he looked sort of soft- and what was up with all the empty fattening food containers around here? She would have slapped herself in the face if she wasn't passionately making out with Jake as she realized that he must be neglecting his physical fitness, but no matter, she still found him plenty attractive and the significance of the slight softness he now carried was unimportant- so they proceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped over at his place on a whim, she'd overheard him being teased on campus and was surprised.  Could someone as good looking and fit as him prefer girls like herself, she did need some sugar and what the hell she figured as she found herself knocking on his door.  She was surprised that on a Saturday evening he wasn't out partying or drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt reinvigorated after their lovemaking.  He'd been so lonely lately, normally his weekends were non stop drinking and partying, but he hadn't received a single text from anyone all day.  He almost wanted Mindy to spend the night.  She started getting dressed and they continued to talk.  \"After all that I'd hate for you to forget about your sugar\" he said, as he leaned in for a kiss and handed her a ziplock full of it.  \"Thanks.. I'm going to pick up some more at the grocery store tomorrow, you can come with me if you like.\" she said as he considered it.  When she wasn't looking he took a picture of her naked with his cellphone camera.  He was having second thoughts, especially after all the doctored photographs showed up, but he loved his photo collection of all his conquests and chubby or not Mindy's backside was to be a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to remember me by... Don't be a stranger\" she said as she tossed him her panties.  They talked for a bit at the door.  He normally would've rushed their conversation, to anyone who might be watching it might be obvious what they just did.  They exchanged numbers and he got a good look at her backside before she left his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake didn't notice that Steve saw Mindy leaving his apartment or that he overheard much of their conversation.  He was amazed, did he actually like fat girls and Steve didn't need to do any photo shopping or did Steve and his actions have something to do with it.  Steve felt so powerful, like his plans somehow worked better than he could have imagined.  He was wondering what he might do next.  Was it still about revenge or was it more of a fun science experiment.  He didn't care at the moment as he went to celebrate his victory, with the alcohol Jake had left for fixing his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His clothes were simply too small, he would have to go shopping soon or he wouldn't have anything to move around in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe missed a test for his women's studies class, and soon enough he was going to try to convince the professor to let him take it after class, if he could only get off of this comfortable couch! Maybe a cupcake would give him enough energy to move ahead- he reached for one lazily and stuffed it into his mouth- that was sort of better. Jake heaved himself up off of his couch and adjusted his biggest pair of sweatpants, which he had obviously outgrown, with little results. The only class he hadn't even considered missing was his cooking class, the food was exquisite and luckily it started at a reasonable time, so he could sleep in, wake up late, and then stuff his face full of pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his keys and heading for the door, he considered just launching himself back into his couch, but he mustered up enough effort to open the door and head outside, adjusting his shirt and pants again and then heading for his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the school, he found his way to his class and walked in, his tight sweatpants piquing his teachers attention as she looked over a few papers. Her name was Ms.Laine, she was 40 and recently divorced, which had done a number on her waistline and rump, having expanded each a fair bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms. Laine,\" said Jake as he stopped in front of her desk, once again fiddling with his tight sweatpants with little result, \"I was wondering if I could possibly make up that test that I missed-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read the syllabus Jake,\" she said simply, \"But why is it that you missed the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno Miss, I've been feeling really weird lately,\"  this wasn't a lie really, his recent laziness and constant snacking had led him to feel at least a bit strange, \"I think I'm coming down with something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said looking him over, \"I don't usually do this, but something about you does seem off and I do believe you're telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you miss.\" said Kevin, \"So when can I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now,\" she said handing him the exam and a no. 2 pencil, \"Don't disappoint me Kevin, you're one of the few males taking this class, make your gender proud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and even though Kevin was thinking more about what he could eat after the exam rather than what was on it, he finished after about half an hour and handed it it to Ms. Laine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When he gets off the elevator to his floor he hears a familiar voice, he walks past the open door to Steve's room and sees Amy, his overweight, blacksheep cousin talking to Steve.  \"Hi Cous! I hope you don't mind that I'm staying with you for the football weekend.  I won tickets on the radio and I figured it's been months since I saw you last\" she says as she gave him a hug.  She was a few years older than Jake, and failed out of college her first year there and since then she's been working all sorts of jobs, having trouble holding them and doing even more damage to her credit report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh that's great, but you could have called first.\" says Jake.  He ushers Amy back to his apartment, not even bothering to threaten Steve about anything they might've been talking about.  The last thing he needs is her doing any more damage to his social life, which is on life support already.  He's a bit surprised at the tattoo that runs down the side of her arm.  He knew she had one on her ankle, but that was small and pretty harmless.  He could only wonder why she felt the need to get a nose and eyebrow piercings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pretty chubby all her life and now he guessed her somewhere north of 200 pounds.  She smiled and looked at the mess of an apartment.  \"What a mess, your roommate must be a real pig.\" she says.  \"I don't have a roommate.... I mean this was from a party last night, I've just been too busy to clean up\" he says and she believes him although she doesn't see much evidence of alcohol.  \"I don't have a room for you, you can take the couch or if you don't mind sleeping on the floor I have a little office space in the back\" he says.  Jake looked at the large bag she brought and wondered what it was full of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around the place, noting the makeup kit on the bathroom counter and wondering whose it might be.  She walks into his room and looks around, seeing a rather large pair of panties among the mess that is his room, she smiles realizing that's who the makeup kit probably belongs to.  Jake with fat girls?  He was always such an asshole to them.  Something about him seems off.  She was determined to figure out what he was up to.  When Jake was young he looked up to Amy, at least until he started playing football.  Thanks to his teasing of her over the years, combined with her families constant comparisons of herself to Jake she developed a strong dislike of him.  Although walking around campus today, she did kind of miss school.  Perhaps she should re-enroll for the spring semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable.  I've got to run to my Stage M.... management class\" he says.  Hiding his makeup bag as he sneaks it into his backpack without her noticing.  \"There's a spare key in the drawer by the refrigerator\" he says with one foot out the door.  She goes to grab a drink and is surprised by his very well stocked fridge.  She grabbed a can of Coke and sat down, soaking it all in.  A little bored, she gives some thought to visiting that nice neighbor of his that she was just talking to, she thinks maybe he can tell him how her cousins been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was feeling a little remorseful about what I did and felt like I should undo it, but the more I hear about him from you and the more I see of him he's still a huge jerk\" says Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  This is amazing!  Part of me can't help, but picture him needing to borrow clothes from me.  I'm amazed though, their are chemicals... drugs that can change his body like that?  Are there any that could help me?  I've struggled with my weight all my life.  Besides I want Jake to be the fat one!\" says Amy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are drugs that can suppress your appetite and increase your metabolism.  If you'd like, maybe I could photoshop a prescription for you to take to the pharmacy.  It'll take some time though, I want to make sure it looks convincing.  Besides I need to research the drugs too and see which ones would work best.  It's very exciting, part of me wants to study medicine now\"  says Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You do know I'd do almost anything to lose all this, right?\"  She says as she gives him a knowing grin.  \"If you can do all this, why haven't you done anything to yourself.  Maybe became more muscular... less of a well.... nerd? says Amy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm not sure... part of me is worried that I could become like Jake... I hate guys like him, but it would be nice to have the perks of looking like that.  Hearing you talk like this makes me wonder how good we could look... and you are willing to do anything.... right?\" he says, a knowing grin of his own appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but we can't let Jake know that we get along or anything.  I'll keep an eye on him and let him know how things are going as he changes.  I'm so excited to see him lose that perfect body of his!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a little bit and then he began getting to work.  She was going to make a few calls about some apartments she'd seen on craigslist, before she headed out to the bars later on.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jake was oblivious, or at least, he acted oblivious, about the changes occurring to his body- it would be hard to believe he wasn't noticing his increase in both size and softness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in a while, chubs-\" he said as he left Amy alone in his house. At another point in time, she would have been offended, but at the rate which Jake was growing, she would be calling him chubs before he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone, Amy popped in an aerobics CD and went to work, trying to burn the calories she consumed and then some. Luckily, Steve had given her both a metabolism and energy booster, and she had already noticed that the tightness she once felt when she slipped into a pair of jeans was being replaced by looseness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour, she toweled herself down and ate a granola bar, then she moved everything in the apartment to its original position- even if she did screw up somehow, Jake would be to enticed by his latest cooking assignment to pay any mind to a DVD that had been shifted a foot to the right or something of the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a reputation of being easy ever since high school, but Amy had shown her some pictures of him and his latest conquests and she got excited.  When she caught him checking out her cleavage she knew that with a little work she could have him doing whatever she wanted later on in the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jake... I hear you've got a reputation as a womanizer.  That's too bad... your powers will never work on a girl like me\" Christine says as she grins, having just caught him staring at her chest in her trademark lowcut top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh... really?\"  He says, blushing a bit from having been caught.  He's feeling a bit nervous as he can't help check out her very noticeable curves.  For some reason big girls seem so hot any more and Christine would be the biggest girl he'd ever bedded.  He hoped he could pull it off, but the more pressure he put on himself the more nervous he became.  Steve smiled as he saw Jake fumble with conversation between him and Christine.  Steve felt a twinge of pain as he remembered how difficult for him it used to be to talk to girls, feeling no need to talk to Amy about the girl whose number he got at the gym.  Steve radiated confidence as his one hand rested in the back of Amy's loose fitting yoga pants and gave her a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhhh like what size bra do you wear?\" Jake said awkwardly... hypnotized by Christine's f-cup breasts, breasts that moments before had nearly popped out as she leaned over for the salt shaker.  Christine knew exactly what she was doing.  Jake wasn't really her type even if he was kind of cute, but she did want to move back out of her parents place and he'd do ok until something better came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night progressed and Christine left to use the bathroom.  \"You really love them big, don't you Jake?\" Steve says.  Jake wants to reply, but feels so guilty about how he's feeling, even if Christine is so hot.  He swears he'll get back at Steve, but soon forgets about it as Christine re-emerges, now ready to go back to his apartment with him.</span></div></div>",

(Which wasn't often)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good for Jake to have someone he could hang around all the time, as of late he hadn't had anyone that resembled a friend, and though his relationship with Christine was more sexual than anything, their relationship was also that of two friends who were slowly growing closer- perhaps in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakes continued neglect of working out was beyond obvious- he was getting pudgy, a muffin top starting to form, his butt cheeks starting to obtain a fair bit of padding, his overall structure getting notably softer. Christine was in no position to say anything to him regarding his weight, as she weighed in at a hefty 250 pounds- but the changes did not go unnoticed. For now, however, she didn't mind much- she had never been picky with her partners, and she had definitely done worse than Jake before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer habits were perhaps doing a number on Jake as well. She was- to put it simply- a pothead. She smoked often, and was soon after hit with the munchies, as her figure indicated. Jake originally was a bit hesitant to smoke with her, he had only puffed the magic dragon when he was in high school- and even then it was two or three times at most. It did serve as a good stress release, however- and soon enough they were smoking together once a day, followed by a stuffing session they attributed to \"The Munchies\" and not their immense appetites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese changes did a number on Jake's already expanding waistline, and the weight was starting to pack on more noticeably now- his pecs were softening, his butt was starting to bubble, his thighs were far from thunder, but a storm was definitely brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Originally he proposed something physical only, because he was worried of his continually sliding reputation.  After it's dropped even further, his growing insecurity is driving him deeper and deeper into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very sweet of you Jake, but I'm young and not looking for anything like that at the moment.\" she says, knowing that's not true.  She'd gladly be in a relationship with someone more fit and exciting.  Another week had passed and his pants were looking even tighter on his body, depending on the clothes they could resemble a sausage casing on his expanding figure.  She'd been thinking of lots of guys when they were physical at night, pretty much everyone, but Jake who was on top of her.  Feeling envious of her 'friend' Amy and her part-time lover Steve.  She'd been lording her recent weight loss over Christine and Steve had been looking noticeably fitter, they were actually making a cute couple.  She resented how patronizing Amy was to her and was beginning to resent Jake for being happier together with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.... you know I'm under a lot of stress with class and I told you before I'm not looking for drama.  I'm still trying to makeup for those classes I missed, but it seems like I'm just getting further and further behind.  School's expensive and my trust fund's not exactly bottomless\" says Jake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my fault!  You wanted this to be purely physical when we first met!  You never introduced me to your friends and when was the last time you took me out on a date?  What's changed now other than that expanding waistline of yours?  I've got problems to you know!\" Christine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was reeling from that last comment.  Was his weight gain that noticeable?  They fought on and off for a few hours and even though it was Jake's place somehow he ended up spending the night alone on his couch.  He barely got any sleep that night.  He needed sex and with the way Christine was acting frustration set in.  He grabbed his laptop and when he was sure Christine was asleep he started looking up pictures and videos of girls online.  He didn't even realize that maybe only one or two of them were less than 200 pounds.  As he finally tired himself out over and hour later, falling asleep without even bothering to clean up the tissues at the base of his couch.</span></div></div>",

Steve, on the other hand, had bulked up- though he was toting around muscle, and was actually starting to look kind of tough. Neither of them was exactly where they wanted to be, Amy was still sort of chubby and Steve wasn't truly buff, but they had both changed considerably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were also both doing well in their classes, Steve had always been something of a genius, but once Amy enrolled he began to help her out and she was scoring very well on her exams.

He would turn so soft, and with that fat he's been accumulating- he'd be nothing short of a jiggle factory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve thought for a second, making Jake lose his muscle mass would make the changes in his physique VERY obvious to all around him- even though everyone had already noticed he was gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is something I can do,\" Steve pulled up his computer and preformed some minor research, and then he found the supplement he had in mind, \"Okay, I'm gonna need you to pick up his first batch of new drug for him- once he starts taking it they'll just have it on record and give it to him whenever he comes by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy paused for a second, \"Yeah, I can do that.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm actually on my way to the grocery store, if you give me enough cash I can help you out with your grocery list.  No sense in us both driving and wasting the gas.\" says Amy as she hopes that he's running low on his current prescriptions.  Steve told her that he should be nearly out, but that's only if he'd been following the prescribed amounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh..... Christine usually makes the list.  She's been hanging around here less and less, but usually it's on the fridge or pantry door, I think.\"  He said, as he guided Amy around to the various places it might be.  Too lazy to get up from the couch and out of the warmth of his blanket to help.  Normally Christine would be bothered by such lazy inconsiderateness, especially when she's trying to help someone out, but since it was Jake, her perfect cousin that she was constantly being compared to, she did her best to contain an almost sinister laugh.  Amy wondered what he was looking like under the blanket.  She wanted to take a picture or two of him before he started his new drug.  She was so excited at the promise of the drug, even if it only did a fraction of what Steve had told her it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wondered about what he was doing for clothing these days and how he was doing in class.  Her birthday was right around the corner and she knew she was due for the inevitable gift cards from plus size clothing stores and boutiques, with how her weight loss goals were going she felt great about her promise that she would never step foot in another one again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need anything, just give me a call.  I've got to run to pilates class, but I'll be back in a few hours with everything.  You look cold, want me to adjust the thermostat\" she said as she got ready to leave.  Taking a quick glance and realizing it was pretty close to the settings that some of her old female roommates left it at.  He nodded his head, distracted by the tv and eager to give it his full attention as he did before Amy showed up.  Amy smiled and notched the thermostat up two degrees. </span></div></div>",

These were primarily sent by people who hadn't seen her in a while- for those who saw her on a regular basis would know that she was slowly but surely thinning down- plus sized clothing stores really weren't her scene anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had these cards- throwing them away would just be wasteful, but she really had no use for them. She could give them to Christine, she reasoned- Christine was a heavy gal, she no doubt could use a few more outfits from any one of these stores. Then it hit her like a train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could give them to Jake! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't seen Jake since she had given him his medication- she had been fairly busy with all of her current responsibilities and her workout sessions. These gift cards could be her in to see how much Jake had changed in the week that had transpired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy could almost taste how delicious it would be to see her softened cousin. After taking care of a few errands, she made her way to Jake's apartment, where she found who else but Jake lying in bed somberly and eating ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy,\" he said sullenly as she closed the door behind herself, \"What brings you around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-\" she thought for a second, \"Well I have these gift cards Christine might want, I was considering throwing them away but that just seems wasteful- is she here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of Christine's name, Jake's face turned sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shes gone,\" he said as he shoveled some more ice cream into his mouth, \"She left me- I don't think shes coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy felt sorry for the boy, what she and Steve were doing to him seemed so vile now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fat bitch,\" he said afterward, \"This is what I get for hanging around stupid fat chicks like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Jake,\" said Amy, trying to keep her cool, \"I know you're angry- but this isn't my fault! I'm just going to leave this gift cards here anyway, I don't want them and I don't have much use for them, maybe you will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy proceeded to stomp out and shut the door behind her- she regretted not seeing if any physical progress had been made with Jake, but she simply didn't feel up to his nonsense right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" asked Jake after she had slammed the door. He stood up, revealing a MUCH softer frame. His muscle loss had exacerbated his feminine shape, he seemed dumpy and very soft- there was also no denying he had packed on a few pounds of adipose himself to emphasize his girlish figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over, now jiggling due to his lack of musculature, then he picked up the gift cards- seeing they were all from plus-sized clothing stores, ones strictly for women at that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I use these?\" he said, pulling his tight boxers out from between his soft butt cheeks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He'd spent a week pining over Christine.  She'd become something of his ideal, he worshipped her curves and every time he picked up one of his many plus sized magazines or logged into one of his plus sized websites he'd think of her and miss her.  \"How... how could she leave me... doesn't she know I'm Jake Stevenson\" he said nearly in tears.  He looked in the mirror and there was little wonder why.  He'd let himself go.  He didn't come to terms with how heavy he'd gotten, as his noticeable and very soft gut now pooched over the few tight fitting pants he had left that even fit.  His shirts were such a mess too.  He used to take such pride in his appearance, but what happened?  He struggled to gather something he used to know as resolve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a long hot shower, brushed and combed his neck length long hair and struggled to squeeze into the clean clothes he had left which gave him and his increasingly soft body an exposed muffin top.  He almost felt like borrowing one of Christine's body shapers.  He was sick at how far out his hips stuck out.  He decided to do his best to ignore his appearance he made up that his mind that he was going to the mall.  Not to use those gift cards, although it might give him an excuse to check out the sales girls working the stores.  He'd suspected that their might be some real hotties working there, secretly grateful that the cards were for plus size stores instead of something boring like Victoria's Secret.  He was especially grateful for the Coldstone Creamery gift card that somehow his stupid cousin mixed in.  He knew that was her favorite place to go, but now he was going to use it, especially since ice cream had a way of cheering him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the mall he looked everywhere for the Coldstone.  Having to sit down once, because of how much his thighs were chafing.  He finally reached the Coldstone, right as his stomach started to rumble.  He knew he should save it for dessert, especially after walking past all the smells and several free samples he helped himself to in the food court.  He was the only person in line so he took his time.  \"There are so many flavors I can never just choose two or three.  I wish I could sample them all.  I mean do I go for Cookie Mintster, Mud Pie Mojo, Oreo Overload.... they all look so delicious\" he said, not realizing how much he was starting to love this place.  The chubby girls behind the counter humored him and let him sample several before he finally ordered two cups.  He saw his reflection in the glass case and hurried to grab a napkin to clean up the ice cream running down his chin.  He wasn't a slob, he'd get his life back together and then Christine would see.  His sweats were so tight he could barely squeeze the cards back into his pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his ice cream down on the bench he was going to sit at and struggled to put the cards back in.  He wondered how he'd get his car keys out and temporarily got distracted as he dropped the gift cards.  He bent over to reach them and sure enough he heard a loud tear. He turned a bright red as he felt the cool mall air on his exposed flabby backside.  He panicced as he heard laughter, trying not to cry as he waddled as fast as he could.  He was desperately looking for one of the stores that matched the cards as he had brought no cash.  In his desperation he didnt forget to bring along his ice cream.  He needed each bite of it to cheer him up as he avoided the stares of disapproval.  He feels a tear roll down his cheek as he hears \"Ewww fatty alert!  I think I'm going to vomit\".  Several girls comment on his ass, comparing it in size to theirs and laughing.  Asking their girlfriends to shoot them if theirs ever gets that big.  He finally finds a store that matches his gift card.  He hurries in ignoring all the dresses on the plus size mannequins.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake looked around for a second- he had just entered a plus sized clothing store, FOR WOMEN. Still, he was in no shape to head back outside, he tried covering up his now ample backside with his hands. Since when had he not been able to cover it with both hands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuddered, thinking of how inconceivably awkward the following minutes could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he studied some options quickly, a plump sales girl-she had black hair and was just a bit pale- approached him, her face a mixture of a greeting and sheer confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sir,\" she began as she looked Jake over, \"How can I help you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need clothes.\" replied Jake simply. He did, didn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she replied, \"This is a plus sized women's clothing store, are you shopping for a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered lying and saying he was- but it would seem weird when he had to try on some of his supposed girlfriend's clothing- he decided he would stick to the facts, however embarrassing those were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" he began, \"I'm shopping for... me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jake said, \"Its just I split my pants-\" he twirled for her to indicate the veracity of this statement, \"And I happen to have a gift card for this store. I was wondering if maybe I could buy something for until I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely true, he planned on wearing whatever he bought here for at least a bit longer- he didn't really have anything that fit him at home anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said the salesgirl, almost relieved, \"Oh yeah we can probably make something work-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over his body, her face showing slight confusion again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind stepping into the dressing room with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure-\" replied Jake, this wouldn't be pretty, but it was pretty much necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-One Measuring Session Later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was beet red- having to see his chubby frame in not one but three full length mirrors was almost more than he could bear. He couldn't look at the mirror for more than a few seconds at a time without becoming revolted yet slightly interested in what he had become. He was chubby- maybe even more than chubby, but his shape was very peculiar. It was womanly, feminine- soft, he had a soft, pudgy belly that was such a stark contrast from the abs that lay layers under it. He cradled it in his hands- \"so this is where all that ice cream went\", he mused. Well, some of it had ended up there- but a fair amount of his stuffing had ended up in other areas. His arms were soft- plush little clumps of fat hung off of them, his once proud biceps and triceps weren't even hiding under there- they were simply gone. His face had softened as well- if he didn't pose his chin just right a double chin was visible. Of course, all of these developments paled when one would look at his lower body. A big, fat ass- he was almost pear shaped, had it not been for his highly breast-like moobs. His ass was an amassing of adipose he had never expected to hold on his body, but it was not alone, set up on some thick thunder thighs and complimented by a wide set of hips. He was very feminine in terms of physical shape. He placed his hands on his hips- so doughy, so very doughy. He had almost become to interested in his own shape to notice the salesgirl standing beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm-\" the salesgirl began to speak, looking over his measurements, \"Well you're a size 18.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake gulped, a size 18 in women's- that was the definition of a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err-\" was all he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she began, she too was at a loss, \"I hope you don't mind me asking, but do you have some sort of medical condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she cleared her throat, \"I mean- just going off your general shape and what not. Its sort of- well really feminine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, and very soft,\" she managed, \"I'm not trying to insult you, its just that most guys- even most fat guys- don't look like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay-\" began Jake defensively, \"Look, I think you must be wrong about the pant size- I can't possibly be an 18-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Numbers don't lie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the tape measure solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just bring me a- a 14.\" he said, \"What do you wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a 16-\" she began, \"You might be able to fit into a 16.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he turned back to the mirror, \"I must be a 14.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He spends more than a few minutes trying to work the pants up his chubby thighs.  As he works them up over his boxers they wedge in between his wide, very female rear and thanks to the tightness of the pants make it look like he has visible panty lines and his boxers are now a thong.  As he works it up over his sizeable hips they pinch into his soft waist, giving him a very noticeable muffin top.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm.... I could bring you something in a 16 if you'd like?\" she says as she tries to soften the blow of the image that lies in front of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets more and more nervous as he examines his reflection.  The stretch pants are so painful and he can see the muffin top.  Wearing something so skin tight just makes it obvious to him.  His body's become so womanly, but how?  He turns around and gets a view of his ass in the pants and lets out a loud gasp.  Empathizing with the people who were teasing him moments ago.  His ass is so big and flabby.  Jiggling it with his hands and moving it.  He's almost in tears.  How can he hide it now?  Even a size 14 just makes it look massive.  Defeated he lowers his head and struggles to try and get the painful pants off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I give you a hand?\" the sales girls asks.  Ashamed he nods his head and a few minutes later he's just wearing his torn boxers again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves and he examines himself further.  He looks like a woman.  Moobs?  Honestly the more he played with them. Their increasing aureolas and nipples he gulped, he knew it, they were breasts but how?  From the neck down he had the body of a woman.  Even his face was looking more feminine.  He begins to tear up as she returns.  He has his smartphone in hand with a picture of his old self on it.  He'd been putting it beside his new reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!  You wanted to know if I was always like this, no!  This was me damnit!\" he says, eyes full of tears as he grabs the size 18 pants.  His tight fitting boxers bunch up, but within a moment he's able to fit them above his wide hips and get them into place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's stunned as she compares him to the picture on the phone.  If it wasn't for his tears and how he looks now she'd have never believed him, but somehow he went from musclebound stud to... well... having an increasingly flabby, womanly shaped body.  He was even bigger than her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok!  I've heard of this.  I'm a little into Wicca, but have you ever thought you might be cursed?  I know... it sounds ridiculous, but I can barely believe that used to be you, but lets face it guys don't have breasts.  I could fit you for a bra now, but something tells me you'd just outgrow it.\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic, curses?  That's ridiculous\" Jake says.  \"Ohhhh?? Well maybe I should just get my tape measure and bring you a few bras to try on?\" she says as she plays with his breasts playfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I...need a bra?  what...whats happening to me\" he asks in between sobs.  \"I... I do have enemies... a curse?.. that... almost makes sense... I mean the timings perfect!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... listen I only play around with Wicca as a hobby, but there are some occult stores that can help you.  Some people consider themselves legitimate sorceresses and well I swear I've seen some stuff that just isn't explainable.... maybe not as bad as you.... but... it does explain it!\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  That has to be it... I look nothing like my old self... I mean I dont even act like it any more.  I... I can fix this... I just need to reverse the spell!\" he says.. so hysterical he's laughing in between tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talk for a few minutes.  She bookmarks some websites in his phone and gets him to calm down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you still need some new clothes, we have them in your size, but remember it's a woman's clothing store.\" she says as he nods his head.  Hoping that he can find something nice that isn't overly feminine.  Knowing this hell we'll soon be over once he reverses the magic and if he works hard on this Wiccan stuff maybe he can even get his revenge on whoever would dare do something like this to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returns with some new clothes and he tries them on.  They're all at least a size 18, he doesn't even second guess her.  Resigining himself to being even bigger than the chubby salegirl.  He appreciates her help and doesn't mention how feminine the clothes make him look.  In some outfits, from the right angle he might even pass for a woman.  With his long hair from the backside he definitely looks like one.  He's been noticing he hasn't had to shave in weeks, but wearing these outfits he'll have to watch himself as he knows it might raise a few eyebrows from people who don't already know him.  They move to the cash register after he's accumulated several bags of clothes, almost enough to max out the gift card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
