            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A person wearing a full black hooded cloak over a black trench coat in the pale moonlight and on the back of the cloak is a symbol of a crossed sword and guitar in light grey dust glitter. Looking at the cloak in a different angle, there are another two symbols on both sides of the strange coat of arms. On the right, a yellow gold outline of a bat and on the left is a white outline of the black knight chess piece. The person looked up to the moon and felt calm while revealing their eyes. A gold dragon/wolf eye their right eye and a blood red fox eye for their left eye. The color of his face is a perfect tan that most would kill for without using tanning beds or the fake spray on tan in a can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath the cloak and coat is a black shirt, pants, socks, dark silver undershirt, and black steel-toed combat boots. His name is Yin \u2018Ace\u2019 Kamen, but he likes to be called ace by his friends. On the left of his waist, is a practice wooden sword with a hilt looking a revolver pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I think that dust shop is still open.\u2019 Yin thought as he made a turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Aki did like the two symbols on my cloak after having mom help her put them on.\u2019 He thought as the dust shop \u2018From Dust till Dawn\u2019 came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came into the shop and noticed a girl listening to some music before looking at the dust crystals in the shop cases. Checking his wallet, yin found enough the dust crystals he needs and parts for a new type of weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne dust crystal of each type please.\u201d Yin asked handing the clerk the money for the dust crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk was surprised to see the money, but nodded anyway and went to complete the order. When the clerk returned with the dust crystals, they are in a case before yin stored them in his scroll and walking over to the music section joining the girl. Like the girl, he also had a pair of personal headphones to listen to music like \u201cMonster\u201d or any good rock music that he could relate with. He looked at the time before sighing it was time to go home, but he still could get those parts for his new weapon idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have this list of parts I\u2019m looking for?\u201d Yin asked the clerk handing him his list of parts. The clerk took a glance at this list before nodding again and went to get the parts for his new weapons. Taking the money from his wallet, he made sure that it was enough for the parts and gave the clerk the money for the parts. Soon he had everything on his list so he left the shop as the girl turns to the cloak on his back and the symbols on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fight: ruby vs henchman: skip as canon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ruby was fighting torchwick, yin was watching from the shadows and felt that he had to help. Sending aura into his legs, he jumped onto the roof of the building next to ruby give or take some feet for distance. Noticing an adult woman with platinum blonde hair (glynda goodwitch) jumping in to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping his practice sword, his aura started to glow dark red with a black outline surrounding his body. Unsheathing the practice sword, he sent a dark blue aura wave at the hiding lava user and it did do some damage. Ruby and the witch turned to see yin landing next to them after jumping over the gap between the buildings by using a bit more aura in his legs. Yin with a bit of focus made an aura shaped of his practice sword after pulling it from his real practice sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor Goodwitch, before you even think of me as a plain young man I\u2019m the son of general Kamen, my mother.\u201d He said surprising her as ruby was confused to see the son of a female general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin turned to look at the lava user (cinder falls) as he pulled his hood down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018So the black knight is here; this will things more interesting or problematic.\u2019 The lava user thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She has made her choice so I will have to stop her.\u2019 Yin thought as his grip tighten on both of his swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the slight drain of his aura, his eyes locked on to the bullhead and sent waves of aura at the lava user who fired several lava shots to deflect the aura waves. One or two of the aura waves managed to hit the bullhead. Ruby and glynda shook their heads to be rid of the shock. Ruby was firing bullets from her condense rifle as glynda summoned ice from storm clouds. Ruby focused her shots to the cockpit as the witch used the ice to hit the bullhead; yin is focused on the lava user. Blasting aura wave after aura wave, seeing some of them do damage while others get blocked by lava shots. Soon a piece of ice pierced the window of the cockpit of the bullhead and it started to descend to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura sword turned black with a dark red outline; the witch lowered the bullhead to the ground using her semblance before yin fired one last aura wave at the engine. He let the aura sword fade away and breathing fairly hard while feeling the drain on his aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least training won\u2019t be as hard with that now, but mom is still a general for a reason.\u201d Yin said as he was drinking some water from a flask. He was about to jump off to the ground before he heard a whistling sound; he turned to see a walking clich\u00e9 (roman torchwick) pointing his cane at ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the aim of sight, yin noticed a dust crystal and to him it was a rare type of dust crystal. His body glowing with aura, yin ran to push both ruby and the witch out of the way catching the crystal. Taking a batter\u2019s stance, yin hit the shot right back with his practice sword at the clich\u00e9. After the smoke cleared, the clich\u00e9 and the lava user were gone and the dust was left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey got away without the dust and you can thank me for saving your lives.\u201d Yin said holding the rare dust type in his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, is your semblance speed too?\u201d Ruby asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t know what my semblance is yet. I have been using my aura so I have no idea of how long it will take for me to unlock it.\u201d He said as he noticed his mother\u2019s car driving down the road to the bullhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she must have come for me and the rouge bullhead.\u201d He said before turning back to goodwitch and ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want this to stay quiet, both of you will have to meet the general.\u201d He said to glynda before jumping down to greet his mother. Being a witch, she and ruby jumped after him before floating down not getting hurt. In front of yin is a woman with dark red hair braided and wrapped around her neck like a scarf. Wearing a dark green with brown trim general outfit with medals on her coat from different kingdoms and she is left with a slender build and well-toned muscle, DD-cup, and a slim ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaa-chan, were you following me again?\u201d He asked like this wasn\u2019t the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I know you were taking a walk and buying dust for your future weapons.\u201d General kamen said to him before hugging him closely and noticed ruby and goodwitch standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you stayed to help stop torchwick stealing from the shop you were buying from.\u201c she said as he nodded. Ruby\u2019s eyes became like star before running to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said something about weapons?\u201d Ruby asked as goodwitch came up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah give me a second though.\u201d He said before walking over to the shop keeper and paid for the rare dust crystal, but it was a gift for stopping the robbers from running with the stolen dust. He smiled before putting it into a small case and storing it into his scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCustom scroll.\u201d He said answering ruby\u2019s unasked question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Cut to the interrogation)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was sitting at a table with a single light over her head and yin stayed with her so his mother is sitting in a corner watching goodwitch, but felt happy that her son might have found a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Skip goodwitch rant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Ozpin still the headmaster of beacon?\u201d Simone asked as a grey/silver headed male walked into the room with a plate of cookies and a mug of coffee (Ozpin).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine my surprise to see remnant\u2019s first female general and said general to have an army of both humans and faunus soldiers.\u201d He said with a small smile as she smirked at his greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of her titles I personally found funny was The Bloody Tomato.\u201d Yin said before receiving a whack upside his head from his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo mean Sochi-kun.\u201d She whined and ruby was laughing at the title. Yin smiled before seeing ruby eat the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby Rose, you have\u2026\u2026.silver eyes.\u201d Ozpin said in a monotone voice staring into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My eyes are something from a story my uncle raven about The Avatars of Light and Darkness.\u201d Yin explained as a very large and thick book heading for his head before he caught it without risking injury and he knew who through it. Both ruby and his mother started to pull out their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, little simone and the kid are like with a reaction like that.\u201d A new voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle Raven.\u201d Yin said as he had a hand laying on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother dear.\u201d Simone greeted her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to interrupt the family gathering, but we are in the middle of something.\u201d Goodwitch said adjusting her glasses as simone nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat story of the Avatars of Light and Darkness?\u201d Ozpin asked intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legend that goes back to when dust was founded to fight off the grim.\u201d Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Legend of the Twin Avatars: skip)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe grimm had a master, but depending of whether or not of the gender of the avatar of darkness. If light was male then darkness was female. With each set of twin avatars, the switch genders like after the example, light would be female and darkness would be male. Then it would switch again in each new set, but the main goal of them is not to fight each other but help each other in saving the world and defeating a grand evil, a true evil. The avatar of darkness had the grimm attack only those of evil intent with no chance of returning to light.\u201d Raven explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUncle has special eyes that lets him see if the person he is seeing is one of the avatars.\u201d Yin said and raven nodded confirming it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting, two people selected randomly at birth to wield special abilities.\u201d Ozpin said drinking his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach pair has to stop an event that could end the world.\u201d Simone said as she too knew the story after raven talked some sense into her when confronting her about yin\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis legend is not known like the history of how dust was found to give us the means to fight back against the grimm..\u201d Raven said and ozpin nodded drinking more coffee from his mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid one of the avatars went evil?\u201d Ruby asked as yin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to find anything that suggested the light avatar went evil, but I haven\u2019t found anything. Some of the darkness avatars did go down the dark path while others didn\u2019t, but hate in the darkness avatars builds in each life and it hasn\u2019t been released yet.\u201d Raven explained and ruby nodded understanding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere the two in love?\u201d She asked as yin snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach pair either had true love or treated the other as brother/sister so like family.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven left the room with the book and simone leaving yin with ruby and the two huntsmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(ozpin talk with ruby: skip)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin and goodwitch turned to yin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been home taught by my mother or the general if you want her respect so I could defend myself and others if need be.\u201d Yin said before sighing. \u201cI don\u2019t hate her, but I want out of her shadow.\u201d He added as ozpin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting and you don\u2019t have a real weapon on you, but make due with a practice sword and your aura.\u201d He said as goodwitch reveal the footage of him fighting the lava user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have more aura than the normal person huntsmen or not. I have been training to find out my semblance, but I haven\u2019t figured it out yet.\u201d Yin said before throwing his wooden sword out of the room through the door without breaking it hitting his uncle in the crotch, as he was laughing before going into the fetal position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised them was that it phased through the door and the adults left the room leaving ruby and yin to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have any idea of what you want for a weapon?\u201d Ruby asked and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new type of weapon that no one has seen yet.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the dust and the parts I need but I don\u2019t have the skill to make it.\u201d He added with a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can help you make them but you need something like blueprints or a picture of what form you want them to take.\u201d She said and he nodded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf yin has more than one semblance than the rest will come from his role as the avatar of darkness. Ruby isn\u2019t the light one from what I have seen, but she is in relation to the that is.\u201d Raven said as simone nodded with ozpin looking at the kids with a smile before sipping the rest of his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA person having more than one semblance is unheard of and frankly impossible.\u201d Goodwitch said adjusting her glasses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have seen his faunus eyes and I know that he is born human with no faunus traits in my family.\u201d Simone refuted that claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLetting him go to beacon will let him choose his own path and help him with walking the path as the avatar of darkness. I want him to be different from me and be his own person.\u201d Simone explained and ozpin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill he need a bullhead to pick him up and take him to the academy?\u201d Goodwitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll send him on my way to the base.\u201d She said as goodwitch nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that he met summer rose a few years ago. Raven was staying with me in the base helping to train yin.\u201d Simone said with a solemn look at the mentioned huntresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did he meet her?\u201d Ozpin asked interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe simply bumped into her and got a cookie from her. She called him cute while called his eyes interesting and told him she liked his eyes.\u201d She giggled at the cute memory of a small blushing yin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs raven still at the base?\u201d Ozpin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless she moved to another place then she is still at the base till I get a notice about her leaving.\u201d Simone said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ruby and yang meeting: canon and skip)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo you met the son of the strongest female general?\u201d Yang asked with a yang like smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that he is the dark knight and overprotective of his little sister. I can relate with watching over you though.\u201d She said with a real kind smile and hugged ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus I have to thank him for saving you.\u201d She said as the hug turned near bone crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black trailer pulled up as a door opened to reveal yin riding on a black as night futuristic motorcycle. The detail and graphics are of a dark horse and a pale white moon. The only thing known about the motorcycle is that it\u2019s called a spyder. A black helmet with dark red flames on the sides resting on the fuel tank. Yang tore up the bar the night his mother and father were at and she experienced firsthand what made his mother who she was. She had to spend the night watching his little sister and aki took a liking to yang so she wanted her around more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin chuckled hearing how his mother got yang to watch aki and he knew that she was over protective of ruby. She is on his good side and ruby is a friend to him leaning to good friend or a best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe good sochi; I\u2019ll give you a call when I can and check up on you.\u201d Simone said as yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have a place for you on the bullhead and the counsel know they can\u2019t do anything to you if you are the dark avatar. Your uncle hasn\u2019t found the light avatar light, but I have a feeling that yang girl would be the one.\u201d She said as yin smirked seeing both ruby and yang standing next to the trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that would be ironic.\u201d He said shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning ruby and her sister, yang.\u201d He greeted the sisters though not seeing yang before this would be the first time he actually meeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo mean sochi-kun.\u201d Simone called out before yin drove off the trailer and she had the trailer drove off so she could get to her base. Yin was chuckling at his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi yin.\u201d Ruby greeted her friend giggling at the exchange. Yang was staring at him and noticed his eyes, but he noticed her stare at his eyes and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy eyes are real faunus eyes, but I\u2019m pure human.\u201d He said with a slight cold tone. He usually gets slightly annoyed with people staring at his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Yang asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial circumstances.\u201d He said before driving off to his room on the bullhead. Ruby followed after him as yang watched her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit too cold for me, but a definitely a good friend for ruby.\u201d She muttered to herself as she followed them to his room. Yin slowed down to pull out some pills and give one to a pale looking blonde (vomit boy/jaun arc).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will help you with your airsickness.\u201d Yin said also giving him a small bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. The name is Juan Arc.\u201d He said feeling better thanks already feeling better from the pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYin Kamen, but call me ace.\u201d Yin said as jaun nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArc hmm, wasn\u2019t your family were in the last war?\u201d yin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy great-grandfather, grandfather, and my father were in the last war and I want to be a hero like they were.\u201d Jaun said and yin frowned a little, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe as our parent\u2019s kids can never be like them only better to surpass them or be worse.\u201d Yin said with a wise tone and the three nodded. His scroll beeped before showing a headshot of an ice queen (Weiss Shnee).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn that stalker for my mother.\u201d He said ignoring the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was that on your scroll?\u201d Jaun asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn ice queen of a stalker for my mother. She uses the same weapon as her and knows her reputation.\u201d Yin said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you ignore the call?\u201d ruby innocently asked and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate people like that and others who try to be my friends just to get on her good side.\u201d He explained as the sisters gulped in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two however, are different and yang is a real friend while ruby is close to a good friend or a best friend.\u201d He said as ruby had stars in her eyes while yang pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it had nothing to do with dat ass that you have.\u201d Ruby said to her sister sounding like her and yin chuckled at the two. Juan gave him a present from his seven sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom my sisters, they met your sister and wanted me to give you this, but also try to be a friend to you.\u201d Juan said and yin nodded taking the gift and the friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard about them caring for aki as a sister and it makes my job a little easier with going to beacon and all.\u201d He said agreeing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be brutally honest juan, going to beacon doesn\u2019t seem a good fit for you yet and joining the general\u2019s army would be a better choice.\u201d Yin said to him as he hanged his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJuan, you need training in combat and about aura so you can use it to unlock your semblance.\u201d He added with a true kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you have someone on your team that has training in combat, ask them for help train you. I can\u2019t do it till I get my own weapons.\u201d Yin said as juan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(flight over beacon canon except for juan not vomiting) skip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the flight, yin was in his room working on the plans for his weapons, which is a new type of weapon and jumped to prevent something from breaking on the floor. Looking up, he noticed it was a picture of the family with a chip on the glass over his mother\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Kaa-chan\u2019 yin thought before frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped on to his spydercycle and drove to the pilot of the bullhead. While the students were getting off the bullhead after it landed, ruby and yang were looking for yin since he hasn\u2019t gotten off yet. The bullhead started to take off with yin still on it, but he had something to do and it was more important than going to beacon\u2026for now. He sent ozpin a message that he would be coming back tomorrow after dealing with some personal business regarding to the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yin finished speaking with the pilot and left the cockpit, he noticed a young man in military uniform, sitting down and polishing his assault rifle. He had messy short, blonde hair. Was quite tall, had quite a muscular body befitting of a soldier and wore the standard Atlas infantry uniform. (Without the helmet) Yin was questioning to himself why an Atlesian soldier was onboard the Beacon academy flight. Then he thought it would probably be easier to just ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde haired soldier turned to his left and saw Yin striding towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier asked halting his polishing \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin spoke up curiously \"What's a soldier doing on an academy flight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier chuckled and put down his rifle \"I'm hoping to become a student here of course, although I missed my chance to drop off. I was getting too much into polishing my gun, and bam! That's when I realized everyone else was already gone, just me and you here now I guess. Did you miss your stop too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said now interested \"An Atlesian soldier wanting to study at Beacon? That's pretty strange. And no, I didn't miss my drop off, I told the pilot to fly to where the general is, I need to warn her. I have a sneaking suspicion someone is going to try betraying her. I don't know who it is just yet, but I have a pretty good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier asked amazed \"You're... not pullin' my leg? Really? WAIT!\" The soldier jumped out of his chair shocked \"You mean Simone? General simone?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said taken back by his enthusiasm \"Yeah, or as I like to call her, 'mom'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said blinking twice \"You must be Yin Kamen then. Nice to meet you sir.\" He held out his right hand for a handshake, and Yin just laughed \"'Sir'? You're so formal and respecting. I'm just a student here at Beacon too, or I'm hoping to become one soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier retracted his hand and said happily \"Nice to meet you Yin. I hope we become good friends or whatever. Anyway, I guess I'll have to message Ozpin explaining why I won't be showing up for the initiation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said opening his scroll \"I'll take care of that, now if only this bullhead could fly a little faster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier said introducing himself \"Almost forgot to tell you my name, Aubin Schmitz. Most people just call me Aubin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said shaking his hand \"Good meeting you Aubin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(teams and initiation and the first day at beacon is canon) skip and end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The morning of the next day started with a bullhead landing with a pissed off yin getting off. As for why, someone close to the family and under his mother's command betrayed them. The suspect that did it was a friend of the family and his mother's second-in-command. They betrayed the army, his family, and the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made my shitlist, Frost.\u201d Yin muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'll find and kill that bastard.' was an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen jumping off from the bullhead right behind him in dark green, waterproof overalls was Aubin who he just met yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubin said stretching and taking in the fresh air \"Great morning to be alive isn't it Yin? General Simone is a lot nicer than I thought she would be in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin asked slightly confused at his attire \"Why are you wearing what looks like a fishing suit to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubin said looking over still tired, yawning \"These are my casual clothes you know, that uniform gets really uncomfortable after a while, with the armour and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said grinning while picking up pace as they split up \"I'll see you later then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the academy, he felt students looking at him and he put up his hood to keep his eyes hidden. He calmed down a bit, but he noticed juan and a cute rabbit faunus girl (velvet) getting bullied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Older brother instincts and dark guardian activated.' He thought seeing his little sister in the girls place. Juan sees yin coming to help, but noticed a look on his face that means 'dont stop me I'm pissed'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should move.\u201d He said to the bunny girl before she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully was wearing chest plate armor for his tall form and carries a large black mace when allowed (Cardin). He and his friends felt killing intent as it got colder and stronger before turning to see yin glaring at them while cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree of you will be done in five seconds.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bully's friends were knocked out a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree seconds.\u201d Yin said before turning his scroll to show the teams it was really three seconds. Yin had his cold stare full swing on the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you to bully me and do actually try because I know I can kick your sorry ass all over beacon and vale. I will fight back.\u201d He said as he judo throw the bully into a locker before juan pushed six random buttons on the keypad having gained some courage and a bit of revenge on the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally juan? Really?\u201d the redhead warrior princess asked him as yin calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was irony.\u201d She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for helping us.\u201d velvet said before yin wrapped her in a brotherly hug and kissed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw my little sister in your place so I acted accordingly.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, I wanted to break his legs.\u201d a hyper girl said (nora).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora, why break his legs\u201d a boy asked sounding like someone yin had met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Monty?' Yin thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to channel your inner monty to find the answer.\u201d He said as the boy's eye twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOum.\u201d Nora said sounding like a monk and the twitching got worse. Yin chuckled before dodging weiss tackling him, caught a punch from yang, and let ruby hug him from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about yesterday ruby, but I had some personal business with the general.\u201d He explained to her and she understood perfectly since he voice was low and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a black cat in hiding (blake belladonna) probably from his kinning intent from earier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to weiss who looked to be ready to charge at him again. \u201cMiss Schnee, my mother, the general, doesn't need you stalker her or me. If you will continue, then you will force my hand and you will want to retreat into your own mind to cope from the shock.\u201d He stated before she could charge at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left after nodding to ruby and yang; he noticed goodwitch by a wall giving him a small smile. They went to ozpin's office to fill them in for why he was a day late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, the prodigal student has returned and a day late. Why?\u201d the headmaster greeted yin who rolled his eyes at him and sipped his coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't know you had a sense of humor, headmaster.\u201d Yin said as ozpin gave a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn any case I had to leave with the bullhead because I had a bad omen about the general and it made me worried. For now she is fine and so is my little sister. My dad is helping both of them to recover from shock.\u201d He explained briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Goodwitch asked while adjusting her glasses worried for the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA soldier under her command betrayed her, the army, and the family. The soldier in question is or was her second-in-command and he was a close friend to the family.\u201d He said as his hand clenched the hilt of the wood practice sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat kind of betrayal runs deep.\u201d Ozpin said drinking more of his coffee with yin nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have plans to catch him and there is a slight chance that I won't kill him.\u201d Yin said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how is the general and your little sister?\u201d Goodwitch asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will be some time before they will be back to normal but she will need a new second-in-command and she will make sure that she can trust him. I can see that, but aki-chan might develop some trust issues from this too. I can hope that won't happen since I can't bale her out and she has to make her own friends.\u201d he explained before releasing a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took the liberty to locate that bastard since he made it to the first spot on my shitlist.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about what he missed yesterday and the layout of the teams. He was given a key to his own dormroom as his spyder and yang's bike, bumblebee, was sent ahead of him are already in the room. He was also given a book of the classes he could take after his main classes are over. When he came out of the elevator, the cat from before was reading her book and was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an affect on yang and ruby, but have a dislike for our schnee teammate.\u201d She said closing her book as yin stared at the cover of the book when he recognized the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood book The story has potential, the love scenes are bland and tasteless, and the action is there with betrayal and mystery.\u201d He said surprising her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot an uncle who is a spymaster three times once removed who is a super pervert writes the books and sends me copies before he gets them published to hear what I think. I guess my mother was good for one thing; keeping me from becoming a pervert like him.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see your eyes? You dont have too if you don't want too.\u201d She said and he knew that she was nervous about asking him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you tell me about your past with the white fang.\u201d He said with a pure serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore You ask how I know, the general has former members before they turned violent in her army and I have trained with them.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was truly debating her answer, but decided on taking a chance on trusting the only son of a truly brilliant general. She told him everything about her past, the white fang, and her role in the group. He sighed before shaking his head, but he lowered the hood and revealed his eyes to her to keep the level of trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have never seen eyes like yours, but they are definitely intriguing.\u201d She said and he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the first time I heard that, but wont be the last time either.\u201d He said giving her a true smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake Belladonna.\u201d Blake introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYin Kamen, but call me ace.\u201d He said kissing the back of her hand like a gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get your eyes?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpecial circumstances.\u201d He said before giving her the short version of the story he grew up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe story isn't known by many, but I will guess that the history teacher here knows it. I know for a fact that you aren't the darkness avatar because another one of my uncles, uncle raven, has a special set of eyes that can see who holds the potential to be the next set of avatars. He said that I'm the logical choice for the darkness avatar.\u201d He explained to blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin stopped walking to see an ice queen (Weiss) standing a few feet from him and he know something changed her while he was gone with blake and his visit to the headmaster's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister told me to tell you that she is helping your father to help your mother and your little sister. Also your mother made a deal with me.\u201d Weiss said as yin let the information soak in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat deal?\u201d He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I can gain your trust or be the friend that you need, then she would meet with me for a private chat. To be honest, I'm more interested with how she made her army with both humans and faunus than her weapon.\u201d Weiss explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin chuckled, but shook his head in thought. \u201cShe still uses me for testing trust of others.\u201d he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but you only get a few chances and I'm more surprised with the general.\u201d He said before weiss nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother thing is that you could help train someone and that will add a few more points in your favor. Plus you can help ruby fill her role as your and blake's team leader.\u201d He added as weiss nodded while her mind flashed back to her talk with a portly professor who had a handlebar mustache (professor porter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not on the team, but I will do what I can to help her since I can think of strategies like the general.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked back to the cafeteria where the two sisters are plus the other team with juan as its leader. Yin got his food for lunch and to him its similar to what his mother makes for him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first one is for juan and the need for training.\u201d Yin said acting as a negotiator and both teams looking at juan and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWeiss agreed to train him and I would like his own team to help her train him.\u201d He added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is in it for us?\u201d Nora asked slamming her fist into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPancakes for the pancake queen, warrior princess-\u201d Yin started before said warrior princess cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPyrrha Nikos.\u201d She said smiling while yin was watching her in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell juan, this is your lucky day. You have the untouchable maiden as your partner.\u201d Yin said returning the smile to the warrior princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want anything in return for helping my partner.\u201d She said and yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about our resident monk (ren)?\u201d Yin asked as he noticed an eye twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't think of anything.\u201d Ren said shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk so after classes are over, I will go into detail on how to help you.\u201d Yin said as he finished his lunch and switched seats to sit next to him and across from ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy other deal is for your team, ruby.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI myself would need your help with making my own weapons as we talked bafore. Yang to be my sparring partner, weiss to teach me in glyphs, and blake in shadow control. I have seen the initiation for your team. I will return the help with a gift or something for a reward, but I'm asking for help with triggering my semblance.\u201d Yin said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelping ruby, juan, and you. I will have to keep a close eye on the time, but prioritizing is a must.\u201d Weiss said agreeing to help him and gain his trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I would help you make your weapons. You are like my best friend and the team aside from yang is like my sisters-in-arms.\u201d Ruby said nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you have your mom to focus on yesterday I guess I have to use this chance to see how skilled you are.\u201d Yang said agreeing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked to blake who had yet to answer, but she sighed before offering a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I can help you with my shadow control, but you have to spar with us so we can see your skills in combat.\u201d Blake said and Yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I won't have your abilities, but I'm more into the methods for controlling my aura.\u201d He said as blake nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day; give a man a fishing rod and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d Blake said as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby outside of the deal I will be helping you and juan to fill your role as team leader for your own teams. I don't have my own yet and I think the headmaster will pick them out or do something to show my talent.\u201d He said as they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the parts and the dust crystals in my scroll, which was made custom so I can store things into it.\u201d Yin told ruby and answered the unasked question about his scroll from the teams at their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you get them?\u201d Ruby asked happy to help make a new weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe night when we stopped that walking clich\u00e9 from escaping with the dust and you plus goodwitch met my mother. He explained and she nodded remembering that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't see your face, but I saw the back of your cloak with those four symbols on it.\u201d She said and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little sister had put glitter dust on it with our mother helping her.\u201d He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you have your secrets, but you have to give them up if you want to know my secrets. My eyes is a good example. The price for seeing them is to give me your biggest secret and I will keep my side of the deal. Only two people outside of the family has seen my eyes and I hope that number grows.\u201d He said before getting up and walking out, leaving both teams to mull over what he just discussed with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was leaving the cafeteria, he collided with another student, he barely moved but the student fell back on her posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long well kept, straight flowing cherry coloured hair. With a single braid running down to her hip. She was an average build and about average height for a young woman. She had pale skin. She was wearing a white lily in her hair for some reason. She wore a red cardigan with yellow buttons, and a slightly darker red shaded pair of trackbottoms and pink sneakers. Now that he had a better look at her she appeared to be quite light, maybe even anorexic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks twice and looks up at him rubbing her head. Yin offers to help her up extending his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes his hand after a moment of hesitation and looks down at some books she dropped when they slammed into each other. She quickly picks them up and says bowing to him \"Sorry, sorry! My mistake I was trying to... give these to Glynda. I thought she was here a minute ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin explained to her crossing his arms sighing \"She just left actually, she was here a few minutes ago but I didn't see where she went. What does she need those for anyway?\" He asked pointing at the books, they were clearly training manuals and he didn't believe for a minute Glynda needed training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the ground silent for a minute and looked to the right nervously. She sighed and spoke up beginning to panic slightly \"I uh, no that's not what I - see these are actually...\" She sighed and said defeated as lines students were passing them by \"Yeah... it's embarrassing but they're actually for me. I was looking for someone to help study with, the reason I was running was because I missed the initiation yesterday. I messed up big time so I want to get in lots of study to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin held out his hand offeringly, she gave him one of the books and he opened it up. Reading through it, he asked surprised \"This is some pretty advanced stuff you know, how to treat deep lacerations. How to ward off beowulfs without a weapon, proper handling of unstable dust crystals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl said slightly annoyed \"That's why I need a study partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin said handing her the book back \"I don't think you should be studying at this level yet, it seems a bit too extreme for the very first year here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl said with one final sigh scratching her hair with her left hand \"Yeah, yeah I know... I just wanted to show off a little I guess. I've already seen Ozpin about who will be on my team but he said some other students that are required for what he's planning haven't shown up to Beacon today. Either that or they're hiding, maybe ditching lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin finally asked her the important question \"What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at him and spoke with a smile on her face \"It's Razz, Razz Blank. I know it's a little weird for a name but that's it, heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin spoke as the line of students heading into the cafeteria had mostly stopped, leaving them more peace to talk \"Not at all actually, my name's Yin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazz asked interested \"Like yin and yang? That peace symbol or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin uttered kind of embarrassed  \"More like good and bad, can't have light without dark. Anyway, I've got to go. Good luck with your study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazz said waving him off as he walked down the stone path \"Ok bye Yin, nice meeting you!\" After that last sentence she felt kind of awkward and hurried into the cafeteria, irritated that she now has to wait in the long queue for her food.</span></div></div>",

He got up for a minute and turned on some music before getting back into his chair, but kept low for both to hear and still be able to talk and hear each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you thinking about?\u201d yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMulitple things.\u201d he said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo snow queen is the only one who hasn't seen my eyes or team JPNR hasn't seen them either.\u201d He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to see how your team and their team stacks up agaisnt me, but I have to get a weapon since this bokken can do so much before I can't use it anymore.\u201d He said and she smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooner or later it will be a bokken sword.\u201d she said and he shook his head at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went over to her bike and they actually were working on it so it can be the best for her and have more horse power in the motor without causing any damage to the performance or the control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were the light twin or a maiden of the season. You would be a sister to me and nothing more.\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No forbidden love between us or a small group of girls just for you, dark knight?\u201d She asked and he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have to be on your team level of power and be able to handle me when I finally let the anger building inside of me go and use it on my opponents.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that my team can't handle you?\u201d She asked smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChoosing to not fall for that obvious trap, but I have a growing rage and I have it under control till something like your team or someone close to me gets hurt.\u201d He said and she knew he was being serious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was team for bed and yang had to go, but not before yin handing her three cookies in a small bag of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRubes, would be sad if she didn't get a cookie and I thought it would be fair if blake and snowy got one too.\u201d He said and she smiled gently at him at his thoughtfulness of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure that she and they would like the cookies if ruby would let them try one each.\u201d She said before leaving his room and he closed his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed before glaring at the picture of him with his mother, raven, and summer on the desk he was using till he got his own team. He slowly walked up to the desk and sit in the chair looking at the ceiling in thought before looking at the moon through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know raven, yang is hurting from you leaving her and taiyang. I have dulled her rage towards you, but you better be ready to be there for her, him, and ruby. I want to see their supermom again like before that mission and prove that you were wrong about leading the tribe.\u201d He said with a hollowed tone and his eyes would have froze any and everyone in fear just by how cold his glare was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the plans he had long drew up for his own weapons in the style of gunblade as a new type of weapon use in the world that he with his family and friends live in. Tracing the layout of the weapons with a finger, he pulled out his scroll and started to line up the parts before he put the dust crystals into the chamber parts of his future gunblades. With gentle care, he was letting his mind and body drive as he was putting the parts together forming the hilt handles. He made sure that both were secured especially the dust chambers before shifting his focus onto the blades with the gun barrels inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has a total of 12 metals and he divided them up equally before taking them, the plans, the hilt handles, scroll, and tools. Silently leaving his room, for the forge in the tower that the headmaster gave him permission to use during his stay. While the forge was heating up to the right temperature for metal working, he was wielding the two groups of metal into two stacks and them on two metal poles. Using his aura to help shape the metal after getting it white-hot, he used a dust powered hammer to lengthen the metal and both form a pair of blades. He had been sure to not let his control slip while quenching the metal blades. He went over to the clay and put it on for a clay quench to get a hamon line as he thought to get a fuller in them soon. He tested his blades to make sure that they were hard and there were no problems with them. He had gotten a bit of a perfectionist from both his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put an etching on both of the blades before taking the blades over to the drill press for drilling holes in the blades so bullets and dust bullets could be fired. After drilling the holes, he made sure that the holes were lined up with the dust chamber and used a bit of his aura on a small ice dust crystal with a control amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dust shot hit a wall away from all the forging equipment and it froze a quarter of the wall before breaking apart not leaving any traces. The barrels in the blades have a twist like a coil to put a spin on the bullet fired from the chamber. After setting the new minted weapons down on an anvil, he put a twisted screw boltnut as a final piece in the guard where it meet the base of the blades to keep them locked in place. (AN: the guard has a little bit of folding metal to help lock the blades in place while the screw boltnut further locks it in place). Seeing the time was around 2 in the morning, he knew he spent most of the night working on his new weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat on a table after being sure that the forge was turned off and pulled out a pair of black sheaths for his new blades. He sheathed his blades and was pleased to see them fit perfectly. He tied the sheaths to his sides before testing his draw speed and cocking the hammers on the chambers. The pair of blades are 8 feet long and thicker to even out the length so there is no thin spots where they shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hold out his bokken with both hands praying over it and had the thought of writing seals on the bokken in the form of art. (Not the same as glyphs like wiess can do, but I more of a seal type use myself.) He pulled out some ink and a small set of brushes to write on the blade and hilt of the bokken. On each side of the bokken is a line of words from a dead language as he use his aura to burn the ink into the bokken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I will use my bokken and my aura so I can save my real weapons for the real fights.' He thought of a plan for the first half of the tournament.</span></div></div>",

Thinking for a moment, he was chuckling for a good bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam GRAY like Team RWBY.' he packed up everything and made sure that everything was like before he visited the forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wore his new weapons on his sides while resting his bokken on his shoulder and he came to the courtyard of the school looking at the moon with a solem look before turning to seeing the headmaster with goodwitch away from their posts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you took home in the forge for the good part of the night making your new toys.\u201d he said while yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was easier to let my instincts take over like I was figuring out a puzzle. I worked out the hilt, chambers, and guards on them first before doing the actual forging.\u201d Yin said as they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay we see them?\u201d Goodwitch asked before he shook his head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't let anyone have a look at these before I use them for their first test in battle.\u201d He said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad that you stopped Miss Xiao Long from her fruitless search.\u201d The headmaster said and yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever I'm willing to bet that a certain raven will be watching the tournament cheering for her daughter and student.\u201d Yin said with a low tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know for a fact that you know about jaune's situation, but dont worry I have it under control.\u201d He added seeing the headmaster smirk hiding as he sip from his late night coffee fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know what top secrets we have?\u201d Goodwitch asked him narrowing her eyes as yin gave them a deadpan stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother is a general no wants to fuck with for Oum's sake. The elder council included.\u201d He said like it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly raven and I can cause she let us and I like messing with her.\u201d Yin added with a devious smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin sit on the edge of the fountain and look at the moon some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI met more people who were late like I was and they were interesting to say the least.\u201d Yin said to the two as he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm assuming that you know which ones will be my partners.\u201d He said and it wasn't a question to the headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ever line between black and white known as GRAY.\u201d Yin said and the headmaster had to stop a chuckle by drinking more of his late coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you know your partners as well.\u201d He said and yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrizz, Razz, Aubin, and Myself.\u201d he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should get some sleep for the big day.\u201d The headmaster said and yin nodded before yawning from all the work he did in the forge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you need before I head off to the land of dreams, ozpin?\u201d He asked and they were thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall the general and see if she wouldn't mind helping us set up our big surpise.\u201d He said finishing his cup and yin look at him like that coffee was spiked with dust or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny words you want to say before I try waking the tomato basher up?\u201d Yin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer came from either of them and he sighed before pulling out his scroll. He looked through the contacts on his scroll before getting to his mother's number and called her. It was ringing a few times before it picked up and a sound of something being smashed with a simple punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSochi? Why are you even calling me this late? Are you having nightmares again or something happened that I need to hide the body or bodies?\u201d Yin heard the tired and the just waking up voice of his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo nightmares or bodies to bury unless you want goodwitch and ozzy to vanish from hearing what he just talked about.\u201d Yin said and she simply muttered a 'meh'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you calling me?\u201d Was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOzzy wanted to talk with you about something he was planning for the students that missed the initiation and the teams.\u201d He said and he felt her sit straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSochi. I'm sorry for that by the way.\u201d She said in a sad tone and he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it makes you feel better when I find frost, you can have the first crack at him; but I get to finish him.\u201d Yin said and she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo formal or casual?\u201d Was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCasual, but wear something warm. I'm used to the cold remember? Your and raven's training did that.\u201d Yin said before nodding to the two head staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything you WANT to happen for the big event?\u201d Was asked and yin thought about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo fights, One against team CRDL and one against my Friends in team RWBY; both on my own.\u201d He explained and she was confused with the scond fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fight with the jackasses I understand, but why a fight with your friends?\u201d Was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause it's a test to my skills and a test I will be going all out.\u201d He said remembering the words he said to the all girl team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it's one of those fights I see. Ok. I'll meet with them and help them out.\u201d She said before hanging up. He sighed before heading off to bed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon while all the students are sleeping, yin's mother or known as The general, was seen in the courtyard with the witch and headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you have him wake me up if you needed to talk with me?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said something about only him or one of your family can wake you up without having to play tomato smash with you.\u201d Goodwitch said adjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne time and he never lets it go.\u201d She said with a sigh before fixing her long coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe spent most of the night in the forge making his weapons.\u201d Ozpin said refilling his cup with more warm coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general was more straight hearing that looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I saw hilts of weapons when he called me.\u201d She said before taking an offered cup of coffee from the headmaster as goodwitch was drinking a cup of warm tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you want me here and now?\u201d The general asked drinking her cup to half gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wanted to know if we could host a special event at your base for the students that missed the inititation the other day. Plus have the teams that were formed a test of their teamwork.\u201d The headmaster explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thinking about before smiling a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that can be arranged for the school, but you have to remember that yin requested two fights alone.\u201d She said and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose can be set at specific times so he can rest in between.\u201d Goodwitch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the main event itself?\u201d Was asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA two part tournament. The first part is the singles like for those missed the first day. Then the second part is the teams say like team JNPR vs team RWBY or the soon to be team GRAY.\u201d Ozpin explained his idea and she was thinking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d She said fully agreeing with the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow soon can you get it setup?\u201d Goodwitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithin a few hours, but it can be done tomorrow and I still have to get more sleep before I actually have to be up.\u201d Simone said with a deadpan tone at the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course sochi with be the crowd favorite since he was training with the army while training with raven, but I think she can watch to see how little yang is doing and same with ruby since summer is still missing.\u201d She said and both nodded reading the file given on yin by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you really holding up?\u201d Ozpin asked with a more serious tone and the general knew it was about the betrayal of her former officer frost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy little aki is getting better more with winter there and sochi stayed with us after coming home with her and another student. I knew his father for some time.\u201d She said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for me, it hurt when it happened. When I finally retired frost was going to be my replacement and had him train a new second-in-command. I trained him from the ground up with countless others during my rise to my current rank. Sochi wants to hurt him and I don't blame him. I however only want to know why he betrayed a family that treated him like he was one of them and what made him do it.\u201d She explained finishing her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did the issue of his eyes come from?\u201d Goodwitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuring the training with the army and raven before he met summer. I think I had something to do with it since I'm his own mother. He had started to develop trust issues and almost always wear a hood to cover his eyes little before aki was born. But only she and their father would be able to see his eyes without the hood covering them.\u201d Simone answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know he still cares for me as his mother; still I let him come here to find his own path not only as one of the avatars, but also as person that is not standing in my shadow. I sent him here to also make it up to him for the early mistakes that I made.\u201d She added with a tired sigh like she was getting older from everything her job requires. Yin had hacked into his mother's scroll from his and he heard that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was standing at his desk and looking at the picture same as before while in a new frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already forgave you for that, kaa-chan.\u201d He said in a low whispered tone rubbing his thumb over the pictured of his mother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin went to sleep in his bed while his weapons are stored in the scroll as the adults were still talking about other things. His bokken was leaning against his desk with a light or ice blue glow to it. His mother perked her head up if she heard something like what yin had said before looking around slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, General?\u201d The headmaster asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thought I heard something in the wind.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you sochi-kun.' She thought knowing what yin said as he slept. In his sleep he had a small smile on his face and went into a deeper sleep.</span></div></div>",

She gathered her things before taking a cold shower and it woke her up as she warm it up to help her relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I have to have the base setup for the tournament and I think winter will be able to help me.\u201d She said to herself before ending the shower and went to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked on aki who was still sleeping as she noticed winter was sleeping in a chair next to the bed with a book on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aki-chan must have nightmares again so winter must have read her a story to help her.' Simone thought to herself before walking into the room. She gently shook winter awake before keeping her quiet by pointing to the sleeping little girl in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the room so they went to the kitchen while winter was working out the kinks in her back and was able to pop it a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't mean to sleep in that chair in her room, but she wanted a story read to her.\u201d Winter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigured.\u201d Simone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it you need from me?\u201d Winter asked the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSochi-kun called me last night for a meeting with ozzy and his little witch because they were scared to wake me themselves. They wanted to use the base for a tournament because there are some people who missed the test in the forest.\u201d Simone explained and winter nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d Winter asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me get the base setup for the tournament and let the army know that their champion will be coming home.\u201d Simone said and winter nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel about your sister being on a team with a supposed faunus?\u201d She asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm honestly hoping that she and I can help heal the wound that our father caused. It's why I'm staying with you more than I should and your daughter reminded me of weiss when she was younger.\u201d Winter explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just glad that your soldiers are letting me help them while I was helping you.\u201d She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were betrayed like my family was and I'm glad that they trust you.\u201d Simone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were talking over coffee about some of the ideas for the tournament and her husband and the father of their two kids walked into the kitchen smelling coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see the two drinking coffee without me.\u201d He said getting himself a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning sir/dear.\u201d Both of them said as he nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur son called me cause oz and his witch were scared of waking me up.\u201d Simone said and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were always like that with me some times, partner.\u201d He said as they share a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did those two want?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo use my base for a tournament for those that miss his test like when yin missed it cause of the former second-in-command.\u201d She said and he nodded before flexing his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sumbitch will die between me and ace hunting him.\u201d He said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a few more minutes before the father left to get things done around the house as the two were about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaa-chan, Winter-nee-chan, why do you leave?\u201d A voice of a young child asked meaning the youngest in the house awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause we have to get the base ready for when your brother is coming for a tournament that his school is going to hold.\u201d Simone said and the mention of her older brother perked her up looking at them with bright eyes with little stars in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnii-chan is coming home?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d She said before aki was hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe didn't make it?\u201d Aki asked her mother as she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my aki-chan. He just need to perform in the tournament while keeping in mind that he will get a team.\u201d Simone explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki who is a small chibi version of simone, but is more like her father is able to keep yin calm for some reason. Compared to their parents it was a role reversal with the kids. Aki nodded her head as her mother let her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do as well as you have been and I might get your class or you to watch him fight in the tournament.\u201d She said and aki was nodding her head so fast that it might come off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter looked at aki and noticed that a younger wiess was standing over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In a way she is like my little sister. It's that scary.' Winter thought before shaking her head to clear it and plan out the duties of the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaa-chan, Will winter-nee-chan go back to that ice place with the tin man?\u201d Aki asked simone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three looked at her surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Winter asked the chibi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want winter-nee-chan to stay.\u201d Aki said clamping on one of winter's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean as my new permanent second-in-command?\u201d Simone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. She is better than that icepick.\u201d Ake said and the two were chuckling at the joke aki did with the former frost name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to see about that, but I have a person in mind for that position.\u201d Simone said while thinking of raven and her tribe being the black Ops in her army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d Aki asked wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn old friend that helped yin train while training with the army.\u201d She said and aki was thinking on it. Winter got aki to let her go and aki went to get breakfast from her father. The two left the house for the base cause they have a lot of work to do. When they got to the base, it looked to be a compound to fit on a small island with everything they need to sleep, train, eat, and if the general needed it, a place to force the team to trust each other or force them to trust a new officer who did nothing that earned a certain level of hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the soldiers that were walking around outside saluted to the two officers. They nodded before making to a building that was their office and simone went to the PA system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention all soliders and personel, everyone is to attend this meeting and if anyone decides not to attend will be punished. I dont have the time for stragglers and I will say that punishment would be near frost level. It will be that severe.\u201d She said before she and winter went to the meeting room where all soldiers and officers were trying to get in before they were consider like former frost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone had a small smile seeing the soldiers and officers in the room waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for coming, but like I had said I don't have time so I will explain what the meeting is about.\u201d Simone said letting the soldiers and officers sit down from saluting her and winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast night or earlier, our champion or my son, had called me because of the headmaster and his assistant were scared to wake me up themselves. They wanted to use this base of ours to hold a tournament for their school cause there are some students that missed the test like yin has because of the former frost.\u201d Simoned had explained and all of them were cheering that their little leader was coming home to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we need to do?\u201d One soldier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe clean this place up like we were getting ready for inspection and set up the contest hall.\u201d Simone said and they all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I'm proud of you for keeping trust and loyalty unlike that frost. I'm glad that all of you are keeping to the code that I have taught into you.\u201d She said with a smile and a sad look in her eyes. She hear steps and noticed that all of the soldiers and officers were coming to her and giving her an army group hug.</span></div></div>",

Simone was clapping to get attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the kinds words, but we are sort on time so squad up and clean.\u201d Simone said as all the soldiers and officers left the room before turning to see a certain raven sitting on a rafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaven, not that I'm surprised to see you.

I have a bad feeling as a mother for weiss.\u201d Simone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a reason why?\u201d Winter asked a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother was part of my team before we disbanded and I was teaching james.\u201d Simone said and winter nodded before leaving her with raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: for those who don't know. I'm planning a twist with the lady schnee and it will be funny.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf everything goes well, I will have two under me and it will make me happy to have her and you, raven close by.\u201d Simone said and raven nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be head of the secret missions with my tribe help you more than ozpin.\u201d Raven said holding her mask like a performer. (more like shakespear play hamlet with the skull.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWE have to find summer and bring her back from where she is.\u201d Simone said before hugging raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to work with your brother despite your differences and that helps me out more.\u201d She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven turned back into her bird form before landing on the general's shoulder as she walked out of the tent. The soldiers were working as teams preparing the base for the tournament the returning champ of their base. The mood was like electric and they were in a good mood. Things were getting done as soon as possible as the general wanted it. They were putting everything into cleaning and setting up the tournament as the general was walking around before walking to her own quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be helping me in here and winter's room while she is doing her own task for me.\u201d Simone said to raven who changed back to human form. She nodded before they got to work in the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile working together over the course of hours, all the rooms was cleaned, the tournament hall was setup in the proper fashion, and the soldier's uniforms were pressed. Simone was inspecting everything like she had done this before and raven, in bird form, was on winter's shoulder as they watched their leader and proud comrade critique on every detail. All the soldiers and officers were tense cause their general was silent while winter and the raven were calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain like the times before and with that former frost, you have proven that you can work like a team and not be like you were before. I'm proud of you all and my own little soldier will be glad for you too.\u201d She said with a smile after a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is cheering for the pass they got as usual and they went to the mess hall for food and celebrate before cleaning it again. Winter and simone were smiling happy for the soldiers and officers, but all three were thinking about the coming event for the school. Simone left to make the call for ozpin to bring the school for the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello oz, the base is ready for your school and you better bring all of your students. I will make the rules and be the final judge with two others.\u201d Simone said on her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is some quick work.\u201d Ozpin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy soldiers are ready for their champion to return, but I have to talk with tinman, about keeping his assistant as one of my new commanders and placing another one under another branch that only answers to me and not the council.\u201d She said and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will be there later the afternoon.\u201d He said and she nodded before the call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention all students, all first years will be taken to the vale's military base for a tournament that the General setup a place for and it will be for those who miss the day of the team test and for the teams that have been form to see what you learn. There will be two exibihition matches featuring two teams against one student, but this student would be the army's champion from what the general told me.\u201d Ozpin said and yin knows who he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe older years will be watching from here and the general will be providing them the action. The first years will be taking a ship that brought them here and any misconduct will be sorted out with the general and miss goodwitch will add to it. Anything more may result in expulsion.\u201d He added before he and goodwitch went to recruit the ship that brought the new students here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin is smiling knowing that his mother came through for him on his two requested fights. 'Soon everything will start coming into place.' Yin thought as he had his bag over his weapons to hide them from view. To be fair he was getting excited for seeing the army his mother raised and led them to victory in every fight in the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't wait for those two fights and I know how to fight with what weapon.' He thought looking at his trusted bokken rubbing it with aura like it is an old friend. \u201cReal weapons will be for the fight with ruby and her team and bokken with the CRDL fight.\u201d He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the first one on the ship when it came to land. As he went straight to a room, he noticed CRDL was up to something again and he know cause he was getting vibes from them. He ran back to see that team about to bully Jaune again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave your childish ways for the tournament and our fight cause your asses will be mine and you will be tasting splinters.\u201d Yin said holding his bokken at cardin with a fierce glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked off with a off and yin stayed with his friend. \u201cJaune, you have to gain a spine or they will keep bullying you.\u201d He said with a kind tone and jaune nodded. They with his team and team RWBY on the ship, but yin went to find a room for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin is resting in his room during the flight and was preparing his mind for the tournament. He was thinking of the army that he was champion of when he was little. Getting an idea, he went over to his bag and was taking a shower as a set of clothes were on his bed. His new weapons were in the bathroom with him so he knows where they are. Soon after the shower and getting dressed again, ace had his new weapons on the bed and he was cleaning and tuning them. He kept his door locked so no one sees his first two masterpieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, he put them on his back in an X fashion before putting his bag on his back. Walking out of the room, the hallway was clear before he walked forward to a window. Vale was coming into view, but only barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Will be there soon and the debut of my beauties will be unleashed.' he was thinking to himself.</span></div></div>",

I know how she acts with new weapons.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She said and he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I think you are turning into a white rose.\u201d He said and she turned her head feeling a faint blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get those two weapons?\u201d She asked him as the red faded from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpend an all nighter making them while the others were sleeping in their beds.\u201d He said and she looked to him shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was like a puzzle to me mostly, but still don't say a thing to ruby.\u201d he added and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI modeled them after her and your weapons, but only in the hilt.\u201d he explained with a smile and she felt a blush return and was a little darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to her and had concern for her by placing a hand on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok, Weiss? I think you need to lay down. You might have a fever.\u201d He said. She backed away from him still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry. I don't have a fever.\u201d She said before her legs gave out and he caught her before she hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helped her back to her feet and let her walk back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, you make a pun, trust me you will feel of the wrath of dragon of darkness for xiao long.\u201d He said seeing yang chuckling at his pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want my little sister not to know?\u201d She asked. He simply gave a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsks a million questions in a few seconds, but to me she is cute like a little sister.\u201d He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause I want to see her surprise when I do use them.\u201d He said and she nodded.</span></div></div>",

After the last of the students got off the ship, it took off leaving to refill before coming back to pick them up after the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Yin thought before seeing the army cheering and he was waving at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are happy to see their champion back even if its for awhile.\u201d A voice said and yin knew it was his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeneral.\u201d He said before she hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake them proud, little soldier.\u201d She said as ozpin and goodwitch were standing by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me. I'm done hiding.\u201d He said with a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a raven and turned his head around seeing a raven on his mother's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe narrowed his eyes before smirking at it. \u201cDon't miss the show, sensei.\u201d he whispered as the raven cawed and flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the first years were led to the barracks where they will stay for the tournament. Yin watched them pick bunks for the boys. The girls are in the female soldier barracks doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHands off the bunk at the corner. That is my bunk.\u201d He said as he claimed the bunk he slept on when he was younger. Aubin came up to him a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind if I bunk with you?\u201d he asked and yin looked at him with a lazy gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. You take the top bunk.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey setup things into a footlocker for aubin as yin still has his own from his training here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everyone picked a bunk bed and their things into a footlocker?\u201d Yin asked the boys. They nodded and he smirked at a certain group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I forget, any tampering with the bunks or lockers will be dealt with general and the headmasters. Trust me, you don't want her angry.\u201d He said as he led the boys to the messhall. The girls were there and the soldiers were lining the wall. Everyone was facing his mother, ozpin, and goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis tournament may or may not be part of your grades, but it depends on how well you perform as a team and on your own. For those that miss the first day, don't worry today you will be made into a team.\u201d Ozpin said as simone stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, for the rules of the base since you are guests here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Stay with the group and don't wander off. If you get lost, ask one of the soldiers to help you find your way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you sneak into one of the restricted areas then you will be treated as a traitor of vale and not even your parents will be save your sorry asses from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Regarding rule 2, Since the betrayal of my former second-in-command, im more in tuned to capture and torture and anyone I deemed a traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. I'm allowed to take anyone from the school and place them into my army instead. Depending on the additude will make your stay shorter or longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Lastly, any racist comments to the faunas members of my army will be dealt with by me. I dealt with it before from them and I will end it from any of you.\u201d She explained and all of them nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led everyone to the tournament hall combat stage and the students were sitting in half of the stands while the soldiers were sitting in the other half of the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then before the tournament can officially begin, there will be two exhibition fights and two teams against the champion of my army before he left.\u201d She said and they were looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is the champion and who are the two teams to fight him?\u201d Ruby asked her with a hand raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general smirked at the question and looked onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe champion she is talking about is me.\u201d Yin said stepping up on the combat ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were shocked or at least surprised to hear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for the two teams I want to fight is Teams CRDL and RWBY.\u201d He called out. He threw his bag to his mother revealing two weapon hilts and pulled out his bokken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won't even need my two babies to beat the carnigan team.\u201d He said handing his swords to a trusted faunas soldier by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Ruby asked as team CRDL was rushing to the step up the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeat them in their place and as for your team ruby, to test your skill as a team and my new weapons in a real fight.\u201d He said as he was surrounded by CRDL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d Simone asked as they and yin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin.\u201d She simply said getting out of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin ducked under the weapons meeting over his head and he sweep the team off their feet with a simple move. Using some aura into a kick, he kicked cardin hard enough to send him flying into his partner and leaving a bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that hurt, carnigan? It shouldn't have because it wasn't even 5% of my aura.\u201d Yin said as his eyes were glowing feeling the hate building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was for velvet and the other faunus you bullied.\u201d He added while his mother was looking at him with a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you allow him to fight a team on his own?\u201d Goodwitch asked the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo help vent the hate building up in him or if it keeps building it will explode on him and make things worse.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do have some thought on that arc kid. He could use some training in a boot camp or personally trained by me.\u201d She added and they were looking at her like she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me that you already figured it out. I mean I know he doesn't any training as a warrior and that is just from my role as general.\u201d Simone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight continued as yin was using their anger to throw them off while controlling the flow of the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarnigan, I swear we were taught this in combat class and your team has been following my lead during the fight.\u201d Yin said as his eyes were glowing taking in the anger the team was exuding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin and his team were barely standing because of the minor pain and being led like an idiot. They charged at him on last time and yin was waiting for them for the last time. Yin was using his bokken to block before hearing a cracking sound. Yin look and seeing his favorite weapon was starting to break from the years of use and training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad to be now.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke the clash and his bokken was cracking more. He jumped away from them to the edge of the ring. He threw his sword into the air and was channelling his aura into his hands. He caught the sword in his mouth while two swords formed in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN: I'm using zoro style for a second before his old friend breaks for good.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if my weapon breaks, I will still fight.\u201d Yin said as his aura was glowing an ice blue all over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo come on carnigan, show me you got the bulls to fight grimm and live. This is no game we are playing and the time to be a bully has passed a long time ago.\u201d Yin egged him on as he shifted into a stance that simone's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy that stance?\u201d She whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know something about what he is doing?\u201d Goodwitch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a fighting stance that one person has to train wielding three weapons at once.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team charged at yin once more before he was smiling at the possible change in the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree sword style: Dragon World Burner.\u201d He said spinning like a top and trapped the team in the vortex for 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin stopped at the team was not moving but not dead. The general stepped forward and raised yin's hand as the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWinner: Yin.\u201d She called out and the army was cheering for him as he was their champion. Yin's aura faded and looked at his good friend as it finally broke in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shed his tear for his friend and handing it to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean what I said to the carnigan team. This is not a game. This is life and there is no reset button. We are teams for reasons and that is to help those who can't save themselves. We watch each other's backs so there are no sneak attacks or surprises.\u201d He explained to the first years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won't hide or run, but I will rip trees out of your asses to make sure you get the point.\u201d He added before leaving the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was close to the door when he was tackled by a small red blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cONII-CHAN.\u201d Was heard and he knew it was his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike the show, aki-chan?\u201d He asked holding her in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I know you will beat the others too.\u201d She said and he smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnii-chan, do we need to put bokken-kun to rest?\u201d she asked about his favorite and first training weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, I have to be ready for my next match against your favorite sitter's team.\u201d He said and she nodded. They left as everyone watched them leave the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone coughed into her hand for everyone to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next match will begin in a few hours. Get something to eat and rest, Team RWBY, get prepare for your match.\u201d She said as everyone left to follow her orders.</span></div></div>",

We need to save them.\u201d Aki said and ruby was going with the play. Yin was laughing at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk you two. Aki-chan, your cookie commander is needed here, but then the tournament will have to start for real.\u201d Yin said settling both of them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut onii-chan.\u201d She whined. Weiss had a flashback with her and winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how is Kuro-chan?\u201d he asked her and she lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, but misses you and likes my hugs.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKuro-chan?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin look to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA black cat I saved when I was younger while the general and I weren't seeing eye to eye.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki was still hugging blake before yin got her off and back to eating her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA piece of advice from me.\u201d He said as the team was looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork together and trust in each other or it will be too easy for me to pick you apart. I want a real challenge from you four. Share your strengths, weaknesses, and everything else. When you do that, then I will take you seriously.\u201d He said and they nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, I can almost call you a friend.\u201d He whispered in her as he and aki left to dump the remains of their lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is testing us.\u201d Ruby said after they were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Weiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wants us to be the best team we can be and there should be no secrets between us.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe knows me and ruby are two weak points.\u201d Blake said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitty say what?\u201d Yang asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby isn't used to being a leader unlike him and his mother. As for me, I still have some secrets of my own.\u201d Blake said and ruby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is giving us a chance to change that and be a real team.\u201d Ruby said before yang turned to see a raven flying around. She narrowed her eyes at it like she was sensing something from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something is weird about that bird.' She thought before turning back to her team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin was at a waterfall training ground meditating with aki holding his swords on her lap. His body was glowing with aura before it was growing and blast off him freezing the water around him. He used his aura again to break the ice till water was falling down on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you giving them time nii-chan?\u201d Aki asked as yin was walking towards her and dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it would be too easy for me to pick their team a part and I have been planning to use my new brothers on them.\u201d Yin said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey need time to let the secrets out and to air them out like between ice queen and blake.\u201d He said and aki agreed knowing that blake was a cat faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you like snow-chan?\u201d Aki asked and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is a friend to me and us, but this is her final test and this makes or breaks my trust in her.\u201d He said and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, RWBY was talking with each other in a sealed off room provided by the general as they were taking his advice. By doing this, they took the shock away from this if yin decided to take the team apart by using the same secrets. Weiss thinking it over and knew this was something that could help or break yin's trust in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I was the me before I met yin, then I wouldn't been me that I am now.\u201d (she means that she would be canon weiss) She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven with the white fang causing problems, I didn't have a good childhood growing up.\u201d Weiss said before going into her own past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, yin was getting ready for his next fight with team RWBY. He stopped before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They are deepening their bond as a team.' He thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon it was time for the last match that yin was fighting against a team again, but he wants a real challenge. Yin is meditating in the arena waiting with his two sheathed swords on his lap connecting with them. Team RWBY came into the arena with their weapons in hand. They walked to the stage and the whole room was silent as a graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I trust that you were doing some team bonding?\u201d Yin asked and they nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how far will you go for each other? Better than the carnigan team?\u201d He asked and they held determination in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll...\u201d Blake started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe...\u201d Yang continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAY.\u201d Ruby and Weiss finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin smiled before laughing. The tone of the laugh set everyone on edge except for aki and the general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the way, eh? Well then, show me you got the skill.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there is no more talking, then let the match....Begin!\u201d Was said before the general jumped off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonochrome.\u201d Ruby called out just before blake and weiss went to attack ace at the call. Blake went to attak with her weapon as weiss was using her glifts and dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSummer Rose.\u201d Ruby said as she and yang went to join in the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin smiled before jumping into the air. He pulled out his swords as his aura was surrounding his body. He used a blade to block blake's attack dodging the speed thrust from weiss. He noticed yang and ruby in the air before they became a spinning drill of rose petals and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like I actually need to try hard here.\u201d Yin said before the red and yellow attack hit him. The meters were his was at 90% and team RWBY was at 95%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo Sword style: Four-Point Barrier.\u201d Was heard as yin was still alive while inside a barrier of aura by using his swords and sheaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aura meter dropped to 80% from the almost last minute defense against the attack. Resheathing his blades again, keeping them on his back before drawing them out. One sword had a black blade with dark silver streaks like lightning while the other sword had a midnight blue blade with ice blue streaks like lightning. The dark blade's hilt is built like a revolver with a six slot for the dust crystals as the metal is dark grey for the guard. The other blade's hilt is a shotgun or rifle gunbutt and the guard is a 12 slot for the same type of dust. Both blades are 8 feet long and sharp as a razor's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will have to thank you ruby for telling on how you made your cresent rose.\u201d Yin said. Using aura, he cocked both hammers making both guards spin selecting the first dust to use in this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Ruby asked seeing the blades and going starry-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus ruby, this isn't the time for your nerd side for weapons to come out.\u201d Weiss said as yin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby-chan did ask an honest question, but these are something new and of my own design.\u201d Yin said as the spinning stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBased on the general's own weapon, but it's not only a sword...\u201d He started before pulling the triggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin sounds exploded from his blades as to blasts were aiming for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's also a gun.\u201d He finished watching the smoke clear from the explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared, weiss was infront of her team protecting them with a shield of aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood weiss, I say after this you earned your prize.\u201d Yin said smiling as said girl looked at him in minor shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith time and experience, you four will be the best team.\u201d He added before channelling his aura through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis meter was slowly dropping meaning that he had more aura than most compared to what normal people had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAura Doppelganger.\u201d He said before three aura outlined appeared by giving him the look of an ashura with nine arms and three faces. The clones walked away each facing a member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Almost like my semblence, but it needs work.' Blake thought studying the clone facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still need control over my aura.' Yin thought clicking his teeth as he was facing ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the fight broke into four smaller fights as the clones were following into his style. After 30 minutes of clones fighting they faded and his aura was 69% as the girls were at 75%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Enough for a last attack.' Yin thought tighting his grip on his swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeason rush.\u201d Ruby said as they stood back-to-back each facing a direction like a compass. Blake's ribbon stretched wrapping their hands together each holding a weapon. Seeing the team working, yin smiled a true smile as he flared his aura. They jumped with weiss's glifts and ruby is speeding them towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree sword style: 9000 World's Dragon.\u201d Yin said as an aura sword appeared in his mouth as he was spinning his swords like a whirlwind pushing them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBullets were being fired at him, but it wasn't working and ruby had them add a spin in the opposite direction. Yin fired a dragon made of aura at them, but yang boosted their attack power. Goodwitch wanted to stop the fight, but was stopped by both ozpin and the general cause this isn't a tournament match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake help her team dodge the dragon as they was getting closer to yin. The meters were getting closer to the red zone, but not there yet. When they got close enough, yin stopped to use his swords to block 3 of the 4 weapons as the dragon turned around and hit them causing a large explosion. The general went to check up on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are alive, but There is no winner. It's a draw.\u201d She called out before the fighters were taking to the bunks.</span></div></div>",
