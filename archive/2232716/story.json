You're a random dude with no social life-you spend all day watching celeb news and other trash tv b/c you're bored with you're life as a computer guy, but none stand out to you more than Paris Hilton herself. You've watched her since she first hit it big in the early 2000s and still adore her now even though she's pushing 40. It's something about her beautiful face, her elegant composure, or her twisted personality that appeals to you and you always dream of meeting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day-you're sent to work on fixing the internet connection for a premiere NYC hotel and expect it to be just another day at work when suddenly you hear cheering and people screaming and look outside the hotel to behold the legendary celebrity Paris Hilton walking into the hotel followed by her entourage. In a panic, you quickly retreat back to you're work fixing the connection in the vacant room that you're in wondering if you'll run across her during her stay. Suddenly you hear a barrage of footsteps and the door swings open to see a trio of muscular men in suits who looked to be security type personnel and one of them casts you a snarl and says \"Hey kid-beat it this room you're stinking up is reserved for Paris Hilton and she'll be here any second so scram!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just finishing fixing this crappy internet connection\" you contend. \"You'd think for the rate this place charges they could at least afford a better internet provider than AT&amp;T\". One of the dudes snarls again at you and begins to advance on you in an aggressive way. \"Ease off, Joe!\" an elegant yet stern voice says from behind him. Joe stopped dead in his tracks and bowed his head to be pushed out of the way by none other than the millionaire heiress herself. She was wearing an long elaborate white dress and walked up to you standin slightly taller than yourself in her high heels. \"Sorry for this rudeness\" she smiled. \"His job is to protect me and sometimes he can be a jerk, thank you for making sure my room is working okay.\" You look at her an smile back \"No prob-Ms Hilton-I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.\" She nods at you and you take advantage of the oppportunity to make your exit from the awkward situation. Secretly, you're screaming on the inside from getting to meet you're favorite celeb, but are also happy to be relieved from the tense situation. Later that night, you get call from the hotel that she's staying at and...</span></div></div>",

Realizing that it could be your job on the the line-you hustle back to the hotel even though it's nearly midnight and you don't understand what could be wrong. You arrive at Paris suite and knock 3 times on her door. It opens to reveal the heiress wearing only a white bathrobe and slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm deeply sorry Ms Hilton\" you say. I don't understand what could be wrong with your connection-it worked fine when I last left. She smiled back at you \"It's no prob-please come in\" she says opening the door allowing you to enter. As you walk in you notice her laptop sitting on the table logged into facebook and realize that something's not right. \"Ugh-so your connection isn't working but you're still able to browse the internet?\" you say looking at her in a confused manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParis shuts the door and walks toward you and then laughs \"Ok-you caught me my internet is working fine-but I felt bad about the way that Joe treated you earlier and just wanted to talk to you a little bit. She smiled and sits back down in the chair at her laptop an motions you to take a seat in the adjacent chair. You comply in a kind of stunned silence. \"You know-she says most people I run across can't come near me without asking for a an autograph or my picture\" she sighs \"Aren't you going to ask me for something like that\" she said looking at you curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ms Hilton\" you reply. \"While it's true that I follow you and find you interesting and beautiful-I would never want to infringe on your privacy or life and am just trying to do my job\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she says in genuine surprise. \"So you say that you find me beautiful-what is it that you like about me?\" You reply \"Everything Ms Hilton-you smile, you're hair, your perfect physique-you just grab me as the perfect woman-almost as a goddess\" you start to say then choke it back to avoid the embarrassment. Much to your suprise she just looks back at you with curiousness \"That's cute-she says-if you think that I'm a goddess now-what would you say if I was 1000 ft tall\" she say in a playful demeanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with a blank expression \"I don't know-Ms Hilton\" I guess that would be interesting, to say the least, but you'd have to be 1000 ft for me to know first\". She laughs \"that's a good observation\" but what it rather than me being 1000 ft tall-what if I were normal height and you were just reeaaaallly small\" she said with a look of mischief beginning to form on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Ms Hilton-honestly it's hard to say, but since your internet seems to be working-I think I'm going to leave\" As you're walking out suddently something happens...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the ground shakes and you look behind you to see a monster, but a very beautiful monster at that towering over you  and realize by the white bathrobe that it's wearing that it's Paris Hilton! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG\" you scream \"what has she done to me\" You begin to run in a panic away from the monster but before you get more than a few inches, a giant soft hand encapsulates you and everything goes dark. When the hand opens up you stare in awe at the most beautiful and imposing thing you've every seen in staring at Paris Hilton's beautiful goddess like eyes that are each as large as you are. She smile revealing monster like teeth and then says \"I'm very flattered that you think I'm a goddess-and I'd like to show you just what  a true goddess that I can really be\" she says and then brings you forward to give you the largest kiss you've ever received.

I know who you are, Ivan, I know you obsess over me and write blogs about me online about how beautiful I am and how you wish more than anything to serve me and be a part of my life. I requested you to be sent to work on my room's internet connection so that this could be possible and I used a special technology afforded to me by my billionaire friends to shrink you to only a few inches so now that fantasy of both yours and mine can be a reality. She looked at your stunned expression and says \"So, my tiny slave-are you going to serve your goddess loyally or will I have to teach you to be obedient\"...</span></div></div>",

But I should let you know that, even at that size, I don't consider you a pet-just my plaything. But if you refuse to be my plaything-then you would make a perfect plaything for my actual pet\". With that she reaches down and pulls up a large travel case meant for small animals and unzips it. A huge monster pokes it's head it's head out and begins to bark out loud monstrous barks that pierce the air. \"Hello, my little Tinkerbell-Paris cooed to her small Chihuahua. Look, my sweet girl, \" she says motioning towards you \"I bought you a new chew-toy!\" With that she set the travel bag on the table you were standing and the monster jumped from its cage. It barreled towards you shaking the table with its footsteps. You scream and dive for cover behind a figurine on the table and just barely evade the monster's first charge. After realizing that it missed, the snarling beast turned its large head around, white teeth bared and saliva dripping from its lips in anticipation of the taste of your flesh. It roared and began a second charge-this time with it's head lowered and aimed towards you. You scream once again and this time can do nothing but cover yourself with your arms for the coming assault when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

This time you see the enormous Chihuahua standing directly over you but panting and wagging its tail. Again, Tinks goes in for another lick and you get slimed with dog slobber again but you mind less this time because you realize that you're not going to be eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tinkerbell-you little shit\" Paris exclaims angrily. Before the dog can give you third coating of saliva she grabs up the dog, scolding it angrily and puts it back in the travel case. She turns back looking at you menacingly \"Alright-so pampered dog isn't going to do anything to you, but if you don't submit slave-I promise that I'll turn you into such a crushed state-that she'll think your her dog food-got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate the situation and then answer her... </span></div></div>",

Getting on top of the molar you begin to pull and heave at the hunk of food struggling to dislodge it. \"Hurry up slave\" she admonishes \"Otherwise I might get tired of keeping my mouth open and might just have to bite down on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the pace pulling on the food with your strength when suddenly it pops out and you fall back on the back part of Paris tongue.

With that-she zips the cover of the purse and everything goes dark as you feel your world begin to shake and rumble and realize that Paris is on the move.  After 15 very uncomfortable minutes of being jostled around in her purse between all the items inside it-you suddenly feel the motion stop and you wonder what's going on. You notice a small sliver of light and realize that a part of the zipper became undone throughout all shaking and and begin to hike up some of the various items in her purse until you reach a pen that's sticking up and shimmy up it until you're close enough to make a jump for the opening. You leap and barely grasp onto the edge of the purse's fabric. As you climb through the opening-you behold a giant and beautiful world around you of gold sculptures, magnificent paintings and lavish carpets and realize that you must be in Paris' penthouse (or at least one of them).  You crawl down the fabric of the purse and realize that you're on the ground and that no one is around. Paris must have thought that you were secure in your purse cage and left to do something else. Realizing that you must act quickly before she returns-you try to run as fast and far as possible to get away from the purse-when suddenly you hear pounding footsteps and look behind you to behold...</span></div></div>",
