            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's something <i>sad</i> about getting used to a city like Las Vegas. Even worse is just wanting to get out of the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Last call for Las Vegas, Nevada. We shall depart for Phoenix, Arizona in five minutes.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left half of my body hung outside with the cold, frosty air of Vegas that was hued by the colorful afterglow of the neon sprayed sky, and the coat I wore couldn't protect me from the occasional snowflake blinking its way into my eyes. Only the very last dribbles of passengers who'd bought tickets onsite came in at the bare bones before takeoff, and were coming in, pushing departure up to its lasts straws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can hear me, human! Look me in the eye if you have a shred of courage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, if you have any complaints about the Gaian establishment, you can send an email at our official website, or send a call to our customer service department to voice your concerns.\" Said stock response #45.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud snort, the blubber-bloated equine shuffled into my line of sight down the train, waggling a blood-painted sign right in my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic! You just can't admit you're a just another little cog in a factory that enjoys butchering animals, when here we could be living perfectly normal lives off of plants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, miss. I'm not the area that entices that kind of request.\" Response #15. <i>Christ almighty, please tell me at least a hundred seconds've passed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You people are all alike! Animals are the births of evolution across the world, and you all...look at me!!!\" She stepped forward as far as she could without touching the train, bending over her behemoth of a belly enough that she could glare down at me. \"How would you feel if I went around tearing <i>monkeys </i>apart to eat them?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, have a nice day.\" #1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Doors are closing.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine's belligerent ranting was drowned out by the screams of joy cheering in my mind as I slinked back into the coach, the door sliding shut on their own. Francine didn't seem to be in enough of the hitchhiking mood to chase me down, either, but a can of soda was promptly smashed along the window, coating the glass in cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ladies and Gentleman aboard The Gaian Express, we are about to take off from Las Vegas, Nevada, at 3:08 AM, the date being December twelfth. The current weather at Gaia 2.0 is snowy, expected to intensify as the week goes on, but we are still scheduled to arrive on time at 1:30 AM on the fourteenth, without any perceived intrusions.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Our next stop is at Phoenix, Arizona, expected to arrive at 7 AM, with the inclusion of time zones. Until then, we wish you a pleasant trip on board, and welcome you to the facilities listed on the pamphlets that can be found your nightstands. Thank you for riding us, and we hope you enjoy your stay.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the whistle blew. Far down somewhere along the track, the shrill blare of an airhorn echoed above all the skyscraping casinos, swimming for many miles over the empty desert land. Without the cars lurching against one another, the wheels began turning. The grains of the station's concrete slowly shifted towards the left, with fives of miles per hour being fueled into our speed along the track, till we'd left the station's threshold with enough speed that the ties of the tracks were flickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVibrant stripes of light rippled along the floor as the windows scanned past the native marques and casinos, but the colors eased off in width and abundance as we came closer to the city's boundaries. The towering skyscrapers and resorts trunked off into more modest hotels, and they themselves faded into little tourist traps and gift shops. It was only till we'd sped past one last gambling house that we'd chugged clean out of the city with one last blare of the whistle, abandoning the bright lights to pitch black that swallowed miles ahead of the snow-covered desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have much of a chance to keep looking out window, though, when the intercom's red light buzzed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Engine to Cabin car 1, does anybody read me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the response button. \"Morning, Miss Carmine. Nathan at Door A!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Morning to you, too Nathan. Any trouble down at the station?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aside from the usual run in with Francine, we should be good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave an exasperated sigh, one so tired I could almost see her holding a palm along her face, but the sound came back with the ruffling of some papers. <i>\"Anyways, I was calling about tonight's schedule, which you'd probably figured out already.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat I had. \"What'd you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking that until we get to Arizona...\"</span></div></div>",

The job looked easy enough, with only a few guests still up and lounging around, but it'd have looked a hell of a lot easier if Dana was anywhere to be seen. Three runthroughs of the cars came up with no sign of the giant bird anywhere, each one filling my mind with more images of the extension cords she could've tripped over along the way, or all the windows she could've tumbled out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took ten minutes of watching the door and waiting for it to open for me to give up. <i>I'll have to call Miss Carmine up on thi-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the aisle, I could actually see and hear a few of the guests go silent as I was cast right in the center of a deep shadow that poured in through the opened doorway, a resounding <i>boom </i>shaking through the floor that made me nearly lose my footing as I turned around to look. But a few feet away, a shapely, leviathanic mass of blubber and muscle pushed its way into the car along the floor, standing high over my head like some spheric monolith that'd fallen from the heavens, its lower half covered by a soft coat of feathers whilst the upper was still covered by a clean purple jacket whose sole intact button strangled as it held the suit together around an immense pair of breasts. Dana's already immense legs were clenched up as their throughs of muscle supported the weight of her belly, but they still struggled to navigate around its underside, transforming her pace into some kind of an overexerted swagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, beneath the cheerful colors of her uniform, her face was a stony grimace whose feathers were stained by three scars slashed along her right eye, one reaching enough to put a tiny scratch in her beak. Gazing down at the spot where I stood, she carefully leaned forward on top of her stomach, her golden eyes narrowing further with an acidic twinge that deepened the more she zoomed in on my lanky, twiggy figure... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...before smiling. \"Hey, Nathan. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what we'd been called up for. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...a lot.\" She rolled back at full height, walking past me. \"Sorry about being late, by the way. I'd lost my glasses, again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it happen this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders fell. \"Me being their owner, that's what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...listen, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, that's life.\" She jammed her fingers into her pocket, pulling out her stud scanner. \"Scanner ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" I answered, pulling out my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>First, Dana picked me up and placed me on her feathered shoulder. Must be nice being nearly 7 times as big as a human and weighing several times as much as a Buick. Dana held out her ticket scanner and walked in to see several passengers already boarding Cabin Car #1 and getting ready to take their seats. \"Welcome to the Gaian Express,\" said Dana in her cheery sounding voice. \"Please make sure that you have the appropriate train tickets.\" From up on Dana's shoulder, I could see the titans riding in the train car and it made me realize how small I was. These anthros could easily swallow me whole and feel like they didn't swallow anything. The smallest anthro I knew was Melissa and even then she was nearly 7 feet tall. Being in such an environment reminded me how low I was on the food chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I was taking note of the passengers, I saw one in particular who was getting ready to take her seat. She was a 75' 2\" tapir woman with bright gold-colored skin and long red-hair worn in a ponytail with a freckled face. She was very obese with a prominent belly that made her skirt look like a tattoo and a large butt that looked like it was wide as she was tall and half her height to say nothing of her H-cup (in scale) breasts. From the looks of it, she had to be 27 and she was wearing a gray jacket with a red skirt and black shirt that only covered the lower halves of her breasts. I gasped because I recognized her immediately. Her name was Pepper Hongo and she was a travel critic when it came to hotels, trains, cruise ships and the like. A review from Hongo could lead to a jackpot or total ruin. She certainly gave off an intimidating aura as she stomped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that Pepper was closing in on me and Dana and it frightened me. I crawled up to Dana's... well, I'm not sure if birds have ears, but you get my point. \"Dana,\" I said as I pointed forward. \"Look.\" Dana saw Pepper taking notes on her iPad and squawked. \"Is that Pepper Hongo?\" asked my Roc friend in worry. I nodded my head. \"Oh yes,\" I said. \"And I think it would be a good idea to tend to her first.\" Dana nodded her head and tried to walk forward, but then squawked because her glasses fell off again. \"Oh no!\" I yelled. Dana squawked again because she tripped on her glasses and in the process she flapped one of her wings and knocked me into the air. Fortunately I landed on something soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dana could even notice I was gone, she bumped right into the airbag-like cleavage of Pepper Hongo. The tapir giantess bent over and picked up Dana's glasses for her. \"I believe you dropped these,\" the critic said. \"Are you alright.\" \"Yes,\" said Dana as she took the glasses. \"Th...\" Dana's beak dropped as she looked up at Pepper. \"G-Good day, Ms. Hongo,\" she said. \"Welcome to Gaian Express.\" \"Please,\" said the tapir woman. \"Call me Pepper. You said you needed to see my ticket.\" Dana smiled and took Pepper's ticket before she scanned it and handed it back to her. \"There you are, Ms. Hongo. Now, if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for me, Dana walked away from Pepper, forgetting to check for me. At this point, I realized that I was stuck somewhere on Pepper as the enormous tapir woman was walking towards her seat. I was stuck...</span></div></div>",

Pen scribbled against paper some few feet behind my head, giving me a few inches worth of a barrier from appearing in our next reviews for the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dana!\"</i> I whispered, praying that rocs had some kind of superpower hearing. <i>\"...Dana!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hopes were dashed from something across the room uprooting a table from the floor, followed by crashing glass and a frantic string of apologies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe writing went still, followed by a triumphant period being dotted in the pad, but the pad slid into her cleavage just behind me without any screaming coming after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she did nothing. <i>Nothing,</i> only dropping her hands down on the side of her gut and swiveling her suite around, leaning back and watching the dark blobs in the desert dash past the windows. All the while, I stretched my hands down as far along my body as I could and held my hand high, forcing myself to straighten out within the little sliver of space her work had given me. I saw everything outside, the starry sky and the desert fluctuate into the hills beyond the city's boundaries, but I didn't process them as fear took a hold of my veins, squeezing sweat from my pores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and by god, she just <i>sat</i> there. Not saying anything, not looking up stuff on her phone, not even twiddling her thumbs as she left me hanging around at ground zero, wondering what the hell I could do to escape with a long, healthy life still in reach. I didn't bother to look around for any clocks to check up on the time, but eventually, I could tell by the minutes being piled on my shoulders that it was somewhere over half an hour until she finally decided to move, grunting as she pushed up off her seat and stood tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shambled the entire length of the train to the other end, each step risking me being flashed into view by her breasts swaying side to side on her march towards...</span></div></div>",

It got harder to keep still and safe with her breasts rocking back and forth against either side of me, but Pepper stayed just as nonchalant as ever, whistling a content tune rather than give me a clue to where she was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when she passed the vestibule into the dining car that she stopped walking, taking a moment to observe the modern decor. A minimal army of lights hung from the ceiling, only keeping the room lit up by the tables against dark, hardwood walls on top of black carpeting, but the bar in the center acted as the nucleus of the carriage's illumination by the colorful bottles of alcohol shone from behind. Pepper's snout turned the way towards a blue \"vacant seating!\" hologram glowing above the empty waiter's desk, and she obeyed, walking through the standing tables to a seventy-scaled booth along the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as spaced apart as the table and its benches were, her stomach was still wedged into by the lip of the table as she slid into her seat, but a motor's whirring buzzed under her ass, massaging the lower half of my body as the chair and table adjusted to fit her size. She hummed, retrieving her tablet to type away a few impressed words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the world still again, I spun my head around at the few heads in the dining car. Aside from the nameless guests wandering about for a midnight meal, the only body I could recognize was the blue filled tank of Amy, but she was standing too far for me to wave her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, god, help me...please...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amy's head leaned back at a shadowed figure trudging her way. She beamed, but I was <i>well</i> more elated moments later when I recognized more of the brown, gray feathers covering her bulbous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Hi, Dana! What're you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy...listen, did Nathan just walk around here, by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't seen him. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we were just working ticket duty in the dome car, but...\"</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana's ashamed mumbling became too quiet for me to make out anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dana! Over here!\" </i>I whispered, but my despair driven theory was proven wrong, as she kept looking down around the ground with squinty eyes. I willed every nerve of my brain for her to move my way, to steer the path of her footsteps towards my end of the car as she zigzagged around the dining arrangements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a minute later that god decided to throw me a bone, and Dana noticed that Pepper was here, to her surprise. Now she made a full attempt to come towards our table, adjusting her glasses, but the clearing of her sight on the Tapir that she froze in place, eyes wide and frozen in terror on her bustline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs slow as I possibly could, I rose an arm, waggling my fingers her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes broke away from me and darted around, landing on a stack of menus on a food cart. She swiped one off the top, then fully stomped our way, forcing the biggest waiter smile I'd ever seen. \"Why, Miss Hongo, what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Pepper's eyes raised just a notch from her tablet. \"Weren't you working at the dome car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd actually just been transferred to waiter duty! Anything you'd like to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Pepper's head turned away from the tablet and to the menu that she took from Dana's hand, making me a safeguard along her breasts <i>thousands</i> of times better than the tablet. \"I think I'll start off with an orange serene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, now, if you'll just excuse me...\" Dana began flapping her wings and, despite some dozens of tons that should've made it impossible, rose up from the ground and hovered over the lip of the table, stretching a wing over to pinch at the corner of a framed painting on the wall. \"...that painting's a bit crooked, so you just...read the menu...and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the chins flowing from her neck coming closer and closer, Dana opened her beak as she maneuvered it towards the back of my shirt, only enough for her to weave the tip into the back of my collar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she stopped to take out her room key, I struggled as I could to try and squeeze out of her ginormous man-eating breasts. But try as I might, the golden orbs were like quicksand and I wasn't getting anywhere fast. The obese tapir giantess took out her key card and used it to unlock the door before waddling her massive self in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, I stopped trying to escape from Pepper's cleavage and took note of the living arrangements. Ms. Holmes sure didn't spare any expenses. The room had a Victorian-style bed in the corner that had a window view of the fast moving scenery and what appeared to be a crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a mahogany desk. If I didn't know we were on a train, I'd swear that this was a hotel room and the one you'd expect to be prepared for the Queen of Zaldin. Though, the paintings in the room looked somewhat gaudy, though I would never tell Ms. Holmes that, lest I wind up either at the unemployment office or in a cow's four stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, I heard a squeaking noise and looked up to see that Pepper had sat down on the bed and undid her ponytail, her blood red hair (which was probably how the goddess-sized tapir got her name) hung down and let out a pleasured sigh. \"So far,\" said the tapir giantess. \"Everything is in order. The train is moving at a stable speed and the service so far seems to be perfect. Of course, that clumsy roc conductor has me somewhat worried. But I'll cut her some slack. I <i>did</i> hear that Ms. Holmes wasn't picky about who she hired as long as they could do the job. Hiring the quirky says a lot about an anthro. Hmmm. I think I'll hit the pool car, next. See if that's in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper put down her notebook and the tapir woman gave a snort as she unbuttoned her jacket. While she was distracted, I saw this as a chance to try and escape her breasts. She pulled down her skirt and hummed to herself as I tried in vain to climb her flesh. It looked like things were going nowhere and I knew for sure that if she did go to the pool with me still stuck in her cleavage, I'd risk drowning on a tapir big enough to use a skyscraper as an easy chair. But then, fortune seemed to smile on me. Pepper's long red hair dangled in front of me and I saw a means to get free. Taking the hair in hand, I pulled and pulled and climbed the obese golden-tapir's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, fortune played a cruel trick on me because with each inch forward, I irritated Pepper and made her grunt. \"What the?\" asked the tapir. \"Ouch! Something is pulling my hair! Ooh! Ouch!\" Pepper then snorted angrily and jerked her head. I screamed as she twirled her hair and was tossed onto her long tapir snout. I tried to grab on as Pepper focused her eyes on me in surprise, but slipped and landed with a grunt in her palm. The next thing I knew, a blushing, SSBBW tapir girl with gold skin and long red hair was looking down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human!?\" yelled Pepper. \"A human <i>boy</i> in my boudoir!? What are you doing here?!\" Clearly she was mad and I gave a gulp. \"I don't mean any trouble. I'm a conductor here. My name is Nathan Beane. I fell off Dana's shoulder when she slipped and landed in your cleavage, Ms. Hongo.\" I was really worried and Pepper looked down at me sternly. She scratched her chins with her claws and snorted through her long snout right before she...</span></div></div>",

Sure she looked mean, and was large enough to crush me between her fingertips, but deep inside she was a really kind, understanding--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy train of thought was interrupted as she raised me above her head and opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'RE YOU DOING?! NO! STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped me in her mouth without a second thought. The enormous leviathan of her tongue began assaulting me immediately, slamming me against the inside of her cheeks. I struggled futilely as she sucked on me like a piece of candy. She gave an appreciative \"Mmmmmmmm\" as she tasted me. Apparently she enjoyed my flavor. I tried to reason with her but between the savage beating her tongue gave me and the tapir spit that I kept choking on, I only managed to cry out screams of terror and pain. After several minutes, Pepper had apparently gotten her fill. Her tongue flicked me to the back of her throat, and with a nonchalant gulp I was plummeting down her esophagus. It was like falling down a darkened elevator shaft. I screamed as I fell, only to eventually reach my final destination, landing in a fizzing pool of gastric juices and half melted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy captor let out a mighty belch and patted the flab of her stomach in celebration of her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human conductor.

She put on a sparkling, low-cut dinner dress. Ironically, despite being enraged at the pathetic little human for being stuck in her bust earlier, she evidently had no problem proudly displaying her copious cleavage for any other person to see. She spritzed some perfume behind her ears and applied some makeup before making her way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened it, however, the roc girl from earlier stood on the other side, poised to knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ms. Hongo!\" Dana said. \"I'm sorry, am I catching you at a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, dear,\" the colossal tapir said. \"I was just about to grab some dinner in your renowned dinning car, but I can wait a minute to talk. What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, this is very embarrassing,\" Dana said. \"But, um... Remember earlier when I fell into y-your... um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flickered down to Pepper's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Ms. Hongo said slowly, not understanding where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, you see, there was another conductor working with me. A human in fact! His name is Nathan Beane. And... I just can't seem to find him! I've looked everywhere but the last time I saw him was when we... \"bumped\" into each other. You haven't seen him around have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human... conductor,\" Ms. Hongo said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Hongo stood perfectly still, keeping her face carefully neutral. The little human had doubled his struggling since hearing his friend's voice outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it,' Pepper thought. 'He was telling the truth. Ugh. This is so embarrassing. Now I'm going to have to throw him up and... ugh, I can't believe the little bastard saw me half-naked! He probably was trying to sneak a peak, he just hoped to use his station to get away with it.' Pepper knew that probably wasn't true, but it was easier to cling to a lie than admit an uncomfortable truth. 'I really should give him back... However... Well, he <i>is</i> already in my stomach. And I am late for dinner... and the little man works in a train populated by giants! Something like this was bound to happen to him eventually. It's not my fault! Would it really be so bad to keep him right where he is? And then I can be on my way and grab some real food.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper pondered her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Hongo,\" Dana repeated, \"have you seen Nathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Pepper said,</span></div></div>",

She rubbed the back of her neck, but froze when she felt how sweaty it was becoming. \"Just\u2026just step outside a few, and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hongo, are you alright?\" Dana asked, looking back at her with both confusion and worry. \"You're looking a bit sweaty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper wiped her brow, only to knock her glasses off of her snout, sending them rolling down along her breast to plummet onto the floor, breaking one of the lenses. To add another gun to the several that were already pressed against her head, she could feel Nathan's despair reach the point where his beating against her stomach's wall would punch a visible bump along the outside near Dana's line of sight, and way to far for her to reach and shut him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need me to call somebody, Miss Hongo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-I just\u2026let me\u2026\" She crushed her stomach down along the carpet as she leaned over to try and reach her glasses, but like Dana herself, it took a deal of squinting to make them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hongo?\" Dana said one more time, stepping in front of her. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Alright, fine!!! I ate him!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all their flabbiness, Pepper's arms showed off a fair deal of muscle as she thrust them out and punched the both of them into her belly with all their strength, the sudden shrinkage of her stomach forced out a loud, air-shaking belch filled with a blimp's worth of gas (with a tiny trickle slipping its way out the other end.) Beneath the hill of blubber swaddled around her neck, a lump traveled up her throat that puffed up in her cheeks, and she spat it straight into her hand in a large glob of spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana looked shocked by Pepper's revelation, but was all the more horrified when she offered her palm out with Nathan laid on top, slimy, battered, and in desperate need of a shower, but very much alive. As his eyes shot back open, he took a long, gasping breath of the outside world's air that came running back out in a horrified yell, and Dana quickly cupped her hands beneath Pepper's fingers as he scrambled away and fell off, only to safely land in his friend's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Nathan,<i> I'm so sorry!</i>\" Dana wailed, immediately on the verge of tears. \"T-This is all my fault! Are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing was still shaky, but he'd settled down enough to see the fact that he was now safe with Dana, giving a clumsy nod.</span></div></div>",

If you think I'm just going to let some speck of a human get away with embarrassing me in this way, you've got another thing coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven cupped in Dana's hands and covered in tapir drool, I sputtered in outrage. \"You're embarrassed?! You ate me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy anger turned to fear as Ms. Hongo loomed her blushing, outraged face just inches from his tiny form. Those few brief moments where I forget how miniscule I am compared to everyone around me, are always brought back to painful reality very quickly. Particularly when one of the anthro gods sharing this planet was upset with me, and judging from Ms. Hongo's demeanor, she was apoplectic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you embarrassed me!\" she hissed, the force of her voice blowing me down onto my behind. \"I come to the famed Gaian Express, expecting the utmost courtesy afforded all guests, and what happens instead? A roc falls into my chest and drops her human pet into my cleavage so he can sneak a peak! Then, once I rightfully devour him in compensation, that same roc forces me to regurgitate him against my will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Dana shrieked, clearly as confused as I was. \"I never made you--you threw him up on your own! I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now look!\" Ms. Hongo continued, leaving the world of reason behind. \"You make me break my favorite pair of glasses, late for my dinner reservation, and look now, even one of the straps on my new dress has broken! I bet you did this all on purpose, that's right, I know how humans devious minds work. You planned on embarrassing me so I'd be pressured to write you a favorable review! Well I have news for you, no one gets the better of Pepper Hongo! We're marching down to your boss's office, right now! ... As soon as I get my other glasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Hongo scurried away to the bathroom. Dana and I dared not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's crazy,\" Dana whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell she is,\" I muttered. \"She just knows she's in the wrong and doesn't want to accept it! She's blaming us for everything so she doesn't have to admit she screwed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana bit her lower lip, or lower beak rather. \"What are we going to do, Nate? Ms. Hongo is one of the most famous and trusted critics out there! If she writes us a lousy review, it could really screw us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grimaced. \"We'll just humor her. Hopefully the boss will be able to smooth everything out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, after Ms. Hongo had found a pink rimmed pair of glasses that made her look like a librarian as a replacement pair, Dana and I were standing nervously outside the boss's office. There were raised voices coming from inside. Ms. Hongo had barely let the other woman get a word in edgewise. I just hoped that Dana and I wouldn't be punished for all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two women finally emerged, Ms. Hongo had a smug smile on her face.

She genuinely cared about the people working under her, even little guys like me. I had no doubt at all that she tried to defend me as best she could from Ms. Holmes. Maybe if it had just been another spoiled passenger she could've succeeded, but against a famous critic? No way Ms. Holmes would let a little thing like my safety jeopardize her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Dana offered the hand I was in. I didn't object. I knew it wouldn't get me anywhere. Ms. Hongo plucked me from Dana's feathery palm between two fingers and brought me before her face. I could see the arrogant gleam in her eyes, and she chuckled under her breath. With her other hand she opened her purse and carelessly dropped me in. I landed amongst make-up, loose change and breath mints, which, I knew from my earlier experiences inside her mouth, she desperately needed. She clamped the opening shut, leaving me in total darkness. Though trapped inside I could still hear them outside clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ladies, for your help,\" Ms. Hongo said. \"I hope we can now put this unpleasantness aside and start over. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to partake in the some of the luxuries of this fine location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic tapir waddled off, me bouncing roughly on the inside her purse. I felt like I was going to be ill, from fear as much as from motion sickness, but I fought the urge to throw up. Barfing inside her purse probably wouldn't have boded well for my future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Ms. Hongo go first?</span></div></div>",

I have a <i>gut</i> feeling about it,\" she said and let out a laugh, amused at her own wordplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana didn't get what was so funny but--remembering how important Pepper's review was to the Gaian Express--she laughed along anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Ms. Hongo said, getting back to business, \"if you don't mind, I'll be going now. I have reservations in your world renown dining car and I'm just dying to see what other food this train has to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't keep you then,\" Dana said. \"I guess I should retrace my steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea... so long as you don't faceplant into the girls again,\" Pepper said, flicking her eyes down to her bust and then winking. This time Dana did get the joke and laughed along before heading back to the dome cars. \"Such a nice, girl... You're lucky to have a friend like that,\" she said to her stomach, once Dana was out of earshot. She could feel the panicked struggles of her miniscule morsel still going strong. They'd doubled from the instant she'd answered the door. \"I suppose I should apologize for this... but, if I'm being honest, I'm not sorry. You brought this on yourself. If you were going to make a living in such a dangerous line of work, you should've been prepared for such an outcome. If nothing else, you should've held on tighter to your friend rather than taking a dive in my cleavage. Honestly, how were you expecting me to react to a bite size pervert?\" Pepper knew whatever answer her meal gave wasn't a happy one. But it amused her all the same that he kept trying, even with all her tons of flab obscuring the squeaks of his voice. \"Hush now, my little appetizer. Time for the main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in her stomach, I was sent tumbling off my makeshift, banana slice raft as Ms. Hongo began waddling over to the dining cart. I fell into the stomach acids, choking on the bile, and quickly pulled myself out onto a nearby buffalo wing. I couldn't believe this was happening to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd spent her entire conversation with Dana busy screaming at the top of my lungs, hoping against hope that my friend would hear me. I'd been so elated when I heard Dana was looking for me. I thought that, once she confirmed my story and Ms. Hongo knew I was telling the truth, surely the tapir would let me go and we could put the whole unfortunate incident behind us. All these hopes were dashed the second I heard Ms. Hongo lie that she'd never seen me. Hell, she hadn't just lied about it, she'd joked about it right to my clueless friend's face! She thought it was funny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stood on my half-chewed life preserver, all my worst fears about working alongside titanic anthros came rushing back. Nightmares about melting away in the stomach of a cruel giant that had sent me screaming awake more than once now became--not just my reality, but my destiny. I was doomed to be nothing but the slightest morsel of food in the belly of a vengeful critic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Hongo reached the dining car without incident and was shown to her table with all the courtesy a renowned critic such as her expected. Apparently the waiting staff had been preparing for her visit, just as convinced as Dana was about the importance of a good review from her. They brought out their best bottle of wine, compliments of the house, and Ms. Hongo sipped at it as she perused the menu. Unfortunately for me, I was directly underneath the stream of liquid that rained down on me, leaving me spluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exquisite! And it pairs so well with human meat,\" Ms. Hongo said, giving a giggle at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there any hope for Nathan's survival?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We decided to check out the first of the cabin cars. I walked on ahead as Dana walked behind me. Probably not my smartest idea because between trying to stand up from Dana's enormous footsteps shaking the ground and barely avoiding being flattened under the roc giantess's enormous talons, I was having a hard time getting any further. \"Careful where you step, Dana,\" I said to my gigantic roc partner. \"I don't want to.. whoa!\" Dana let out a scream and slipped slightly and as she was stopping herself, she accidentally kicked me forward with her large bird feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, I landed on something soft. Something soft and scaly. I looked down and I landed on a chubby and scaly foot that was bright turquoise with what looked like green diamond-shaped marks. I looked forward and saw what looked like a serpent's tail that ended in a rattle. There I looked up and gasped. I had landed on the foot of a 90ft tall rattlesnake woman. She was morbidly obese with a large stomach and backside and breasts so big that her black tank top only covered the top of them. She had long black hair and a long chubby neck with several chins. Despite being a snake, she had rather wide arms and legs that ended in clawed fingernails and toes. She wore a pair of blue jeans and a green jacket as she flickered out her forked tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could saw anything, Dana walked up to the snake woman. \"Welcome to the Gaian Express, ma'am,\" said the ginormous roc. \"May I please have your ticket.\" The snake woman smiled and flickered her tongue as she handed Dana her ticket to scan. \"Dana!\" I yelled. \"Down here!\" But Dana was too busy dealing with the passenger to pay any attention to any humans.\" As Dana took the rattlesnake woman's ticket, she scratched her chin. \"You know,\" she said. \"You look familiar. Have I seen you before.\" The snake woman flickered her tongue before speaking. \"Have you ever heard of the country of Ditan?\" \"Ditan?\" asked Dana. The snake woman nodded her head before lowering her neck to whisper into Dana's ear. \"Keep it under your hat,\" said the snake woman with a hiss. \"But I'm here to meet with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to hold on tight to the snake woman's toe as Dana hands her back her ticket and the rattlesnake giantess begins to walk away. That's when I realized that I recognized this snake woman. Her name was Desdemona and she was the queen of a foreign nation called Ditan. From what you heard the country was dropping its isolationist policy. But what was the queen of Ditan doing here on the Gaian Express? Heck, she didn't even look like a queen from the way she was dressed. Then again, there might be people who might do her harm, so it would make sense why a gigantic obese rattlesnake queen would go as incognito as a Godzilla-sized fatty could. Then something occurred to me. It was unknown what anthro giants from Ditan think of tiny humans. Exactly what was I in for if the queen spotted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I was thinking it over, Desdemona stopped in her tracks. I then felt something grab me and looked up to see two large claws at the ends of two fingers that were the size of buses. I let out a yell as I was pulled up in front of Desdemona's face. The rattlesnake queen lowered her neck before looking at me in awe. I gave a nervous look before uttering \"Your majesty.\" Desdemona gave a hiss before she gave a lustful smile. I didn't know whether to be relieved or worried. \"Well, well, well,\" said the royal rattlesnake giantess. \"Hello there. I wasn't expecting to see any humans on the train. What a cute little creature you are.\" I was sweating. When a giant anthro called a human \"cute\" it wasn't normally a good sign. \"What were you doing on my toes.\" I bit my lip and I was about to explain but then Desdemona gave a hiss. \"Oh, I think I know a better place for a cutie like you than on my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could protest, Desdemona placed me...</span></div></div>",

She stared our way for only a few seconds, only making enough eye contact to ensure we'd scan her card key as she handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attitude only made her reaction all the more hard to laugh over as Dana took off her hat, bringing the card key near her hair so I could scan it, instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how adorable!\" The peacock chortled, holding a wing over her beak to keep from having a full laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your stay, Ma'am!\" Dana said heartedly, handing back her ticket. I cast out a dramatic salute as the hat came back down, and the peacock gave a more complete chuckle, her smile lingering as she went back to her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, go down my sleeve, this time!\" Dana whispered, opening up her collar by a button. I crawled down under her shirt and worked my way down through her sleeve, and the cloth of her uniform held down me like tight cling wrap against the warm dense padding of muscle and adipose beneath her coat of feathers, holding me in place as I poked my head out from between her wrist and the suit's cuff. \"There's somebody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana's sights were turned towards somebody sitting a few rows ahead. From the head up, their fur's color seemed pretty normal; brown fur beneath a head of wavy black hair, but the jackal lady's ample form was concealed by a flowing robe sewn from a mess of vibrant colors, their shapes winding together into some exotic, yet hypnotically fluent design that flowed nicely down along her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" Dana asked, holding out my sleeve as she came up from behind. \"May I see your ticket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal lady turned her head back, looked disinterested by Dana's presence, then looked down at her stud scanner, and took her key card out from her breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held it under Dana's scanner, but I popped out into view, whipping out mine to do the task instead. \"Thanks for coming, Miss. I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but right then, Me, Dana, everybody in the car, and everybody in the cars next door leapt back as the jackal let out an earsplitting screech. One moment, Dana was standing up, and the next, the world was thrown into a blur for a split second before I felt her arm slam down onto the floor, with me only a few too many feet to the side from getting crushed by its weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my arms shaking, I pulled myself out, legs too weak to hold me up as I stumbled onto the rug. Dana's head was kept out of view by her stomach pointing high up into the air, legs hanging up in some kind of stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW <b><i>DARE </i></b>YOU?!\" Came the jackal's voice in full volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing my arms on my legs, I looked up as she stood at full height, teeth bearing as her muzzle rumbled with a long, steady growl. I held my hands up. \"Miss, I'm incredibly sorry, I meant not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW <b><i>DARE</i></b> YOU APPROACH ME WITH THAT KIND OF INDECENCY!!!\" She snarled again, pointing a claw down at me. \"NEVER, NOT EVEN ON THE <b><i>STREETS</i></b> WOULD I EXPECT TO BE TREATED WITH SUCH INEPTITUDE AS THIS, BUT FOR IT TO BE HERE, BY A <i><b>HUMAN</b></i>, OF ALL THINGS...!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dana rolled rolled forward, the velocity of her stomach nearly toppling her forward as her talons dug back into the carpet. \"Miss, listen, this was all my idea! If you'll just hear me out, I swear tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>YOU WILL BE SILENT!!!</b></i>\" She screeched at Dana, who promptly obeyed with a squeak. She then leered back my way. \"...AND YOU!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her other arm out, and I covered my head with both hands, but only out of reflex. Instead of come down to either roll on me or rip me to shreds, she stood straight and still with her fingers open and tense, her face existing somewhere between glaring at me and channeling some inner sense of deep concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Nowth'I sthes toryal'la!!!</b></i>\" She spoke in a more quiet, but still booming volume. \"<i><b>Bou thowm'y lifego, tfl'ipp edt'urne dupsi!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dana?\" I said wearily, looking back to see her watch us both with an uneasy face. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Dedow nandi d-li ketota!</b></i>\" She continued. \"<i><b>Keami nutejus t-si'trig h'the reillt! ELLY'O UHOW IB'ECA METH EP'R INC-EOF ATO WN'CAL LED-BE LA'IR!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and at that last tangent, she ceased to speak, or even move, arms still cast out with her eyes twitching after her sudden burst of energy. I kept staring at her eyes as they hung frozen in vengeance for a few moments, then steered my head away back towards Dana, whose feathers were all fluffed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal's paw moved aside, and she walked the other way down the aisle, not saying anything. Instead, she looked back at us, her mouth flashing us one of her canines as she gave us a confident smirk.</span></div></div>",

From the waist up, she was a complete twig, intact, but everything below the belt was hurried beneath an imposing cliff of ass that practically exploded out of her behind, each cheek reserved in its own chair like a pair of large, scaly gray boulders stuffed within her black pants, feet dressed in shoes that barely poked out from her overburdening cankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" She stroked a clawed hand through hair that was slicked back with grease, the other rubbing at her snout's chin as she closely read through a word document yet to be finished. \"I can never remember...is 'scandal' spelled with two a's, or one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" I rubbed at my right elbow. \"Excuse me, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard-woman turned her head and noticed us standing behind a short distance away, a friendly smile reaching across her muzzle. \"Anything I can do for you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we...\" I began numbly, wondering what to say first. \"We just heard you reading from your laptop there, and uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that?\" She pointed at her screen, frowning. \"I wasn't bothering you two with that, wasn't I? I'm sorry if I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all, uh...\" Dana leaned forward, trying to read through some of it. \"What's it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing pertaining to you two, if that's what your wondering.

Seven inches shorter than when I'd checked myself last month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hand down, roughly measuring me up. She didn't look too pleased. \"Looks like it. Eight or seven inches, is that close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not possible!

A little cold, in fact.\u201d Dana felt like her body just kept getting warmer and warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo hot.\u201d She panted.

I suddenly found myself looking a little higher at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Dana?\u201d She paid no mind, lost in the euphoric feeling. Her breasts seemed to surge out a size, then another, straining her already tight top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so much energy! I feel like I\u2019m about to explode from this feeling!\u201d Her pants button popped off as her thighs and butt expanded, her zipper heading down as she continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDana!\u201d I called. She seemed to surge in height again, her outfit complaining all the white. Her pants rose up, busting several seams on the side. Her shirt followed suit, exposing more of her massive stomach as she grew up and out. Her bra became apparent against her shirt, just as her panties exposed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can\u2019t shake this feeling! Nor do I want to! I feel so good!\u201d Her tongue poked out cutely, even as she continued swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDANA!\u201d I yelled. She looked down at me for a moment, before a large ripping sound came from her. Her shoulders ripped through her shirt, exposing her extremely tight bra straps. At the same time, her talons broke through her shoes, ending their life cycle. The crotch of her pants seemed ready to blow, as did she, if the pulsing in her panties was any indication. She must\u2019ve grown at least three feet by now, at least 4 macro cup sizes, and several sizes in her rear. Her hefty belly seemed to remain proportional, but that only meant she was heavier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nathan.\u201d She managed to spit out. \u201cI-I, I</span></div></div>",

Still, arguing the \"fairness\" of this punishment wouldn't get him anywhere. Not with a crazy person. Nathan decided to swallow his pride and try to apologize again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" he squeaked. \"I'm sorry. I should never have... wronged you,\" he said awkwardly. \"You are my better in every conceivable way and I should treat you with the utmost respect. Please, I beg of you, give me a chance to earn your forgiveness. I will do anything to make it up to you Miss... uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. He didn't know her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anubis... Jacqueline Anubis,\" she said. Jackal. \"Jacquel\"ine. Oh, ha-freaking-ha. \"I let my friends call me Jackie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say we were friends, worm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean--Miss Anubis,\" Nathan said. \"Like I said, I am truly, deeply, utterly, completely, impossibly, eternally sorry for any offense I caused you. Will you please, please, <i>please</i> take this curse off me?\" Nathan tried his most winning smile to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance in hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. Death is the only fitting punishment for your transgression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what transgression you're talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Even now you're ignorant of the depths of your offense. The fact that you even have to ask only proves how much you deserve this fate. You will finally learn your place--the place of all humans--once you're devoured by one of your so-called friends. Hopefully your fate will serve as a reminder of what happens when the staff here try to integrate pathetic little worms like yourself among their ranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing there was no reasoning with her, Nathan decided to at least vent his rage. \"You psychotic, evil bitch! You monster! I didn't do a damn thing to you, you bigoted, rabid dog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline Anubis paid him no mind. She clutched him in a paw and stomped off down the train carts. Where she was going, Nathan had no idea, but he knew it wasn't anywhere good. He couldn't see anything in the darkness but as Jacqueline kept walking, he could hear excited voices outside, sniffing the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" \"It smells positively heavenly.\" \"Is someone baking cookies?\" \"Are you crazy? It doesn't smell like cookies. It smells like the most exquisite steak.\" \"God I'm so hungry. I need to eat now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan gulped in the darkness of the paw and heaved a sigh of relief as the voices went out of range. Unfortunately, his relief was short-lived. Jacqueline opened her paw and he blinked, eyes adjusting to the light. Nathan recognized where they were and he gulped. He was right outside the dining cart. Jacqueline was standing over a dining cart lined with several, silver domed dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No escape this time, worm. Your next stop with the inside of one of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want me eaten so badly, why don't you just do it yourself?!\" Nathan demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the lesson isn't just for you about your proper place. It's a lesson to your friends as well. Humans are at the bottom of the food chain and it's high time they all admitted it. When they realize not even their \"friendship\" can stop them from indulging in their hunger, maybe they'll finally wake up and stop treating insects like you as equals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not their choice! You're making them feel this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making them feel it? Yes. Forcing them to act on their instincts? No. That's their choice. Don't blame me that their hunger is more important to them than your life. I was amazed how quickly that roc succumbed. I barely had to do a thing. Think about that as you await your fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Jacqueline lifted up one of the silver dishes, casually tossed Nathan inside and closed it, sealing him in darkness. Inside the dish was slimy and gooey. Nathan didn't spend a moment trying to figure out what food he'd been put into though. As soon as Jacqueline's thunderous footsteps faded away, he was at the edge of the dish, desperately trying to pry it open so he could escape. But it was no use. He couldn't budge it an inch, and soon he heard a new voice outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll deliver these orders now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart was pushed into the dining car, and Nathan tumbled at the sudden movement, getting a fresh coating of whatever dish he was in all over him. It was no use. He just had to pray that Jacqueline was wrong. That whoever his dish belonged to valued him as a person more than they did as an easy meal. Nathan said his prayers as the dish containing him was taken off the cart and put on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan recognized the familiar voice even before the cover was pulled off the dish, putting him face-to-face with...</span></div></div>",

The middle section of the steps went down to the car's lower level, where the bakery and brewery all lay, and the ones at either side went into the main dining area where the kitchen sat right in the center in its own separate hut, with waiters busily going in and out whilst holding round trays with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I searched for whatever my duty was, none of the other workers seemed particularly interested that I was around.

Before she could take too many steps with them in her grasp, I hurriedly ran to her side and fed my hands into the handles, just as she was starting to lose her grip. \"Here, let me help you with those, Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>thank</i> you, dear!\" She sighed with bliss, her back filled with great relief as she let them go, but she still didn't rise above her shoulders.

Along the way, a few other travellers recognzed Coletta, and she was happy enough to sign some autographs (apparently even the rich and famous get star struck sometimes). As I showed her the pool car, we were talking about her acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard you're a good actress, and you have some dramatic roles, so why do you take roles in smaller films? 'Attack of the Killer DVD's', 'Captain Midnight Man', 'Sorority Slaughterhouse'. Kind of low key, isn't it?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColetta chuckled. \"Yeah, acting was my dream. And my first few roles were dramatic. But they weren't fun. Stifiling make-up, boring scripts, bland co-stars, and overly long shoots. I was so bored. But action movies? Dumb slasher flicks? Campy B-Films? That's where the real fun is. In those, you can cut loose, overact to your hearts content, and you get co-stars who are much more interesting.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But most of those films failed commercially.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commercially, yes. And most reviews are mixed. But that's not important to me. I just wanted to act, not make money. Though being rich enough to go to Gaia 2.0 is a nice bonus.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Some friends of mine saw a film of yours. 'Insects of Joy', I think it was.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Coletta frowned. \"Oh, that film. It was alright, but Jamie was a NIGHTMARE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew who she was talking about. Jamie Billet. American actress currently preparing for a role as the glutonnous Queen Edith II. She was overly demanding, short tempered, a major diva, and insisted everyone treat like the queen. She was working to put on 30+ feet of weight by the time we get to Gaia.<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She insisted everything be done HER way.\" Coletta said. \"Always demanding reshoots if she didn't look perfect. Getting co-stars replaced if she didn't like them. Turned the director into her whipping boy. Even insulted my acting, saying I was just a bimbo using her tits to get roles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comment did draw my eyes to her breasts, but I could understand why she was pissed.

She'd been amazed by the dining car's menu, was floored as we walked around the pool car's underwater tunnels, and <i>marveled</i> at the stars passing by over the dome car's glass vista, but none of that could've set her up to set foot on a leafy bricklaid path paved through a dense forest of pine, the trees' branches rustling as the wheels rattled along the tracks. All the trees were shrouded by black, but enough of the road ahead was lit by a line of streetlamps whose bulbs were weathered into a dull orange to see the way, and the scene was tied up from above by a windowed ceiling that gave way for a vast night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth choked out some loose sputters when it wasn't hanging agape, fur bristling as she kept walking and met the fresh dampness of the air in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but it...it...it just...but...this <i>can't</i> be real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can, <i>is</i>, and stays open 24/7 for every week, every year, and every state!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it's just...it's all so <i>amazing!</i>\" She swooned, so much that the weight of her breasts nearly sent her and the trolley toppling over as she swung around to take it all in. \"...and this <i>isn't</i> the last car on the train?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as far as the tour's concerned, it is.\" I shrugged, trying not to show a cringe at the thought of the observatory. <i>Her </i>car. \"Come on, you haven't even seen the hedge maze yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continued our walk towards the rear of the train, the amazement on her face somehow still managed to grow, even if we'd barely covered a quarter of the coach's length. I had to slow down a decent amount to let her sightseeing keep up with me, but there was still something cute about her stopping every few seconds to gawk at every new tree, bench, light post, sign, or even newspaper stands that'd we pass by on the trail, almost making her completely forget the bordering half a ton of boobage that hung from her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed particularly thrilled, however, when we'd covered enough of the path to hear the gush of a flowing stream just ahead. As we rounded a corner filled with bushel, the source appeared in an instant, and she actually let out a tiny gasp and came to a stop as I took us in front of a wooden covered bridge traveling over a flowing river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to take her hand to keep us going. The wheels of her trolley rattled as it rolled along the floorboards and jittered up her breasts, which snapped her out with a delighted giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way to see the observatory at all?\" She asked, her head constantly turning about to take in the views of either ledge. \"Not another tour, or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's still a fair deal of pictures on the brochures, but there's also a few channels on our TV station that explore the car's features, and every hour or so there's a special where-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was right then, just when my foot was about to step out of the bridge when I froze. I came to an absolute halt, my smile instantly seizing up with surprise, followed by fear, and followed by pure dread as I heard something mutter about somewhere  around the fork in the road before us, and a dusty gong in my head was rung. The sound wasn't close, but was loud enough for us to hear the dull, heavy dragging sound scraping itself along the brick path, and sitting somewhere on top of it was a strong, yet snippy voice that sputtered about with a buzzy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan?\" Coletta knelt in, looking pretty concerned. \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go.\" I said flatly. Without a word, I took her hand to walk us back down the bridge, only to feel how heavy 877 pounds were to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go? Nathan, what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Coletta, things'll be a <i>lot </i>more pleasant if we get out of here and come another ti-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>\"...and ssuch pathetic possture in the face of royalty, too! Why, I ought to-\"</i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Coletta's arm seize up, too, as the other passenger's voice walked out into the open, only to fall silent as well. At first, all that stood in the circle of light from the street lamp was a stomach, one engorged into a titanic mass stuffed in an armor of shiny skin that smoothed its bulk out into an immense black globe, but the rough skin still jiggled softly under the coach's rocking. We stared back as its owner eyed us from the shadows, not moving for some time until she moved a grossly bulging leg forward and dragged her gut along the path, taking a few long steps before we could see a massively cushiony pair of breasts come into view that were decked up in some majestic robe made out of red cloth that hung along a lengthy pair of shoulders as it clung around her ridiculous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the twinkle on her crown just a second before it came out for us to see, sitting on a vast body of black hair for a smooth, noseless face whose pincers were nestled within a boa of flab that her neck was drowned within, with large red eyes that stared us down with a royal scoff that was trying to hold down surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of us spoke for several seconds of pure torture, taking one another in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you.\" Coletta whispered. I felt a chill from a soft growl that rumbled under her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie's face was still the cold demure of a queen, one of a tyrant looking over two unruly subjects, but I could sense a few shakes in her resolve as she fought to hold something inside. Something she was fighting to the death to keep from leaping out in some blind rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From my vantage point, I also saw that her toenails were painted bright copper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up in fear as I recognized this hippopotamus woman. Her name was Peony and she was a professional wrestler who fought in the pinnacle of the heavyweight championship of the world. There was a rumor that she had never lost a fight in her life. She gave a snort as she looked down on me. I didn't know what to expect from this big lady. \"Well,\" you think. \"At least it doesn't look like she needs me.\" However, then, the enormous hippopotamus amazon does something that surprises you. She smiles sweetly at you and then bends over her knees, touching the ground with her large stomach as she takes a closer look. \"Wow,\" she says in a very high-pitched voice that I'd never expect from an anthro as big as her. \"I don't think I've ever seen a human as cute as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes popped out. \"Did she just call me, cute?\" Perhaps she meant in terms of a pet. That's the only context that giants like her would use when calling dwarves like me cute. Peony then got on her knees and held her enormous face in front of me and gave a smile. I think it was supposed to be a sweet smile, but her teeth were really huge and sharp. They were as big as trees. I was afraid she was going to eat me. But then, Peony closed her mouth and giggled. \"I can handle my luggage on my own, thank you very much. But I'd appreciate it if you took me to my room on this train, Mr...\" I cleared my throat as the giant woman stood up. \"Uh. Nathan. Nathan Beane. Ms. Peony.\" Peony let out a giggle like a schoolgirl. \"Nathan,\" she says. \"Sounds fierce. I like that in a human.\" I gave a nervous smile as I walked ahead to lead Peony to her room. I made sure to stay as far enough ahead of her so she wouldn't step on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all the while, she was staring at me. I took a closer look and I realized she was looking with lovestruck eyes. Then I remembered something about Peony. She was 29 and it was really stressing her out because she was still single. Apparently, just because she was a wrestler, didn't mean she was lucky in love. Rumor has it that she had a thing for human men, mainly because Peony was only attracted to males who were <i>much</i> smaller than she was. That didn't do me again good. But I tried to forget about it and focus on my job when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I gave a grunt because Peony fat fingers had lowered down and grabbed me by the back of my shirt and lifted me up into the air. I looked forward and saw the hippopotamus wrestling diva's enormous face in front of me again. She placed me on her giant snout and I saw both of her bright blue, moon-sized eyes looking down on me. The huge hippo lady gave a giggle. \"You can just direct me to my room, little guy,\" says Peony. \"It's too much for such an adorable little human to trudge. Besides, I wouldn't want to step on and crush a cutie like you.\" I didn't know how to react. She was being nice, but for some reason, it felt rather creepy. \"Uh,\" I said. \"Okay, Ms. Peony. Right this way.\" I pointed my finger in the direction of Peony's room and Peony stomped in the direction, her huge body shaking with every step. I had to admit, Peony was rather beautiful looking... for a hippopotamus as big as a skyscraper. She was even larger than the likes of Rachel, Eva and Dana. She was probably even bigger than Ms. Holmes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprised me at how such an enormous lady was actually very friendly, especially since she was an animal known for being surprisingly territorial and dangerous. I directed Peony to the biggest room in cable car No. 6 and then she lowered me to the knob so I could unlock the door for her. Of course, she had trouble squeezing in. Sure, the door way made for somebody as tall as Peony but Peony's butt was just too wide and she had to shake and grunt in order to squeeze her huge body inside. \"Oof.\" Peony then let out a sigh and slapped her own mountainside back. \"It's a curse being this beautiful.\" Peony then giggles and tilts her snout. I let out a yell before I fall down into the palm of her huge, fleshy hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeony then looked down at me and giggled again. \"Thanks, Nathy-Wathy,\" said the goddess-sized hippo. \"I <i>really</i> appreciate you leading me to my room.\" Before I could say \"You're welcome\", Peony brought me up to her mouth and I gasped. \"Wait!\" I yelled. \"Please don't eat me!\" I thought she was going to devour me, but instead, Peony puckered up her gigantic pink lips and pressed down on me. I gave a muffled scream as I was drenched with hippo saliva. Peony kissed me so hard that she accidentally sucked me into her mouth. I let out a grunt as I stood up on Peony's football field-sized tongue and gasped as I looked around at her enormous fangs and gums. The gum line alone was several times my height, to saw nothing of her massive tusks. For some reason, Peony's mouth seemed bigger inside than it did from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for me, Peony's mouth opened up and she extended her tongue into her hand for me to step out and onto her thumb. \"Sorry, my cute little Beany,\" said the hippo as she laughed and blushed. \"I guess I got a little too excited. I just really love humans.\" I just shivered in place. \"I-I really th-thought you were going to eat me.\" Peony gave a scoff. \"Not unless you want me to swallow you whole and alive. If you want, I'd be happy to oblige.\" I shook my hands. \"Uh, no. I'm not a big fan of being eaten.\" Peony puckered her lips again and then placed me down on the ground before shaking her hips. \"I really hope that I see more of you around the train, little guy.\" \"O-Okay,\" you say. \"I'll, I'll just be on my way.\" I made my way towards the door and just then...</span></div></div>",

I saw this movie twice in theaters, and even without 3D glasses, you can still feel the insane attention of detail the animators put into the final product, down to every individual strand of fur the animals have, and with the way it's shot, written, and rendered, you always feel like there's a world that'd been created outside of the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also give them credit for putting the buddy cop gimmick to good use. I was iffy about the film at first when I first found out it was going to be an crime action film, but the script actually takes advantage of it being a means to explore the customs and architecture of the city. It also handles the mystery element of the story well, doing a great job of using misdirection to keep us guessing the exact truths until the very end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, though, I felt like the movie's biggest falling point was the dialogue. The actors are all cast perfectly for their roles, and put on great performances with what they're given, but all the lines they're given constantly fall into the habit of spelling everything out or what they're trying to get across, rather than let everything express itself in a visual way, or make its themes much more subtle. The movie's take on prejudices in modern society is actually pretty complex and relevant, delving into the social boundaries that make it a really complex issue with no solve-all answer, but I still felt like there was a lack of subtlety that painted it the same way more animated films tried to tackle the concept of racism. <i>Especially</i> by the end, with the main reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not to say the movie completely fails in that effort. There's still enough motivations fleshed out to understand most of the characters' decisions, and we can see the effort they take to reconnect when they take things too far. Even if the movie tends to flow in the traditional Disney formula, it still makes up for a lot of relevance in the way it frames society and its issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, though, I thought Zootopia was worth both the money, and walking across a parking structure at midnight o leave the shopping mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give Zootopia 7.5 stars out of 10.</span></div></div>",

How much of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just section 2; we'd already done the rest. Gonna be there in ten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be there in ten. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speaker clicked off, and I opened a metal door built nearby on the same wall. I sidestepped to weave my way into a spiral staircase that swirled down underneath the floor of the carriage, trapping myself in total darkness once I shut the door behind. I tiptoed deeper through two stories of total black until my chest hit another door, behind this one a lit room painted all in white, save for a station on a segment of clear tubing whose ends curved into the wall. With a rubberized hiss, the vacuum of the tube was broken by the station's main panel opening automatically, leaving a line of red velvet seats inside out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly excited, I hurried over the stoop and settled into the pneumatic pod, buckling in at the front. With a press of the button under the visor, the doorframe briefly lit up with red before the flap came back down, fusing back into the car as the air pressure was sucked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully enclosed, the pod was utterly silent for several seconds until the vents of the pneumatic system came to life, growing in volume till the suction moved the pod forward through the curve, then accelerated into a full blast that rocketed me along the car's length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Ca-Chnk!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any trash, the garbage pail standing on the roof of the passage easily slid away, letting the moist warmth of the courtyard dribble into the narrow climb for the ground. With the glass roof being the main source of light for the park, the maze was only lit by a pathway along the ground of mellow orange lamps when I climbed over the last few rungs of the ladder, but I could still make out the rough ends for the long walls of pure bushel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hedge trimmer'd been set up on a bench right next right next to the secret door, complete with a set of safety goggles and gloves  hanging from the tip.

All the lengths of hedge that I'd spent the rest of the night scuttling along were now shaved into a nice, smooth finish, but I still had one last turn in the quadrant to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost there...and...</i> \"Done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mowing down the last triangle of rough hedge, I triumphantly shut off the trimmer, and relished in the <i>glorious</i> silence of the maze, and a lack of a constant buzzing in my arms. It only felt better when I looked down at my pocket, and punched out three minutes before six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and now it's mimosa time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up the hedge trimmer, clipping my goggles and gloves under my arm, but I'd only just turned around the corner when the beautiful silence was broken. It was the rustle of a branch, one way too erratic to be the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" I looked over my shoulder. Nobody was there, nobody to be seen, at least, but the sound came again, even louder, and joined by a thump on the ground from somewhere around the bend. The edges of the corner murmured from the footfalls stomping my way, and out of instinct my feet carried me behind the corner and out of sight, only enough that I could still peek over at whoever was snagging an early peek at the maze...</span></div></div>",

My heart tripped over a few beats, my breathing quickening up as my arms hugging the prickly bushel against my back, eyes boring straight into the other hedge wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the risk of rustling the branches, I didn't move, which probably got to be the dumber decision as they kept coming my way. With another few hops, whoever it was came closer; they were <i>big</i>, being large enough for their movements to murmur through the ground, but something about them also sounded more plush and fluffy than indomitably large, somehow more like how a ton of pillows would than a ton of bricks. With as light a touch as I could muster, I peeled myself away from the bushel, arms still stretched out as I bent forward and angled myself to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dumb luck that she wasn't already glancing my way as I spied over the corner again, my head ducked down so far down that I was a hair's width from falling over. It was outright <i>moronic</i> luck that her big ears hadn't twitched from my hushed breathing, too, but I was just relieved to see that Rachel didn't have that big, goofy smile that she had on her face whenever she was on the hunt, and instead was curiously looking over her surroundings as she hopped down along the path. She looked like she was aptly prepared to give a chase, though, as she bounced about in a pair of black gym shorts stretched like latex around her mammoth legs and a yellow A-shirt whose straps seemed nonexistent around the sheer meat of her arms and the wide tracts of fur visible along the roofs of her sprawling breasts, a lengthy pedestal supplied for them by a body-engulfingly large stomach that couldn't be contained by her jogging uniform. Its weight constantly threatened to send her toppling over, but there was also an airy fullness to it that made it seem like it was filled to the verge of bursting with helium, a fullness that spread through the rest of her body and smoothed out what would've been the folds or dimples of cellulite sagging off of her, all meshing together to transform her into the most spherical rabbit ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straightened back up and covered my eyes, but did so so gently that there wasn't an audible slap. I couldn't outrun her, as deceptively round as she was, but there wasn't a spot in sight to hide under without making any footsteps, either, and every second going by was one lost from the last few before I'd hear that deafening squeal of joy, the loud pitter-patter of her paws as she'd barrel my way, and the feeling of being scooped away in a fuzzy tsunami of adipose, then feel all the sensation in my body get blotted out by a crushing swarm of blubber that'd squeeze on me from every direction, with only a single tiny window provided by the valley of her cleavage left for me to breath through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I gonna </i>do? I thought with dread, having more trouble keeping still. All my worrying did was cost me valuable time to make more of a plan, and before I could make up my mind on an escape plan, she was already too near for me to have any options but the bare minimum...</span></div></div>",

If she even knows I'm some what in the area, she'll get excited and turn this cart up on its side to find me. 'Come on think Nate.' I shouted in my mind. 'I'll just have to wing it and make a run for it.' I peeked out from the bush to see if the coast is clear. To my surprise I didn't see Rachel any where, which was both relieving and terrifying. 'How did I lose someone that big!?' I screamed to myself. 'It doesn't matter right now, I see an exit and I'm going to take it.' I saw a crack in the door to the next cart, and I was going to book it on the count of three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     'Alright.. one... two... thre-' My train of thought was interrupted when I felt a sudden jerk on the back of my shirt, lifting me in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I appear to have caught the most A- DORABLE wittle human~\" Rachel cooed as she dangled the smaller person close to her face. A little TOO close. I didn't even hear her behind me, she just plucked me up. I was helplessly hanging as Rachel held my shirt, looking into her crystal like eyes, that just pierce right through my soul. I was afraid, terrified even. The one person I needed to avoid has me at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Uh... g- good morning Rachel.\" was all I could muster. \"OOOOOHH and it's polite, that's so cuuute~\" Without any hesitation she grabbed me with her other arm and starting to nuzzle me against her pudgy cheek. This went on for about a minute before she brought me to her face again. I was spitting and wiping off any shed fur on me. 'I'm starting to see why people told me to stay clear off her, she's a NUT!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"If you couldn't tell, I just love anything tiny animals. They're just so itsy and bitsy.\" Rachel said in a blubbly tone. \"But humans just take the cake. They're the most adorable things, even when they do nothing.\" Having said that she brought Nate in close for a hug. Rachel was loving this but was completely oblivious to Nate's struggles for air. He manages to get air when his head finds the crevice between her cleavage. Rachel took it as something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Aaaaw does the wittle human like mama's little girls~?\" She cooed, starting to talk to Nate like he was a pet or something. \"Y- you have the wrong idea, I was just trying to breathe!\" Nate stammered with a slight blush. 'And \"little\" is a very big understatement, literally.' He said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh my gosh, I can't take it anymore, you're so cute I could just gobble you up whole~\" \"Actually...\" she continued quietly. \"If I did that, then no one else can have you.\" 'And I'd have a cute human to keep all to myself.' She thought to herself. 'Plus I'm a little bit peckish right now.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah, I've had other anthros say that as well.\" Nate said in a nervous tone. \"But they were kidding about it.

The feed on the screen connected to her office gave a view of her seated partway in a pool of water that left her plentiful breasts partly submerged within the surface, the both of them wrapped up within the buttoned flaps to a gray business suit, and laid on top of an almost leviathanic mass of black that cast most of the water below in an almost void-like abyss of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion on her face was a breath of fresh sanity in the morning I'd been enduring. She incredulously stared back at us, seeing the fear on my face as it sat firmly wedged partway into her breasts, then sank her head into her fins' palms and began massaging her temples. <i>\"Miss Loomitt, that's in regard to <b>items.</b> You know, <b>meals and antiques,</b> or what not.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Natty here is sure a heaping plate of sweet, tender huggability, I know <i>that!</i>\" Rachel countered, pulling me up to nuzzle me against her cheek again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carmine kept her face hidden in her palms before pulling them away and interlocking her fingers, fighting tooth and nail to avoid showing any exasperation. <i>\"Miss, Nathan is a <b>human being</b>, as in staff that's contractually obligated to live and work under our stead as...</i>\" She bit her lip before continuing, glancing at me with a guilted look. <i>\"...company property.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I couldn't concentrate on being offended by that statement, as I was too busy feeling a glimmer of satisfaction tingle in my chest as Rachel looked back with a hurt look. \"You mean...I can't keep him?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, no. He can't leave the train, of course, but-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once she'd realized that last word'd crept out, Miss Carmine sputtered and, ever so briefly, broke out of her professional demure and partly covered her mouth with a balled fist, eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...buuuuut?\" Rachel said slyly. \"Was that a 'but?' I think I heard a big 'ole 'but' in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Carmine glanced at me with regret even worse than when she referred to me as property, then shut her eyes and gave a tired sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Should you wish, I can arrange for Nathan to be your personal conductor for your trip, and from then you can have him do or act on your desires within certai-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" Rachel squealed before any kind of fine print could be announced. \"YESYESYESYES! I'll take it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my head away as far as I could from Rachel and looked back at Miss Carmine, terrified. \"Miss Carmine, <i>please!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nathan, I promise that as soon as this is all over, I'll do all I can to make it worth your while!\" </i>She said earnestly, almost begging to me as she held her hands prayed together. <i>\"If it's a raise or a break, you have my <b>absolute word </b>that you'll reap from this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" I spat away at a another strand of fur stuck to my lip. \"How <i>long?</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Rachel was ecstatic over this. She was going to have her own personal human pet (to her) until the express stops at Gaia. Miss Carmine broke the silence by speaking up. \"<i>Miss Loomitt, Nate is still an employee through this trip. Any injury that comes onto him and basic necessities that he needs will be <b>YOUR</b> responsibility. If these can't be met, we'll be forced take back the offer and Nate will no longer be your personal conductor. Am I clear miss Loomitt?</i> \"Crystal.\" Rachel cheered back. <i>\"Good, and Nate... I swear I will make it worth your while 3 fold. One for everyday you service Miss Loomitt.\"</i> Miss Carmine said in a regrettable tone before cutting the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A second passed before Rachel started to jitter happily. \"Ooooo, this is gonna be great.\" Rachel squealed, holding Nate close to her fluffy cheek. Nate tried his best to blow the fur out of his mouth. \"Yeah.. I'm sure.\" He said sarcastically. \"Oh don't be like that. I will make those three days the best days of your life. We still have a bit of daylight left, let's make the most out of it wittle Nathan.\" She cooed back. Rachel held Nate close to her chest as they traveled into the next cart over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   On there way there Nate was practically suffocating in Rachels grasp. She held him so close to her to the point that he's being smooshed into her ample chest. He struggled to find air leading him to stick his head into her cleavage again. Rachel noticed and said something about. \"Getting a little intimate with my Ha-has there, but It's okay your loving Mistress will allow it for a cutie like you.\" She caressed the back of Nate's head like you would to a dog. They made it into the next cart, which was the passengers cart, where the travelers lounge around and do various indoor things like playing board games or go to their quarters for the night. Rachel loosens her hold on Nate, causing him to free himself from her hefty rack. He regains his composure after a gasp of fresh air and turns to his fluffy captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well Miss Rachel, let's get this over with, what do you wish to do with the rest of the day?\" Nate asked to Rachel. \"Oh my, there are <b>SO</b> many things I want to do with you, from cuddling you, you adorwable pwecios wittle munchkin.\" She cooed to Nate. \"To dressing you up in some outfits I have.\" Rachel giggled a bit a that last part. 'Why does this woman keep human sized clothes with her!? It's like she planned this out or something!' Nate thought to himself, hoping that he wouldn't have to strip for Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"<i>Weeeeelll</i>, we could...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nathan was too occupied with Rachel to realized that someone else was approaching from behind him. \"Oh looky what I found! A walking, talking waste of space!\" A pompous voice said behind Nate. He winced at the voice, knowing full well who it belonged to. Nate looked back behind him to see a rotund swan looming over him. \"It's nice to see you too Jade.\" He said sarcastically. \"Don't you start with me human... I could easily pulverize you under my rump if I wanted to.\" Jade said irritatingly. <i>And maybe the whole car if your fat ass gets any bigger.</i> Nate said under his breath. \"Hmm? Care to repeat that?\" Jade lurched forward. \"Why are you even here?\" Nate was quick to change the subject. He knew full well what a night under Jade would be like. A living, heavy hell. \"Hmmmm...\" Jade hummed in suspicion. \"I was going on a walk to the dining car. A lady must always watch out for her figure. Not that a simpleton like you would understand.\" She kneaded her heaving belly after that remark. \"As a matter of fact I don't.\" Nate snapped back. Talking with any of the Rhodes' was always a terrible experience for Nate. The real bad part is that, to his knowledge, they hate humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Typical.\" The pompous swan snorted. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have a meal to enjoy.\" Jade said before trotting a few steps forward. Nate turns back around to look out for Rachel. \"Yeah, enjoy the food. Fatass!\" Nate immediately covered his mouth after letting that slip out of his mouth. He turns back around to see if Jade heard that little remark of his. To his misfortune, she was standing right in front of him, lurched forward and face fuming with anger. \"Wrong move...\" she growled before grabbing Nate by the torso and lifted him up. \"I think brainless humans like you need to be taught a lesson.... a personal lesson.\" Jade stormed off with you in her arms. You were powerless to do anything in her grip. Jade may be fat but she is clearly strong. Nate at this point was considering Rachel over Jade. Jade was more than happy to show Nate what happens to human if they mess with her as she made her way to the Observatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was quite extravagant, nothing less for the finest of the fine. Nate felt uncomfortable with how the servants are being treated. Some were tasked with carrying impossibly heavy objects, most likely impractical luggage. Others however were tasked with wearing very embarrassing uniforms while they worked. His heart sunk however when Jade was approaching a door with a \"Rhodes\" plaque on it. That room was obviously where Jade and her mother stayed. Jade reaches into her cleavage to what looked like fishing for her key. She stops for a moment before looking at Nate, sneering at him. She lifted him up by the legs and dangled him above her rack. \"Make yourself useful and get my keys.\" Before Nate could protest Jade dropped Nate. He plummeted down inbetween her boobs, his legs left hanging out. Nate's point of view was full of feathered breasts. He could hear Jade giggling above him. Nate spent a few minutes looking for the key or whatever lets Jade and Sapphire into their room. To his dismay it's no where to be found. \"I can't find it! Are you sure you put it down here?\" Nate asked. Jade just chuckled before replying. \"Oh it's down there somewhere, maybe you need to look... \" she place both hands on the bottom of his feet. \"DEEPER!\" She said before shoving Nate further down. The jolt surprised Nate as he was now face first in the fat swan's belly. \"Ahhhh..\" Jade moaned before retrieving her actual key from her back pocket. Where Nate is, it leaves a human shaped lump outside of her shirt, practically making it look like she ate him. She unlocked the door and walks into her room. Nate felt movement as the sudden realization of what happened hit him. A muffled \"<b>HEY!</b> came from under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire was at the kitchen table enjoying a nice hearty lunch. She was taken aghast when she saw Nate's imprint on Jade. \"Oh my goodness Jade! Did you abandon your vegetarian ways!?\" \"Oh heavens no! I wouldn't give that up for the world. This...\" Jade points at Nate. \"... is a human that needs to be taught a lesson.\" \"Oh really now...? What's did it do?\" Sapphire growled. \"Well <i><b>HE</b></i> insulted my figure.\" \"Release him. I want to see exactly what he looks like.\" Jade sneered as she lifted up her shirt and Nate tumbled onto the floor. Nate was flat on his ass, looking up and becoming shaded by both Jade's and Sapphire's looming shadows. \"Feh.. exactly how I imagined him to be. Dirty, ugly and weak. If I had half a mind I would make him my personal slave for the rest of this trip.\" Sapphire brought her face directly in front of Nate. \"And make it Hell for you and Heaven for me.\" \"Mother, you always take the humans. Why not leave him with me?\" Jade said looking directly at Nate. \"After all, I was the one he insulted.\" \"I have a better idea.\" Sapphire butted in. \"Why not let the human decide. It would be fun to see who he chooses.\" \"Hmmmm... alright then.\" Jade chimed. Sapphire smirked at Nate. \"Now human. Which one one of us will you choose, hmmm? The one you, oh so, insulted? Or the more grand diva that will \"take very good care\" of you.\" Sapphire looked like she really wants Nate for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuh...\" Nate paused before deciding. Sure both options are bad but Nate was the one that did this to himself. </span></div></div>",

I could vaguely remember how <i>floored </i>I was the first time I stepped into the faculty car's rec room, at how wide and homely it felt compared to the shoeboxes I'd seen back at home, but as the years went by of waiting on the train's vast, almost boundless landscapes, the walls slowly seemed to shrink into something that felt <i>startling</i> small to step into. The room was split perfectly down the middle between a stretch of thick red carpeting pitted against the other half's hardwood floor, with the left section from the door reserved into a modest living space. A TV near the wall sat on a stand that was guarded by two red armchairs and a considerably wide sofa, while the corner was taken by two pinball tables and a bookshelf that'd been long abandoned for a fine layer of dust. An open corridor stood on the wall right along the boundary into walls of sleeping pods dully built in an even grid of glass windows, and right on the opening's side was a kitchen bar, sitting right along the wall with a line of booths built under the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone white figure sat at one of the booths, and she was a startling sight to see as well, due to a great amount of space between her and the table that wasn't eaten by a belly. For somebody who looked rich enough to afford the pristine makeup she was wearing and the brilliant curls styled into her mane, she was downright <i>skinny,</i> not even veering onto any level of \"chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came to her table with a kind smile, but the young unicorn didn't turn from the window, not even letting a finger twitch as I made myself known. She just glared at the scenery going by with a look of absolute hate, like she despised the very existence of the world outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Carmine told you I was coming, right?\" I continued. \"My name's Nathan Beane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proved she could move, giving the tiniest shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" I scratched the back of my head. \"...ready to see the train?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get this shit<i> over </i>with, yeah.\" She grumbled, stepping her way out of the seat. As she stood up, I could see that the buttons on her conductor's overcoat were misaligned, the both of the back pockets were misaligned, and her bowtie was tied up in some sloppy mess of a knot, along with a whole list of tiny little drags in her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only coughed, flipping out and reading my pocket watch. \"Well. We'll have a few things to brush up before we go down, but before we hit the night, we'd begin our patrol around...\" </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A spinoff of Gaia 2.0, my most recent interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet just under the upstate of New York, the infamous resort Gaia 2.0 stands as the most ambitious vacation spot in the world, appealing to the tastes of anybody wanting to go on vacation, complete with an indoor beach, a five star hotel and restaurant, and a luxurious casino in the very penthouse. While already appealing only to the richest of the highest 1% in the world, the place is even harder to check into during the heart of winter due to the merciless local snowfall, but management at the hotel has since found a means of transport that can slice through any weather on the trek across the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gaian Express is a luxurious express train that operates on a privatized loop of track laid across the entire country, passing through several major cities in a matter of 2 days, while giving future guests a taste of the awaiting lifestyle of the resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans rarely afford enough to even drive past the resort, so much check in, but can still get an extended peek inside, with a nice enough application...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"><u><br>\r\nThe Train (from front to back)</u></div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Engine:</b> A streamlined 6-10-6 steam locomotive measuring in at 275 feet tall and 1450 in length, the engine is a monolith in industrial manufacturing that's not only strong enough to pull fifteen passenger cars that'd try and match it in weight alone, but fast enough to chug around the whole country and through the brims of Canada and Mexico in three days, operating on a specially reinforced and magnetized brand of track that assures the highest speeds without derailment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin is separated into two floors; the lower being the bedroom and control center where the engineers maintain and run the train, and the upper being the office of Beverly Carmine, the sole connection between the train and Gaia 2.0's management.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Tender:</b> Approximately the same size as the engine, the coal car gives the locomotive the fuel and water needed to stay in motion. The coal reserves along the front half are always covered by a transparent visor made of acrylic, which slides away during refueling sessions. A tunnel travels under the tanks that connects the baggage car to the engine, but is reserved for staff only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Baggage Car:</b> As per the title, the car where the luggage is stored. Everything from minor personal belongings to things as large as cars and <i>yachts</i> are allowed to be stored here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Faculty Car: </b>The third least decorated part of the train, next to the tender and baggage car. The crew eat, sleep, rest, and live on this car of the train, sorted into sections that categorize workers by their size ranges. Workers on the train sleep in very small, compressed pods designed to reduce space (think the capsule hotel,) but measures are still taken to ensure that everybody lives in a clean, well equipped environment, albeit not to the extent of what's poured on the guests' laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Faculty car is also where the train's power comes from; the main generator sits at the end latched to the baggage car, kept charged by the cars' wheels turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Foyer Car:</b> The furthest up a passenger can go on the train. It's the hot spot for passengers getting on and off, and acts as a hotel lobby with a cafe, small lounging areas, and information booths for happenings aboard the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cabins Cars 1-6:</b> Each car is akin to an individual five-star hotel on wheels, complete with perpetually clean furniture, food service, cable TV, free wifi, completely soundproof walls, and the most comfortable beds science could ever make. One of the cars is filled with water to house aqua-savvy guests, and the rooms scale up the further their car is are from the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Dining Car:</b> Not only is the coach a high-end restaurant that peeks at the surface of Gaia 2.0's menu, but also features a bar, bakery, and brewery that samples the resort's vast collection of the rarest, most expensive delicacies in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pool and Spa Cars:</b> An articulated pair of coaches reserved for guests wanting a few hours of warmth no matter what weather the train's chugging through, featuring three pools. The largest occupies the entire front half of the car, and is so deep that there's a path of underwater tunnels along the floor for guests to dryly travel past, with large windows underwater that look outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Dome Car:</b> The lower floor of the dome car consists of a lounge, pool hall, and bowling alley, but the upper floor is a full length vista whose ceiling and walls are 85% glass, where guests can sit back and watch the view going by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Courtyard:</b> A botanical garden boxed up into the confines of a train car, and gives customers the freshest air they could ever get indoors. One end of the car occupied by a dense hedge maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Observatory:</b> A gigantic personal mansion whose rooms are reserved to only the most \"VI\" VIPs rich enough to rent out the space for their trip. The main bedroom is the glass-domed observation deck that overlooks the tracks, while the rest of the car features two indoor pools, a cinema-sized home theatre, its own private kitchen, servants, and cleaning staff, and the quickest means of access to the train's fine service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Pneumatic System:</b> Beneath the floors, each car is equipped with loops of tube that help the smaller crewmembers quickly shoot past miles of train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Characters</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><div align=\"center\"><b>The Good</b></div></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nathan Beane</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 6'0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main character and narrator of the story. Born into a poor household, Nathan never got to live in any remote sense of luxury, and thus took a job under the Gaian franchise to ensure both him and his family a better life. Always charming, polite, energetic, if a little dreamy and naive at times, he treats his job as a rare privilege and takes every possible advantage that helps him enjoy his job, despite a conductor being one of the lowest jobs on the train's social ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a conductor, he's required to do any job in need of getting done short of actually driving the train, whether it be at the request of the staff or a visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy Brewley</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Jellyfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9'5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy only weighs as much as the personal tank that she lives in and drives around on the train, but her light body has the image of a very fat one dressed up in a pink sundress, with stingers flowing from her head that takes the role for the hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy is the ditzy, albeit all-loving head of the bakery who greets every guest, worker, and day with a smile, but is notorious on the train for her painstaking dedication of cooking her deserts \"with love,\" which she showers upon everybody she meets, giving out innumerable hugs via the tank's robotic arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dana Etherglades</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Roc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 35'2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 25.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother conductor on the train, but is lesser seen by customers courtesy of management, due to her appearance. Despite being incredibly obese, particularly in the belly, even the workers who extensively know Dana tend to shy away from the rigid scars across her eye, and the sharp glare she always shoots around the train, despite knowing her for who she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that being Dana is really a borderline supernatural klutz, always searching for a pair of glasses that seem to vanish any time she finds them. Still, Dana tries to help in any way she can around the train, and is very friendly towards the staff and passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Eva Nero</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 41'4\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 34.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the biggest, fattest members of the crew, thus one of the most fitting to be an engineer, and even better could pass as someone who isn't completely blind. Just from memory, Eva can not only navigate around the train's map without being able to see, but can even tell where they are in the country by the patterns of curves the track navigates through, right down to the inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an overcharged array of senses, Eva has the mind of an eccentric artist who always insists on hanging upside down, along with many other requests to keep her \"in the mood,\" but her massive body is also filled by a big heart and wide sense of humor, and thus is far preferred to work with than Gess, her daytime partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the two rarely seeing one another as they change shifts, it's rumored that she and Gess hope to be a couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stacey Grove</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Giraffe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 20'6\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 37<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wildlife documentarist known for directing numerous award-winning nature documentaries filmed all over the world, despite being allergic to almost every conceivable species, whether they be animal or anthro. As a result, she'd forced to always live in an enclosed rubber spacesuit wherever she goes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey's height is mostly owed to her neck, and currently stands in as the first legitimately skinny anthro to visit Gaia 2.0 in a long, long time. She's rather shy around others, but very gentle, and is more open around species who are much smaller than her. However, if she's exposed to even the tiniest breath of air that anybody else is wafting around in, she immediately swells up like a gigantic beach ball, leaving her immobile for long periods of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Coletta Raines</b> (Created by The 12th Doctor (non canon))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Cheetah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 9' 8''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 36<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColetta could be considered the complete opposite of Jamie Billet. A British actress, Coletta prefers to star in action, horror, or campy b-films. Unlike Jamie, she's kind, laid-back, and treats the crew of the Gaian Express with respect and dignity, never demanding too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, unlike Jamie, the majority of her weight has migrated to her boobs, making them the size of bean bag chairs. They're also so extremely heavy that she often needs help moving. (They did land her a role in a superhero movie, but that's neither here nor there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and Coletta hate each other. Jamie thinks Coletta is an untalented ditz just using her boobs to get roles, while Coletta thinks Jamie is an arrogant, rude bully. They've only shared the screen once. Both would say it was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maesta Everlind</b> (Created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 13'11\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head chef of the dining car, Maesta's a fairly plump woman, but she looks incredibly obese due to the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">shear</span> sheer amount of wool on her body. Her talent for cooking is highly valued by the train's management, but it's extremely rare that she gets to leave the kitchen, which is where her apartment is built under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may come off as a bit of a grump, but it's mostly because she's saddened by never being able to see the reactions on her customer's faces when they taste her food, and yearns for somebody to voice their opinions to her face to face. She's rather open to Nathan when he drops by, who's a constant contender when Deanna goes into one of her hunger pangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Beverly Carmine</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Orca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 52'8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 47.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe highest up on the staff of the Gaian Express, and the sole connection between the train and the resort itself. Despite her own hunger being her biggest weakness, and being easy to pack thousands of pounds onto her behemoth of a body by the day, she's still a swiss army knife of a woman who can run any job on the train with what'd normally be a crippling weight, while still filling out the management and paperwork entailed with the express line. She's the source of any demand on the train, and has a stern expectance out of those she sends into battle, but rather than be a Miss Holmes II that only sees her employees as chess pawns, she legitimately cares for the safety and wellbeing of the staff, and seeks to compensate for any undo stress their being in action may have caused without trying to hide away her guilt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Holmes trusts her as one of the few people to share her paperwork with, and is one of the even fewer who comes close to being called \"an aquaintance\", but Beverly only sees her as just a boss, often being cold against the feelings she returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>The Bad</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melissa Barjes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 6'11\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn heir from a family so rich that her mane is 12K gold, but never inherited the well-known philanthropy of her parents. Despite being a very slim and pretty girl, Melissa is a sadistic bully who, although not much of a bruiser, enjoys humiliating and enforcing power over those around her, and devoted her college years to making other students' lives a living hell. After the full story'd finally spread of her atrocious behavior in school, her parents decided to make her work for once in her life, and at one of the most hard-working places circling the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so young, there may be a chance of redemption for her to find at the Gaian Express. That, or just a ton of winter weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gess Mallicks</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 42'5\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 30<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engineer by day, coming close to Eva in terms height and obesity. While not typically feared by the staff, and being one of the more harmless of \"those\" anthros on the train, anybody near her still cringe at her relentless habit of complaining, whether it be about her job, the train, the customers, the boss, the music on the radio, or just her usual dumpsters of food being late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, crewmembers are assigned to sit in the cabin with her and listen to her endless rambling, just so she can have the satisfaction of her gripes having weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sapphire Rhodes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Swan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 20'7\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 48.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA name that strikes great fear into the hearts of anyone having to share <i>England</i> with the belligerent, hate-spewing owner of Gem fashion industries, <i>especially</i> humans. Just moving one car closer to the observatory sends a chill down the neck of anybody aware of her being on the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire loves eating, and always tries to dine on endless line of tables and buffets carrying the most expensive and exotic foods anybody could buy, and has amassed a monstrous girth that, despite lugging around a gigantic belly and breasts, mostly dribbles down and puffs her legs into a rediculously large pear figure, a feature that she loves to flaunt or potentially use to humiliate her servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone as fat, lazy, and aged as she is, however, she can move around with an intimidating amount of strength and vigor, should she ever feel like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jade Rhodes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Swan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 18'9\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a proud vegetarian, Sapphire Rhode's second youngest daughter still manages to ride on the ankles of her weight by sheer gluttony, even if her body puffs out in more of an apple shape. Unlike her mother, though, Jade is vastly liked by many others for a kind heart towards all other species, making a large circle of friends filled by all kinds of anthros while gladly taking part in numerous charities. However, she makes it up to Sapphire tenfold by sucking away what'd be her distaste for all species and plopping it all right on humans, who she makes much more of an effort to bully and humiliate, putting sitting and squashing on anything the likes of Melissa could ever try to match. As such, she'd smoothed out her differences and earned her mother's complete pride, making her a likely beneficiary to the family's heirlooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jamie Billet</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 11'7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 39.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn american movie actress whose current job is getting in character to play France's gluttonous tyrant Queen Edith II, a job she absolutely refuses to let anyone CG herself for. She demands everybody on the staff to see, treat, and talk to her as if she was the actual late ant queen herself, while at the same time packing on the 30+ feet worth of weight that'd go with the role<i> by the time they reach the resort,</i> in order to \"feel the weight of an empire dropping on one's shoulders.\" (and quite frankly, is making incredible progress with the dining car.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Edith herself was a nightmare by the legends, she could've learned a lesson or two from the fury of Jamie Billet being called out of her character...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Deanna Aswell</b> (Created by Keroro04)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Beetle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 18'1\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 72 (31, in beetle years)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress for the dining car, but is also pretty adept at being on the other end of the order, as well. She may had been pretty round when she'd first stepped onto the train, and carried around a chipper workplace attitude, but trying a sample of the car's food two months ago lit a fuse inside of her that swamped her body with eight extra feet of fat, and now it seems she's only ever happy when she's eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets pretty angry and bossy when she's hungry, and management allows her to have snack breaks on duty to curb over her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kendra Blake</b> (Created by The 12th Doctor (non canon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Lizard<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 10'3''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 27<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heir to a media empire, Kendra is on her way to meet with her parents at Gaia 2.0. While she's riding the train, she's adding more pounds to her already massive ass. Oddly, she never gains weight anywhere else but her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra inheriting her parents empire would be problematic, since she is, by most definitions, a sociopath. Kendra is devoid of any empathy, and will lie, cheat, steal, and hurt others with no remorse. She is completely unable to form meaningful relations with anyone or anything, sees herself as the center of the universe, and views both humans and monsters as toys and tools to be used and discarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her lack of empathy and incredibly fickle nature, Kendra is making life hard for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>The Ugly</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rachel Loomitt</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 38'1\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 21.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA morbidly obese track runner who can still run around as if she weighed nothing, as if inflated by her bubbly personality and a mad infatuation for anything tiny, particularly within the human-sized club. Anybody caught in that twinkle in her eye can only run, run and pray to the holy light of heaven to keep them from getting swiped away and squeezed in a giant bunny hug, and pray even harder to be let go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Francine O'hagan</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSize: 25'8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 28.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loudmouthed vegan who still downs handfuls of junk food on endless refill, and desperately seeks to slander Gaia 2.0's hedonistic atmosphere while shaming anybody who eats food that'd originated from its farms. Despite being incredibly obese, she somehow appears on time at every stop the train makes, trying to scream the holy virtues of veganism through the windows, or even sneak in to sabotage the kitchen's hardware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Absence</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight: 14'-15'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: Unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opera singer whose fame is known worldwide, but only famed for two things: her name and her voice. Her mere existence alone is one of the greatest mysteries to grace the planet with its presence, pulling in more conspiracy theories than any UFO sighting. Nobody, not even her staff and assistants, know what species she is or what she looks like beneath costumes or custom fashion she wears designed to keep any patch of fur, skin, feathers, or scales on her body completely hidden. The sole, solitary clue of her appearance is her body's shape, possessing an extremely corpulent frame that mostly focuses her weight on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a woman of high society and charity, she obsessively leads a lifestyle brutal on both herself and her staff to keep her identity in check, relying on an army of security guards that scrutinize any form of communication she makes with the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The rules go pretty much the same as Gaia 2.0's, but for those new...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do not end stories without my permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Maximum character height is 100 feet. The train is big, but only <i>so</i> big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All characters must be at least 21, and under 50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Nathan is always the main character.

No crashing/derailing, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Original characters are more than welcome. Should you wish, hit me up with an email an I'll add their bio to the front page.
