She considers spitting on the gym floor she'd spent the past month possessing, but decides it goes through enough as is. \"Ugh, I miss when I didn't feel empathy for inanimate objects. Thay wasnt nearly as hot as I thought it would be. Great view though... I'm just glad the phone tablet voice chat app the owner was calling while on vacation to tell me to stay the floor crashed overnight the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlana stumbles around regaining her footing while trying to leave. Finally she decides \"Eh, why am I giving a crap about her convenience? I just need to find somewhere to take it  and sets off the alarm while exiting the fire escape door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She takes a couple minutes outside to enjoy the humid but clean night air, then hears sirens approaching. \"DAMN! Of course the fire department on on the ball tonight.\" She can't tell which way the trucks are coming from due to the alley's acoustics, and isn't sure which way to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">A perverted 19 year old girl named Ilana is granted her wish to be able to turn into any object and experience \"life\" as it, but on the condition that the owner of the object has to agree to the change. She is unable to feel pain while transformed, but keeps all her other senses. Her face is always visible on the object in a location decided by her owner when the pact is made. This is where the vast majority of her senses are. Even though her face is formed out of the material of whatever she's turned into, she is fully able to move her mouth, tongue, nose, and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is stuck as the object for 72 hours, but the timer is reset anytime her current owner expresses her desire out loud that she remain as she is. The owner is not told about this at the time the pact is made, but the girl is forced to explain it if the owner unknowingly does it and asks why she hasn't changed back. They have to say it each time, so a voice recording set to play each day won't work, but and alarm reminding them to say it is fair game. While possessing something, reality alters so that only she and her owner know she existed. Anyone else reacts to her being a sentient talking object like it is perfectly normal. The wish has 2 catches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  1 - She vastly improves the function of anything she's turned into, adding features the owner wishes the object had. The owner's are not under any magical compulsion to keep her as she is, but the improvements make it desirable to do so. As time passes though and the object she's possessing becomes \"normal\" to them, it's more and more likely they'll start treating her as one and let the timer expire unless reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  2 - She is compelled to use her power. The longer she spends in her human body, the stronger the compulsion becomes, and the more humiliating of a pact she is willing to accept to do so. As perverted as she is, even she can become overwhelmed and wish to take a break, but this prevents her from doing so for long. So far her record for staying in her human body is a week, and she ended up spending a month as a gym floor when she broke down in front of the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few rules.<br>\r\n- Only female characters, no male interaction.<br>\r\n- Animals have enough sense of self that she can't possess them. A creative girl may realize that her body is her property and make her into a body part, but in general she possesses objects. <br>\r\n- No pee, scat, or gore. This is purely personal preference, sorry. Farting is okay.</td>",
