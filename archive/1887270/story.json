He was a very average guy with dark brown hair and a fairly slim body type that was neither especially ugly or impressive. He hardworking father, a kind, caring though sometimes overbearing mother and annoying. In terms of schools he was doing alright in school, he wasn't failing in any of his class but he wasn\u2019t excelling in anything either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall Bill had a very quiet calm, nice and uneventful life but that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking down the street Bill spotted a small shiny stone lying in the grass next to the pavement. He didn\u2019t know  what complied to do so but, the moment he saw it, he walked over and picked. He turned around and discovered that on other side was an inscription on the other side, \u201cThose who make a wish in angry while holding this stone shall have it granted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill raised an eyebrow, was that true could rock really grant wish?  He smiled, of course not? This was obviously some kind of joke. But he did have to give credit where it was due, whoever had set this prank up, they were at least trying to be creative. Regardless it might be good for a laugh at so he pocketed the stone and carried onto school, he got as far end of the front lawn  when suddenly\u2026...      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To be honest it could get quite annoying at times. Once Matt finished his rant Bill decide that perhaps have a little laugh would cheer his friend up.     <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey Matt, check this out I found this green stone in the garden,\u201d Bill showed the \u2018wishing stone\u2019 to Matt, he took the rock and turned in over in his hand. \u201cApparently if you get angry enough it will grant you wishes.\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two friends chuckled at how dumb the whole idea of magic rock was.

Her hair was a long mane shiny of golden locks, her eyes were bright violet, her teeth were perfectly white, her lips were of a good quality and she had a button nose. She was also pretty tall with long fine but muscle legs and her delicate soft hands ended with long blue painted manicured nails and very big chest. She wore a long gold chain necklace that seemed to have been placed there to emphasise her large set of asset, while her earlobes were pierced by a set of silver earrings. Her last accessory was a small navy blue purses that hung over her left shoulder.             <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for clothing, her main piece was a professional navy blue blazer jacket with golden buttons, underneath the a was a light grey blouse, the blouse was a navy blue pencil skirt. Meanwhile, her long elegant legs were wrapped in pantyhose. Finally, she wore a pair of light blue high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overall impression, she was a strong professional who took great pride in her skill and appearance, that she was someone who should always be taken seriously, the only thing that didn\u2019t fit with picture was her confused and dizzy expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The woman asked her voice remind Bill of his mother's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Bill, why are you staring at me like that and did you shrink, why do I feel so strange?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a theory, to the woman\u2019s identity popped into Bill\u2019s head. \u201cMatt is that you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gave Bill an annoyed look, \u201cOf course it's me, stupid!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...Matt looks down,\u201d The women looked down as Bill instructed, only then did notice her large pair of breast. The woman cheeks turned red with panic, \u201choly\u2026\u201d she stopped talking and covered her mouth only just realising that something was wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir only logical explanation was either this was some sort of elaborate prank, or the rock had transformed Matt into a woman.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a woman! How the hell did this happen!\u201d The woman who was probably Matt began to devolve into a panic that would be comical if the reason behind it wasn\u2019t so terrifying. \"My hair is my eyes and these shoes, how does in one walk in them!\u201d Matt then stumbles slight, before grabbing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow do we fix this?\u201d Matt moaned, while Bill looked on trying desperately create a plan of action.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His whole body began to get smalller and thinner as he shrunk from six feet tall to just around 5'5. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill cried out moaning for help as Matt struggled to do anything but just watch. He was helpless to do anything at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBills while bidy frame began to change as his hips expanded and got wider. His legs shrunk down as his body hair began to vanish. His stomach pulled in tighter and flatter. Next a pressure began to build up in his chest as two small but perky breasts began to push out. They stopped at B-cup range. Lastly his face began to reform as his voice changed becoming soft and feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last changes were to his clothing. His baggy clothes began to change to reform around his new body. His tennis shoes melted away and reformed into blue sandals which showed off his cute feet and painted toenails. His pants began to shrink and tighten around his body into hip hugger jeans. The began to shrink up his legs and stop right around his knees. His undershirt began to reform into a cute bra to contain his new breasts while his shirt turned into a nice blue blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few minutes Bill had completely transformed into a cute Brunette girl his own age. In many ways he was now how he would have been if born a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" Bill called out in his new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was shocked and stunned at the transformation he had no idea what caused it as he held the stone still in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone! That light it has to be it!\" Bill said angered as he took it back from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey! I don't think you should be messing with that we don't know anything about it yet!\" Matt said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say!

Bill thought, and immediately discarded the option. Much as he wanted to, he could only make a wish while angry, and right now he felt more confused and unsettled than agitated in any sense of the word. With no other choices, and dreading the idea of attending Mom's work on her behalf, he settled with going back home and figuring things out from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Bill walked through his front door. He realized this was the second or third time in his high school career that he had walked inside his house at seven forty-five, when he'd usually be sitting with Matt and his girlfriend Gloria, waiting for the first period bell to ring and talking about their plans for winter break. Putting food for the dog and letting out the cat--just as Mom wanted--he walked into the kitchen and mustered up the courage to call her work, finding the number within a binder she had placed on the table. Lying was easier than he had expected. Mom had a good record for attending work, but not good enough that they questioned any absence. Once he hung up, Bill walked up to his bedroom, placed the Grellstone on his desk, and fell onto the mattress, face-first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stung his new breasts, unsurprisingly, and his feet extended several inches off the side of his bed for a change. Still, Bill felt more calm than he did at any other point in that morning, lying there. It was kind of nice to skip school and do nothing for a day. While Kimberly and Mom, in his body, were at school, and Dad was at work, he could go downstairs and play video games. The novelty of doing it while in his mother's body was not lost on Bill, and for a second he entertained a slightly dirty thought of doing it in her underwear. He did not think of playing with her body in any capacity, however. Even with every part of her body under his control, she still remained his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill had just begun to get cozy with this plan when, interrupting his reverie, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could that be?\" Bill grumbled, mustering the willpower to go downstairs and checked.

So much so that he didn't even notice when Bill jumped at him and grabbed the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, give me that back!\" Rob yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Bill saw this coming and was already a ways ahead of the lumbering bully by the time he started running. However, Bill's foot ware was not making running easy. Nor was the weight of his breasts swinging back and forth on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't keep this up!\" Shrieked Bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I wish I was a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked down at the stone in his hand as his legs slowed. It didn't seem like it was going to do much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob came from behind and wrapped his arms around Bill, restraining him, as well as feeling up his new body. Bill just went limp in his arms, until he suddenly tightened his fists and pulled up his dangling legs a bit. He no longer felt scared or panicked, but angry, very angry. I wasn't just because he had been turned into a girl, or that Rob was now using him for his enjoyment, but because he was now just fed up with Rob altogether. All the years of frustration with him just came bubbling up to surface at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sick of you! You disgust me. Why don't you just turn into the one who's always picked on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rob let go of Bill and began to stumble back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob began to lose a few inches of height and quite a bit of bulk. His face became a lot thinner and girlier, and his hair quickly tripled in length. His body was now only half of its previous size and becoming more feminine, but only slightly. His hips puffed out a tiny bit, as did his chest, but it was barely noticeable. All of a sudden he put his hands to his mouth and winced in pain, when he pulled them away, Bill saw some braces on his teeth. Finally his clothes changed to some rather loose fitting girly clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbed squeaked in a tone much girlier than Bill's, in fact he sounded a bit like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill smirked, still gripping the stone tightly. \"Finally! Big Rob is reduced to what he really is! A wimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stopped staring as his body and gave Bill an angry glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until I get that stone you freak! You're going to beg me to be begging me just to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone? You're not going to use it ever again. You need a personality to match your wimpy body. Instead of getting mad at everything, you're just going to run away crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob get even madder. \"What?\" He was charged Bill and went for the stone, but received a smack across the face instead which sent him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob kept scowling, but couldn't seem to finish his sentence of get up. After a few seconds, a tear came streaming down his face. Bill just burst out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob just sat on the ground fighting the urge to cry, but it wouldn't last much longer. From around the corner came a few girl's from Bill's school. The giggled to each other as they saw Rob sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who it is Sandy, Roberta the washboard!\" said one of the girls, pointing at Rob's flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know they made training bras for sixteen year olds!\" Said another girl, which made all three break out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob, or Roberta, couldn't take anymore after that. He burst out in tears screaming before getting up and running as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill looked on as he ran. \"That should teach him.\"</span></div></div>",
