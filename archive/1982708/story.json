On the table he was working at was what appeared to be a utility belt, one that Batman or one of his many tight wearing sidekicks would wear. But this one was a dark color of blue with a green circular emblem for a buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus grinned wickedly, \"Finally,\" he started \"My masterpiece is done! Those fools will be no match for the power of my Blob Belt!\" He picked up the belt and strapped it onto his bulging belly. He wore a skin tight orange leather suit. His fat curves could be seen from every angle. \"For years I have seen all those well muscled hunks and the cute sidekicks run around the in skin tight outfits, showing off there bodies and making me feel bad about being fat. But no more! With this belt they will learn what its like to be like me! All of those Justice dorks and there boy toys that follow them around. I wont stop until they are all to huge to move or even care about saving the world. Only three things will be on there mind, Food, Sex, and getting Fatter!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Dr. Obesus laughed the classic villain laugh. He was going to enjoy this, but who was he going to start with?</span></div></div>",

The Flash was always running around and showing off that bouncing bubble butt in that red skin tight outfit of his. Everyone always thought he was sexy and wanted to screw with him. Lets be honest, Dr. Obesus wanted that too, but he wanted fat first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus traveled to Central city to take on the Flash. The only problem was that he was to catch, the only way he could hit the Flash with his Blob Belt was if he got him to stand still, and for that hot head speedster was hard. But Dr. Obesus was a genius, he had already gotten a way to keep the flash still long enough to get hit by the ray from the Blob Belt. Dr Obesus had a couple of his fat henchman stage a robbery and Central City Bank. Inside the bank, Dr. Obesus hid out of site, waiting for the scarlet speedster to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the Flash burst in through the door, pausing for dramatic effect. \"No boys,\" he said loudly so all could hear, \"I know you need money to fill those growing guts of yours but there is better way's to get money.\" A couple people snickered at his joke. \"Cocky showoff.\" Dr. Obesus muttered. Within seconds the Flash tied up his henchman and was chatting casually with the former hostages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think its funny to make fun of my fat boys do yeah,\" Dr. Obesus whispered to himself, \"well lets see how you like it Flash.\" With that Dr. Obesus reach down to his belt buckle and fired a beam at the Flash hitting him square in the back. The Flash simply scratches his back, not even knowing what is about to unfold...</span></div></div>",

I got you Flash!\u201d Dr, Obesus said, revealing himself. The Flash spun around. \u201c\u201dOh great, another fat villain\u2026 What\u2019s your gimmick, eating? Being a tub of lard\u201d Dr. Obesus rolled his eyes. \u201cNot necessarily. I\u2019m here to make you, Flash, into the Fattest Man Alive! And with my Blob Belt, I\u2019ve already succeeded too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash cocked an eyebrow, \u201cOh, really? Cause I don\u2019t feel very\u2026\u201d The Flash suddenly felt a pain in his gut and looked down. To his horror, he saw his midsection begin expanding, pushing his bright red latex suit outwards and downwards. \u201cW-What did you do?!\u201d He yelled as the fat began traveling up his body. \u201cHeheh, as I said, I\u2019m turned you into a bright red ball. You\u2019ll keep getting fatter until you\u2019re as big as me! Or maybe even fatter?\u201d He grinned and slapped his orange, spandex clad gut, making it jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flash\u2019s belly ballooned, and so did his thighs and forearms. His chiseled abs were long gone, replaced by a hefty, pudgy belly. His pecs became softer, turning to be, flabby moobs. His hot bubble butt expanded as well, becoming a nice, fat ass. Eventually it spread to his feet and arms, making his hands puffy and his fingers look like sausages in the red spandex that still managed to cover him. The weight gain rose upward to his face, as his cheeks started to puff out and he began developing a double chin. The whole time all he could do was watch in horror, as he becomes a huge, fat man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo\u2026 I-I\u2019m HUGE! I\u2019m as big as a whale!\u201d He whimpered as he jiggled with his massive belly. He had to be at least 400 lbs., maybe even more. He couldn\u2019t believe just how fat he was! And as he stomach began to gurgle again, he could feel himself starting to balloon even further, as his body just started getting flabbier. \u201cHah! Now who\u2019s the tub of lard, hmm?\u201d Dr. Obesus mocked him as The flash groaned as he kept getting heavier. \u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m so fat\u2026 I\u2019m a blimp! I-I\u2019m going to blow up at this rate! You have to change me back!\u201d He pleaded as his belly rippled. He felt like he had gained another 50 lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to explode, just pack on the pounds. Besides, why should I change you back? You look much better as a fat, red hog.\u201d Hew grinned, \u201cOh, but that \u2018blimp\u2019 analogy isn\u2019t too far off. This thing causes a few side-effects.\u201d He chuckled as The Flash grimaced. \u201cW-What do you mean\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was another gurgle in Flash\u2019s gut, and he grunted, before a massive, smelly FRRRRRRT came from behind him. He gasped in shock, embarrassment, and oddly, relief, and blushed as it rumbled out of him. \u201cW-What the hell?\u201d He asked. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re just full of hot air, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Dr. Obesus mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flash was on the verge of tears at the humiliation. He was getting fatter and slobbier by the second and couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He tried to run, but he was so fat now, he couldn\u2019t use his super speed. He was powerless now. He huffed, panted, and started to sweat as he waddled toward Dr. Obesus. Dark stains started to appear in the pits and folds of his suit, and sweat rolled down his chubby face. He stopped, having to catch his breath. He couldn\u2019t believe how winded he was. As he bent down, another huge PFFFRRRT rumbled from his bloated ass. Then, there was a sudden tearing sound, RIIIIIP, as a hole tore in the thigh of his suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty impressive suit you\u2019ve got there. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to hold out so long. I\u2019d say you were at 500 lbs now. And counting.\u201d The Flash groaned, humiliated, and continued to waddle toward Dr. Obesus, stopping and panting, as he stood right in front of him. \u201cHuff\u2026Change\u2026Me\u2026Back\u2026\u201d Dr. Obesus crossed his arms and smiled. \u201cHate to burst your bubble, but there\u2019s no reverse switch on it. Besides, you\u2019re looking pretty sexy as a fat slob.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flash was surprised by this comment, and his face just kept getting redder, from the exhaustion, the embarrassment of his fattening, loud farting, and suit ripping, and now from the compliments of this huge lardass. For some reason he found himself thinking he was a surprisingly\u2026 sexy\u2026 lardass, before shaking his head, trying to get those thoughts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t\u2026 Doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 I\u2019m still taking you in. You\u2019re a criminal and\u2026 God, I\u2019m tired.\u201d He sighed, trying to place his hands on knees to catch his breath, but he belly was too big for him to reach. Dr. Obesus wasn\u2019t paying attention, and was more focused on Flash\u2019s flabby belly. Without warning, he grabbed it and jiggled Flash\u2019s hefty gut to his shock. \u201cH-Hey, what are you\u2026 S-Stop!\u201d He yelped as Obesus just kept jiggling it, smirking as he watch the blubbery belly ripple through the spandex. He fingered Flash\u2019s belly button through the tight fabric. Flash moaned, before realizing what he was doing and grabbed his hand. \u201cStop! Y-You\u2019re going into custody, and you\u2019re gonna work on a way to reverse this.\u201d Dr. Obesus just smirked, \u201cMake me, fat boy!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He smirked as he thought about it. \u201cIf you insist.\u201d Suddenly, the Flash belly bounced Dr. Obesus, knocking into him and knocking the similarly fat, but not as big supervillain down on the ground, big belly shaking whilst doing so. \u201cHow d\u2019ya like that?\u201d, Flash quipped as he stood over the villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus looked up at the bright red mass of jiggling fat in surprise. Before he could do anything else, he already saw the Flash\u2019s now enormous ass looming over him. He gulped, as the Flash brought it down, slamming into him, burying him between his massive, flabby cheeks. Flash chuckled, \u201cNot so fun now, is it?\u201d He said, even deliberately digging his fat ass into the ground to squash him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs exciting as it was, Flash was still morbidly obese and out of breath, but at least the threat was neutralized. \u201cNow let\u2019s see\u2026. Just gotta\u2026 Keep you here till help\u2026 arrives.\u201d He chuckled weakly. It was still embarrassing in all honesty, the fastest man alive reduced to the fattest. Still, at least that fat was being put to good use. He could feel Dr. Obesus squirming futilely, trying to get away, and laughed more, whole body jiggling as he did. It kinda tickled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for assistance from the Justice League to arrive, he sighed wearily. All he wanted was too return to normal. Could he? Well, if they have the guy in their clutches, it should be possible, shouldn\u2019t it? He hoped so anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting there, soon a crowd began to gather around, undoubtedly surprised at the giant fat Flash crushing a new foe with his ass. Flash was even more humiliated, especially when they started taking pictures of him, but couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it, not without letting Dr. Obesus go anyway. Even more embarrassing was when his belly began to growl and gurgle, prompting chuckles and jokes about his eating. Flash tried to ignore them, but his face was as bright red as his suit was from it all. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nightwing was known for his hot body, hard muscle, and skintight black suit that accentuated his sexy bubble butt. He had dozens of fans that ogled him, drooling over his abs and handsome, boyish features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus thought that needed to change. Smiling wickedly, he strapped on the Blob Belt and made his way to Bludhaven\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightwing silently lept from rooftop to rooftop during his nightly patrol. Crime was pretty slow these days, but he had been taught to follow this rigorous routine by his former mentor, Batman. Even though he no longer followed him, he still followed his example, to an extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick\u2019s body of course was honed through his exercise. He didn\u2019t like to brag, but he was quite proud of his muscle. He knew how tight his body was. Especially his glutes, which tended to gather a lot of attention. Not that he minded of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this particular patrol, he felt somewhat uneasy, as if he was being watched. He stopped on a roof and looked around uneasy. Unbeknownst to him, Dr. Obesus was hidden in the shadows out of sight, waiting for his chance to strike. Cautiously, Dick withdrew his batons and held them in a fighting stance. \u201cIs anyone there?\u201d He asked, as he watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply but silence. Dick waited for a few more moments before relaxing. It wasn\u2019t like him to get this nervous. Maybe some of Bruce\u2019s paranoia had rubbed off on him. He sighed, turned, and stretched, figuring the danger was gone. Maybe he ought to take a vacation sometime, or at least consider staying with the Titans for a while. That normally took his mind off things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Obesus saw the perfect opportunity and took it while Dick faced away from him. Grinning, he fired his Blob Belt at the youth, striking him in the back. Dick yelped and spun around, looking for the cause. Dr. Obesus quickly hid again, but now Nightwing was aware that there was something there. He rubbed the spot on his back as he looked for the source. Something had hit him, but he didn\u2019t know what\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
