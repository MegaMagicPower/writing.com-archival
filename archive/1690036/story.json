Sweat dripped down his gray T-shirt and navy blue cargo pants. He huffed and puffed through the alleyways of Myaiu City as fast as he could. If the track coach could see him now, he'd probably consider letting him join for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be late...I'm going to be late...I'm going to be late...\" He chanted to himself, jumping over trash cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a big obstacle made an appear. A chain fence stood between Varieo and the street to his school. He could easily climb over it, but it was what had it's foot stuck in the fence that proved a greater challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cat...a bloody cat...\" He said to himself as an orange kitten desperately tried to claw it's way out of the chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo hated cats. His aunt kept dozens of the fur balls around the house when he was a kid. They were nasty things and did everything to him; from spitting hairballs on him while asleep to knocking over a bucket of water onto his head. He HATED cats, which was odd considering what a kindhearted person he was. And it was this same stupid kindness that was forcing him to help free the entangled kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright now....Here kitty, kitty...I'm not going to hurt you...That's it...Now let me just grab your little paw here and...What the?! OW-OUCH! The stupid thing scratched me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange tabby cat took off in a flash, leaving Varieo to suck the blood oozing from his carved hand. Three giant claw marks had been cut into his hand, very deeply. He was in pain, but he was already late. Turning to the fence he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if I help another mangy fur-wad again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo had already missed his first class, barging into his second period class earned him a glare from his teacher. He took his seat next to his friend Bloono, who as always was chewing on a stick of celery. Bloono didn't even bother to ask why he was late, which was good considering the mood Varieo was in. The cut had developed some sort of odd pus, making it looked infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my luck.\" Varieo thought to himself. \"That cat probably had rabies or something...I probably need to get a shot now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took his handkerchief out and wrapped the wound up. Allowing him to return his attention to class. The rest of the day went fairly normal, he chatted with his friends who showed some concern when they saw his bandaged hand. It was nice to know they cared enough to ask. He decided that he would go to the nurse after lunch to have her take a look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when lunch did finally come around Varieo felt something odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The whole arm was covered in fur. He took off the bandage and saw the cut marks are completely gone for some reason. Not only that, but his hands were growing claws too.<br>\r\n\"What the hell kind of cat was that!? Now I'm mutating from it!\"<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before his ears moved to the top of his head and grew long and pointed. His face grew a long snout, a long furry tail burst out of his pants, and sharp claws ripped his shoes to pieces. He stood there in the empty bathroom, looking at the reflection of an anthropomorphic wolf in the mirror. He touched every detail of his new lupine body, not wanting to believe a single second of what happened.<br>\r\n\"This isn't real, this isn't real at all!

Everyone was in the classrooms around him, and he can hear the chatter and talk of the other students inside. Now that he's a wolf, his senses were sharper than before. As he approached the end of the hall, he heard footsteps approaching him from somewhere. \"Oh no, I can't let anyone see me like this! I've gotta find a place to hide!\" Panicking, Varieo rounded the corner of the hallway, only to bump into someone head on. \"Ow, what hit me?\" Varie looked up to see an anthropomorphic wolf with a distended stomach poking out of the too small shirt it was wearing. When Varieo looked up, he saw his friend Varie staring at him. \"Ah! D-don't scream! Please, don't scream! It's me Varieo!\" \"Varieo? What happened to you!? And...what have you been eating?\" Varie stared at Varieo's growing gut, much to his dismay. \"Ugh, stupid cat scratch!\" \"Cat scratch? You mean to tell me that a cat did all this to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention students, attention students,\" the P.A. system suddenly said all around the school. \"I'm terribly sorry to say this, but I regret to inform you all that I have received word that one of our students have been infected with a newly discovered disease called 'Morphosis'. Everyone must stay in their rooms for I believe this disease is contagious and, most likely, very dangerous. To prevent further infection, the government will send a team of scientists to located the infected student and try to find a cure for him or her. Thank you.\" \"This is just great. More good news.\" Varieo said, covering his face with a clawed hand. \"Well, what do you think you're doing, sitting there like a lost cub like that? It's time to go!\" Varie said, already standing when Varieo looked at her. \"What do you mean by that Varie!? I can't go with you, let alone be near you! I can't just put you in danger like that!\" \"And I can't just let a bunch of guys in suits take you away for experiments and stuff! I'm not going to just abandon you! And besides, we've already head butted each other, so I might as well be infected already!\" She's right. They've already touched each other, and that could already be enough to infected someone else. Being near her won't cause anymore damage than what's already been done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Varieo can realize it, Varie has already gotten a running start down a random hallway. As Varieo ran after her, he was stunned to see how quickly he was gaining after her, without even breaking a sweat! Plus, he feels really light on his feet, even with the 3-inch gut in front of him. \"Varie! I think there's something else that's happening to me!\" \"Huh? What was that?\" Varie looked behind her and was surprised to see her wolf friend a lot closer than she thought he would be. She knew Varieo wasn't much of a runner, but to catch up with her so fast like that!? As the two turned to a different hallway, they were spotted by some men with hazmat suits and tranquilizer guns. \"What kind of disease do these people think this is!? A zombie virus!?\" Varieo said as the agents ran after them. \"Quick, this way!\" Varie led the two to the opposite hallway. The government agents were right on their tail, with Varie and Varieo turning every which way to try and lose them. Finally, the agents ran to a different direction. Varie started panting while holding her knees, but Varieo was wondering why he's not as tired as Varie is. \"Aren't you, *pant* even a bit, *pant* out of breath? *pant*\" \"Strangely enough, no I'm not. There's definitely something fishy about this disease I have. I just hope that someone would explain this to me soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if he got his wish, Varie and Varieo was shot by tranquilizer darts, and fell into the darkness of slumber.</span></div></div>",

As he shook off the rest of his drowsyness, he sat up on a metal table, seeing his shirt completely gone, and only a part of his pants still intact enough to cover up his modesty. What he didn't expect to see was how big his stomach has grown while he's asleep. In fact, his whole body plumped out. His arms and legs were a lot thicker, with or without fur. His neck was quite large now,with a second one growing uderneath it. His chest was puffy and seemed to be getting some a bit bigger too. But what really caught Varieo's eyes the most was his stomach. It was the size of an overinflated beachball now! More or less even bigger than that! Varieo placed his hand on it, feeling the soft fat under his fur. He pushed into it, his hand sinking into his gut. He shook his head, suddenly remembering that Varie was with him back in school. He looked around and saw that this definitely wasn't his school anymore. There was a table with a bunch of tools and chemistry equipment ahead of him, right across the room. There was a large window to his left, and a big door to his right, which must've been the way out. Just then, the door slid open and a scientist, accompanied with two guards with tranquilizer guns, entered the room. \"Hey, who are you guys, and where am I?\" Varieo asked the scientist. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Alick for having to drag you all the way here from your school. I'm the chief virologist in this facility. My name is Dr. Kane.\" \"Alright, but where's Varie? What did you do to her?\" \"Ah, the girl. Well, she's still asleep right now, and for some reason, it also appears that she's still human. Did you even touch her yet?\" Dr. Kane asked, looking at Varieo's entire body. \"Well, we accidentally bumped into each other, but I think that's about it.\" Varieo said, putting his hands on any part of his body that Dr. Kane is looking at. \"Hmm, interesting. And how did you get infected?\" Dr. Kane said, finally looking at Varieo in the face. \"Well, um, I was running late for school today, and I cot scratched at by this cat. And, that's all I think there is.\" The scientist eyed him carefully, a bit skeptical at Varieo's recollection. \"You were scratched by a cat?\" \"Yes.\" \"Was it any normal cat? Nothing special about it at all?\" \"No, not at all.\" Dr. Kane backed off a bit to look at Varieo's entire body again, much to the latter's embarrassment. Finally, Dr. Kane turned and headed to the door. \"I'll be back with results from tests we took while you were unconscious. Don't worry, it won't take long.\" The guards followed him out the door, leaving Varieo alone in the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Dr. Kane returned, this time without the guards. \"Well, Mr. Alick, I've got some good news for you.\" Varieo sat up on the table, eager to hear the results. \"It seems that this disease can only enter through an open wound, not on just skin contact.\" Varieo gave a sigh of relief, believing that he didn't get his friend infected like him. \"I've also got some bad news to tell you, also.\" Varieo immediately looked at Dr. Kane, worry beginning to fill him from head to toe. \"It seems that the virus causing this disease can survive on the skin of an infected individual. And, it can survive on the skin of an uninfected individual for a limited time before dying, so your friend may have a chance of becoming infected after all.\" Varieo gave off a slight whimper, which kinda caught him off guard, since he wasn't even thinking of whimpering at all. Dr. Kane immediately gave a friendly smile, thinking of something to help comfort the obese wolf anthro. \"Don't worry now, we just have to wait for the virus itself to die before your friend is homefree from becoming infected. We just have to make sure that she doesn't get any bruises or cuts of any kind, no matter how small.\" Varieo did perk up a bit from hearing this good news. \"Um, Dr. Kane?\" \"Yes?\" \"Just, what IS this Morphosis or whatever this disease is even called supposed to be anyway? I turned into a fat wolf in my school, but I felt lighter, and I didn't even get tired from running away from those government guys. What's this virus supposed to even do in the first place?\" Dr. Kane went quiet for a bit, which made Varieo even more curious than before. \"The truth is, the government has an entire file all about this disease, and if you really want me to, I could get it for you.\" Varieo got even more curious about this. The disease is supposed to be newly discovered, but they have an entire file about it? What's could this Morphosis truly be? </span></div></div>",

This time though, it took a long while before he came back. This time, he had a disappointed expression on his face. \"Sorry Varieo, but only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the archives the files are being kept. I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.\" \"But, I have to know what the file says! It's impossible to make a data file on something they just found! There must be something about this that they know!\" \"Yes Varieo, I know about that, and I'm just as suspicious as you are, but unless something happened, I won't be able to get to that file.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dr. Kane's eyes widened as an idea came to his head. \"Wait! I just got an idea!\" \"Well, what is it?\" \"What if an emergency happened here, which caught the attention of all the guards?\" \"That would be a good distraction. That way, you can get the file while the guards are all distracted! But where are we going to find a distraction good enough?\" \"Easy. Say, if a subject we were observing suddenly finds a way out of the observation room and starts causing mayhem in the facility, All the guards will have to come and try to stop it.\" Varieo can already see just where this conversation was going. He gave a sigh before getting off the metal table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo guards were having a conversation when Varieo suddenly burst through a door and roared at them. The two were caught off guard by this and ran away. \"*sigh*I hope Dr. Kane get the file so I don't have to keep acting like a fat monster here.\" he said as he continued down a random hallway and roared again. Meanwhile, Dr. Kane ran up to the guards watching the door to the archives room. \"Guards, guards! It's the subject! He's escaped and now he's going on a rampage!\" Just then, the distant sound of Varieo roaring somewhere echoed throughout the hallway. The guards immediately ran toward the source of Varieo's howl. Dr. Kane watched them leave as he quietly opened the door and entered. From there, he booted the super computer inside and began searching for the file. Once found, he grabbed an empty hard drive he keeps in his pocket, downloaded the file and shut the power off to make it look like it was untampered with. He left the room and began his search for Varieo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo was running away from some guards chasing after him. After taking a few turns, he lost them. He still couldn't believe the speed he was going, even with all the excess weight on him. He began howling again. If there's one thing he knows about wolves, it's that wolves howl to alert pack members their location. So, it's only logical for Varieo to howl so Dr. Kane will find him, in theory that is. After a couple more howls, he can hear footsteps coming from behind him...</span></div></div>",

We've gotta find her and save her too!\" Dr. Kane nods in agreement as the scientist leads the obese wolf down a few corridors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in where Varie was sleeping, she wakes up on a metal table, taking in the surroundings. She's still fully human. \"Ugh...Where am I? What is this place?\" She hears the yelling of guards beyond the door leading to the hallway. \"Huh? I wonder who's making all that racket?\" She gets off the table and peers out the door. A large number of guards were running down the hallway, yelling about an escaped subject. \"I wonder who they're talking about.\" She decided to stop one of the guards to ask. \"Excuse me.\" \"What is it little girl!? I'm in a hurry here!\" \"Well, I'm just kinda wondering what all the fuss is all about.\" \"Ugh, listen. There's an escaped subject on the loose, and its going crazy here in the lab. Now I gotta go, you've wasted enough of my time!\" The guard ran down the hall, with Varie running after him to get more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo and Dr. Kane was running down a corridor, hoping to reach the observation room Varie was kept in. As they were about to make a turn, they saw a guard holding Varie with her arms behind her back. \"Alright, I know that you're friends with that monstrous freak! Tell me where he is!\" \"Ah! I told you, I don't know where Varieo is right now!\" The sight of it all made Varieo feel an intense anger building up inside of him. \"Get away from her!!!\" Varieo ran at the guard and punched him square in the face. He was sent tumbling down the hall until he landed on the wall and fell unconscious. \"Varieo!\" Varie hugged her savior tightly, but only reached half way around his belly. She stayed there for a few minutes before Varieo finally broke the awkward silence. \"Um...Varie...We, uh...We really need to get out of this place.\" Varie instantly let go. \"Oh, uh, right, hehe...\" Dr. Kane stepped in and told them about the guards most likely blocking off some of the hallways. \"Um, who are you?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Dr. Kane, young miss. What is yours?\" \"I'm Avariella. Varie for short. What the heck is this place anyway.\" \"No time to explain.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three were running down a hallway, the sound of guards trailing them behind. Dr. Kane led the party, with Varie in the middle and Varieo trailing behind. When they reached the next intersection, they were met with guards on one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! There they are!\" \"Oh crud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards began firing at them as the party ran down the other direction. \"This is bad! That corridor leads to the exit of the facility! We'll have to go around them.\" Dr. Kane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to run, they met a few guards in their way. Varieo easily jumped over his friends and pounced on them, knocking them out. Eventally, they reach a wide corridor with an open double-doorway at the end, sunlight shining in through the opening to the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two turret guns came out of panels from the walls and began firing bullets at them. \"Oh come on! Why would they even have that!?\" Varie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo immediately rushed at the turrets, dodging the gunfire and ripping them out of the walls with his bare claws. He stared at his hands in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, how strong have I become?\" \"Not now, Varieo! We need to leave!\" Dr. Kane called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo looked up and saw the two already running ahead of him. He began running behind them, not noticing a guard running towards the hallway, reaching the exit. \"This one's for you, freak!\" The guard aimed a pistol at Varieo and pulled the trigger. Varieo heard the gunfire  and instinctively side-stepped, narrowly missing the lead projectile aimed at him. But then, the bullet continued on ahead of him, and reached Varie. She screamed, falling to the ground. \"Varie!\" Varieo picked her up and continued running with Dr. Kane ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three were well away from the lab, they got down and rested. Varieo carefuly laid Varie on the ground. \"Varie, are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I think that last shot just grazed me, that's all.\" Varie raised her arm, showing a small cut made by the bullet. Dr. Kane and Varieo looked at each other, faces full of distress and worry. \"Guys, what's wrong? It's just a scratch.\" \"Well, you see miss, the virus that changed your friend here is called Morphosis.\" Dr. Kane said. \"Yeah, I already know that. The principal said it over the speakers back in school.\" \"You see, that thing is...Well, since you've been so close to Varieo here, that means you've got the virus too.\" \"Huh? Then why am I still human?\" \"Well, um...The thing is, just having the virus isn't really enough to change you. It can't get into you unless you get hurt. Like, well, you know.\" Varie looked at the cut on her arm for a few seconds before realizing what it means. \"You mean I'm gonna turn into a fat wolf like Varieo!?\" \"N-no no! I believe the animal you turn into depends on your DNA. But a morbidly obese one, yes...\" Varie almost flipped, saying all kinds of things, like how she can't go to school looking like a fat animal, or how she might lose her title as the most athletic student in school, and various other complaints. Varieo just sat down and kept thinking about the cat that morning. \"Stupid cat. The one time I try to do something nice to those demons, this happens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone has calmed down a bit, Dr. Kane suggested going to his house, which also doubled as his own personal lab. \"It's not too far from this area, and I've got the data on Morphosis those goverment people had in their computers. I can begin studying it and maybe even find a cure for the two of you as well.\" \"That's great! C'mon then guys, time's a waistin'! Let's go!\" Varie began running to a random direction. Dr. Kane called out. \"Other way, Varie!\" Varie began running back to them. \"I knew that. And maybe I should just let you go first. It's your house, after all.\" As they continued walking down the forest, Varieo felt somewhat uncomfortable with Dr. Kane's sudden change in sides. \"Hey Dr. Kane, what made you want to help us bust out of there instead? I mean, don't you work for those government scientists?\" \"Yes, until the apparent discovery of the disease in your school. I overheard one of them say that they made sure to cover up an incident regarding the Morphosis disease. Apparently, I don't like the way the government already knew about this virus, and I just want to find out what they know about it. If they made this disease in the first place...\" Dr. Kane stopped mid-sentence, not wanting to talk any further. Varieo decided to stay quiet for the rest of the trip.</span></div></div>",

They cautiously approached her, several of them seemed to have needles in their hand. The man in the front spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny stood up. She easily towered over the man by a good few feet. \"Warm and...strong.\" She flexed. \"What happened to me? And who are you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are scientists for Myaiu Research, Ms. Kaida. You caught an extremely dangerous and contagious disease known as Morphosis. It enters your body on contact with your skin, and stimulates calories. These calories then creates a massive amount of surplus fat which overall makes your body grow to these proportions. There are also animal chromosomes in the sickness causing it to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny was completely lost though, and it showed to the scientist who tried to make it simple for her. \"Um...Basically it's a disease that turned you into a giant fat animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well, how odd. I'd like to be turned back to normal then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem Ms. Kaida. There presently is no cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? I can't stay like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. That's why we're keeping you here and working around the clock to find a solution! Why, in just a few years, with your help, we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A FEW YEARS!? But I have a life to get back to! I can't stay here for a few years!\" She began to glare angrily down at the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now miss, don't get violent. This is a secure facility. And the men behind me are trained to inject tranquilizer into yo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't get to finish. By a rare stroke of quick thinking, Renny had spun around on her massive feet and clobbered the group of men with her giant tail. All five of them went crashing into the wall leaving Kenny completely shocked at her new found strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! I didn't think I hit them that hard! Are you okay mister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were completely knocked out; birds were spinning around their heads. Normally, she would have gone over to see if they were alright but she recalled what the man had said about the disease spreading on contact. It would be best to leave them alone. Thankfully, they had left the door behind them open allowing Renny to escape into the hall. It was like a white medical hospital but by luck it was completely void of people. This would allows Renny time to adjust to her new form a bit. Walking was a difficult task with gigantic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I'll hop! Kangaroo's are good hoppers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire hallway shook under the weight of her body, but she was able to go much faster.

They said the disease was called Morpho-something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Morpho...Morphophila...Hey! I discovered something! Morphosis!

It should be ready in about 62.34 seconds.\" She snatched her trusty flash drive she kept around her neck and plugged it into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny was on edge. She could have sworn she heard approaching footsteps coming down the hall. No doubt people would notice the group of scientists were missing. She tapped her big feet on the ground impatiently. A window on the computer popped up \"File Download Complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All preparations are complete Ren-\" Said Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!\" A man in a suit similar to the scientists aimed a gun at the pair. \"You girl! You're under arrest! And you, kangaroo! Don't move-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny's body seemed to move on it's own. Before she could even think, her huge kangaroo foot was placed firmly in the face of the armed man. He was sent flying backwards, crashing in the hallway's wall. More footsteps were heard by Renny, armed guards were coming to detain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore! Hop in! We need to get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly concurred, grabbed the drive and jumped into Renny's pouch. When she was firmly in place, Renny sky rocketed out of the room into a hall filled with gun wielding soldiers. All of whom began to fire at the kangaroo girl. Renny reacted naturally again, ripping off a metal plate from the wall and using it as a shield. Aerore suggested something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renny, use ricochet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is ricko-shay??!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just jump and bounce off the walls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny grunted and crouched real low, building up the power to bounce. Aiming at the wall, she unleashed the power in her legs and began to bounce around the hall like a pinball. From the speed and weight, the entire hallway cracked. The guards were unable to aim and fire at the high speed mass of fur, Renny was able to hit most of them while bouncing. She landed with a jolt and continued hopping for the exit, bullets flew past her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore! Get down!\" She was about to burst through the glass door. When she was sure Aerore had ducked within the pouch, she kicked down the door. The glass harmlessly bounced off of her, keeping Aerore safe from harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in what appeared to big a large lobby. Several people working there cowered in fear at the sight of the giant kangaroo who had blasted through the door. Aerore peaked her head out of the pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way did you come in?\"  Asked Renny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I entered this facility through that entrance.\" She pointed at the main doorway which lead into a parking lot. They were apparently in a hospital out in the middle of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" The sounds of sirens in the distance meant it was time to go. \"Hang on! We're heading home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later in a dark office, a bald man finished showing a young dark haired businessman the video of Renny breaking out of the research center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's all the footage we have sir...We have no idea where they went.\" Said the bald man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businessman stroked his chin. \"Did the researchers manage to persevere any belongings of the two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. Some tattered clothing belonging to the kangaroo girl. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Good. After seeing what a mere high schooler can do with the power of Morphosis, I can't wait to see what effect it has on a trained soldier. We'll combat Cashlin with our own army of super humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! You can't be serious! If the government finds out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they won't find out, will they? Tell them we were able to terminate the infected girl, I doubt they'll cause us any trouble. After that, find some suitable volunteers. And Floydman, if you fail me then I'll make sure you're the first to receive the disease. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes sir...\"</span></div></div>",

Her parents owned a relatively big three story house on the outskirts of town. Her room overlooked an empty, grassy plain. It wasn't the 19 year old mutant's ideal home, but it was still nice nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Renny and Aerore arrived they entered the house through a backdoor that her parents always left open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had forgotten her key on many occasions, even when her parents were gone on business trips (as they were now) and had stressed how important that it was that she remember her key. The result was weeks of her spending her nights with her four friends, which her parents disapproved of, causing them to always leave an entrance as a precaution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Renny's favorite things to do was stargaze while listening to music on her MP3 player, but looking at the far off white lights in the sable sky while humming along to pop songs hadn't helped her mood very much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, this isn't the best way to start off summer, but at least I'm free.' she thought, trying to cheer herself up. Renny sighed and closed her window, and afterwards she cut off her music device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to get bored and decided to watch television. The program that was on was a skateboarding competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Just what I needed!\" Renny exclaimed as she sat on her bed, which groaned due to her extra weight. This was another thing to add to her list of 'Reasons-why-this-is the-suckiest-summer-ever': Turning into a furry blimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, at least this show's good.\" Renny watched the TV attentively, when the skater on the screen preformed some pretty sweet moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the girl's stomach began to rumble, she hadn't eaten all day. Aerore had gone out to grab some food and new clothes an hour ago, so she'd be back soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope she hasn't changed yet...' Renny thought. Just then there was a knock.

She hadn't sprouted any hair yet but her nose was black and bulbous, sticking out a good foot from her face with her mouth. Her ears had moved to the top of her head and had become pointed. Sharp teeth could be seen in her new snout, her fingernails had turned into claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Said Renny stifling her giggling. \"You're a sight for sore eyes. I hope no one saw you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear! The changes didn't commence until I was returning home.\" She handed Renny the new clothing, which still looked tight but was much better than sitting around in shards of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't touch anyone did you? The last thing we need is hundreds of poor people with this disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! What kind of careless neanderthal do you take me for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Sorry.\" She finished pulling up her new sweatpants. They looked like they were concealing a watermelon, which was Renny's massive gut. To make room for her tail, she had ripped a hole in the back. The shirt was a very large T-Shirt, which gave Renny little room to breathe in because of her huge bosom. She also had to rip a hole down the front, exposing plenty of cleavage but allowing her to breath at least. Renny sat down to eat, she was starving. Aerore, however, didn't touch her food. Renny noticed that she was sweating, fur had begun to sprout all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should get some rest. I blacked out when I began changing at school.\" Said the kangaroo girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright...\" She climbed into Renny's bed. \"Ren? What are we going to tell our friends? We can't stay like this forever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl tried to cheer her up. \"Don't worry kiddo. With that information you found at the lab, I'm sure there's something in there about returning to normal.

The house seemed big and lonely again, as usual. She'd probably have to sleep on the couch but she didn't mind. She thanked god for air conditioning, all this fur was not the best thing to have at the start of summer. Sitting down, she turned on the skater show again.

Or did you two go blind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Said Renny as she rubbed her head. \"I hate it when you talk scientifically. I can never understand what you're saying. Anyway, what did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to believe this...But 'Morphosis', the disease we have, was actually a drug created by the government. The project was started to create super humans by multiplying the calories in your body by a vast amount, thus increasing your strength tremendously. They added animal DNA in the mix to further promote the growth but that caused a chain reaction and morphed the drug into an actual transmuted disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...,\" Muttered Renny. \"...Can you say that in English?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore tried her best to simplify it. \"Umm...basically. It started as a drug that created fat and made you use it for more energy and strength. Then they added animal genes to it, now it's a disease that does this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that explains why I was able to take out all those guys with guns when escaping that research place...That reminds Aerore. What the heck were you doing there anyway? How did you know where to find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who me? Well...My father works as a scientist for the government, right? He told me that he was treating you for the disease when I got home from school today. So I decided to visit you. I guess I got dragged into this mess huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment.\" Said Avariella. \"If it's contagious, aren't I in danger being around you two? The last thing I need is to end up big and fat before summer sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be safe so long as you don't touch Renny or me. The disease only spreads on direct skin to skin contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny suddenly remembered that woman she had ran into just before school. \"Aerore. Did the research say anything about returning to normal? I think the person I got it from looked just like a normal person, not an animal. There's gotta be some way to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is...but according to the notes only one test subject was able to successfully revert to human form again. She was named Cashlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we just need to go find this Cashlin person, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it were that simple. But the government terminated the entire project and eliminated all test subjects for good measure. Nothing was ever heard from the research again after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't stop Renny. \"Then we'll just have to find out how to get back to normal ourselves then, right Aerore? With your brains, we should be able to figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore laughed nervously. \"Well, I admire your enthusiasm at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are still forgetting the biggest problem.\" Said Avariella. \"How in the world are you going to get around like that?

It's out of the city and no one comes here anymore. Besides you're a tomboy right? I thought you liked sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie's swing nearly hit Renny, she ducked to narrowly miss it. \"Am I a tomboy? Yes. Do I hate sports? Yes again. Why do I have to like sports?

You're the only one out of our group who likes them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you did sports you won't be overweight like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny was tempted to flattened her. \"Hello? I have a disease that you're going to have soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie didn't seem to hear her though and continued talking. Aerore thankfully came into the room with news on Varieo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's completely knocked out though. There's a massive bruise on his head, probably from where he hit you. The strangest thing is though, he seems to have a huge nosebleed that doesn't appear to be stopping. Keeps muttering something like 'I'm in heaven' or other.\" Renny blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be alright though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. According to my calculations, he should be up in less than an hour. In fact-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was groaning heard in the other room. The girls had turned to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could wake up now!\" Finished Aerore, she started running to see him but was grabbed by the collar by Renny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, cool it wolf-girl. What do you think you're doing going in there like that? You trying to give him a heart attack? Let Avariella see him and prep him so he doesn't completely lose his mind when we go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good point Renny! Varie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe athlete smirked and put the bat over her shoulders. She walked in and the two giant animal girls huddled around the doorway to eavesdrop. The dark skinned boy was sitting up in the make-shift bed of a couch snapped in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Varieo! How ya feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Varieo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerore!\" Called Avariella. \"Does the disease make people stupider or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"No Varie. This is quite the predicament. I think Varieo has amnesia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I guess there's no harm in letting him see us then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the room one at a time. But Varieo didn't even bat an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these guys like mascots or something? Where's the baseball game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny turned to Aerore. \"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, based on the books I've read from my father...We just need to wait until his memories return. And depending on the damage it could be hours...or months.\" At least he hit someplace soft, Renny thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do tubby and blubby?\" Asked Avariella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

We're going back to town for a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny had Varieo in her pouch again as the group walked along under the cover of darkness. Aerore had called her parents a head of time and told them to expect a visit and to not be 'surprised'. Needless to say, Aerore was not exactly thrilled to be seeing her parents as an overweight wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must we really go see them? I mean- they're probably very busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be such a wuss,\" Said Averiella as she walked along with you. \"They said they'd do it.

Aerore's home, which was very futuristic complete with solar panels and self watering yard, stood in front of them. The lights were on in the living room. Aerore gave a huge sigh, reluctant to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now come on kiddo. Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents took it surprisingly well. Only her mother fainted, and she only did so once. Her father seemed more interested in asking her questions, being the scientist that he was. They all looked alike, white hair and glasses. Her father looked almost like Albert Einstein actually. He had Aerore sitting down on the couch and was examining her with a stethoscope, of course he was wearing gloves to avoid infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all four of you got infected you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Tiombe. Do you know anything about the disease at all?\" Said Renny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, only very little. It's not something openly discussed at work. Technically it's supposed to be top secret. In fact, I'm surprised you all haven't been found by the government yet. Now, let me take a look at Varieo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore got up and let the dark skinned boy take her place. He still seemed confused at where he was, but didn't seem too worried. Averiella was being to look pale, and started to sweat profusely. Renny gave her a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay, Varie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea...just sick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt the same way when I was about to transform.\" Said Aerore. \"Go to my room and use the bed. You just need some rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and turned for the upstairs. She looked slightly chubbier, the process was beginning. Renny grinned at Aerore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what animal she'll be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably a pig, considering the way she eats.\" Giggled the wolf girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore's father felt Varieo's forehead.

Varie! You completely exposed the sanctity of my bedroom to the filth and contamination of the outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, isn't it cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny walked over to the gaping hole and put her hand to her brow to see where Picasso had landed. Avariella had knocked him so far a way that she couldn't even see him. A lot like what happened to Team Rocket at the end of every Pokemon episode. \"Wow, you really pounded him like a baseball! I can't even tell where he landed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I didn't even get a good shot at him!\" She looked around the room and spotted Aerore's ball-shaped trophy for student of the year. \"Hey Aerore! Can I see what happens if I hit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf-girl quickly grabbed her prized possession. \"Absolutely not! Besides shouldn't we be concerning ourselves with that turtle-man!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't worry about him Aerore.\" Answered Renny. \"I mean, how often can you get up from getting beamed like that from a baseball bat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I should really try out for baseball this summer...\" Said Varie as she flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe television showed a middle aged woman with soft brown hair and fancy suit,. She had a small stack of papers on the desk in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Eyewitness News Myaiu Channel Five. This just in. It appears a...giant turtle was launched through a main street building. Police say no one was injured and the creature is currently unconscious according to federal agents. Nonetheless, this may be related to the outbreak of the deadly virus known as Morphosis in a local public school. Police have the entire area closed off. We go live to Jonathan Buck down at the lines. Jonathan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictured swapped to a young man with glasses and gelled hair. He had a microphone in his hand and appeared to be standing in front of several police cars. Behind that was a brick red building with a hole between two windows. A police helicopter whizzed by overhead. Jonathan cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you Susan. As you said, police have already closed this area off and are preventing any unauthorized onlookers from entering. Even the men inside have to wear protective armor and radiation suits. If this is in fact an example of the disease known as Morphosis, the city may face a severe problem. All residents in the building have been quarantined in a research center where scientists are determining if they have been infected or not. They're now bringing in an armored van to transport the body of this giant...thing to escort it to a secure fac- Wait. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen fuzzed out slightly and the shot returned to Susan looking concerned. \"Jonathan is everything alright on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother change in scene showed that whoever was holding the camera was running with Jonathan struggling to keep up. Police officers were trying to push the crowd of people a way from the building. \"Susan!? Apparently, the creature has awoken and took out all federal agents on the floor! They're telling us to flee the area and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a huge explosion from the building, a large shell flew into the air like a bullet and landed on a nearby rooftop. The circling helicopters through a spot light on the turtle man and he quickly dove off to try and lose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this! Did you get that!? Tell me you got that!\" Yelled Jonathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan was becoming increasingly worried. \"Jonathan? What's going on over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! The television cracked in half. The TV remote has been thrown clear through it. On the other end of the room it was in sat a some what large, black haired woman. She had an angry look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you test me Picasso!? Now with those policemen you won't be able to get that kid! Stop fooling around with those brats before I get angry and break you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at Aerore's residence...</span></div></div>",

She smiled as the pudgy Ms. Cashlin, the new teacher, who, while obviously smart, seemed a bit TOO anxious to please the class, turned her head, her white cheek creasing into a double chin.  Quickly she reached over the table for a second cookie, and snatched it.  Quickly she wolfed it down.  It wasn't, to her, \"sneaking\" a cookie at all--there really was nothing dishonest about it--it was just \"cute.\"  Others in the class laughed at her as she chewed and swallowed the cookie very quickly.  Ms. Cashlin heard the class's laughter, and looked at the girl, briefly.  There seemed to be a gleam of displeasure in her eye, but she could hardly call Varie on it.  Varie was young and beautiful--that perfect combination of cute, hot and athletic, and Cashlin, being older (no matter how she disguised it with dark make-up), was a bit of a blob.  It wouldn't do for an overweight teacher to scold a star athlete for taking another cookie.  How many cookies had Cashlin herself already eaten before coming to class?  She had to know everyone in the class would be wondering that if she were to so much as shoot Varie a reproving glance.  Varie relished the lingering taste of the chocolate as the thing slid down her throat.  Cashlin looked like she was about to say something, but wisely held her tongue, and got on with the lesson.  And that, Varie thought, was the last she would hear on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the bell rang, Varie felt her teacher's pudgy hand resting on her shoulder.  \"Varie, I need to see you after class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie played the part of the dumb, ponytailed blonde.  \"What is it, Cash--uh, Miss Cashlin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashlin walked behind her and shut the door.  Then--to Varie's surprise--locked it.  She began to feel a little anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like my cookies today, Varie?\"  began Cashlin.  Varie decided to beat her to the punch.  How neurotic, to be angry about an extra cookie, she thought.  This teacher was a real control freak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked them a LOT,\" answered Varie.  \"In fact, I liked them so much, I had two.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashlin laughed, and brushed her black hair from her face.  \"Well, you get points for being honest,\" she said.  \"But you know better than to steal.  I really have a thing about stealing, whether cookies or recipes or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh please, thought Varie.  She's just mad because there's one less extra cookie there to stretch that black skirt of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we done now?\" asked Varie.  \"I need to get to practice!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be done when you've learned not to take things that don't belong to you!\" snapped Cashlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie wasn't afraid now.  She was angry.  It made her afraid when she knew she was in the wrong--but this teacher was crazy and miserable, and she was taking it out on her!  \"You fat old miserable pig!\" she yelled back.  \"You talk about 'greedy,' but you only wanted to be able to gorge yourself on one more cookie.  Unlock this door and let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of erupting with rage (as Varie expected), Cashlin laughed.  \"So I'm a pig, am I?  And miserable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie nodded uncertainly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, Varie, there might be something to that.\"  She reached in her pocket and pulled out a strange device.  \"But misery loves company.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightning speed, Cashlin put Varie (athletic though she was) in an armlock.  Pulling up Varie's Varsity shirt, she held the device against her toned abs.  \"Hold still.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the\"--began Varie--then--\"Ooowww!\"  The device contained a hidden needle that injected Varie with..something...right on her stomach, which she instinctively placed a hand over.  She could feel the toned abs against her hand, but she couldn't feel her hand.  Her stomach was numb, and the numbness began to radiate out toward her chest, head, arms and legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\"  She managed to stutter, as she fell to the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The numbness will pass,\" said Cashlin.  \"And I've just made a first recruit.  Here, have another cookie.  It'll help.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it,\" said Varie.  \"HELP!\"  she shouted, realizing she couldn't get out.  Heeeeelllll--mmmfff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie's cry was interrupted by 200 calories of chocolatey goodness.  She began to spit it out, back at Cashlin, but then she realized how good it tasted.  Even better than before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like that, you little piggy?\" asked Cashlin.  \"Do you like how good that cookie feels in your gullet?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie knew she was being called a pig by a fat woman, but somehow she didn't care.  The cookie really was amazing.  Then, she realized, she felt an odd pressure about her midsection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, and to her horror, she saw her sweatpants beginning to ride over a surplus of pink flesh.  \"I\"--she began--then to her FURTHER horror, overcome with emotion--she snorted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--oink--is--oink-oink--hap-hap-grunt--happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she snorted, she began to fall on her hands and knees.  She felt her belly--yes, it was a belly by now--hang down, together with her ripening boobs, and--what was this--two other strange globes of fat beginning to form like fruit underneath her.  Handling them, she realized they were an extra set of breasts.  She felt her face with her hands, and realized she was developing a double chin--but what was worse, her nose had widened to twice its size.  Her ears were getting floppy and pointed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once proud athlete stood as best she could on--well, she could only call them haunches now--and tried to waddle out of the room, sending Cashlin into a laughing fit.  \"What-oink-are you-oink-DOING-oink-oink-grunt--to me?\" Varie screamed as best she could and ran falteringly--sometimes on haunches, sometimes on her hands (which now only possessed three fingers each) to the door.  </span></div></div>",

Thank God,\" she grunted, feeling no pig nose or ears, and no additional flab or extra breasts.  It was one of those dreams that, no matter how ridiculous, FELT so real that waking up and realizing none of it was real was actually pleasurable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How completely bizarre,\" Varie thought, as she washed her face, staring at the toned young goddess in the mirror with a new gratitude.  She didn't notice her flaws (one eye SLIGHTLY larger, a birthmark on her cheek, occasional acne) this morning like she usually did.  It was a great way to start her 12th grade year.  Her blonde hair streamed from her temples, wavy and bleached a slightly brighter color than was natural; her lips were full, her nose, delicate, her eyes adequately-lidded without being droopy.  And her body, while still lean and muscular, had become slightly more womanly over the summer.  She may not have been perfect, but thank God--thank God she was not a pig-woman.  She laughed as she thought of it, and pushing her nose up, said \"oink-oink\" to the mirror.  The rest of the dream quickly faded from consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys, old friends, old coaches, new books, new binders, new lockers, the smell of disinfected halls...it all had a way of playing with most students' nerves.  But for Varie, as well as for the other seniors, nothing seemed too intimidating.  It figured, she thought...just as you started to get used to a place..really make it your own, you realize it's the last go-round.  She was excited--she, the consummate jock-and-cheerleader rolled into one, was excited--about some of her classes.  Earth Science seemed easy (and surprisingly interesting), and the new English teacher, Mr. Bailer, was young and hip and dreamy (to use slang current fifty years ago),  Not only that, but now--NOW--she was about to head to the most exciting class of all:  Study Hall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had had one study hall before, and she remembered how much fun it had been.  This year, she had TWO.  Not only that, but she and Penelope, her best friend, had coordinated their schedules so that they had this study hall together.  After hugging, and before \"class\" began, the two girls started to catch up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I worked on my uncle's farm for a while, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out.  I didn't even realize ordinary people OWNED farms anymore.  I thought it was all businesses these days...y'know...cooping chickens up on top of each other and stuff.  I read about it in this book called \"Why King Corn and Big Business is Evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he is definitely a real farmer--I've got the tan lines to prove it he specializes in certain crops like soy and barley.  No cows or pigs or anything like--Varie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigosh, Pen--I had the WEIRDEST dream last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" said her friend, a bit annoyed at being derailed like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was the first day of school, and I was wearing RUNNING clothes, and there was this really creepy teacher, who was all...oh...shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Varie?\" asked Penelope, noticing her friend's face had gone white.  She was staring toward the front of the room where the teacher was beginning to introduce herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod!\" whispered Varie.  \"That's HER...the creepy woman from my dream!  That's Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...my name is Miss Biltennen,\" continued the young woman up front, addressing the class.  She smiled pleasantly.  Everything about her, in fact, SEEMED pleasant, other than the fact that her makeup was a tad too dark for her pale skin.  She eyed the two whispering girls in the back corner for a moment, then rolled her eyes as if to say, 'Teen-age girls--is there any situation they can't manufacture drama from?'  \"I am, as I'm sure you've figured out, a teacher, and I NEED this period to plan classes.  I'm not planning on treating any of you like babies, so by all means, communicate, as long as you don't distract me or other students from their work.  I think we'll get along quite well.\"  There was general eye-rolling from most of the girls, who tended to take an instant dislike to most young, pretty teachers (pleasingly plump or not) who seemed to be hard-asses.  The guys, of course, generally approved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie did not approve.  Even after she'd settled down, and began to text Penelope next to her, she felt really weird about Miss Biltennen.  True, her name was different, and she was a study hall teacher rather than a Home Ec teacher, but...weird.  Was she merely, she wondered, projecting Biltennen's face backwards onto Cashlin's?  What in the world was wrong with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed, more or less, without incident (though not, perhaps, from the perspective of a popular teenage girl--gossip, boys, sports, mini-reunions of all kinds).  Varie forgot her dream and Miss Cashlin/Biltennen.  She lay down on her bed, exhausted, head brimming with new plans and burgeoning pre-college obsessions.  This was going to be a great year.  She drifted slowly, slowly...and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her dream of a normal life, of being beautiful or athletic or anything else melted away as the cold, muddy water she had been splashed with ran over her snout and down the creases of her new jowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pigg-ee!\" squawked a voice. \"Food time!\" A second splash of water drenched her sizeable hindparts and made her shudder in the cool autumn morning air.  She squealed again in shock and mortification as she realized she was naked, and tried to stand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe task proved too difficult, and she fell, face-first in the mud. The girl was mostly pig by now. With great difficulty, she managed to feel her undersides with her two-fingered hand.  There were six breasts there, but it was hard to distinguish them from the rest of the flab that hung from her belly now.  She couldn't feel her face, but she was sure it was similarly transformed--the muddy water cascaded from her snout over several chins.  At least she could still see her wavy, blonde hair, though it looked brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back to Myaiu,\" the voice said. \"I hope you had a nice sleep.\" It was a man's voice--she had at first expected Cashlin.  She looked up, with difficulty, and saw her Bloono there, holding the empty bucket of water.  He was nearly as dirty as she was, as they were in a pig pen of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloono!  What are you doing here?  Did Cashlin get you too? she thought, but only managed, \"Snort, snort, grunt, Bloo snort!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloono approached her and patted her hair.  \"This must be a shock to you.  Here, you'll recover a bit once you've had some food, and then I'll explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie felt hope for the first time since she had awoken.  If Bloono was here--if there were things to be explained--then perhaps the transformation could be reversed.  She grunted in assent--she was rather hungry--and trotted on hands and feet in the direction Bloono had indicated(her legs were only slightly longer now than her arms, which caused her enormous backside and curly tail to stick up higher than her head).  What she saw before her was not the sumptuous breakfast she had imagined, but a trough of slop, filled with garbage and complete with horseflies buzzing around it.  She turned to Bloono, and tried to say, \"You honestly expect me to eat THAT?\" but what came out was \"Weeee-ohhh-eeeegrooo.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's not exactly human food,\" said Bloono, \"but let's face it, you're not exactly human anymore.  Just try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie refused to go nearer to the stuff, managing to turn her head to the side in disdain...but not before her wonderful new nose picked up the scent.  Her stomach rumbled and she began to drool uncontrollably.  Before she knew what she was doing, her face was buried in the slop, and she was gobbling it down as though it was the most delicious thing she'd ever eaten.  After a time, she felt Bloono pat her on her elevated rump.<br>\r\n\"That's a good piggy,\" he said.  The tone of his voice had changed.  \"But you need to leave some for the other hogs.\"  He snickered.  \"You know, when the two of us were going to school together, you never would have so much as LOOKED at a big guy like me--much less let me pat your head or your ass.  But who's the porker now?\"  Bloono ran his fingers across two of Varie's breasts.  They were still fatty and globular enough--human-looking enough--for this to be indecent.  Varie at first squealed because it tickled, and then angrily tried to defend herself the only way she knew how--by biting his hand.  Bloono withdrew it immediately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little sow!\" he yelled, kicking her in her ample side.  \"Don't think for a moment I--or any human would--even consider TOUCHING you now!  Here's what's going to happen.  Miss Cashlin has me keeping this farm for her.  She owns a great deal of property out here, where she employs a lot of your classmates (many of whom don't at all mind seeing you get what's been coming to you for a long time).  You'll be sorry for biting the hand that fed--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Bloono?\" asked a pleasant voice behind him.  Though Varie's vision was dimmer than it had been, she could still see enough to confirm her ears and nose's report that this was, indeed, Miss Cashlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this little pig classmate of mine tried to bite me AFTER I fed her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true, Varie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeee *snort*!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad piggy,\" she said, nicely, stroking Varie's blonde hair and scratching her pink back.  \"I can't blame you, though--I imagine you're pretty confused about what's going on.  I'll fill you in soon enough, but for now...enjoy the \"simple life.\"  I'll be around if you need me.  Cashlin patted the horrified pig-woman's buttocks and walked out of the pen.  \"Bloono, make sure this porker with all her...equipment...isn't a waste of space--use her either to get me some fat-backed bacon, or some new pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" Bloono said.  \"Come with me, piggy.\"  Bloono pinched Varie--hard--on the backside, and sent her squealing into an adjacent pen. Varie, horrified, watched as Bloono opened a small door from outside the pen, and three hairy hogs--humongous with sharp teeth and fearsome calls--began to approach and fight over her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every boy in class wanted you, and you didn't even look in my direction, though I loved you more than all of them.  Well now, like before, you have your pick of male chauvinist pigs.\"  Varie trotted--sometimes on her hind legs, her six pendulous boobs swaying ridiculously, sometimes on all four \"legs,\" to the corner of the mating stall and watched the competition.  The largest boar, of course, intimidated the others and began to approach her.  An all-too-human scream escaped from her still-full lips as he tried to mount her from behind.

She rolled in the dirt to try to clean herself off, and reflected, as she tried to feel the things she felt she needed to feel--that if she ever got out of this situation, she would campaign for female animal rights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a hand on her head, scratching her blonde hair, between pointed, moderately floppy ears.  \"Did my pig have a nice romp in the hay with her gentleman callers?\" asked Cashlin.  Varie didn't have the strength to try to bite or charge the woman.  She simply tried to express her outrage in a loud grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness!\" said Cashlin, without a trace of malice in her voice.  \"Goodness!  It sounds like you certainly did!  It occurred to me that your otherwise happy, simple existence as...heh...MY pig...might be somewhat troubled by the fact you don't quite understand what's going on.  So let me fill you in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all exist in more than one reality,\" she said, adopting a teacher's voice.  \"This allows us to be many different things at the same time.  For example, here on Myaiu, you are, apparently, a pig--or something very like one.  But what happens when you go to sleep?  You drift right on over to another reality--one that calls THIS world the \"spirit-world,\" or \"dream-world,\" or what-have-you.  The people in that reality seem to think that Myaiu is not \"real,\" just as most people in Myaiu, when they go to sleep, tend to disbelieve the reality of what people call \"Earth.\"  But let me assure you, both are very real places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So in this version of reality, you are a pig, but you'll notice, you're still partly woman as well.  Now THIS is highly unusual, because the virus I injected into you was meant to turn you COMPLETELY into a pig--but to a great extent, you're retaining the part of your humanity that exists within your \"Earth\" self.  There are a number of other similarities arising between the two worlds, which means that something is pulling our two worlds--the world of Myaiu and the world of \"Earth,\" or whatever you want to call it--together.  Your \"self\" in this world is holding onto morphological characteristics occurring in the other world.  I'm sorry if that's confusing to your pig brain!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit confusing, but, she thought--that meant she could at least forget about the nightmare that was Myaiu, when she was awake, right?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief to you, is it?\" asked Cashlin.  \"I'm glad.  But here's the bad news (I mean, bad for you): your keeping woman characteristics in THIS reality is a two-way street.  In other words, you may even begin to revert to an ordinary girl (though not if my viral injections can help it) in Myaiu, but that also means that on \"Earth,\" you will become more and more pig-like. By infecting people HERE with this virus, I conquer not only THIS world, but the next!  Anyway, I'm sure you're bored by now.  Why don't you go back to rolling in the mud, like a good piggy, and I'll go back to masterminding an interdimensional takeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay, grunting, feeling sure that even now her pig-womb was teeming with abominations.  Emotions like horror and sadness have a limit, and anyway, are not adequate to some situations.  She felt numb instead, and fell, exhausted, to sleep.</span></div></div>",

In fact she had to look like a mental patient right now by the position she was standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing and laughing nervously, she slowly lowered her arms. \"S-sorry Bloono...I...uh...I thought you were someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe narrowed his eyes a little. \"Uh huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie tried to change the subject. \"Uh...I was just heading to the cafeteria to meet with Penelope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, actually I was supposed to give you something. I didn't mean to sneak up on you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloono reached into his pocket and pulled out something in his one giant hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a...</span></div></div>",

If he was hiding anything from his friend, he was hiding it well.  \"She\" said she downloaded the files...hey, are you okay?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie wasn't okay.  The shock of seeing Bloono--and seeing him with the files she'd taken from Cashlin's or Biltennen's or whoever's computer--had caused her to grow very pale, and then flushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...feel so good...\"  The girl was now extremely red, and would have been in a cold sweat, except--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--as she sat down, wringing her hands, she realized it--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not sweaty.  Not clammy, despite feeling chilled.  There was not, in fact, an ounce of moisture on her skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloono leaned over her.  \"Varie.  Varie!  Are you okay?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chill had passed, and the blonde suddenly felt heat building up under her reddening skin.  \"No...'s'fine, Bloono...I'm juss...really hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look fine,\" said Bloono, reasoning that if his friend had been over-hot, her hair or skin would have dampened by now.  \"Do you need to rest, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was suddenly unbearable.  \"Yes,\" panted Varie.  Her breath seemed to almost singe the outside of her skin as she panted, and--without warning and as if on instinct--she spread herself on the cool tiled floor.  It was amazing--as refreshing as a drink of water.  Jono ran to get the school nurse, and as he did, an alarming thought occurred to Varie which caused her to panic all over again, holding the USB disk even more tightly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPigs don't sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She bolted upwards in fear, thinking that her Earth body had become like her Myaiu form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around to see herself in a pit of mud, the familiar trough and fence posts of the other world around her, not to mention the foul stench of unwashed animals her heightened sense of smell picked up. She was definitely on Cashlin's farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up as best she could, noticing her hair was fuller than before, as well as the fact that she was standing taller than normal. Her hooves now seemed to resemble her hands, but they were still barely usuable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and noticed that the farm hands (some of which were various students at her school) were just going about their business, ignoring her. Around her were several \"other\" sows. The boars were mercifully in another pen, while she took a look at her surroundings her stomach began to rumble. She tried to sigh, but it came out as an embarassing grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, I'm in Porky Pig Hell and now I'm starving.' She thought, when she saw someone, a girl, filling the trough with slop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeding time piggies!\" the girl said before leaving, her eyes staying on varie for only a couple seconds. Varie couldn't see her very well, but she ran off quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Varie could even begin to feel disgust, she was jostled and bumped by several of the hogs around her, greedily gulping the muck and splattering her with mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the altheltic mutant saw was the curly tailed creature stuffing themselves. Varie couldn\u2019t bring herself to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, the sensation was unbearable and Varie couldn\u2019t help but walk towards the trough clumsily, but when she leaned down to see the food, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Varie tried to sleep, somewhat thankful that Cashlin, and Bloono (or was it this world\u2019s Bloono?) had not appeared. Yet rest would not come to her, a couple hours later the workers had gone in for dinner, the scent of food wafting towards her poor nose, making her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she smelled something, a roll, some green beans, and a side of Mashed potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might want this.\u201d a voice said, it was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His tone would have been kind if she had not been one of his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first instinct was to bite his hand, again.  But she was thinking a little more clearly now than last time, and anyway, that food smelled better than food had ever smelled to her when she was human.  She grunted at him insistently, and at one point, her once-full lips managed, \"Bloon--oink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!  A certain fat little piggy is sure excited about MY food!\" he retorted, snatching the plate from under her nose, and stuffing the roll in his mouth.  She attempted to look at him insolently, but she _was_, she realized, drooling.  He looked thoughtful, for a moment.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough of her snout had now reverted to human face to create two chubby cheeks, and he grabbed one, looking directly in her small eyes.  \"Hmm...refusing the food that the other pigs are happy enough with, as though YOU think you're better than them...almost saying my name....why, if I didn't know better, I'd say Cashlin's drug was wearing off...I'd better run and get the boss-lady,\" he chuckled.  Wouldn't want her prize sow developing thumbs and smarts again, then trotting off into the wild!\"  As he said it, Varie began to realize her forefeet WERE, in fact, beginning to separate into fingers again.  It was now or never, she suddenly realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But JUST to make sure ya don't go, lardy-pie\"--and here, Bloono stroked one of Varie's blubbery (and increasingly human) flanks--\"I'm gonna leave the rest of this plate for you to gobble up.  Don't say I never did anything for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another cruel laugh, Bloono threw the plate of potatoes and greens to the other side of the pen, closed the gate, and ran toward (Varie was beginning to make it out) the farmhouse.  It was her one chance.  But she felt so weak, and that food, even if she had to lick it off the ground, would be SO good.  It was decision time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Varie: </span></div></div>",

Then she moved on to the potatoes, they weren't as good as expected, but she ate them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her fierce hunger was sated, Varie realized that many minutes had passed, and that Bloono could be back with Cashlin any second. Frantically she tried her best to flee. As she did, she wondered about what would happen if she received another injection of the strange serum that made her into this freak. In all honesty she knew that she probably wouldn't make it. Internally, she cursed her stupid hunger, she cursed this world's Bloono, and she cursed that fat bitch Cashlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to exit the pen, still angry and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

This calls for a <i>special</i> punishment. Bring her into the feeding pens!\" Cashlin laughed as Bloono dragged Varie into a bigger, more crowded pig pen that had strange machines along the walls, with aisles along the middle. It was a warehouse like pen that had all males in it, all with huge bodies and stomachs full of food. Varie also noticed that all of the pigs were hooked up to the machines, and were feeding from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she realized her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, all of these pigs haven't seen a female in quite some time and are all dying to reproduce\" Bloono said with a smile, \"I imagine that you'll have quite a fun time with all of them as you yourself eat to your heart's content\u2026and more.\" He laughed and hooked her up to one of the larger machines ad placed her mouth on a strange tube. The machine started up, and Varie felt the food begin to enter her mouth. Suddenly, her pig senses went into overdrive and she began to suck on the tube hungrily. The food seemed to only become better and better tasting as Varie continued to suck on the tube and squeal with involuntary glee. Out of corner of her eye, she noticed the other giant, hugely obese pigs begin to notice her expanding body with interest. The two pigs next to her suddenly stopped feeding and came up behind her. She felt foreign liquids flow through her from behind as she turned her head and saw all of the other pigs start to come up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarie closed her eyes and sucks on the feeding tube, in a desperate attempt to escape everything happening to her, as all of the male pigs have their way with her still fattening body. Strangely enough, for each male that ejected a load of sperm into Varie's body, she squealed in happiness and pleasure, like she loved what she was doing and wanted even more. When they were done, Bloono came in and attached the pigs back to their feeding tubes, while glancing over at Varie's huge body, visibly attracted to it. She looked at him in slight disgust, but her pig brain told her to ignore him and focus on the yummy food. Bloono came over to her, rubbing her fat rolls and caressing her huge ass. Varie tried to stop him, but she couldn't stop eating...and eating...and eating...Soon that's all she cared about as Bloono also had his way with her fattening body, only in a more rough and deeper penetration than the pigs did, although it was <i>waaay</i> more pleasurable and satisfying according to her pig mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut according to Varie the human's mind, however small it was in control of her body, she was appalled and outraged at how she was being treated. Desperately, she forced herself to close her eyes and calm her breathing down, to fake her pig mind that she was asleep, while she thought of a plan of possible, hopeless escape.....</span></div></div>",

It is a large island not much different from the real world, modern technology rules the land while people go along with their daily lives. However, it is in this land that something horrible would go wrong. A plague is upon it's people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began with scientists, obsessed with creating a powerful drug to tap into the endless potential of the human body. The drug, called Morphosis, generated high amounts of calories in the human body creating excess fat. Those affected with the drug were able to call upon the calories for massive amounts of surplus energy, essentially creating super human strength. However, the head developer of the project was not satisfied with the results and decided to add animal DNA to the drug. The results proved to be too dangerous and the scientists were ordered to execute all test subjects. On the night when they were meant to do this, there was a giant explosion from the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one from the research team was ever heard from again, the laboratory they worked in was laid to waste. However, from the ruins of the research rose a powerful female by the name of Cashlin. She possessed the powers of the drug and worse, was able to infect others with the same powers like a sickness. Creating a small army, she challenged the government with war. A war unknown to Myaiu's people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, five students from a local school go about their daily lives. Blissfully unaware of the approaching storm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerore Tiombe- Female (14). Shy and studious. Has white hair, glasses, and freckles. Loves animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarieo Alick- Male (15). Kind and protective. Dark skinned and thin. Hates cats, but deeply cares for his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloono- Male (17). Black haired and pale skinned. Is very large and aloof. Has a habit of munching on a celery stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenny Kaida- Female (19). Big busted girl who has short brown hair. Tomboyish. Friend of Aerore. Extremely naive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvariella \"Varie\" Suldia- Female (17). Hyper, short athlete. Can't sit still for a moment, and is very talkative. Also naive. Loves candy but never gains weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCashlin- Female(??). Tall, dark, and childish. Cashlin can't stand losing and will often boast whenever winning at anything. Mysterious otherwise, with no known background or history. Immensely powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the serious story stuff is out of the way, enjoy! Keep the plot to that of an adventure. You will follow one of the five student's perspectives throughout the story. Anything goes so long as it makes sense with the Morphosis sickness (Read above for details or mail me with questions.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an animal/anthro TF WG story for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
