His voice reverberating around the police station drew the eyes of every officer currently in the building while simultaneously causing every guest to flinch, as the station itself seemed to shake for a moment. The officers who heard the shout quickly returned to their work, though a few muttered prayers for the little bunny who was about to be chewed out, others casting sympathetic glances to Judy\u2019s cubicle. After his bellow Chief Bogo slowly returned to his desk, by the time his door had slammed shut, he had returned to his desk, pulled his chair out and sat down the sound of skittering paws could be heard just outside. His door slammed open moments after it had closed, Judy Hopps ZPD\u2019s one and only bunny cop stood in the doorway, her fur just the tiniest bit disheveled from her mad dash, the barest hint of sweat glistening on the fur covering her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cYou wanted to see me chief?\u201d Judy stated excitedly, her fluffy pawed feet closing together as she raised her right hand up in a salute, a frown crossing Bogo\u2019s face as he knew the salute wasn\u2019t meant as any sign of respect. He could not discipline Judy for it however as he knew that while he was not on the best of terms with Judy the gesture was completely sincere. Judy\u2019s pivotal role in saving all of Zootopia from the anarchy Bellwether had planned for it helped their relationship grow certainly, as he came to recognize her worth. Her acceptance of his renewed offer to become the face for the ZPD once the Bellwether scandal ended also helped, he simply was not as naturally photogenic as she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cSit,\u201d Bogo growled out indicating the chair before his desk with a small wave of his hand. A small smile crossed his face as he saw Judy confused and a little nervous; despite their more positive relationship, Judy was a bit of a loose cannon and he was responsible for her. Any mistake she made fell on his head so these moments where he could make her squirm a little helped relieve some of the stress he gave her, it was only fair after all. Bogo waited patiently for Judy to leap up into the chair that sat before his desk and get comfortable, looking at her little form eclipsed by the chair, it reminded him that he really needed to get a chair that fit mammals smaller then himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHopps I\u2019ve been getting reports that something has been bothering you as of late. Your performance reports are all top-grade, crime is down in your section of the city, overall no complaints but your behaviour has been reported to be, let\u2019s see here.\u201d Bogo paused long enough to pick up his reading glasses from their place on the large desk, placing the near comically small spectacles on his nose before reading \u201cinattentive, jittery, and staring off into space. Something is bothering you, what\u2019s wrong Judy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The fact that Chief Bogo had addressed her by her first name rather than just Hopps caught Judy by surprise, just as surprising was the legitimate concern underlying Bogo\u2019s question.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong chief, I\u2019ve been having a few too many cups of coffee, that\u2019s all\u201d Judy replied. A small nervous smile parted her lips as her little pink nose twitched back and forth quickly; a single powerful snort from Bogo showed that he was not buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cThis is about Wilde isn\u2019t it?\u201d Bogo stated factually, as he leaned back in his chair, hands resting behind his head. \u201cA fox as the acting officer for Bunnyburrow, it\u2019s your hometown so you have every right to be nervous,\u201d Bogo said calmly expecting the phrasing to get a rise out of the little bunny; he did not need to wait more then a second for Judy\u2019s response. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cWith all due respect sir Nick is as good a cop as any, I trust him completely\u201d Judy replied as she leapt to her paws in the middle of the chair, her voice the closest Bogo had ever heard to angry. \u201cSaying Nick couldn\u2019t be a cop in a-a bunny city because he\u2019s a fox! Chief I\u2019m disappointed in you.\u201d As she continued her tirade Judy exploded off her chair, leaping onto Chief Bogo\u2019s desk she walked closer and closer not caring about the papers and forms she stepped over or kicked out of her way as she talked. She advanced until she was almost nose to nose with the much larger water buffalo. In response, he simply leaned forward slightly letting his natural size as well as his position as her commanding officer do the work for him. As Judy\u2019s anger wore off her ears drooped in shame, her paws quickly moving some papers back as she realized what she had done \u201cI\u2019m sorry chief\u201d Judy whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cWhat do you have to be sorry for? I wish more of my officers were that spirited,\u201d Bogo replied now that he had the room on his desk he leaned forward just enough to rest his elbows on the desk, his eyes focused intently on Judy. \u201cI am worried about you Hopps, you haven\u2019t taken a single vacation day since you first joined, and on top of that it is fairly obvious to anyone in the precinct that losing Nick hasn\u2019t been good for you.\u201d Bogo stated, he was not going to let her wiggle her way out of this, he would find out the problem here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHe\u2019s just in Bunnyburrow it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t just visit him,\u201d Judy tried to argue. Her statement was true; it was not as if Nick had passed on. Besides Nick, she had other friends in the ZPD; it was not as if he was the only one. Cluhauser joked with her on a daily basis, and besides Clauhauser she...she... \u2018she had to be friends with more people than just Nick!\u2019 Bogo watched as Judy thought about her standing in the ZPD. He knew that she was on good terms with nearly every other officer in the precinct but her friendship with Nick in his opinion had impeded both officers from making any other connections. They relied on each other too much, this was their greatest strength and their greatest weakness, that was why he had to split them up, though Judy did not know he was the one who requested Nick\u2019s transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHopps I think it\u2019s time you took a vacation, go visit Nick and your family in your hometown, it\u2019ll do you some good, you can see how well he\u2019s doing then come back and we can see if we can get you working with one of the crime units.\u201d Bogo said, trying to scoot the little rabbit off his desk but she gently pushed his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cI can\u2019t take a vacation Chief, the city needs me! As for being placed in one of the units, I\u2019m doing fine as a beat cop, as you said crimes are down,\u201d Judy replied, her voice filling with conviction as she raised her head to look Chief Bogo in the eye. Sighing he turned his gaze to a few papers on his desk; he knew that Judy was stubborn, the \u201c200 tickets before noon\u201d stunt she had pulled on her first day proved that but this was just frustrating. Looking over the papers, he remembered one assignment in particular; a small smile crossed his features as he came up with a plan. He reached for the case, an escaped felon case that should be relatively simple for a bunny like Judy and one that would he hoped fully convince her to make use of her fellow officer\u2019s talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cFine, Hopps you get to work on one more case and then you\u2019re going on vacation that\u2019s an order.\u201d Bogo responded laying the manila folder down flat on the desk. With a quick kick of her paw, Judy spun the folder around to face her \u201cHugh Mann?\u201d she replied as she saw the name printed across the side. Opening the folder, she was greeted with a picture of a Holstein cow scientist, the black splotches scattered across his white body clearly identifying his subspecies. Looking over the file she obtained some miscellaneous information, height, weight, a few interests but nothing that made the cow stand out or in her opinion implicate him for anything. \u201cWhat\u2019s the case Chief?\u201d Judy asked, her right ear tilting to the side in confusion, as he even his picture looked normal enough, a smiling figure standing in front of a computer console, large rimmed spectacles, white lab coat, the only thing off about the scientist was his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cHe\u2019s well\u2026a mad cow, his words not mine.\u201d Bogo replied, as Judy angled her gaze up to him as he called Hugh a \u201cmad cow.\u201d \u201cHugh claimed that there is an entirely different universe of creatures that evolved from apes called \u201cHumans\u201d connected to our own. He believed it so strongly that he even changed his name to match,\u201d Bogo replied taking in a large breath before continuing. \u201cUnlike your usual crazy he\u2019s got a few PH.Ds under his belt: theoretical physics, nanotechnology, advanced computing, so he\u2019s much smarter than your average criminal. He has been held at the Tundra Town Institute for a few years now after he was caught trying to steal millions in experimental technology but he escaped several days ago. Your job is to bring him in and make sure he\u2019s returned to the institute.\u201d Bogo finished confidently, it was an open and shut case, Judy would be good for the detective work; and if her track record was anything to go by she would be off vacationing in a matter of days. \u201cI\u2019ve had Wolford and Fangmeyer working on the case but they\u2019ve had no leads so far.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cChief isn\u2019t there something a bit more\u2026high-stakes in that stack of cases? You\u2019ve also got two top-notch officers on the case\u201d Judy replied trying to argue, emphasizing the \u201ctop-notch\u201d phrase with her body language. It wasn\u2019t that she thought the case was not important enough but Judy was not a dumb bunny, what Chief Bogo was trying to do was fairly obvious and while she appreciated the concern she was fine on her own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     \u201cThe only cases at the moment are small time things, as cops we usually like things to be peaceful Judy, and I\u2019m sure Fangmeyer and Wolford will love having your help. Clauhauser will give you a copy of the case file, dismissed,\u201d Bogo replied waving Judy unceremoniously out of his office. Scooping up the cases on his desk as Judy turned to leave he pretended to sort them, but simply held them in front of him out of sight as Judy left, the door closing with an audible click behind her. Sighing in relief, he returned to his desk and fanned the cases out before him \u201chomicide, drug bust, kidnapping\u201d were just a few of the titles on the cases that lay before him. Judy was good but if she did not take a break every once in a while than she would be liable to jump into a situation she could not get out of and Bogo while hard on his officers knew that protecting them was also part of his job as police chief. He began to mutter to himself as he looked over the case files, assigning and re-assigning officers, his door opening minutes seconds later. He quickly hid the cases, behind his back as he looked up to see Fangmeyer and Wolford standing in the doorway, the large female Bengal Tiger and gray wolf looking nervous as they walked in together. \u201cChief there\u2019s something we need to talk about,\u201d Wolford began; Chief Bogo returned the case files to his desk as he prepared to hear what they wanted. As Wolford finished Bogo heaved a great sigh as he rubbed at his eyes, a slight migraine setting in \u201cgo find Officer Hopps and let her know there\u2019s been a change, dismissed.\u201d<br>\r\nDown on the precinct floor Judy raced in and out of the legs of her fellow officers as she took ran from Chief Bogo\u2019s office to Clauhauser\u2019s desk down in the reception area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cClauhauser, Clauhauser\u201d she exclaimed as she neared the pudgy cheetah\u2019s desk. Clauhauser pulled his face out of a box of donuts long enough to look all around in an attempt to find the source of the voice before finally glancing down and seeing Judy standing there, the action getting a small eye-roll and an amused smirk from Judy as he really should have known it was her calling by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cOh, hey Judy, what do you need?\u201d Clauhauser asked, leaning over the desk, arms lowering to support his larger head. Judy could not help but smile as she saw Clauhauser, the cheetah\u2019s ease of conversation made things a lot easier and he was always good for a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cChief Bogo wants me to take a look at the Hugh Mann case, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have the file would you?\u201d Judy replied, leaping up to the counter she held herself up with her forearms, her feet kicking expectantly beneath her as she waited for Clauhauser to retrieve the file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve got it right here, but I\u2019m surprised that Chief Bogo had you assigned to that case, I thought Fangmeyer and Wolford were already on it.\u201d Clauhauser replied as he brought out a manila folder that was much more substantial than the last one she had to work with. Carefully taking it Judy began quickly skimming it, it listed was all the information she had seen in the record Chief Bogo had, birth date, age, gender, the usual pieces of information. However much more relevant information was also listed, last known sightings, possible aliases, and interestingly enough there was a small sheet of records pertaining to his stay in the Tundra Town Institute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Pulling the sheets from the folder to examine those several pieces of information quickly stood out to Judy. Several incidents with Hugh during his stay had been recorded, despite the facilities security he had somehow smuggled in contraband though all of it was technological in nature. Computer equipment, wiring, and other electronic paraphernalia, when examined no one could figure out what he would have used the items for, it all would have been useless in an escape and Hugh like most criminals did not volunteer the information when asked.  What caught her eye most was a small footnote attached to the sheets written as if someone was just scribbling down observations or idle thoughts \u201cever since Hugh entered the facility our power bills have been skyrocketing, there have been noted spikes in power usage when contraband was located in his cell. As patient cells are devoid of any electrical outlets or other ways to access the electrical grid for their own safety and the continued security of the facility this is a most puzzling fact. When questioned about his having a possible way to access the power grid Hugh was non-cooperative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cThanks Clauhauser I think I have all that I need\u201d Judy said leaping up and placing the folder back onto his desk, the cheetah looking puzzled as she did, she\u2019d had it for only a few minutes at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cJudy you only had the file for ten minutes,\u201d he shouted after her as she scampered off towards her desk, his voice incredulous as he could not imagine after Wolford and Fangmeyer had worked for a week Judy had come up with the solution so easily. Shrugging two words came to mind \u201cnight howlers,\u201d that had been all that was necessary to blow the Bellwether case open, so who was he to complain. Ever since the Bellwether incident, the ZPD was granted access to \u201cprivate\u201d but more mundane information regarding the running of Zootopia. From accessing the street cameras scattered across the city to electrical records of individual households, they had access to everything and that access is exactly what Judy needed. Rushing to her computer she quickly signed in, pulling up the electrical database for the city she began a thorough search of the power grid for the past few days, several places came up with spikes in terms of electrical usage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Most of the hits however could be explained away by cross-referencing major events in the city, the Beaverton Hotel hosted a movie premiere several days before so it was out as the electricity was most likely for floodlights and other devices. Location after location was eliminated in this fashion until only one was left, though Judy groaned as she realized where it was. The criminal never goes far from the crime, and despite escaping from the Tundra Town Institute neither it seems did Hugh. Looking at the electrical records, the only place he could be was an ice cream factory several blocks away. The factory had been shut down after its workers, all cows had begun to practice a belief of \u201cmy udders, my choice.\u201d Regretfully this lead to the workers not properly sanitizing their udders nor pasteurizing their milk before it was utilized in the ice cream. This led to the closure of the factory for health reasons after an outbreak of Salmonella was linked to the factory and its practices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Smiling, as she knew where to look Judy sat back and tried to think about what was going on. Hugh was incarcerated for his belief that there was an entirely different dimension filled with creatures no mammal had ever seen before. Hugh was found on numerous occasions with seemingly random electrical equipment, not even attempting to escape just tinkering with it. As she looked at the electrical readouts, it was obvious that Hugh had been sapping a massive amount of power for...something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     There was only one conclusion that she could come up with, Hugh was crazy enough to try to access this other dimension and bring some of its inhabitants here to Zootopia. She wasn\u2019t sure if he actually had the knowledge to do what he was planning or if this other dimension even existed but she knew that she had to stop him. A self-sure smirk crossing over her features she got up from her chair, just as Fangmeyer and Wolford stepped in front of her cubicle. \u201cOh, hey Fangmeyer, Wolford\u201d Judy addressed each of them in kind, giving them a slight nod and getting one in return. \u201cHere to work on the Hugh Mann case? I\u2019ve been doing some research and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cAbout that Judy...we\u2019ve made no headway whatsoever so Wolford is going to head back to undercover, and I\u2019m going to be heading back to Swat.\u201d Fangmeyer spoke first inadvertently cutting Judy off. The tigress was perceptive enough to catch Judy\u2019s ears as they drooped for a moment, \u201chey I\u2019m sure that since you\u2019re on this case it\u2019s handled, we\u2019ll see you around Judy.\u201d Fangmeyer said softly, turning she and Wolford left, the wolf turning and shooting her a small smile before separating from Fangmeyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cCome on Judy, you were fine as a cop before Nick showed up, you can do this on your own.\u201d She muttered though her words lacked the conviction she had expected them to have. Stomping her paw her entire demeanor changed, her ears stood tall, she set her eyes forward as she took off for the precinct\u2019s garage, she would catch Hugh then take that vacation, and it had been quite a long time since she had some time off. As she hopped into the seat of her modified cruiser, the roar of the engine shaking her much more than the car she had to admit to herself that Bogo was right, she loved being a cop but a vacation would do her good. </span></div></div>",

She was a farm bunny, born and raised and she preferred the feeling of the sun beating down on her fur compared to the cold nipping at her little toes. \u201cI just have to take down Hugh and I can go get myself something nice and warm to drink, and a paw warmer\u201d Judy muttered psyching herself up as her cruiser skidded around a corner, her cruiser\u2019s tires screeching as they attempted to maintain traction on the frigid roads. The larger and more unwieldy vehicle compared to her parent\u2019s truck was one part of her increased positions she was not fully used to, this combined with the natural treachery of Tundra Town\u2019s slippery streets meant that despite being in a hurry she was staying well within the speed limit. Despite her inexperience with the wieldy cruiser and the slick roads, she was able to navigate her way through the burrow\u2019s tight streets to the factory without damaging her cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCutting the engine as she drove up to the gates she leapt out of the vehicle, paws skidding for a moment as she attempted to regain her footing as she landed right in front of the factory\u2019s massive wrought-iron gates. The gates to the abandoned factory hung open as the district\u2019s constant cold worked at the metal corroding and weakening it to the point where they nearly fell from their hinges. Stepping into the factories courtyard she paused long enough to examine the building, though she was sure she had typed in the address correctly it looked like nothing more than a skeleton of a building. The cold of the district working against the factory itself even more than the gates of the factory. What was left was nothing more than massive pieces of corrugated sheet metal interconnected in tight groups by rivets which acted as the walls and ceiling of the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Judy walked closer she was faced with a set of massive doors that looked like they would simply slide away, probably bay doors for a cow-sized tanker trailer to carry the ice-cream out to market. A minute of searching eventually revealed a much smaller door off to the side to let the workers in, the wavy sheet metal and the sameness of the building hiding it from view. This employee entrance was still imposing to the little rabbit due to the difference in size, the handle just to open the door hung several feet above her head. Taking in a deep breath to steady herself, she leaped for the door handle, flipping in the air she brought her foot down in an axe kick before kicking against the door itself, snapping the handle down undoing the lock and setting the door ajar in one clean motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJudy slipped in through the crack though what she saw past the door left her speechless. Standing on either side of the massive warehouse-sized room were huge tanks obviously meant to store milk, row upon row of milking machines ran in front of the tanks, while the tanks themselves emptied out into just as massive mixing vats where cream and other ingredients would be added to the mixture creating different flavours. Walkways lined the top of the room, obviously meant to allow the facility\u2019s workers to check on the ice cream mid-production as well as allow them to \u201ctweak\u201d the mixture as necessary as the walkways clustered around the mixing vats. As she walked through the facility Judy could not help but feel the cold of the place seep into her despite her warm fluffy fur, the corrugated metal walls and ceiling of the building seemed to retain rather than disperse the cold of Tundra Town. The concrete flooring of the factory did not help as it seemed to do much the same, freezing the underside of her paws with every step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-ok seriously w-when I get my hands on you Hugh w-we are going to have words\u201d Judy chattered, her hands brushing along her arms to give her some semblance of heat. \u201cS-Seriously it\u2019s T-Tundra Town, you could stick your ice cream o-outside the factory and it would stay cool, why would they need to make it colder?\u201d Judy mused aloud; she did not have time to answer that question though as she moved swiftly to the back of the factory eager to get this over with. A door marked \u201cEmployees Only\u201d led to a concrete staircase that descended several stories down into the frozen ground, the entrance to the stairs sitting beside an industrial size elevator that could fit a small vehicle inside it though that was obviously out of the question as it would let Hugh known she was coming. She took the stairs three at a time despite their larger size; her legs thankfully were powerful enough to absorb the impact of each leap. Much to Judy\u2019s eternal delight the staircase unlike the factory floor itself was heated, if her luck kept up hopefully wherever Hugh was would be heated as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeveral seconds were spent on one landing simply basking in the heated staircase, as the frost, which had gathered on the very edge of her fur melted away. Thankfully, the melted water was not enough to mess up her uniform in any way; unthankfully the melted water flowed right down her back. The staircase led to a single doorway at the bottom, which much to Judy\u2019s chagrin led to a refrigerated corridor that was even colder than the factory floor above. To her surprise, the elevator from before also opened into this corridor. Unlike the factory above this hall was below the frost line, the sound of freon running through the walls and the whirr of fans cooling the air rang out from the ducts overhead alerting Judy to the fact that she was not alone. Hackles rising as she slowly advanced paw step by paw step down the corridor it took several freezing minutes for her to sneak down to the end of the corridor, but once she reached the entrance to the next room she carefully looked inside. Keeping her ears pinned back so they would not give her away; she only took a cursory glance but what she saw in the room beyond left her speechless. Hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of computer equipment lined the walls of what had to be the main freezer for the factory, the freezer itself was turned into a massive server farm, hundreds of little red lights flashing and blinking in the dark space beyond what area wasn\u2019t filled with CPUs was filled with other computer equipment. The loading area of the freezer was turned into some form of experimentation area, one wall was filled with a massive metal ring held to the floor on some sort of platform with a ramp leading up to it and a small platform in front of that. With a diameter of twenty feet, the ring could fit five large mammals, depending on which they were, shoulder to shoulder. A much smaller version of the ring, only small enough for a mouse to fit through sat near a massive console that took up the majority of the center of the room, the smaller replica having a ramp and platform of its own. The whole room was filled with a soft gentle hum, as the machinery worked at its full capacity within the cold of the building. \u201cI\u2019m freezing my tail off for some computers!\u201d Judy hissed angrily, though her little outburst was covered up by the constant hum of the machinery in the room beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe paused as she looked in again, her keen eyes quickly sweeping the room as she looked around for her target. She spotted Hugh hunched over the massive console, the bovine only appearing once he stood up slightly. Standing more than five times her size and several dozen times her width and mass the cow with a mad glint in his eye was a rather imposing sight. Judy, however, was not intimidated, she had fought and taken down bigger, and besides that small fact, she had the element of surprise on her side. Carefully stepping forward she made it only a few steps before her paw landed on a stray piece of ice formed from a leaky pipe and though she tread softly not knowing the ice was there her weight came down on it fully causing it to *CRACK*. Though the sound was rather minuscule against the hum of the numerous computer banks, in the relative quiet of the room the ice might as well have been a gunshot. Hugh whirled around to face her, though much to Judy\u2019s chagrin he looked right over her, she knew it was a stupid move tactically but she cleared her throat regardless her pride not allowing her to figuratively and literally be overlooked by the criminal she was meant to catch. To his credit Hugh locked onto her in moments, a small smile crossing his lips as the glint in his eye seemed to almost intensify as Hugh saw her.</span></div></div>",

From this point on the characteristics of the human can be decided by the next person who writes as they're never referred to by any designated race, or sex)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, so the ZPD has sent their little pet to stop me, well you\u2019re too late rabbit, I\u2019ve already tested the connection between our two worlds,\u201d Hugh taunted, indicating the smaller portal with his hand, \u201cand as soon as I hook up the real portal I will have an unstoppable army. Predator, prey it does not matter, all will bow to Hugh Mann and his Human Army!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn unstoppable army based out of an ice cream factory?\u201d Judy replied, one of her eyebrows rising in disbelief as she looked at Hugh piteously \u201cand you might want to get that name changed Hugh, wouldn\u2019t want your subjects to get you confused. Are they talking Hugh Mann, Human wouldn\u2019t want your subjects to get confused now would you?\u201d Judy replied with a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSilence, you ignorant little bunny, and do you know how much it costs to keep equipment like this at working temperature? I\u2019m supposed to be the thief in all this?\u201d Hugh replied, some semblance of clarity seeming to enter his mind for a moment before it disappeared. \u201cRegardless, I just need to attach these two wires and world domination shall be mine!\u201d With that declaration, Hugh reached for a wire at his feet, and another just over the top of the console. Judy figuratively and literally leapt into action as he did, though the ice that covered the floor reduced her traction slightly, but her pawpads let her gain enough momentum to send her up onto the cows back in a single leap. Not waiting for Hugh to stick the cords together she grabbed onto his horns and yanked backwards. The effect was immediate, his body jerking backwards as well, the cords jerking out of his hands as Judy literally \u201ctook the bull by the horns.\u201d Hugh began to swing for Judy but the agile little rabbit dodged his blows easily causing him to hurt himself as she guided him around in front of the console. Letting out a little \u201cwhoop\u201d of glee she led the bull around, smashing and slamming into the computer equipment. \u201cGet off me, you insufferable rabbit!\u201d Hugh shouted, \u201cThis is the culmination of years of research and preparation and I will not be denied by you.\u201d he bellowed as he futilely swung repeatedly trying to strike her down from her position atop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou want your computers back Hugh, you can have them,\u201d Judy commented, driving the bull back towards the central console, she leapt off the bull to land on the floor in front of the console just as he crashed into it. A loud \u201cclick\u201d followed by an ever growing \u201cwhirr\u201d sounding up as Hugh slumped over one of the switches on the console. As this was happening the miniature portal next to the console began to crackle to life, bolts of energy coalescing into the center of the tiny circle of metal before exploding into a whirling vortex with a flash of light. \u201cNo, you fool they\u2019re still connected, if the portal pulls a human through now it will be disastrous,\u201d Hugh cried as he tried to reach for the lever and flip it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah right, hey Hugh, why don\u2019t you chill out?\u201d Judy shouted, gaining some momentum she slipped onto her back, blasting across the ice on her back she leapt from the ground using her hands as a springboard, her feet slamming into the cow\u2019s jaw. Dusting off her paws in triumph looked at the slumped over cow, despite the active little piece of technology giving off quite a light show there was no way it was real. \u201cInterdimensional portals ha, as if something like that would really exist...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t*Fwumph* There was a sudden explosion of heat and light, enough to melt the ice around the portal as something passed through. She was completely oblivious as a tiny form came to rest on the small platform in front of the portal as she leaped up onto the console itself, fake or not Judy knew she needed to shut this \u201cportal\u201d down. Throwing her weight against Hugh she struggled and strained for several seconds against him. Inch by precious inch his arm came free from the switch though Judy would later admit to herself that gravity as much as her efforts dislodged Hugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as his arm came free she threw herself against the lever, it took several seconds and while it was a simple action for Hugh she could physically feel the lever move through each notch until it clicked back from \u201con\u201d to \u201coff\u201d. The portal shut down with a notable lessening of the \u201cwhirr\u201d around them followed by a flash of light as it winked out of existence, the crackling electricity disappearing a moment later. Sitting back Judy sighed as she pulled out her walkie-talkie and began to relate what happened. \u201cThis is Officer Judy Hopps, I am at 350 Dairy Boulevard inside the old Moovine ice cream factory, Hugh Mann is in custody, and a lot of sensitive computer equipment that\u2019s probably stolen is here too.\u201d Judy let the button for her walkie go at that as she began to examine the smaller portal, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he actually thought this tiny thing...could...pull...in.\u201d Judy fell silent as she stared at a tiny figure laid out before the portal. It was covered in normal clothing, a shirt and shorts but little else; shivers wracked its body as its form was completely hairless, its skin was exposed to the elements wherever the clothing did not protect it. A gentle moan escaped tiny lips that were rapidly turning blue as the presumed human was going into hypothermic shock right before her eyes. She was on the tiny form in an instant, gently lifting it up in her right paw and pressing it gently against her tactical vest as she was trained to do in her rodent EMT training. She began to sprint out of the building, her right paw attempting to cocoon the tiny figure to protect it from the cold as best she could. Lifting up her walkie she radioed for backup \u201cChief, I need a team of doctors waiting at the emergency room of Tundra U, possible hypothermia patient.\u201d Judy let go of the button just long enough to hear Bogo\u2019s reply, she leapt up the stairs four at a time once she reached them, though she was careful to stabilize her tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHypothermia? Hopps pretty much any mammal can survive the temperatures of Tundra Town easily enough\u201d Bogo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not holding a mammal, there was an...incident while I was stopping Hugh, he is not as mad as everyone thinks, The humans he was talking about they\u2019re real, and if I don\u2019t get that medical team waiting for me. The first one we\u2019ve ever seen is also going to be the last.\u201d Judy replied she stopped as she felt a slight shiver against her palm. In the warmth of the staircase, she knew they had a few extra seconds but he was shivering and shaking even in her palm, there was not enough warmth. Without even thinking she opened up the top of her vest and taking several seconds she nestled the human safely against her chest, though just to be sure she gently held the human tight against her as she sprinted up the rest of the stairs and was across the factory floor and out in a matter of moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re real? Hopps I\u2019m sending backup to support you-\u201d Bogo began as she reached her cruiser, the delay and unnecessary caution annoying her enough that she interrupted her commanding officer.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n     \u201cThere\u2019s no time, they\u2019re not as big a threat as Hugh made them out to be or at least this one isn\u2019t, now am I going to have a team waiting for me or not?\u201d Judy snapped back as she leapt inside, starting the engine she cranked up the heating as far as it would go. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n     Judy heard a sigh through her walkie just as she was about to slam her paw to the pedal \u201cwhat\u2019s your ETA?\u201d Bogo asked, frustration from not having all the information clear in his voice.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n     \u201cThree minutes\u201d she replied quickly, a quick flip of her wrist turning her cruisers lights on as her paw slammed on the gas, shooting the cruiser forward as she blasted through the streets.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n    \u201cThey\u2019ll be waiting for you, what size of medical team do you need?\u201d Bogo asked trying to get some information in regards to what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u201cMouse!\u201d Judy replied quickly, her fingers barely pressing down the button for her walkie before they released again, as she needed both paws for the wheel.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n    \u201cMouse? What do you mean mouse?\u201d Judy could hear the anger growing in Bogo\u2019s voice as he did not have all the information but she did not have time to argue with him, a quick flick of her wrist shut her radio off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be ok, I\u2019ve got you\u201d Judy muttered protectively, one hand leaving the wheel just long enough to pat her vest and feel the small form held within.  Her paw pressed the accelerator further and further to the ground as she pressed the limits of her cruiser, intent on making sure that this was not her first case to include a fatality. Something about the entire situation heightened her senses, she screeched around corners and made turns that she was fairly certain she should not physically have been able to given the conditions and her speed, yet before she knew it they were in front of the Tundra Town University Hospital. She was out of her cruiser like a shot as she raced to the ER, a tiny team of mouse medics met her along the way, though they were confused when they saw her without a patient. Without a hint of embarrassment, she gently pulled her charge from within her vest, the medics staring at the strange creature as it was gently laid on their gurney. Once they had the strange creature secured and stable they rushed into the hospital, Judy followed inside but was promptly informed that since she had no connection to the victim, all she could do was sit and wait. Staring up at the large bear, which acted as an orderly in the hospital Judy wished to protest, but knowing that it was useless she simply sat down on a chair to wait, as that was all she could do. </span></div></div>",

George, take her to the window of room 346.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the bear said. \"Officer, this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked around as she followed the orderly. It reminded her a bit of the time she'd stopped Duke Weaselton when he'd tried to get away from the police by going through Little Rodentia, and she'd felt like a giant to the various mice and other small rodents that lived comfortably there. Thankfully, the shades on most of the windows were down to, at the very least, give the patients the illusion of privacy, while the larger patients and doctors, and visitors walked by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" the bear said. \"Rooms 341-350.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I don't bother the other patients when I talk to him,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are soundproof, for the most part, at least on this side,\" the bear said. \"Keeps disturbances down, so long as you keep your voice to a conversation level. That being said, it's real easy to move these rooms in an emergency, and take them outside in the case of a fire, or some such thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Judy. She then looked at the numbers outside the windows, and saw that 346 was just above her ears. \"This is going to be mildly annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he won't have someone looking down at him,\" the bear said. \"Less of that whole Predator-Prey Fear Reaction thing. You don't want that sort of thing with those suffering from head injuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear tapped the window at 346 with his claw, and it opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" a mouse nurse asked. She looked looked up. \"Oh, hi George.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps here to see the patient,\" the bear said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse looked down. \"Oh, it's you. The patient's been asking for you. Calls himself John Smith, which is obviously a fake name, but I will say this, he knows his manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama tried to raise me to be a gentleman, and while some things didn't stick, manners did,\" said a voice in the room. \"Now, I believe there's others who'd be blessed by your presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse chuckled at this. \"Like I said, he has manners.\" She ducked back inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Judy found herself looking up at the small face of the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked down out her. \"Well, this is awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the whole looking down thing,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm used to looking down at rabbits,\" the human said. \"What I'm not used to is giant talking ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this must be a little strange for you then,\" said Judy. \"Do you know how you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you carry me here?\" the human asked. \"The nurse said that you carried me here in your vest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I meant here in general,\" said Judy. \"As in, how did you end up in that ice cream factory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Investigating temporal-dimensional energy readings, which were off the charts,\" the human said. \"It's illegal to mess with that sort of stuff unless you know what you are doing, and if all safety precautions are taken care of, and if you're smart enough to not to take anything from the other worlds you might discover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way; what if, say, there was some sort of virus that I was immune to, but you weren't, and let's say I accidentally gave you that virus, and let's say it killed you,\" the human said. \"Bit of a rocky start to a relationship. Thankfully, I doubt I could give you anything, as my doctors gave me a thorough check of my health before I sent out to investigate those energy fluctuations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've been in this sort of situation before,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One way, or another,\" the human said. \"Either someone got sent to my world, or I got sent to their world. I remember one time, got sent to a world dominated by humanoid-like lizards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would be strange,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what's strange is where you get sent to a world that looks like your world, the people look like those whom you know, but they are all different, and even the version of you you meet is different,\" said the human. \"I remember one time, got sent to a world where my counterpart was a dangerous criminal, and it wasn't easy trying to convince the cop looking for him that I wasn't the John Smith he was looking for. Then, when I finally located my counterpart, I was disgusted at how much alike we were, and I don't mean physically; very arrogant, single-minded, stubborn, the both of us, but at least I knew that I was on the right side of the whole Good and Evil thing. Funny enough, the counterpart of that cop is a dangerous criminal on my world, and I'd wager he'd be surprised at how alike they themselves are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by right side of Good and Evil?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes you have to question if you are good, or evil, among other things,\" the human said. \"If you can honestly ask yourself the question, you can usually get an honest answer - evil people don't question if they are evil, they believe that they are always in the right. If you're smart, you'll admit that you've made some mistakes in the past, but are working on them. Doesn't always work out like that., but if you have to question yourself, you're usually on the right track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it you are interested in?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First up, I'm going to enjoy some delicious soup,\" the human said. \"Then I'm going to kick the tar out of whomever it was that was foolish enough to open up the portal that got me sent here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, the one who created the portal was a bull,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that affect the price of beans?\" the human asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you've seen how you are the size of a mouse,\" said Judy. \"And you've seen how tall I am. Have you seen how tall he is?\" She pointed at the bear standing beside her, who was easily eight times taller than her. \"He's about as tall as the one who brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked up at the bear, before looking back down at her. \"Bigger target is all they'd be. This isn't my first time in a world full of giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've seen a lot of strange things?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place isn't even in my top twenty,\" the human said. \"That slot belongs to the time I ended up being sent from Anchorage Alaska, which is really cold in winter, to Mexico City Mexico, which is nice to be in the summer before hurricane season, and I'm sure I did not get on any planes; my one buddy thinks it was aliens or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would number one be?\" George asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked up at the bear. \"Going to sleep in my bed, and waking up in my brother's bed, over a hundred miles away, and in his wife's arms. I don't remember drinking, and there's no sleep-walking, let alone sleep-driving, in my family's history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, strange things happen to you a lot,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human looked back down at her. \"Often enough. Now, after I deal with that bull, I'm going to make him build a portal that sends me back; the Chief will chew me out for this, always does, because he'll complain that I didn't wait for backup when I checked the site out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a law enforcement officer?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temporal-Dimensional Department,\" said the human. \"Small group, less than a thousand total, including the guy cleaning toilets, and the cafeteria lady, and whatever local forces, including those from parallel worlds, we can convince that we're not crazy. Not easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is your name?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Smith,\" the human said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fake,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a very common name,\" said John. \"Useful for when you have to go undercover. And, it <i>is</i> my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be difficult explaining to others then,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" said John. \"So, got any idea on a place for me to stay at?\"</span></div></div>",

It was one from when she and Nick had found a photo booth, and has decided to get some candid photos done, including one where she'd tackled him from behind, as well as one where he used her head as an armrest. There were some other photos she kept in a drawer in the desk, and hoped that no one would see, especially her parents, especially since they had been taken when they were undercover at the Mystic Spring Oasis, investigating a theft, and per the rules of the establishment, that meant that, given that they were posing as customers, they two of them had been naked. Nick had been fine with it, and was, apparently, a regular there, well, he used to go there to sell pawsicles at least once a week back when he was hustling, but it was Judy's first time there, naked. Then, Nick had decided to do some Role-Playing with her, and well, it could be said there was some extenuating circumstances, but Nick had pinned her to the ground, and kissed her. It wouldn't have been so bad, providing that Yax, the place's proprietor, hadn't been in the wrong place at the wrong time, with a camera, and took a picture of the moment. Luckily, Nick had been able to get Yax to hand the picture over, along with the negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my partner,\" she said. \"We work together on the force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn glanced over to her. \"Seems a bit more friendly than just partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are friends when we're off-duty,\" said Judy, as she chuckled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn grinned. \"And, just how friendly are you? Just Good Friends, or is it a Friends With Benefits kind of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't put it quite <i>that</i> way,\" said Judy. Then, she lowered her voice. \"Although, I wouldn't mind it, if he was interested in me that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said John. \"You're still defining your relationship with each other.

Then, her eyes widened, as she looked again at John. \"And, this scale between rabbits and humans is accurate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some rabbits are a tad bigger or smaller, same with humans, but the ratio is close enough,\" said John. \"Humans are about six feet tall, give or take an inch, or two, while rabbits are just over one and a half feet in length, or a hundred eighty centimeters versus twenty centimeters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled nervously at this, as she was just a foot and a half tall, with her ears just barely meeting the two foot mark. \"Funny how we use the same measurements, and yet are so different in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happens in most of the world I've ended up on,\" said John. \"In fact, there are world where I'm in the exact opposite extreme, where everyone barely comes up to my ankles, and so forth. I've been on worlds where people are giants, and worlds where people are tiny, compared to me. Also, this is easily the thirtieth world I've been to where humans are not the dominate species; there's lizard dominated worlds, bird dominated worlds, fish dominated worlds, amphibian dominated worlds, to say nothing about worlds dominated by creatures from Fantasy or Science Fiction. But, no matter which world I end up in, the people tend to be similar in personality with their counterparts across the dimensions. Now, the real trick will be locating my counterpart, because he, or she, is the main failsafe in sending me home; two of the same thing can't be in the same space at the same time. Basically, I touch them, I end up in my home world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what if we can't find your counterpart?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd best get that mad cow to fix the portal that brought me here,\" said John. \"A person can only spend a year outside of their native dimension, before the local dimension fixes the imbalance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that happen?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either I'll die, or I'll end up like the locals,\" said John. \"At least, that's the theory; no one has spent more than a month outside of their native dimension to risk too much of an imbalance. Maybe nothing will happen, or maybe I'll die, or something. Always best to be ready for the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Judy.</span></div></div>",

As it is, humans, being omnivores, do eat meat, and rabbits are occasionally on the menu, either by hunting them, or raising them to be food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, other animals?\" Judy asked, slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on the situation,\" said John. \"Some are hunted during certain times of the year, some are raised as food, while others are not hunted, because of one law or another.\" He then looked at her. \"That being said, I think sentient beings would be off the menu, especially the whole killing them just to eat them. If the person's already dead, then the law gives some leeway, providing that one didn't commit murder first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I know what to do to that bull when we talk to him tomorrow,\" John said, as he got into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him that he's either going to help us, or I'll have his Rocky Mountain oysters,\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no oysters in the Rocky Mountains, but there is plenty of cattle, and every so often, you have a bull that has an undesirable coat, or some other undesirable genetics, but instead of killing them, as that would be a waste of meat, you castrate them, so that they are unable to breed,\" said John. \"Then, get a pan, some flour, and you fry up what you cut off, and that's a Rocky Mountain oyster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes widened. \"Would you really do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled. \"I'm sure that some lawyer would complain about doing that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they probably would,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled. \"I'll see you then, John.\"</span></div></div>",

As she picked up the device, she was surprised to see Chief Bogo's image appear on it. She accepted the call. \"Chief Bogo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps, is that human still with you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy glanced over at the mouse-sized bed on her desk. \"Yes, he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your uniform on and get your fluffy butt here, on the double!\" Chief Bogo ordered. \"And bring that human with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call disconnected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like my boss,\" said John, as he got out of bed. \"Then again, that seems to be the way of Police Chiefs everywhere; yell and rant at the officer's face when they screw up, but when someone tries to go after said officer over doing their duty, the chief has the officer's back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to be like that,\" said Judy. \"Yelled and ranted at me for abandoning my post by chasing a thief, when I was supposed to be handing out parking tickets, to the point he almost fired me after I said I'd help locate a missing otter to said otter's wife. The only reason I didn't get fired was because of then-Assistant Mayor Bellwether. Funny how things turned out in the end - Bellwether turned out to be the reason the otter, among others, had disappeared, and Chief Bogo managed to convince me to rejoin the force after I messed up in a big Public speech. Then, he ended up coming to my rescue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rescue?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a number of predators had been, for some reason, going savage,\" said Judy. \"Turns out that the victims were being exposed to concentrated doses of <i>Midnicampum holicithias</i>, which are better known in the non-botanical community as night howlers. Normally, farmers use them to ward off insects from their crops, but, if you eat them, or get injected with a serum made from the flowers, it can make you highly aggressive. Bellwether was using them to try and make it look like predators were reverting to their old savage ways. Me and Nick ended up finding out about the plot, and she tried to kill us, well, she tried to make Nick become aggressive, and attack me, but Nick is something of a con-artist, and had swapped the serum pellet for a blueberry, to which it was very similar to in appearance. Funny enough, she had called Chief Bogo to say that there was a Savage Fox, and that Officer Hopps was injured - ended up recording her confession on my pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, basically, you stopped a whole lot of innocent folks from getting hurt,\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed. \"A little bit more complicated, but yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'd best get going,\" said John. \"Something tells me that another human must have shown up, or else they wouldn't have bothered you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you say that?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't because someone complained about getting a ticket, now was it,\" said John. \"He probably wants you because you're the closest thing to an expert on humans, and he probably wants me because I am a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, that reminds me,\" said Judy. \"Just how dangerous can humans be? I mean, you lack any sharp teeth or claws, and you don't have any natural weapons or defenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked right at her. \"We didn't get to be the dominate species by being nice, and even now, we're not always friendly towards one another, and we can utilize almost anything as a weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes widened. \"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. \"Anything. And, like I've said, I've seen humans smaller than me, and I've seen them as tall as you, and as tall as some of the others that are taller than you, like that bear at the hospital. Some could be even taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed. \"I guess we'll see what the issue is.\"</span></div></div>",

After a few times though, it's like, 'Oh, I've just been sucked through another portal. Better find the way home.' Thankfully, most places that I've been to has their own Portal system, so it's basically a case of getting the right directions, and then typing in the right address in the GPS, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what if these humans are not used to the whole dimensional effects stuff?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some will be confused, some will be scared, and others will be aggressive, but it's all mainly instinctive reactions, where they try to keep themselves safe from those they think might harm them,\" said John. \"There's three things that you might want to do; have the humans empty their pockets, keeping the contents separate from each of the other persons, keep your predator officers away from them, yet within sight, and play Classical Instrumental music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By emptying their pockets, you'll reduce the risk that someone will pull out a knife, or some such thing in a fight,\" said John. \"Keeping the predators away is important, because humans have been preyed on by a number of larger felines, canines, bears, and the like throughout time, even into the Present, and there are plenty of stories, and seeing giant-sized ones won't help. As for Classical Instrumental music, well, music in general would be a good thing, but research has shown that instrumental-type music has a calming effect on the human mind, meaning that they are less likely to act out aggressively, especially when under stress, like being imprisoned on an alien world, especially orchestra music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled. \"I think we might be able to handle those details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer a combination of acoustic Guitar and drum music in a style called County, myself,\"  said John. \"Still, any music is better than no music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what about this song?\" Judy selected Gazelle's \"Try Everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sat back, and listened. \"It's got a good beat. Nice vocals. And most males like a female singer anyways. It will do the job.

But, you've got folks of all sizes, which means.....\" He looked at Judy expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means, we're going to have humans that are very small, and humans that are very tall,\" said Judy, as she looked around. \"Um, I don't see any of the really tall ones, or the really small ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't keep a fifty foot tall human here anyways,\" said John. \"As for a half inch tall one, you can fit over dozen of them in a shoe box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I know of people who would really take advantage of that,\" said Judy, as she walked up to the desk sergeant. \"Hey Clawhauser, is Weaselton out on bail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duke Weaselton?\" the obese cheetah asked. \"I'll take a look.\" He punched the information up on the computer. \"He's out as of last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask a car to stop by his place, to check up on him,\" said Judy. \"Instruct the officers that, if they find any humans, especially ones that are in containers, that they are to ask Weaselton if he was keeping the humans safe until someone reliable could be found to care for them, which would look favorable in reducing his sentence, unless he wishes to be charged with kidnapping, in addition to stealing, as well as selling, toxic flowers without a license, to say nothing about the other charges on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess; this Weaselton sells things that are on the shady side of legal,\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could put it that way,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know the type,\" said John. \"Some you can buy stuff off of, and others, well, you stuff them in the backseat of the car, drive to a dangerous area, and talk to them in front of a well-known crime boss's place of business, as if they were going to tell you information about the guy's operations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled nervously. \"You've done that sort of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way, I'm stuck between two crime families,\" said John. \"Father's the younger son of a well-known crime boss, mother is the daughter of another crime boss; Italian Mafia and Irish Mob, who hate each other's guts to the point that blood has been spilled by both sides. Worse than that, father never married mother, meaning, in the eyes of the Catholic Church, I'm a bastard, who isn't going to get into Heaven, and nobody on either side of my family will willingly talk to me, except in special situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Judy. \"Just because of some family feud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been going on for a hundred years,\" said John. \"Thus, I became a Protestant, and then a cop. Changed my name to John Smith as well. If they won't acknowledge me as a relation, I won't keep their names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's harsh,\" said Clawhauser. \"No contact with your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Precinct is my family,\" said John, as he looked at the over-sized cheetah. \"As long as I do my job, they don't care about my past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked around again. \"Tell me, do you just have large-sized animals, like rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, elephants, not to mention lions, tigers, and bears? Or do you have some smaller officers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's Officer Wolflord,\" said Clawhauser. \"He's a wolf, and is much smaller than most, save Wilde, who is out of town, and Hopps here. There's a few other wolves as well, and some pigs. Used to have some sheep, but, sadly, they turned out to be corrupt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might make things tricky,\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that you have more rabbits and mice who are officers?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the only rabbit, and we have no mice,\" said Judy. \"There is Officer Swinton, who is a jail guard. She's a pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn groaned. \"This is going to be very tricky. You're short on Domesticated and Farm animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you might get by with wolves and wildcats with certain fur-patter types, same with the pigs, which, while not popular with some, should be fine, not to mention yourself,\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The humans will be more comfortable around someone they connect to Floppsy, instead of Jumbo,\" said John. \"Basically, you look like you aren't a threat, while the others do. It's all a matter of perception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, they're going to be more willing to talk to me, than to any of the other officers?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" said John. \"You look like a cute pet instead of a dangerous beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mind not calling me cute,\" said Judy. \"I don't like it when someone who isn't a rabbit calls me cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn raised his eyebrow. \"Get used to it quick, especially if a child decides to grab you and calls you fluffy as well as cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do know someone who might be able to help,\" said Judy.</span></div></div>",

He looked at the rabbit. \"Hopps, I just got some rather disappointing, and annoying news; Hugh Mann has escaped from custody, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sighed. \"I guess I'd better go after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are staying here to cover the human element,\" said Bogo. \"If what this one says is true, you'll be more important here, than you would out there - Fangmeyer and Wolford have been sent to his previous base at the ice cream factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell, me, what was the reason this guy created the portal in the first place?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about summoning an army to take over the city,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" John asked. \"Take a good look at the humans you have here, and you might notice something that this idiot overlooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different sizes?\" Judy guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What color are most of them wearing?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most seem to be wearing blue outfits,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who normally wear these outfits?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police officers,\" said Bogo. \"Explains a few things, like the fact that among the items that have been collected are a large number of badges and handcuffs, not to mention handguns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" said John. \"Folks notice some sort of disturbance, they call the police, and the department sends someone to check it out, and the officers end up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo started to laugh. \"All that work, and he is going to get himself apprehended by a large number of alien cops! Jurisdiction is going to be a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Locals get preference where punishing that sort of offender is concerned,\" said John. \"It's sort of a rule. Still, given that he sounds like an egomaniac, he'll probably televise that he's summoning an army of aliens to take over the world. Thus, you have to get the jump on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the moment, these guys are just playing along,\" said John. \"They gave up their guns, handcuffs, and anything that could be used as a weapon, but every cop knows how to break out of a precinct with nothing more than a simple paperclip, and I wager plenty slid one of those up their sleeves. Like I said, they're trying to get the lay of the land before making a move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But eventually we are going to end up getting people who aren't going to play nice,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you want to get a jump on it before some misunderstanding gets someone hurt,\" said John. \"A big news conference stating that a number of portals to parallel worlds have opened up, and bringing aliens here, helps out, and telling the public to just treat the aliens like they would any other stranger, as in being polite to them, giving the ones that look like police officers a free cup of coffee and a doughnut, and that sort of stuff, as that all helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to talk to the Mayor,\" said Bogo. \"He won't like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's the Mayor and not stuck in prison, or worse,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there,\" said Bogo. \"That being said, you might want to crash in the Visitor's Quarters until things are figured out; it is the middle of the night after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need the rest,\" said Bogo, as he went back to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right there,\" said Clawhauser. \"With this human thing, we've all been working, and taking whatever rest we can, whenever we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Judy, as she took John with her. \"See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then.\" The cheetah took a sip of coffee, and got back to his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy entered the Visitor's Quarters, and saw a few other officers on the cots. She chuckled, found a spot for John, and then found a spot for herself. \"See you in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" said John.</span></div></div>",

Of course these humans won't be standing any taller than the ankles of most of Zootopia's furry inhabitants (it wouldn't be a shrink interactive otherwise) but hopefully people other than me will enjoy this premise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1. Any type of relationship is allowed, m/f, m/m, f/f, prefer inter-size relationships but it's up to the writer. The first person to write a chapter will decide the type of relationship, please leave an \"other\" option in this case for others who want to write their own stories (or simply want to use another orientation). Please indicate this by writing (m/m) (m/f) or (f/f) at the top of the first chapter.<br>\r\n2. Any person can be used, same rules as relationship, first person to write the chapter gets to decide, please use the same indication method as above just with (first person), (second person), or (third person)<br>\r\n3. 4 FULL PARAGRAPHS PER CHAPTER (minimum of 4 sentences per paragraph), I shouldn't need to emphasize this but I need to as there are still those who like to write 1-2 sentence chapters. Obligatory except for choice chapters as well.<br>\r\n4. While this may seem restrictive I don't want any hard fetishes, no vore of any kind, crushing, or any toilet related fetishes, no death and no torture. Light (non injurious) stomping and paw focused material is encouraged. Also no \"accidents\" that relate to or lead to the above banned fetishes, you're not being clever, so don't do it.<br>\r\n5. Try to keep characters in-character. If you want the pantheress from the nudity club to be a sly seductress then go right ahead as she doesn't really have a character, but Judy for example would stay true to her movie character. She is not going to become some sadist upon finding the character (even if it was allowed) because you want her to. <br>\r\n6. Have fun and enjoy the story, if you have any questions, complaints, or queries then you can easily e-mail me by hitting the little mail icon next to my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a bonus I've found two clips that demonstrate the relative sizes of some of Zootopia's inhabitants in rather applicable terms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r6GYP1PLpM\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-r6GYP1PLpM</a> (Judy compared to a larger creature like an Elephant, skip to 0:15 if you don't want to see Judy talk to Clawhauser)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2XkyDTW34\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ2XkyDTW34</a> (Judy compared to your average mouse, not the full chase but the best I can find)</td>",
