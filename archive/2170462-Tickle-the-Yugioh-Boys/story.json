You play against your favourite boy and surprisingly win. Great! That means that you get to tickle him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before we go any further, who was the boy you played against? </span></div></div>",

Would you be able to make Kaiba laugh? What would a non-haughty laugh from him even sound like? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba does his best to resist. He fights the grin that threatens to appear on his face. Finally, he can fight it no more. He smiles with just his lips, and keeps fighting the spasms of his body. He tries to curl up but there's always a vulnerable spot you can get to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watches in awe as you keep tickling him, waiting for the explosion of laughter. You get his neck, underarms, back, under the knee area, the tops of his knees, and his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's held out this long, and you can't help feel proud of him. Who else could have lasted...? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you pull off his boots, the socks deciding to stay inside.

But Seto isn't pleased. He didn't like feeling helpless and the other boys possibly overheard his laughter. Plus, you've just initiated a challenge!

That you'd help him overcome his pain. 'You can do this,' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you run a finger along his ribs... He giggles lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, more! More!\" Mokuba cries. At his prompting, you attack both his armpits at the same time, making him cry out in laughter. \"HAHAHHAhahaHaHAHAA! AHAAHAhAHaAHaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggles from side to side, trying to get away while also balancing himself so he doesn't fall off the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccessfully, he fights off your tickle attacks, even though you keep coming back, getting him in different areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!! NOT THE TOES! HAHAHAAHAHHAHHAHAHA! OH NO NOT MY BELLY BUTTON!!\" He rolls over to avoid you targeting his stomach, while making the fatal mistake of exposing his sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, mercilessly wiggling your fingers on them. Mokuba screams and falls off the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mokuba!\" you cry, kneeling down beside him. Suddenly, you turn serious, the smile fading from your lips. You start inspecting him for injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs, pushing your hands away. \"Oh, stop! Hehe! You're such a mom friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your arms. \"I am not a mom friend!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds his stomach, laughing again. \"You are! Just look at how you always worry about me.\" He stops giggling, eyes turning bright and serious. \"I'm glad you care, though. Don't get me wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hug him again and give him one last playful tickle. He giggles and squirms away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you like the tickling?\" you ask, curious. You hope he had a better time this time than before. He nods happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was definitely better than that time. And also whenever Seto tickles me, he's always merciless, like it's some sort of game he's got to win. It's just the kind of person he is, but I wish he was gentler.\" He smiles up at you. \"This time was definitely the best. It was just right. Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, kiddo. And hey, I could always convince him to be gentler with you, next time I see your brother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt he'll listen, but thanks.\" He gives you one last hug. You return it, glad you were able to help Mokuba with his troubles. Then he moves suddenly. You release him. \"Oh! It's getting late! I should get to bed soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and decide to prepare for bed too. The sleepover has almost ended and the rest of the group looks tired. You may as well take advantage of the fact most of the others are more immersed in their games than you two and beat them to the bathroom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ The End ~ </span></div></div>",
