She in her own admission has a sweet tooth, but she tries her best to work it off. Perhaps she can stay thin even as her angelic and demonic cohorts gain around her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya starts as a somewhat thin and toned woman, with perky breasts and a toned behind. As she gains, she develops into a more hourglass figure, though with a bit of a focus on her breasts. Tanya is capable of height growth if she gains enough as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana Vern<br>\r\nAge: 24<br>\r\nWeight: 250 lbs.<br>\r\n5\u20193\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grocery bagger at the local supermarket of Green Foods, Diana Vern is in charge of working with others in order for it to maintain top shape. Working with her demonic slacker cohort Lucy, she\u2019s the more productive of the two, trying to help keep balance in a supernatural world. Now, can she say the exact same thing about keeping balance to her waistline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana starts out moderately chubby, with wide hips and a big potbelly. This potbelly, under the right circumstances, has the chance to grow huge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam Hawthorne<br>\r\nAge: 22<br>\r\nWeight: 122 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20196\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is one of the very few doctors in Angel\u2019s Peak, and he takes his job very seriously. Taking care of the needs of everyone, he works to fix broken bones and to help cure diseases wherever they may show up. He runs a tight ship though, and that entails some nurses under him cracking and resorting to comfort food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam starts as a rather thin doctor, with no definable fat on his body. If he gains, he\u2019s likely to develop into a pear-like figure, with most of his weight going into his behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty Parks<br>\r\nAge: 21<br>\r\nWeight: 190 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20199\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA party-going woman in the community, Patty has a technical job as a DJ but prefers to let the music be on auto-play as she goes off to party with others. She lives a carefree life, bouncing from one party to the other and letting herself enjoy the finest things in life: beer, food, and good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty starts off as a rather tall hourglass of a girl, with the potential to grow a rather massive chest and belly. Patty is able to grow in height as well as her weight soars...</span></div></div>",

Using her divine beauty and elegant wings to win over favors, she is liked quite a bit among the average students, though a small amount recognize her for the bully she really is. Perhaps by gaining weight, she will be humbled? Eh, she\u2019ll probably spin it off as body positivity or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitra starts off as a rather well-endowed Angel girl, with the smallest of potbellies beginning to form. As she gains, this belly will slowly catch up to her breasts and one day maybe even exceed them. With enough weight it may even cause her to begin growing as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael Evans<br>\r\nAge: 28<br>\r\nWeight: 145 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 6\u20190<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe principal of Seraphim High, Michael is a descendant of the original archangel Michael, and in charge of leading humanity to greatness much like his ancestor. Becoming principal of this new school, he seeks to help lead the next generation into a era of peace, even if the world seems to push them all into gluttony...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael starts out as a tall and muscular man, with wings facing upward.

She, along with her group, bring in appetite stimulants to the town of Angel\u2019s Peak, and sell them to those who wish to use it. Woe be to any who would piss her off or steal from her in turn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce starts off with a hourglass figure for her height, with a ample behind and firm breasts. As she gains and grows further, her belly very quickly will fill in this hourglass, and then quite possibly overtake it by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry Meyers<br>\r\nAge: 37<br>\r\nWeight: 197 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20190\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVitra\u2019s mother, Cherry is a former model who masqueraded as a human on Earth before angels and demons were revealed to Angel\u2019s Peak. Being past her prime, she has let herself go a bit, but she is actively trying to lose weight in order to go back into her career as a model. Can she lose this weight, or is she doomed to add more to it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry starts out with quite a bit of a potbelly and some plump breasts. She tends to gain in an apple shape, though like her daughter her belly is often the quickest to grow.</span></div></div>",

Seeing that it was nearly 8, she would slowly grumble as she got up and began getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through her closet, she would quickly slide on a skull themed t-shirt and some jeans as she would begin looking in the mirror. Standing at a even 8 feet tall, despite being around 250 pounds she was able to hold it in a hourglass figure, with large F-cup breasts and a plush booty, but with a slim waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the side of her body though, Joyce would feel a slight bit of fat, causing her to sigh. \u201cUgh, I need to hold back a bit at the buffet. I don\u2019t wanna end up too fat for my hog...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her dressing, Joyce would quickly make some toast and cereal for breakfast, eating light to prepare for a heavy day of work. Having been thrown to Earth as a Fallen Angel for boasting about her figure as a teen, Joyce had since started a local biker gang known as the Red Wings, in the town of Angel\u2019s Peak to find a group to belong in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boss of the Red Wings though, she had to set an example, and as such she usually had a bunch to do every day. Aside from general riding around in her motorcycle, she had to run both a gambling racket and a protection racket to fund any motorcycle repairs, and she even had to occasionally put members of her gang in line, when they would get too rowdy or drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up her breakfast, Joyce would quickly slip on her biker jacket and helmet, before hopping on her motorcycle. Pulling out her phone, Joyce would make a call to her second in command, a girl named Queenie, while looking out at the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Queenie, how\u2019s the group doing? I just woke up, should be there in a few minutes...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to the other end, Joyce would hear bits of fighting and punching as Queenie would speak. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not good... one of our lower level riders got drunk and we\u2019re having a problem subduing him. He just keeps getting back up after every punch...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? Hah, from the sounds on the other end, I was worried it was a gang war, but if it\u2019s just one guy it\u2019s not a problem at all! I\u2019ll take care of him as soon as I arrive!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up on Queenie, Joyce would rev the engines on her motorcycle, before riding off onto the streets. Taking a few left turns, Joyce would turn through an alleyway before riding down a secret path into the Red Wings territory. As she would get closer, she would already begin hearing the sounds of punching as she would get closer and closer to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she would see two guys, both she would recognize as her own, in front of the entrance. One of them was heavily inebriated and was holding up the other by their collar, as they were ready to throw a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me *hic* back my *hic* money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI keep telling you, I don\u2019t have your money, it\u2019s still in the safe with all our other- Joyce your back! Help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the two, Joyce would smile as she towered over the inebriated mook by 3 feet, cracking her knuckles as she would grab him by the back of his collar and hold him into the air. Quickly raising him up a bit more, she would throw him as hard as she could, causing him to land a good few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay away from here until your sober again! I won\u2019t accept a slobbering drunk who attacks his own men!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her sights back to the base, she would push the other guy aside as he would approach her, before opening the double doors and walking into the Red Wing Tavern. Hidden in the back alleyways of Angel\u2019s Peak, the tavern was a old-timey biker bar, with all of the crew\u2019s motorcycles lined up in a row, while the inside would have more of a wild western feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Joyce would eventually see Queenie, as she would be looking through a list on some clipboard. Having known her since she was banished to Earth, Joyce considered Queenie her best friend, and she trusted her with the business end of the gang and running it while she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did consider helping her figure in exchange though. Being 50 pounds heavier and 2 and a half feet shorter than Joyce, Queenie had a huge dark gut on her body, and her behind settled in a heavy pear shape that required her getting a custom-made cycle to suit her weight and figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Joyce approach her, Queenie would smile as she would dart between her boss and her clipboard. \u201cAh, Joyce... so, how goes your morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, nothing impressive. So, what exactly are we doing today? Y\u2019know, aside from our usual riding around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her clipboard and reading it, Queenie would let out a small smile. \u201cWell...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Not really caring about traditional demon values, Lucy would sleep all day if she could, but food costs money, and at least she\u2019s not gaining the brunt of the weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy starts off with a slight potbelly and a otherwise average figure. Her gains can go in any way, from her belly being the center of gaining, to her breasts or behind taking the brunt instead. She does have the potential for height growth as well, but more than often will stay the same height unless she gets really massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnathan Nancy<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nWeight: 120 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20195<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather unique case of a half-demon, Johnathan Nancy is a man who works the town\u2019s sole bar. A bit of a chubby chaser at his own word, he\u2019s had trouble in love due to many of his dates not seeing the same way, either wanting to burn off weight, or wanting him to gain instead. Perhaps one day he will be able to find some sort of perfect date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnathan starts out at a average height and build, with no discernible muscles or fat. He tends to gain in his upper body, as well as in his belly. He has the potential for growth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa Holdem<br>\r\nAge: 17<br>\r\nWeight: 340 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 5\u20196\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heaviest of the students in Seraphim High School, Vanessa is the school\u2019s resident tech wizard, understanding how to use technology in ways that benefit herself. She wants to use these skills to live a life of hedonistic gluttony, but as with any such life she has ended up being pestered by other students to help them as well. Can she find time for herself while helping other students with their dreams of relaxation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa starts out already fat, with a heavy pear-like figure. This figure will only get wider as she gets fatter, and her breasts will only be close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie Arnell<br>\r\nAge: 32<br>\r\nWeight: 260 lbs.<br>\r\nHeight: 4\u201911\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA farmhand of a demon working the fields of Angel\u2019s Peak, Bessie Arnell is a rather isolationist of a woman. As long as she works on the farm and nobody bothers her while she tends the fields, nothing bad does happen. But between using appetite stimulants on her crops and selling them at a expensive price, she\u2019s seen as sort of a black sheep of the community. Perhaps by getting a subserviant worker, she can show them that she\u2019s relatively fine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie Arnell starts out relatively thin for her weight except for her breasts, which are massive for her chubby figure.

However, even before the discovery of the supernatural, Angel\u2019s Peak was known for its cuisine, and both men and women usually ended up growing quite round and large, and it remains unknown if the same fate is to befall to the new residents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel\u2019s Peak is a quality-driven Weight Gain Interactive set in a small town where the divine have chosen to migrate to. If you do not like weight gain or are scared of the supernatural, I suggest you turn away. Go ahead, there\u2019s no penalty if you do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those who stayed around, Angel\u2019s Peak is a mutual weight gain interactive, meaning both men and women are capable of gaining weight. The minimum age for such weight gain is 15, and please don\u2019t portray sexual acts for those characters under 18. You can have them gain weight but not have them be lewd. Magical or scientific methods of weight gain or growth are allowed, but no instantaneous methods, such as suddenly gaining a hundred pounds from nothing. Giantess growth is also allowed, to a limited degree of only up to 50 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, be sure to have fun! I will maintain a certain amount of quality control to make sure it looks good, but as long as each chapter is around 3000-Max characters, has proper grammar and follows the rules, all should be okay. When it gets big enough I\u2019ll create a character archive too, to help people keep track of their characters as well! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow get on writing!</div><br>\r\n</td>",
