You've been studying under Bobobo and learned the superfist of the videogame and as an added bonus taught you to master the art of wiggin so you're now a wiggin specialist. \"Wait a minute I don't wear a wig so how can we be this wig-bro guy?\" you ask. However the gang seem not care so they reveal the leader Don Patch. However Don Patch is a little out of it. \"Hey our Christmas ornimate!!\"both you and Bobobo say in unison. Both you and Bobobo put Don Patch in a pine tree like those bobble balls. \"Wait a minute I'm no Christmas ornimate!\" Don Patch exclaimed. He was impressed with both you and Bobobo so he challenged you to a wiggin out contest. The only question is what is the theme.</span></div></div>",
