He started to eat the fries and very quickly they had disappeared into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached some traffic lights they began to change, he decelerated, depressed the clutch, put the car into neutral and applied the handbrake - Barry always seemed to get held up at these traffic lights.  He reached for the milkshake and had drunk just over half of the thick liquid, when the lights began to change.  He returned the cup to his cup holder and started off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hundred yards Barry approached the main road, he joined the traffic easily and reached for the sandwich.  He drove with one hand on the wheel, the other holding the sandwich and quickly devoured it in eight bites.  He loved the crispy chicken, the warm bread, the sweet lettuce and the cool mayonnaise.  He licked his fingers and reached for the milkshake again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gulped down the rest of his drink, Barry saw the turning for home ahead, he indicated and turned off the main road.  After a few moments he pulled into the local shopping precinct parked the car near a waste bin.  He'd been doing this for a few months, he'd get out of his car with the evidence of his gluttony and stuff it into the waste bin, hoping no one he knew would see what he was doing.  Barry wasn't sure why he didn't admit that he ate like this to his wife (or anyone else), it was just easier to dispose of the wrappers than have the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barry got back into his car, he remembered that his wife was at a hen party and so it wouldn't have mattered if he'd gone home directly, it was just he'd got into a routine.  He started the car and a few minutes later he pulled into his driveway, he noticed that his wife's car was also on the driveway, but perhaps Sarah had been picked up by a friend.  Barry entered his house and he heard Sarah say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, darling, it's me.  I thought you'd already have left for your party?\" said Barry, putting down his briefcase, taking off his jacket and placing his keys in the bowl on the hall stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm upstairs, can you give me a hand?\" came his wife's faint reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry started climbing the stairs wondering what the problem was, as he reached the top of the stairs he noticed to himself how heavily the McDonald's was sitting in his belly - he wasn't full, but he could feel it down there.  Also his heart-rate was up and he was breathing a little faster, not surprising really, he'd packed on over 40lbs since Christmas and wasn't taking regular exercise.  Barry entered the bedroom and saw Sarah standing in front of the mirror, struggling to zip up her dress.  He moved over to her and helped her get it done up.  Turning around she kissed him lightly and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that, it must have shrunk a little in the wash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know doubt\", said Barry, \"You know the tumble-dryer has that effect.\"  He stood back from her while she brushed her hair and applied her make up, looking at his wife he thought that she'd put on a little weight (only a couple of pounds), but it seemed to have gone to her top and bottom, rather than her middle.  He thought she looked better with the added weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made you dinner, it's in the oven keeping warm\" said Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Great, thanks.\" said Barry, he must of forgotten to mention that the guys were coming round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finished up and turned to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\" said Barry.  They then when downstairs, in the hallway as Sarah put on her coat and grabbed her bag, she said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm running late so I have to go, enjoy your time without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\", said Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave him another kiss, picked up her car keys and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry went into the kitchen, already slightly missing his wife, but looking forward to his evening's plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking out the plate which was keeping warm, he saw it was piled high with mashed potato and there had to be half a dozen of the local butcher's sausages swimming in onion-gravy.  'Sarah certainly knew how to cook satisfying meals', thought Barry.  He placed the plate down at the kitchen table and retrieved a knife and fork from the cutlery draw.  He then went to the fridge and pulled out a beer, opening it he sat down and ate the meal his wife had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry had noticed that over the last few months his wife had been cooking heavier and larger meals, once this meal would have had only half the mashed potato and three (or occasionally four) sausages.  As he dug into his food he also remembered how in January the shelves in the crockery cupboard had given way and all the plates and bowls had been broken.  This had meant that Sarah had insisted they go and by a new set of crockery, but Barry had been surprised when she'd insisted they go for a set that was a pretty large size - it had 'gourmet range' in the name and had extra large rims to all the plate and bowls.  Apparently, Sarah said, it was going to be the next 'big thing' and everyone would have this style plate in a few years - Barry wasn't convinced, to him they looked like the sort of plates you got in restaurants with a tiny piece of meat, one carrot and a couple of peas all disguised with some sort of foam emulsion or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been thinking about crockery, Barry hadn't noticed how much he'd been eating, but his mind jolted out of its reminiscences when he discovered his fork was failing to find any more food to pick up.  He looked down at his plate and using his knife and fork scooped up the last remaining spots of gravy-soaked potato into his mouth.  He leaned back and took a good swig of beer, he brought his hand to his belly and gave it a light rub.  Barry could see it was full, and feel how much bigger it was getting.  'I'm getting fat', he thought.  He spent a few minutes enjoying the sated feeling of his belly and finishing his beer, then he looked at the clock, it was just past six, the guys would start to arrive at seven.  He need to shower and change and then start to prepare the food for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry stood up, rinsed his plate and cutlery in the sink and put them into the dishwasher.

He then left the kitchen, climbed the stairs and entered the bathroom.  He removed his tie, hanging it behind the door and started to unbutton his shirt, he saw that the fabric was starting to gape around his belly, he pushed his belly out and enjoyed seeing the gaps widen further.  He continued to undress and put each of the remaining items into the laundry basket, one by one.  When he bent down to take off his socks, he suddenly comprehended how full he was as there was a slight reflux in his esophagus.  He straightened immediately and held his dinner down, raising his feet onto the toilet seat he was able to get his socks off without upsetting his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce undressed, Barry went into the shower and delighted in the hot water cascading over him as he washed the dirt of the day away.  He grabbed some shower gel and began to lather himself up, first his hair, then neck, shoulders, arm-pits, arms, chest and down to his belly.  He lingered on his gut, massaging it firmly with both hands and aiding the digestive process.  He let out a burp, which was tinged with the taste of banana and sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's attention to his stomach had not gone unnoticed by his dick which had been getting harder since he started lathering up.  His hands moved over his love-handles and round to his buttocks.  He'd been oblivious to how much bigger they were getting and he looked over to the big mirror opposite to see his reflection while he continued to lather up.  Noticing his hard on, Barry moved his hands round front, finished lathering up his legs and then spending some time adding to the soap suds.  He rinsed himself off, and stepped out of the shower, taking a towel from the rail nearby he dried himself off.  As he rubbed himself dry, he began to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplacing the towel on the rail, Barry picked his tie off the back of the door and wandered nakedly into the bedroom.  He hung his tie up and started to look through his clothes.  He sprayed himself with deodorant, combed his hair and ran a hand over his chin, noticing in the mirror his five o'clock shadow.  Pulling out underwear, socks, a pair of comfortable jeans, a mid-blue T-shirt and a lighter blue jumper he got dressed.  The jeans weren't roomy, but they fit him, without being tight around the waist and nicely showed of his behind, the T-shirt and jumper clung to his belly demonstrating how much it had grown in the last few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the clock...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He headed downstairs into the kitchen, gathering his thoughts as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Barry said to himself, \"I need to get the chicken on, the gammon steaks from the fridge and prepare the glaze, put the potatoes and vegetables on, make the sauce, heat some rolls, put the nibbles out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry set to it; he gathered up the different ingredients he'd need, and got out pans, bowls and utensils, turning on the oven as he made his way to the fridge.  He was making gammon steaks with a maple and walnut glaze (or crust he thought to himself), laying the steaks in a roasting pan he liberally coated them with maple syrup and a little oil before sprinkling chopped walnuts on the top and finishing with a good grind of black pepper.  He'd prepared the chicken yesterday, pancetta wrapped chicken stuffed with basil, sun-blushed tomatoes and pine nuts, it was wrapped in tin foil parcels in the fridge and needed to be cooked in the oven for 35-40 minutes, before the tin foil was removed and the pancetta allowed to crisp up for 15-20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven bleeped to signal that it was up to temperature so he put the chicken in, then he filled the steamer pan with water and added some salt.  He opened the bag of new potatoes, washed them and put them on the hob to boil.  Taking a large head of broccoli, four good sized leeks and a bag of carrots he prepared the vegetables and spread them in the steamers different sections (carrots at the bottom, the others in the top (who likes soggy broccoli?)).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the time he saw it was just past quarter to, so he opened a bag of honey roasted peanuts and a family sized bag of crisps and poured them into serving dishes and took them through to the lounge, helping himself to a couple as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the kitchen, Barry could see the steamer was now boiling, so he turned the heat down a little to let it simmer.  He then put the gammon into the oven and went and got the bread rolls.  He placed the eight bread rolls on a tray and placed it in the top oven to be gently warmed by the heat of the main oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that the table needed to be set, Barry went through to the dinning room and spread a table cloth and opening the sideboard laid place mats, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, side plates and napkins.  He returned to the kitchen to get the butter and the other condiments before taking these to the dining table.  Glancing at his wrist watch he saw he'd only about five minutes until his friends started to show up (if they weren't early).  He just had time to start the vermouth sauce for the chicken, he finely chopped six shallots, which he put into a pan with some oil on a low heat to start to soften, he added some herbs to the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But as the last five years had progressed they had slowly changed into a sort of gastronomy club, he wasn't quite sure when it had started, it must have been over a year ago.  Once a fortnight the guys would get together at one of their houses, usually ensuring their wives and children weren't there, the person whose house it was would cook a main course and the other three would each bring a dessert.  Beer, wine and spirits would flow, until the guys went to bed - they always stayed the night because they were usually too drunk to drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could also have been part of the reason why Barry had been packing on the pounds, these meals were usually very rich and there was always plenty to eat.  Also with three desserts to tackle, it wasn't difficult to really indulge in their shared passion for good food - and Barry was certainly happy to indulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Barry was reflecting he'd opened a carton of cream and poured a good half pint into the sauce, this needed to reduce again by half.  He could hear the guys in the lounge chatting, it wasn't distinctive enough to make out what they were saying, probably just catching up with each other since the last time they saw each other.  In a lull in the conversation, Barry called out, \"Mark, does your pudding need to be heated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause, a moments silence from the lounge, then Mark responded, \"That would be great, steam it for about forty minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are.\" Barry replied.  He knew it wouldn't be a problem to put it into the steamer once the vegetables were done.  He could hear the conversation in the lounge pick up again, then there was some loud laughter (probably Paul telling a joke) before the conversation appeared to resume at its previous pitch.  He gave the sauce another quick stir and took a swig of his beer.  'Time to serve up', he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were the 16oz gammon steaks with maple and walnut glaze, each with a thick rind of crispy, maple sweet fat down one side.  The pancetta wrapped chicken parcels oozed with juices and Barry had generously stuffed each one with the sun blushed tomatoes, chopped basil leaves, toasted pine nuts, shallots and breadcrumbs (the bread crumbs absorbed a lot of the bacon fat).  A gravy boat with the vermouth sauce, rich, creamy and incredibly calorific.  A piled bowl of warmed bread rolls and another of new potatoes with a good knob of butter.  Three dishes containing each of the vegetables, again each with a good knob of butter.  Two bottles of chilled white wine (a sauvingon blanc and a semillon chardonnay) were in their wine coolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys were round the table, salivating.  The aromas which had been permeating the air had become even more intense as Barry had brought the items to the table.  As each new dish had appeared the guys appetites had been tantalized and they delighted in each new dish, complementing Barry as each new dish appeared with appropriate adulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, those look delicious\", or<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a wonderful smell, I can't wait to start\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys dug in, none of them stinted themselves - they all helped themselves to a steak, a chicken parcel (with lashings of sauce) and a bread roll each and took good helpings of the vegetables.  There were some differences in what each man took, Paul and Barry had probably taken the largest helpings, with Barry perhaps just having a little more than Paul.  Steven and Mark had taken slightly less than the other two, but still had good man-sized portions on their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all enjoyed the delicious food which had been prepared, savoring each mouthful, drinking their wine and chatting about the usual things, when their mouths weren't full with another gorgeous forkful of food.  The conversation hummed along, it wasn't particularly riveting, and the guys mainly concentrated on their food, but it was kept up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barry's plate began to become visible as more of the food entered his mouth and found it's way into his growing belly, he began to feel increasingly full.  He looked down at his plate; he'd devoured about three quarters of the steak, most of the chicken and vegetables and had only a couple of potatoes still to eat - not to mention half a bread roll on his side plate lavished in butter.  He paused for a moment, straightened his posture, stretched his ribcage and pushed out his belly.  He then took a good sip of his wine, draining his first glass.  Taking the semillon chardonnay he offered top ups to the other guys, then refilled his glass.  This action seemed to give him more room and he renewed his onslaught upon his stomach by scooping up more food and putting it in his mouth.  The other guys had noticed this action and had passed significant looks to one another, which Barry hadn't noticed being too engrossed by his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guys cleared their plates, Mark started offering the last of the potatoes and the vegetables to each of his friends.  He paid particular attention to Barry, ensuring that Barry accepted the offer of another helping which Paul generously filled his plate with, even more so that the other guys.  He also handed round the bread rolls, neither Mark nor Steve took a second bread roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was beginning to feel really full, he'd slowed down and was taking more sips of his wine.  His belly was swollen and stretching tighter the fabric of his T-shirt and jumper.  The waist of his jeans which had seemed so comfortable earlier when he changed into them now seemed to be shrinking.  Somehow Barry managed to finish his second helpings, but just as he'd eaten the last forkful, Steve this time started scrapping the last remnants of the meal onto his plate and passed him another roll.  The other roll had been taken by Paul, who'd eaten almost as much as Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can eat that.\" said Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can.\" said Steve, \"You can't be full yet, look at Paul, he's still eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry looked across to Paul who was thickly spreading butter on his third roll.  Barry looked down at his plate and then started buttering his roll.  Mark poured him another glass of wine, which Barry gratefully accepted and then started clearing his plate again.  The slight competitiveness with Paul was just enough for him to knuckle down and clean his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the food was gone and Mark and Steve started clearing the table while Paul and Barry who had eaten the most reclined as best they could in their dining chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He let out a burp himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign of a good meal that, Baz.  I don't know how you manage to make such delicious food?  I just can't stop eating when there are such appetizing morsels on offer.\" said Paul, smiling at Barry as he continued to massage his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry just inclined his head in a show of appreciation of Paul's comments, the three beers and the wine were starting to affect him and his overladen stomach was protesting at the quantity of food he'd consumed.  Strangely, perhaps, he could feel his stomach loosening up as he massaged it, it wasn't really full, just well filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to be careful, Amanda commented this morning that I was getting fatter.\" said Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you need to worry.\" said Barry, \"I'm the one whose put on forty pounds since Christmas.\" grabbing his gut and pushing it out to demonstrate his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've put on some weight, but you can't be bigger than me.  I bust the zipper on my pants this morning while getting dressed - I think that's what got her attention.\" stated Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry looked at his friend, he guested they were about the same size.  He wondered if he would stay roughly the same size as Paul or would he keep getting bigger.  At the rate he had been gaining he'd definitely be bigger by Christmas, especially if he continued to stuff himself like he'd done that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They could here Mark and Steve in the kitchen getting dessert ready, but it seemed to have been taking them quite a long time to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Steve returned to the dining room carrying a tray holding Paul's coffee cake, his tiramisu and a jug of cream, behind him followed Mark with his steaming summer fruits pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul's coffee cake had three layers, with each one sandwiched with a thick layer of coffee flavored butter icing.  The top of the cake also had been thickly iced with and decorated with twelve walnuts, like a clock face.  It had to be eight inches in diameter and almost four inches high with a beautiful golden brown color to the sides of the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's tiramisu was in a rectangular glass dish, about twelve inches long by six inches wide and three inches deep.  The layers of coffee and rum soaked sponge, mascapone mixture and cocoa powder could be clearly seen through the glass.  Steve had topped his dessert with a final dusting of cocoa powder and chunky pieces of plain, dark chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's summer fruits pudding was steaming as it was placed on the table, the bread had absorbed the berry colors amazingly, so that the outside now had a deliciously vibrant cerise color to it.  It was a good eight inches height and had a seven inch diameter.  Mark had chosen a mixture of raspberries, blackcurrants and redcurrants to fill the pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Steve was serving up the dessert to each of the guys, Barry went to the kitchen and came back with a decanter of port and a bottle of dessert wine, sauternes.  Barry was glad of the opportunity to stand up, it allowed him another opportunity to stretch, which seemed to ease the pressure in his sizable paunch.  In fact he now felt that he wouldn't have much trouble devouring his desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach man knew how the dessert course when, each man had to eat a quarter of each of the three desserts and they were not allowed to leave the table until all their desserts were eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough each of the men had eaten really well and were all comfortably (more or less) full.  The slight delay between courses, the alcohol and the simulating effects of the attractive and appetizing food all had their effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry, like the rest, dug into his desserts first hitting the summer fruits pudding which he'd drenched in cream.  The berries burst with sweet fruit flavor as he shoveled them and the juicy bread pudding into his maw.  He loved the warmth of the steamed pudding contrasting with the chilled cream, but also the lovely interaction on his palate of the sweetness and tangy fruit against the smooth, luscious cream.  He made short work of that pudding and reached for his glass of dessert wine and had a few palate-cleansing mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he moved onto the the tiramisu, this was one of Steve's regular items.  Barry took huge spoonfuls of the sinfully indulgent dessert.  The soggy sponge and the rich, creamy custard slid down his throat with ease.  No need to really chew this one and he sucked it up like it might have been taken away from him at any moment if he didn't do so.  The bitter intensity of the cocoa and plain, dark chocolate chunks contrasted with the sweet, creamy and alcoholic dessert.  swiftly the tiramisu was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry looked up from his plate, the other guys we equally as intently consuming their desserts, they were a bit behind Barry, but each was making good progress.  He took his glass again and had a few more mouthfuls of wine.  His belly was beginning to protest again.  He'd stuffed the first two desserts down quickly, and now his belly was signally that it didn't appreciate this kind of abuse.  It wanted time to make room for the recent arrivals, but Barry looked at his quarter of the coffee cake and took a large forkful and brought it to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coffee cake was gorgeous, the cake itself was moist and rich, with a beautiful texture.  The icing was sweet, buttery and delicious and make the cake better than any shop bought cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Barry's t-shirt and jumper were stretching tighter and tighter across his growing gut, it didn't prevent him from finishing all his desserts before the other three.  He leaned back from the table and began to ease his stuffed gut with slow and careful movements of his hands over his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He blearily opened his eyes and the strong summer sunshine was already making an unwelcome intrusion into the bedroom, even through the lined curtains.  He slowly eased back the covers on the bed and swung his legs out while sitting himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's head ached.  He pulled himself up and padded off to the bathroom to relieve himself.  Feeling more comfortable and more awake as he stood in front of the bathroom sink washing his hands, he could see himself in the bathroom mirror.  His belly was really swollen under his pajama top, bowing down the waist band of the pajama bottoms, but it was no longer fully stuffed, as it had been last night when he'd finally climbed into bed.  Having dried his hands on the hand towel, be moved them over the rotund mass of his paunch, this action stiffened his cock a little (as it always did of late).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his foot, Barry pulled the bathroom scales out from against the wall and pressed the corner.  The red digital displayed flashed three times blank and then came to a steady 00.00.  He stepped on the scales wondering what damage last night had done.  It had become a routine for Barry to weigh himself on Sunday mornings and he'd found himself becoming increasingly interested in each weeks steadily rising report of his weight.  It might only have been a pound or two a week, but it had been heading inexorably in an upwards direction.  Last week he'd weighted 240lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the display and having to lean forward slightly to see past his growing gut, Barry read the latest reading - 243lbs.  'A three pound gain in a week', Barry thought as he stepped off the scales, 'No wonder this belly seems bigger'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's cock was pleased and so Barry returned to the bedroom, wrapped himself in the warm bed linens and pleasured himself, thinking about how big and fat he was and how he wanted to grow bigger and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry laid in bed for a while, letting the warm cum soak through his pajamas, but eventually he knew, despite his headache, that he'd need to get up, clean himself up, dress and prepare breakfast for himself and the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tell you what, I bet I can eat more than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry felt his cock stiffen, he looked at Steve.  He knew that Steve was a big eater, who knew where it all went, but he could certainly pack it away.  Barry could hardly believe what he'd just heard.  His friend wanted to compete with him over how much they could eat and who could eat the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sure.\" said Barry \"Let me just fill my plate with what you've already taken and we'll begin.

In only moments their first plates were cleaned, both almost at the same time.  They loaded up again and forced it into their mouths and down their throats, taking gulps of fruit juice to wash it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was beginning to gain a slight lead over Steve, as he finished slightly ahead of him.  Barry started to load his third plate and noticed that his belly was swelling under his clothes and that the waistband of his pants was getting tighter.  He started to devour his third plate.  Steve saw he was beginning to slip behind and so when he'd finished his second plate, he released the button on his trousers, which gave him a bit more room.  Piling his third plate with food he tucked in with a renewed passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this had not stopped Barry developing his lead.  He'd finished his third plate while Steve was only half way through his.  He took more food and began to gobble it down.  Steve was beginning to slow.  Although he had a good capacity and appetite he was still quite full from the previous evening and he wasn't used to forcing food down at a competitive rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Steve finished his third plate, Barry was already almost done with his fourth.  Steve looked over at Barry and resigned himself to Barry's gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed... I think you can finish the rest.  I can't believe you're still eating.\" said Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry murmured his ascent and continued to eat until all the food was gone. Leaning back he could see and feel how stuffed his stomach was.  The buttons on his shirt was gaping and the waistband of his pants was digging into his fleshy corpulence.  He could also feel a growth under his belly, it seemed to have swelled as his belly had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're becoming quite the porker Baz.  Keep this up and you'll be huge by Christmas.\" said Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that big.\" said Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve just raised an eyebrow as they both looked at his gigantic gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stuffed these down in the car as he made his way to church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChurch was the usual array of prayer, praise, worship, thanksgiving, repentance, hymns and blessings.  If Sarah had noticed his bulging belly she didn't comment on it, nor did anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter church, as they had been doing for a couple of months, they went to a great all-you-can-eat Sunday carvery, where Barry as usual ate a huge amount of the delicious roast meats and vegetables as well as dessert.

August was hot and the brief time in the baking sun had really affected them, especially Barry.  In the hall, Sarah turned to Barry and drew him close to her giving him a warm, comfortable hug.  Barry could feel his belly pressing into Sarah which only emphasized how much he'd eaten and how full he still was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to join me for a constitutional?\" Sarah whispered into Barry's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned towards the stairs, allowing her hand to gently graze her husband's engorged gut.  What Barry didn't know was that his growing belly and gluttony were a real turn on for his wife, she'd found herself increasing aroused by how much her husband had stuffed himself as his paunch pumped up his shirt at the restaurant.  She found it really hot to see her husband eating increasingly large meals and packing on the pounds, indeed she'd been wanting Barry to satisfy her desires ever since they got in the car.  Barry's cock stirred in his pants, he didn't need asking twice and followed his wife up to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them found the constitutional amazing, it was the best Sarah had ever had.  Barry having been uncomfortably gorged at lunch and still slightly fuzzy had risen manfully to the occasion and ensured they both fully enjoyed themselves.  Barry was now lying on his side cuddling his wife as they composed themselves.  Sarah turned to him and gave him a long sensual kiss.  Pulling away she whispered, \"You were good.\"  and moved her hand down towards his swollen stomach.  Barry continued to lay their enjoying the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you've been putting on weight, darling?\" said Sarah squeezing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of hard to miss how huge my belly has grown recently.\" said Barry somewhat nervously, concerned at where this conversation might be leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I love you.\" Sarah murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh God!' thought Barry, 'Here it comes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been noticing how you've been getting bigger lately and how it's had an effect here.\" Sarah moved her hand down to playfully stroke Barry's shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What was she saying', thought Barry now very confused and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you'd be willing to keep gaining weight, I quite like the idea of you being more cuddly?\" said Sarah, he voice trailing off as she ended her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry almost couldn't take in what he'd heard.  His wife wanted him to get even bigger.  No wonder she'd been making larger meals and encouraging him to eat more.  His weight gain since the start of the year seemed to make more sense.  Realizing he'd not said anything for a couple of moments and wanting to break what he suddenly discerned as an awkward silence (in which Sarah had stopped stroking him), he moved his hand to brush her hair back from her face and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The alarm beeped annoyingly and Barry slowly moved his arm from under the warm, cozy bed sheets to switch it off.  He felt comfortable and didn't want to get out of bed.  He could hear Sarah just breathing audibly next to him, not really a snore, more like a purr.  It was an endearing quality to him.  Barry, carefully disentangled himself from the bedclothes and got out of bed.  He padded drowsily into the bathroom and turned on the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom light was one of those energy efficient ones which meant that the bulb didn't blind you straight away, but gently warmed up to its full brilliance over about a minute.  As the light grew Barry could see himself in the bathroom mirror.  His pajama top was really tight on his still distended gut, he gently twisted from side to side to have a better view of his protruding paunch.  He looked at the straining fabric and thought that he better pick up a larger size soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off his pajama top revealed his massive gut, the waist band of his pajama pants had ridden low below the bulge of his belly and made the whole thing look even larger.  He could feel the material of the pants stretch across his buttocks, not excessively tight, but pleasingly so.  Trying to get a view in the mirror, he could tell that his butt was also growing.  He removed his pajama pants and sat on the toilet to relieve himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he felt better and more awake, he washed his hands, brushed his teeth and then moved into the shower. In the mirror opposite, Barry could tell that his belly was stuffed.  He didn't feel as totally stuffed as he had when he went to bed, but it was clear that all the eating he'd done over the weekend had had an effect.  He soaped himself up and washed himself off, spending time examining his burgeoning belly.  After only a few minutes he was done, he stepped from the shower and dried himself with one of their Egyptian cotton towels.  He ensured that he rubbed himself all over and that every part of him was dry before slipping his robe from its place on the back of the door, putting it on and returning to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Barry would expect to find Sarah still asleep, but she was not in the bed when he entered the room.  He looked round and could distinctly hear her moving around downstairs.  As he began to get ready for the day ahead and dress himself, he called out, \"Is everything alright, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Sarah's response could just be heard, \"I'm just making you breakfast, come down when you're ready.  I'll have my shower while your eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry picked out a pair of trousers from the wardrobe, they were one of his favorite pairs; navy blue, cotton with a forty inch waist.  He put one leg in, then the other and pulled them up, grazing the material past his buttocks.  It was always a bit of a struggle to do them up, Barry liked tight clothing and so he always wore clothes which were a bit tight.  However as he brought the button and buttonhole together it became clear that this would be more than a struggle - a veritable battle of the Bulge.  Barry moved towards the side of the bed and laid back on it, sucking in his gut as much as possible and breathing in, he again tried the button.  This time, after a near miss, he was able to get the button through the hole.  He quickly fastened the zip and stood back up.  Looking in the bedroom mirror, he could tell that these pants also wouldn't last much longer and made a mental note to get a few pairs in a larger size.  He picked out a white,  size eighteen inch collar shirt and put it on, this also was a bit tighter, but the fabric of the shirt nicely spread across his belly and emphasized how much bigger it was.  He then chose a blue tie and tied it in a half Windsor knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Barry entered the kitchen, somehow as he'd showered and dressed his wife had managed to prepare a feast for him, she motioned him to the kitchen table as she transferred bacon from a frying pan onto a plate and placed it in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right I'm going for my shower.  I expect all this to be gone by the time I come down.\" said Sarah looking serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\" said Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the masses of food in front of him.  There was half a dozen rashers of fried bacon, half a dozen sausages, some hashed browns, four fried eggs, four grilled tomato halves, a pile of fried mushrooms, half a loaf of toast and a pitcher of orange juice.  Barry tucked in, enjoying the delicious food and knowing that the more he ate the bigger he'd get and that his wife would be pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Barry half an hour to eat all the food, he'd struggled somewhat with the toast as it was quite dry and he'd left it until last, but by slathering it in butter and jam he was able to make it slide down reasonably easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was just draining the last of the orange juice his wife walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my.  You've done well, I didn't expect you to be able to finish.\" said Sarah, looking pleasantly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry let out a little burp, and pushed his belly out to impress his wife.  Sarah drank in the sight, but despite wanting to take Barry there and then, she knew they both had to get off to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we've got to get going or we'll be late for work.\" said Sarah, she moved close to him, kissed him on the forehead and encouraged him onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was an already hot August Monday and no doubt it would only get hotter, neither of them bothered with coats, just picking up their phones, money and keys and went out to their cars.  Kissing each other, they each departed in their own cars for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hopping into the driver's seat of her SUV, Sarah twisted the air con to max and adjusted the rear view mirror so that it was focused on the left hand side of her husband's gleaming Porsche Panamera further down the drive. That done, she leaned back, humming happily and drumming her fingers on a slender thigh, watching the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving washed his colossal breakfast down with an entire pitcher of orange juice, Barry had realised at the last minute that he needed to pop back upstairs to the bathroom before setting off for work. With his car blocking her in, there was nothing Sarah could do but wait. She didn't much mind. The SUV was comfortable, and by angling the mirror as she had she was looking forward to getting a perfect view of her husband's hefty bubble butt when he waddled out to his car. It was well worth being a few minutes late to work for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill keeping an eye on the door, Sarah pulled out her phone and fired up whatsapp, sending a picture of Barry's multiple breakfast plates to Amanda, empty but for a few smears of ketchup, butter and grease. She followed the picture with a wide-eyed emoji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled as she tucked her phone away, looking forward to her friend's response and reflecting on a whirlwind of a few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all started during the hen party the other night. Sharing a room, she and Amanda had been drunkenly discussing their adorable husbands and had somehow gotten onto the topic of how both men had been putting on no small amount of weight in recent months. Inhibitions lowered by all the alcohol they'd consumed, Sarah and Amanda had confessed to each other that they'd both found that, far from being repulsed by the extra poundage, they actually found their hubbies' widening waistlines and burgeoning pot bellies quite a turn on. After another round of gin and tonics, Sarah admitted to having sabotaged the crockery cupboard so that she could replace all their existing plates and bowls with super-size ones so that she could serve Barry much bigger portions without him realising, while Amanda confessed to doubling the amount of sugar and cream she mixed into Paul's desserts and hiding his running shoes on more than one occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more gin went down, the conversation had become more candid still, turning to what a thrill both women got out of seeing their respective spouses bulge and overindulge and groan with too-full contentment after an excellent meal; and by the end of the night Sarah and Amanda had resolved to throw caution to the wind and reveal their preferences to their partners, and were raising their glasses in toast to having the future fattest husbands in the whole town. It seemed a perfectly reasonable, after all. Barry and Paul clearly loved to eat and had expressed no qualms about their expanding bodies. And the couples' sex lives had been better than ever recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sober light of the next morning, however, both Sarah and Amanda had been somewhat less sure about confessing their secret fetish to their spouses, loving and secure as their relationships were. But after testing the water by encouraging Barry to eat and drink excessively at the carvery after church (which he did with barely any effort on her part) and after a few drinks for dutch courage herself, Sarah had taken the plunge - albeit in the most subtle and casual way she could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her delight, Barry seemed even more enthusiastic about the idea than she did. The rest of the weekend became a veritable smorgasbord, with Barry stuffing his face with everything she put in front of him, his overfed stomach taut and gurgling after every meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, men do love food,</i> Sarah thought. She glanced down at her watch and then looked back up at the door. It had been nearly five minutes since Barry went to the bathroom. What could be taking him so long? With a tingle of excitement Sarah realised he was probably struggling to get his pants refastened. The button had been stretched to the limit when Barry had sat down at the table - and that was before he'd packed away enough breakfast to fill three hungry people. Six rashers of bacon, six fat sausages, four eggs and five slices of toast, among other things. She really hadn't expected him to come close to finishing, but Barry had polished off the lot - and in just half an hour. Sarah bit her lip. No wonder he was struggling with his pants after eating like <i>that</i>. She was sorely tempted to pop back into the house and jump his bones there and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, however, the door handle turned and her slightly flustered looking husband emerged. The puffed cheeks and red tinge to Barry's face clearly showed he was feeling the effects of rushing around with such a full belly. As he locked the door Sarah took a moment to admire his hefty side profile, the way the fall of his tie was diverted over the great mountain of his breakfast-swollen paunch. As Barry walked (or could she even say waddled?) down the drive, Sarah smirked at the swinging jiggle of his butt, each fat asscheek fully outlined in the seat of those much too tight blue pants. She wondered how much of her husband's new weight would distribute itself to his ass as he continued to gain, and how much would go to further rounding out that majestic middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, those pants are not going to fit much longer mister,\" she murmured out loud. \"Better skip the 42 inch waist and go straight for 44s, I think.\" A surge of sexual excitement passed through her like electricity as she pressed the gas pedal and prepared to back out the SUV behind her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClambering into the driver's seat and wincing as his belly brushed against the wheel, Barry sighed with relief at taking the weight off his feet. Then he let out a throaty belch. The seat was set to lean back slightly an he could feel the weight of his breakfast slosh to the back of his gut, pushing against his organs. <i>Forget these pants, </i>he thought to himself, pressing a first to his chest and twisting out another burp as he tugged the belt across the wide arc of his belly. <i>Many more breakfasts like that and I'm going to need a seatbelt extender.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he planned to turn them down, of course. That had been delicious. And the look Sarah had given him afterwards showed him she'd enjoyed it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Barry backed out of his driveway, the hands free kit in his car started to ring, Sarah's name flashing up on the dashboard. Barry smiled. The two of them actually had similar routes to work, and Sarah's SUV was still directly behind him. But ever since they'd been married the couple had made it a thing to talk to each other on their car phones all the way to their respective offices. He pressed the accept button on the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling darling? Did you enjoy your breakfast?\" Sarah burst into laughter when her husband responded with a greasy belch. \"I'll take that as a yes. Now, I'm doing yoga with Amanda after work, but I'll swing by the supermarket on my way home. Any requests for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffed to bursting with fried goodies as he was, Barry couldn't help rubbing his stomach eagerly. In truth he'd already been thinking about dinner. \"Mmm. How about that three cheese Mexican tortilla bake you made last week? But this time with extra cheese, and pork enchiladas and beef burritos on the side, and sour cream chorizo quesadillas, and empanadas - and nachos to start: plenty of guacamole; and churros for dessert, and-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling!\" Sarah cut in, laughing merrily on the other end of the phone. \"That's too much to remember. Why don't you text me what you want when you get to work?\" She could hear Barry was breathing heavily in his excitement. \"My yoga finishes at four, so I should be able to have the first course ready as soon as you come in. I may even throw in a few Margaritas to help you wash it all down.\" Smiling and shaking her head, Sarah pulled up behind Barry's Porsche at a set of traffic lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she frowned. He had been indicating right, but now he was indicating left. \"Darling, you've got the wrong signal on.\" she said, \"Keep your mind on the road... Darling? Where are you go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she followed Barry left and he then indicated indicated to take the next right, Sarah suddenly realised where her husband was heading. Her jaw dropped. Mouth agog she stared after Barry's car as he turned right while she continued on down the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all that breakfast!\" Sarah chuckled in delighted disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it,\" replied Barry. \"All this talk about food is making me hungry! Yes, hello, get me a big mac with fries and coke. Supersize.. And a McFlurry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry's voice faded with his order and Sarah turned off the call. <i>Forget the 44s,</i> she thought. <i>After today he'll be needing 46 inch pants at least.</i> Pressing the accelerator she tossed her hair and sped off to work, eagerly looking forward to recounting the tale of her husband's gluttony to Amanda at yoga later - and to dinner after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's going to get so fat,</i> she thought.<i></i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh my word.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's neat pencil-thin eyebrows rose continually higher as she thumbed Sarah's mobile phone, scrolling down through the text message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll make himself sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, lowering her bottle of water and accepting her phone back from her friend. \"I'll spread it over the evening - five or six courses. Should give his stomach time to settle in between.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so,\" said Amanda, slinging her towel over her shoulder. \"That's a <i>lot</i> of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't argue with that. She glanced down at the message herself, lip curving into a half-smile. Far from spoiling his appetite, Barry's morning top up at McDonalds after his big breakfast seemed to have made him even more eager for dinner. Just a few minutes after arriving at work Sarah had received the text she'd just shown Amanda: a list of all the foods Barry wanted for dinner. In addition to the Mexican delights he'd excitedly spoken about earlier, the hungry fellow had added shrimp fajitas, spicy potato skins &amp; steak rancheros. Then thoughtout that day he'd sent three additional messages, with even more requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot to cook, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke the words, Sarah almost shivered with lust. She knew all these texts and elaborate dining demands were mostly gamesmanship on Barry's part. Much as she expected him to put away a very big meal, there was no way Barry would eat everything he'd asked for in the texts, and he knew it as well as she did. His ridiculously gluttonous and constantly growing requests were as much an attempt to push her buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was working too. An image of herself fluttering back and forth and back between kitchen and living room, ferrying an endless stream of overloaded plates and steaming platters to Barry as he sat embedded in the couch with his feet up, came into Sarah's mind. She imagined serving him course after course, on and on into the night, while he sank deeper into the couch, his plump belly rising towards the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just the intensity of her yoga session that was making her feel weak at the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Sarah's phone beeped again. Without looking at it she shot a look of knowing surprise at Amanda, who gasped. \"Surely not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah inspected her phone, raised an eyebrow and then turned it to her friend. They both started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god he's so greedy!\" chuckled Amanda under her breath, as there were still a few of the other girls in their yoga class milling around. She leaned in conspiritorially. \"You know, Paul ate a big brekky too. Polished off a big stack of pancakes and two rounds of French toast, even with all the extra syrup and butter I mixed into it all - three rashers of butter-fried bacon too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah raised her eyebrows admiringly. But then she thought of the truly monstrous feast her own hubby had devoured to start the day. Paul's oversized breakfast paled into little more than a large snack by comparison. Sarah kept her smile to herself. Though several years younger than Barry, Paul was a similar height and probably roughly the same weight too. Never much of an athlete, Paul had been handsome and styish despite his glasses, when he'd married Amanda, his wedding suit tight around a pretty hefty pot belly brought on by too much sitting at a computer indulging the thirst for beer he'd cultivated at university. Aafter a year of marriage and Amanda's fine cooking that pot belly that had graduated into a modest beer paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came her pregnancy, and with it all sorts of weird cravings. Marshmallows on ice cream, custard and jello, chocolate on toast, syrup coated cookies, fried chicken wings baked with melted cheese. Amanda's cravings came went as fast as you could say boo, leaving greedy Paul to hoover up the better part of whatever bizarre treat she'd concocted, tasted and then abandoned. Sarah reckoned the plump newlywed must've packed on a good 40lbs by the time Amanda gave birth. Yet since then his weight had stagnated. Despite eating generous meals, he wasn't really getting any bigger. Unless Amanda bit the bullet and revealed her desires, he'd fall way behind Barry in the gaining game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any more thoughts about telling him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda blanched. \"Are you kidding,\" she hissed, glancing round to make sure no one was within earshot. \"He'd go crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed. \"Well suit yourself,\" she grinned deviously, swinging her arm around Amanda and whispering into her ear: \"but will you be able to bear seeing Paul teetering forever around the 250 mark while my Barry balloons into the 300s and beyond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Amanda chuckle ruefully. She nudged Sarah playfully in her skinny ribs. \"Hey, just coz I haven't outed myself as a fat lover doesn't mean Paul's going to stop gaining. I'm the best cook in town, you know! Just because my man isn't in on the plan doesn't mean he won't gain as fast as Barry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Sarah raised her eyebrows as they strolled out through the gym doors. Her competitive spirit was primed. \"Well, what say we put it to the test? This Saturday, my place. Leave Scott with the grandparents and bring Paul around. We'll rustle up a feast while he and Barry watch the game, and then see which husband eats the most. Nothing serious, just a bit of friendly competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Amanda was cautious. She didn't want Sarah and Barry's behavior to give the game away. But the thought of the two hoggish husbands stuffing themselves silly at the table, their fat tummies bulging upwards as she and Sarah plied them with more and more delights, then waddling to the couch where they'd be served dessert, was too much fun to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" she gasped breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Sarah's phone beeped again. She looked down at the message and broke into a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" she said, walking faster now with long strides. \"I need to get Barry's dinner on the go. Sounds like he's extra hungry tonight. Can't keep my fatboy waiting!\"</span></div></div>",

Steve said in shock; 'yeah; I've got a massive sweet tooth, can't do anything else till I satiate it' Barry said; 'you've also got a massive belly; because of that Satiety' Steve said jokingly. 'But any way Barry; I better shoot. I have a few things to do today and I better get a head start on them' Steve said; hugging Barry. 'Try not to eat too much Ice Cream' he said rubbing Barry's belly; before heading off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry waved Steve off as he drove away in his car; he began to walk to the kitchen; 'try not to eat too much Ice Cream? Sounds like a challenge to me hey Belly?' Barry said talking to his belly as he lightly stroked it. 'Time for Sundae's' He said and walked into the kitchen and to the freezer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a tub of ice cream and began to scoop some into a Sundae glass; doing intervals of layers of ice cream; nuts, chocolate sauce, chocolate chips, fudge bits and topping off with whipped cream. He began to slowly work his way through it as his belly was still pretty full from the feast he just ate with Steve; but he made it through somehow; although his sweet tooth was still there so he made another one; which didn't last long either and another....and other; until he had to take his pants off with them digging into his belly too much; he went to spoon some more ice cream out but noticed he'd eaten that entire tub. 'Need more' Barry said as he journeyed over to the freezer again to look for more ice cream; the gaps between his shirt buttons had widened further still and would be unlikely to hold much longer. He rummaged around a bit and found two large tubs of ice cream; he grabbed them and on his way back to the table; a large bowl. He spooned the entirety of the tubs into it and began to pile nuts, chocolate, sauces, chopped banana's and all sorts onto it. He sat there looking at it for 10 minutes; whilst the other food digested a bit and the ice cream had melted slightly; and without warning he dived his head into the bowl and started eating like a pig. He stood up and over the bowl as he bent down to take in the ice cream pile; his belly hung freely and felt good as he gobbled more and more; it pushed harder against his shirt as well as his member against his tight boxers. After 30 minutes of starting and stopping he made it to the bottom; he picked up the bowl and tipped it and his head right back as he finished the remains of it off; his two middle buttons burst off as he did. I put the bowl down and rubbed the bare belly that was now on show; he arched his back slightly as he walked towards the living room; his belly sloshing as he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcefully sitting down on the couch; he looked down 'think I may have eaten to much ice cream; Steve' Barry said to himself; and grabbed his member and pulled himself off, before slowly drifting off to sleep, without changing out of his wet pants or ruined shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 hours; Barry was awoken by</span></div></div>",

Was she finally kicking him out?<br>\r\nHe sat up feeling how his belly sagged over the boxers he wore to bed.  <br>\r\nSuddenly Sarah was beside him, her hands playing with his fat love handles.  Barry tried to suck in his gut.<br>\r\n\"I know, Sarah.\" he muttered.  \"I've been slacking off at the gym and eating too much.  I'll get back in shape.  I promise.\"<br>\r\nThen he felt Sarah kissing his belly.<br>\r\n\"What was I thinking?\"  Sarah whispered.  \"I don't want a skinny, underwear model of a husband- some twinky poser. I want a real man with some heft. I was confused.  I'm sorry about that sweetie, giving you a hard time about your gut and cooking your favorites.  I love your belly and I want you to get bigger. Will you forgive me?\"<br>\r\nBarry was fully awake by now and Sarah's attention was getting him aroused.  Sarah liked him fat.  But was it too late?  At first, he had wanted Sarah to accept that getting older meant accepting weight gain.  then when Sarah gave him a hard time he started to think about options- living single and exploring lifestyle changes.  Barry used to think that Sarah was hot but lately with the nagging and 20 more pounds on her ass, she didn't turn him on anymore. He'd found himself looking at young men and wondering how that might be.  Still, he had a good life and now that Sarah was ok with him getting fat, why mess it up.<br>\r\nBarry made a decision.  He looked Sarah in the eye.<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" he said.</span></div></div>",

Barry squeed with glee, 'what does it say?' Sarah said from behind him, wrapping her arms around his meaty chest; '274lbs, I've gained 28lbs' Barry said, 'mmm well done baby, you are expanding really quickly....in more ways than one' Sarah said as she fondled little Barry, 'mmm I know' Barry said, it didn't take long for him to climax at the thought of getting fatter, 'whats for breakfast?' Barry asked, 'oh....well unfortunately we don't have time for breakfast, we have to be at my sisters by 11, so we need to set off now; i would have woken you sooner but you looked so peaceful' Sarah said, 'its fine, i'll jump in the shower and we could always pick some mcdonalds on the way' Barry said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah kissed him and left him to get ready; Barry ran the hot water all over his body and lathered his belly up to make sure it was all clean. Drying off, he ventured into the bedroom and put on his favourite t-shirt and jeans....both of which did not fit him anymore; the t-shirt was black and extremely snug, it rested just below his belly button, but you could plainly see how deep it was through the t-shirt, his jeans, rested below his growing belly and only seemed to extenuate it, making the t-shirt even more snug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked downstairs, Sarah looked at him and gasped 'Sorry, you did say wear my favourite clothes....even if they are a little snug' Barry said, 'oh no its fine, Janet won't care...Dean might but you are beautiful the way you are' Sarah said, kissing Barry <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kissed again before getting in the car; it was an hour trip to Dean and Janet's, so they stopped off at McDonalds along the way, where Barry got his belly stuffed, his jeans seemed to be only just hanging in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the trip; they got out of the car and knocked on the door; Janet opened, she was two years yonger than Sarah but they were very similar in appearance, she was slender, wearing a floral patterned dress; her hair was shoulder length and light brown in colour; 'oh my god, its so good to see you both!' Janet said, hugging her sister, she then turned to Barry and stared at his belly for a second before hugging him 'come in come in, we are still preparing but come have a drink or something!' Janet said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked through the house; Sarah and Barry waited in the kitchen, whilst Janet went off to find her Husband Dean, after 5 minutes she came back but bumped into Barry's belly 'oh sorry Barry' Janet said, 'no no its my fault, this thing gets in the way a lot' he said laughing and giving it a pat. Janet went a bit red and Sarah smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here Janet, let me help you; Barry you go and sit down' Sarah said, the two woman started cluttering about and began to whisper, Barry could only imagine what about; he sat in the lounge and suddenly felt a pat on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey there Barry!' Dean said, Barry turned around to see Dean, he was around 5'10, but quite muscular, he wore a tight t-shirt that revealed his pecks unlike Barry that revealed his belly, he had short brown hair and chizzled features, 'oh hey Dean!' Barry said shaking his hand, again Barry couldn't help but notice Dean staring at his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Say...I've got to go out and get a few bits, do you want to come with?' Dean asked, 'sure; we haven't had a chance to speak to each other in a while', 'Great' Dean said, he walked to the kitchen 'Honey, me and Baz are going out to get some bits, we'll be back soon' Dean said, 'ok babe, see you boys soon!' Janet said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into Deans car and begin to drive in the direction of the stores; the trip was quiet with only a few words spoken, but as they got to the junction to where the stores are, Dean took a wrong turning. Barry didn't say anything, after half an hour; they went down a dirt road and up to a cliff; Dean stopped the car<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm...sorry for bringing you out here Barry; i just want to know what its like?' Dean said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?' Barry asked, Dean reached over and undid Barry's seat belt and then began to rub Barry's belly; Barry was slightly shocked but slightly turned on by this situation, he'd essentially been kidnapped to get his belly rubbed, 'Sorry, Barry; i just needed to know...It feels so good' Dean said, 'No problem Dean; here let me help you a bit' Barry said as he pulled up his shirt, 'Oh damn Barry; you fat bastard!' Dean said smiling, Barry returned the smile, 'take it you like?' Barry asked, 'I love!' Dean said and suddenly covered his mouth. Barry was perplexed by this....'I'm sorry Barry...I just love guys bellies! Always have.....always wanted to see yours...and when Janet told me about you putting on a few, I had to get a feel for myself' Dean said, Barry chuckled 'well feel away; plenty of it and more to come' Barry said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'More? Damn! I can't wait to see that' Dean said, 'Sarah said I can't be any thinner than 450; can you imagine, i'll be as big as a house!' Barry said, Dean moaned slightly, 'mmm yeah....Barry listen, i need your help!' Dean said, 'Whats wrong?' Barry said, 'Janet caught me looking at big guys bellies....she said, how about we make you Barry 2; she wants me fat like you mate!' Dean said; Barry was shocked, 'Dean....you really need to do this! Its fantastic, eating whatever i want whenever i want....getting so full and turned on by my own belly....i mean if you gained......we' Barry said, stopping mid sentence, 'we could what?' Dean asked, 'Belly bump....imagine, it two fat husbands, getting fatter by their gorgeous wives, letting us bump our bellies together!' Barry said, his erection becoming plain to see; 'whoa....that would be incredible....but where do I start!' Dean said, he took his top off but Barry couldn't help but notice the bulge in his pants too 'well.....You are never too thin to belly bump' Barry said but as he did his belly growled with hunger <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa......I want to'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dean want to do?</span></div></div>",

Beaming delightedly as her husband leaned back in his seat, she tipped the huge serving pan, sending an avalanche of dough balls tumbling onto Barry's scraped-clean plate. Then, reaching for a vast bowl in the center of the table, she poured beef chili liberally over the plateload of dumplings. Finally, she selected six large pieces of cheesy garlic bread from the platter in the center of the table, arranging them in a ring around the edge of her husband's now very full plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the final piece of bread at an angle to match the others, Sarah pecked Barry on the cheek and then stood back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bon appetit, my sweet!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean watched as Sarah returned to the kitchen to fetch her husband another beer, and Barry tucked greedily into his third helping. He felt Janet's hand on his shoulder, and looked up to see her holding a pan of dumplings, an expression of hope in her pretty eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm honey, I thought maybe you'd care for some more dumplings too,\" she suggested softly. \"Uh, before Barry scoffs them all,\" she added, lowering her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his lips, Dean leaned forward and opened his mouth. Then, catching Barry's warning cough, he quickly shut it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been about to agree wholeheartedly. The dumplings and the accompanying chili were absolutely exquisite. The girls had obviously pulled out all the stops to provide their husbands with a meal they'd remember. He desperately wanted more. But Barry's warning had reminded him of their agreement: play reluctant; make Janet really work for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he do? How could he really work this to his advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some moments Dean sat there in thought, puffing out his cheeks slightly, his wife standing expectantly over him, pan at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno hun,\" he said at length, stifling an imaginary burp and resting a hand on his belly, which was slightly convex with one big helping of dumplings and chili inside. \"It's really good, but I feel kinda full,\" he motioned at Barry, who was making short work of his huge third helping, \"wouldn't want to make a pig of myself like this guy,\" (the pig burped in response and continued to eat). \"And I want to leave room for dessert, too,\" Dean went on, before adding, with a shrug: \"besides, I wouldn't want to be too full to help you with the dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet brightened immediately. \"Oh, don't worry about that!\" she smiled, patting him on the shoulder. \"You just leave that to us girls. We said we'd treat you, didn't we? So just relax and, um, eat all you want - it's just for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of apparently deep thought, Dean broke into a smile. \"Well, all right, if you insist.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost giddy with happiness, Janet began to refill his plate. As she did so, Dean glanced sideways at Barry, who subtly raised his glass in tribute to his friend's stroke of genius. Which reminded Dean of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use another beer too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding dutifully, Janet picked up his glass and scurried off to the kitchen. Watching her perky ass depart, Dean grinned widely, skewering a dumpling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hot little wife waiting on him hand and foot? This was going to be great!</span></div></div>",

He looked up at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All bought and paid for,\" he announced, slapping his massive gut - and causing the watching wives to go weak at the knees. \"Skinny guys like you just don't know how to enjoy the finer things in life.\" He leaned back, entwining his fingers behind his head. \"Ain't that right sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes darling,\" cooed Sarah. Failing to constrain her excitement, she stepped forward and pressed her mouth lustily against his chubby lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately, of course, Barry thought Dean had done a splendid job of enjoying those finer things, at least this afternoon. Two big plates of dumplings and chilli had been followed into his lean but eager belly by two large slices of exquisite peanut butter chocolate cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man grinned as his wife pulled away from the kiss. The cheesecake was Janet's recipie, but he strongly suspected Sarah of having a hand in the peanut element. Since they'd expressed their desire for him to gain weight, she'd had her nose buried in countless cookbooks and calorie guides. One morning, as he was recovering from breakfast, she'd waltzed in, a heavy hardback in hand, and announced the startling revalation that peanut butter was more fattening that cream. Since then large amounts of it had been finding their way into many Barry's meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that he was complaining. The stuff was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out of the kiss Sarah licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me fix you another beer to help wash that cake down,\" she said, picking up the glass, a frown formign on her pretty face. \"We're so sorry you guys found it a little dry. We'll definitely do better next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry accepted his wife's apology with a casual wave. In truth he was battling to keep the smirk off his face. That was the best part of all of it. Throughout the evening, despite eating heavily, Dean had stuck manfully to the plan. Dramatically leaving the last dumpling of his second plateful and protesting that he was much too stuffed for dessert, the sly devil had eventually relented to a small piece of cheesecake on the condition that it was served to him in the living room, so that he could put his feet up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Janet had pulled the poof over for his feet and served a decent slice of cheesecake, he'd taken a small bite and then screwed up his face in revulsion, complaining that it was far too dry to eat. A crestfallen Janet had begged him to let her fix it by putting cream on top, which - after some protests - he'd permitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had, of course, still been too dry, prompting poor Janet to rush out and bring the whole tub of cream through to the living room, where she'd transferred her husband's dessert into a bowl and saturated it to the point where it was practically floating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Dean had been able to force down two hefty slices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four, quite naturally, had found their way into Barry's swollen stomach, leaving him very full and contented and the faintest sliver of cheesecake on the plate, which the men had chivalrously suggested the the girls shares between themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe gotta do this more often, thought Barry, burping again and shuffling back in his seat as he lifted his beer glass for a reappeared Sarah to refill. His wife was doing a great job of tending to his wants, alone for sure. He was getting as much as he wanted to eat, and the weight was coming on easily.  It was just... well, having two women at work naturally led to a wider variety of food. Over that past two months he'd eaten a <i>lot</i> of Sarah's pound cakes. It was all good, of course, but the added factor of Janet's less familiar cuisine had been tantalizing, and had really helped him eat particularly big this afternoon. Also, having two women meant that one could cook while the other served, which meant drinks were always topped up and there was no annoying delays between courses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming back into the plush sofa, Barry glanced over at Dean, who was staring at the TV with a glazed grin, absentmindedly stroking the slight bulge of his food-filled gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the first stages of a food coma wash over him, Barry let his own eyelidds droop. Yup, they were onto a good thing here, no question. They definitely needed to do this again.</span></div></div>",

It had been another marathon Sunday with Barry eating like a hog and Dean allowing himself to be coaxed into consuming enogh food for a family of four, all the while complaining  about the shortcomings of the food.  <br>\r\nDean was devloping into a genuine fatboy while maintaining the impression that he didn't much like eating and only with extreme effort was he able to force down the best that the ladies cound offer.<br>\r\nBarry smiled watching Dean fumble under the roll of fat around his middle to let out his belt.  Then when he disscovered that there weren't any more notches, just left it unbuckled and released the pressure by unbuttoning his skin tight jeans.<br>\r\n\"Elastic waistband.\" he told Dean.<br>\r\nDean nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Sarah.\"  Barry called out. \"The game is about to start and Dean tells me he thinks he might be ready for a small piece of cake now.\"<br>\r\nDean grinned <br>\r\n\"Don't let the fat guy fool you Sarah.\" he called. Mr. Bottomless Pit just wants you to start bringing him more food.  I'm stuffed.  If I had to stuff another bite of cake down my throught, it would probably just get stuck.  I could go for something to drink though.\"<br>\r\nDean had gained nearly 40 pounds since the two friends  had dreamed up their new gaining program.  Barry was up another 20 and he was sure that he'd make 300 by Superbowl. As well as the program was working however, Dean wasn't sure how much longer he could play the role of reluctant feeder.  As his belly grew so did his capacity and appetite.  It took so much more to fill him these days that he was always hungry and wanting to eat.  Making his wife plead and coax him to eat was fun but the greedy hog he was becoming  was getting harder to control.<br>\r\nSarah rolled a cart into the Den.  On the cart was a three layer chocolate cake with one quarter missing to reveal the thick icing and rich filling.  That quarter slice was on a dinner plate.  Sarah dished up a pint of icecream next to the cake and served it to her husband.<br>\r\n\"Tubs.\"  Dean called to Barry.  \"You sure you want to eat more?  As it is, it takes a forklift to get your big ass our of that chair.\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, slim.\"  Barry replied.  \"I sure wouldn't want to go from mansize to twink and have your scrawny ass.\"<br>\r\nBarry dig into the cake.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sweetie.\" he told Sarah.<br>\r\n\"If the cake is to dry,\" she told Dean. \"Maybe you would just like some ice cream or mayabe a hot chocolate.\"<br>\r\nWhat Dean desperately wanted was  the cake Barry was suoveling down.  He was definitely becoming a fatboy.  He sighed.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can handle some ice cream.\"  </span></div></div>",

The hungry hog within him battled against the desire to continue to play the reluctant eater and keep his wife on her toes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sarah, howerver, it simply seemed as though this uncommonly difficult male diner was yet again having doubts about the food. \"Ice cream it is,\" she replied to Dean, before turning to Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another slice for the road, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grinned as her munching husband grunted an affirmative, speedily cutting him another massive hunk before turning swiftly to push the trolly out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her face left the guys' field of vision, the pretty blonde breathed a small sigh of relief. Clearly unimpressed with the cake, she'd been half expecting Dean to request (that is, demand) a different dessert. And as much as she <i>loved</i> watching the men eat their fill, she was feeling pretty tuckered out, and she knew Janet was too. Barry's big gut was always hard to keep satisfied, and despite his constant protestations, this was the most she'd ever seen Dean eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, though both girls stayed slim and in shape with yoga and frequent jogging, it had been a particularly long and arduous day for them in Sarah's sweltering kitchen, slaving over hot stoves and rushing back and forth with trollyloads of food and drink for their husbands to stuff their faces with while whooping at the football in the comfort of their den, rising only to relieve themselves. With luck, after the massive meals they'd consumed already, two big slices of cake for Barry, and a warmish helping of ice cream for Dean would send them drifting into a long after-feast nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's hopeful dreams of a well-earned coffee break while the husbands slept through the next game, were shattered by a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing with the trolly halfway through the doorway, the blonde closed her eyes. <i>Spoke to soon</i>, she sighed, even as she fixed a smile and spun round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer questioner was rubbing his belly bulge thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" he began casually. \"Perhaps I could manage a small slice of cake after all. <i>If!</i>\" He held up a hand, stopping Sarah mid trolly turn. \"<i>If</i> Janet would whip me up some eggnog.\" He patted his belly. \"Y'know, to go with the cake. That might soften if enough for me to manage. With the ice cream too, of course,\" he added hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned, slightly caught off guard. \"Oh, well, I dunno if-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might even be able to manage <i>two</i> small slices,\" interrupted Dean, \"I mean, I'm just thinking of Janet,\" he shifted back in the sofa in a way that caused his shirt to rise slightly, revealing the bottom sliver of his chunky lower belly. \"Even if the cake is a bit dry, she's gone to so much effort with it, y'know. I'd hate for her to be disappointed again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's evident inner conflict tasted almost as delicious to the devious guys as her wonderful cooking. The devil on her shoulder obviously wanted to fill Dean's already full belly even rounder, and for once the angel was in alliance with it, saying that this might help Janet feel better about her cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the blonde, though still stunningly beautiful, was looking a little dark under the eyelids - as had Janet when she'd wheeled through that blueberry pie earlier. It was clear the girls were tiring after a long day of indulging their darling husbands' greedy desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two slices?\" Sarah said softly, almost to herself. Dean nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if that's what you want,\" she continued, the devil starting to win through, \"I'm sure Janet can whip some up pretty sharpish.\" With a smile, Sarah swept back her hair and turned to continue pushing away the trolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget our beers!\" hollered Barry after her departing form, winking at a sniggering Dean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back with satisfaction, both men watched Sarah's her pert little ass wiggle through the doorway. No doubt about it: <i>this</i> was the life!</span></div></div>",

Dean is such a prima donna.  Nothing is ever good enough for him and I'm just worn to a frazzle getting him to eat. Sometimes I wonder if it is worth the effort.\"<br>\r\nSarah smiled again.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to say anything because I know you want so much for Dean to get bigger but I think we are being played.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think your Dean is such a reluctant piggy as he wants us to think.  Just think about today.  Just consider how much your reluctant Dean put away.  It's probably hard to notice when Barry is there running interferance but your skinny reluctant Dean ate enough for a high school football team.  Two bags of chips lubricated with guacamole and sour cream and maybe six beers.  Two tubs of chicken wings, a large double meat pizza and a tub of ranch dip to wash it all down.  Then those two slivers of cake with nearly a half gallon of ice cream and your special eggnog with cream and a dozen eggs.  Don't tell me that man doesn't like his food.\"<br>\r\nJanet thought.<br>\r\n\"But he seems so hesitant.  I just want to get him past his obstacles.  I'd love for my Dean to match or even surpass Barry but it is a struggle.\"<br>\r\n\"Here's what I think.  Our guys are working as a team to keep us off guard.  Dean wan'ts to get fat but he wants it to be your effort.  I say we've done enough.  I think Dean is not so reluctant and here's my plan. From now on no more special effort to please Dean.  My Barry would stuff himself with hogslop if that's what I put on the table.  You should just make what you please and stop catering to Dean's special requests.  I think that boy is keen to be like Barry but I say we make him ask for it.\"<br>\r\nJanet was hard to convince.  She had long dreamed that Dean would get fat and afraid that without her effort he'd go back to skinny twinkdom,  Still she was worn to a frazzle trying to keep Dean happy and she finally agreed.<br>\r\nSo when the boys woke up and picked up the next rootball game the girls</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Comfortably settled in the Den, Dean and Barry were enjoying a hazy hour of sipping beers and semi-competitive belching, when the arrival of a mysterious warm scent caused them to gradually fall silent. Nostrils twitched and sniffed the air experimentally, and bellies grumbled eagerly. The two men exchanged a hungry glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah!\" called Barry casually but loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later her lean figure appeared in the doorway. She was drying a large glass bowl with a chequered teacloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes babe?\" she said, coming over all sweetness and innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry licked his lips. \"What you girls got cookin' out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tilted her blonde head, lifting her eyebrows in a wouldn't-you-like-to-know-way. \"Why don't you come see hot shot?\" she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo entranced was Barry by the smell, that he momentarily forgot how fat and lazy he was. Digging his feet into the carpet, he gripped the arms of his recliner firmly, and, after an epic five seconds of grunting and squirming, slumped back in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just bring it out here?\" he panted irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean picked up his cue. \"None for me,\" he sighed placing a hand on his portly abdomen. \"Absolutely stuffed from earlier; that eggnog was way too creamy,\" he frowned, \"really hard to digest.\" Then he motioned at Barry's roundly protruding tummy, heaving with exertion after that ill-fated attempt to get up. \"Lardo here might wanna rupture a gut, but I gotta physique to maintain!\" Dean finished by aiming several gentle pats at his smaller but amply plump midsection, causing it to jiggle chubbily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have another drink though,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if hearing him, Janet took that very moment to burst through the doorway, wheeling a trolly containing a large tray of the aforementioned brownies, and two tall drinks. The men leaned forward eargerly in their seats as she halted the trolly in front of them and handed out the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm becoming a natural at this, thought Dean, grinning as he accepted his drink - a glass of lemonade. A few gulps of this, and then I'll deign to force down a few brownies. Or maybe they'll leave the tray I can take a good share and pretend Barry scoffed the lot. Smiling smugly at the idea, he lifted his glass and took a thirsty swig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And frowned in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This is water!\" he looked incredulously at Janet, who nodded in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sweetie,\" she confirmed, kissing him on the cheek and resting her hand on his middle. \"Said you gotta a little indigestion from the eggnog? S'my fault. Water's what you need - got some antacid disolved in there too for your tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean could only look from his drink to his wife in disbelief. He glanced over at Barry and found the big man gulping beer with his eyes fixed eagerly on the stack of thick brownies Sarah was mounding up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean checked himself just in time. What could he say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you do feel full in there,\" Janet added, pressing a hand lightly against her husband's gut, prompting a short burp from Dean. \"I don't think soda or beer would be such a good idea now hunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Sarah had stradled Barry and was giggling and stroking his nose as she fed him brownies from the plate in quick succession as he lay back with his hands running down her lower back and cupping her pert buttcheeks. Dean watched with growing envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...yeah...But.\" Dean's belly echoed his thoughts with a greedy gurgle. He looked up at his wife, hoping this would prompt her to feed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" she said, interpreting the gurgle as a sign of overfullness. \"Best we give all that fatty eggnog and dried cake a chance to settle,\" Janet leaned foward and tried to suppress a shudder of enjoyment as she rubbed her husband's belly in a circular motion that took her hand over its entire orb-like bulk and caused Dean to belch yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean was annoyed and dumbfounded. But after complaining for vehemently about the eggnog and stating that he was stuffed, he couldn't exactly ask for brownies or contradict Janet's assessment of his stomach. He felt about as metaphorically stuck as Dean looked physically stuck in that chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sarah was giddy with mirth. Not only was Dean getting his comeuppance for being so lazy and deceitful, she was left with an entire tray of brownies to stuff into her man. As her tubby hubby gulped down his tenth piece and immediately opened his jaw for more, Sarah felt his gut press harder into her thighs, swelling up as an abundance of chocolatey dessert joined the massive amount of food he'd already devoured that day. Smirking, she stroked a hand over his bulging flank and reached down the side of the recliner to release the lever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooof!</i> With a grunt of surprise Barry jolted back into a horizontal position, his wife gripping the sides of his shirt, riding him the short distance downwards like a bucking bronco. Once his big belly had stopped jiggling, she leaned sideways and pulled the trolly alongisde the armrest. Both hand free, she selected two more brownies and held them high. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry licked his lips, while Dean looked on forlornly, sipping water and glancing at the now half-empty tray, hoping desperately that there'd be some left for him to sneak from the fridge later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from the doorway, Janet was starting to wonder if Sarah planned this all along.</span></div></div>",

No more games. No more making her 'earn it'.\" Stepping forward, Sarah poked a finger into Dean's budding paunch. You do that and and pretty soon you'll find you're getting everything you want - and plenty more besides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding frantically, Dean hurried towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon you'll be living like a king!\" called Sarah after him. \"Who knows, one day you might even be as regally round as my Barry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through grabbing his coat, Dean paused. Barry. He'd forgotten that the whole thing, the whole \"play hard to get\" approach had been Barry's idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No doubt an attempt to get more food for himself</i>, thought Dean, perhaps a little unfairly. But he was more than a little peeved at his friend for getting him into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" he said casually, slipping an arm into his coat. \"It was Barry's plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned and tilted her head. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole treat her mean, keep her keen thing,\" explained Dean. \"It was Barry's idea - seriously,\" he added as she cocked an eyebrow. \"He said it'd be fun, get her eating out of my hand. Or, aha, get me eating out of hers really, I suppose. Well, see ya,\" He turned for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Dean depart, Sarah was silent for a few moments. Then she followed the sound of snoring back into the living room. Sprawled back in the recliner, Barry was entering the early stages of a food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched his magnificent dome of a gut rise and fall massively, fuller than full with an entire pan of brownies that were so good he'd kept eating and eating even as his belly ached and his shirt rode up, in an act of gluttony that turned her on more than anyone could imagine. But was what Dean said true? Much as she adored her dearly beloved walking belly, it was just the kind of dumb thing he'd try to do. And Dean had no real reason to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pursed her lips. It was clear from Dean's face that he'd learnt his lesson. But, husband or not, if Barry had been involved in upsetting Janet, it was only fair to get back at him, in a gentle way. Sisters had to stick together, after all. The only question was whether to get one up on Dean too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPondering thoughtfully, the blonde beauty tapped her chin. Choices, choices.</span></div></div>",

He'd have to sell the house, split the retirement and set himself up again but it would be all right.  Even better that he had been shifting some of his income under the table and keeping it from Sarah.  What she didn't know wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\nIt was time to celebrate his independence with a decadent feast.  He picked up the phone.  \"Can I order some food please.?

Barry stood their amazed as he began to rub his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is great, i never knew i had t-shirts this small, i can't believe my big fat belly is hanging out of the bottom' Barry said to himself 'wait a minute!

I noticed that from your profile we live in the same city and may have crossed paths many times. As well as gaining i do encouraging on the side and would love to encourage you bigger; this may seem like suc a strange request for a stranger to be asking but I hope that we can work together in making our bellies bigger, if you might be interested we can arrange something here but if not you do not have to respond, I completely understand<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalkingGaia' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry kept rereading that message, this was a big deal, he wasn't sure what to do about it; his curiosity really wanted to go for it as did his belly. Out of sheer curiosity Barry clicked on walkingGaia's pictures; and he was in awe; he appeared to be around 320lbs, but his belly was enormous, it was a ball belly, so large that Barry didn't know how he saw around it, there were images where he'd burst through zips on jackets and hoodies, his belly covered in fine hair with a trial going from his very deep belly button down to his groin. His moobs were quite well defined pecks and Barry could tell that he must have done a lot weights to get his shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was so in awe but he just didn't know what to do. </span></div></div>",

Soon after he had sent it, he got a reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Excellent news Barry; with me helping you; you won't be able to keep up with the clothes sizes as your belly out grows them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll schedule us into the Hilton near the stadium for tomorrow if you are free; do you know it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry; kept reading the first line over and over, it made him hard that he would soon be bursting out of what he was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, Johnny; i know it and i am free! So excited about this prospect; let me know when its booked' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry sent in reply; he continued to search the site and saw some great bellies in hopes of what he wanted to achieve, within 5 minutes Johnny had replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Booked, i've got us two conjoining rooms, they have a shared bathroom in between that we can use, they usually come with scales as well, so we can have some fun on them ;) I'm free most of the day, so i'll probably check in early, but come whenever you are ready; the rooms under John Powell<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee you tomorrow FatBaz'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry, couldn't believe it; he was so excited and a little scared of the prospect, but as he read the name John Powell; something seemed familiar about it, but he didn't have time to linger on the thought as the door bell rang; so Barry shut the PC down and went to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the guys were waiting on the doorstep; Barry let them in and they began to have a great time, a really nice meal, watched a couple of games, chatted with some beers, but Barry kept day dreaming about what was going to happen tomorrow; the evening seemed to be dragging on a bit longer than he expected, but he kept cool throughout; as they continued through the night till about 2am; when the guys had to all shoot off after not realising what time it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry said his goodbyes; cleaned up the kitchen and then headed to bed, it didn't take him long to drift off to sleep but his mind was full of wonder what his life now held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The next morning* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry awoke at 11am; today was the big day, the day he would finally meet Johnny and the end of his days as a relatively slim man. Barry packed; several pieces of clothing, he put some of his tighter cloths in to show off to his fat friend and maybe even get him to wear them and burst them; he put his wash bag in and several other items; he even packed a load of snacks in there, he only just about got his bag shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even bother with Breakfast, he just headed straight to the car and drove to the Hilton Hotel; it took about forty minutes from his house especially at this time of day going through town; but he finally made it, parking up; he grabbed his shoulder bag out of the boot of his car and headed into reception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small young lady was sat behind the reception desk <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good morning sir; may i help you?' The girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'ah yes; I'm meeting a friend here for the evening, he said it'd be booked under his name John Powell' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yes; Mr.Powell is already here, although he did say it was for three nights; is that not correct?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry stopped for a second 'Oh yes, silly me, i forgot what we were doing for a moment' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No problem sir; if you follow this corridor to the left and take the lift to the top floor; you are in room 1410; with the conjoining bathroom; i hope you have a nice stay' The girl said, giving Barry a smile and his room key card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you' Barry said; and hopped into the lift; his heart was pounding a bit at what he was doing but he thought it was all part of it; he was lucky and the lift did not stop until it got to the top floor; they opened largely and Barry stepped out, he looked down the Corridor and could see his room right at the end. He placed his key card into the slot and entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was pretty nicely laid out; a big king size bed, a beautiful view of the city, a mini bar and fridge, a sitting area and various other simple needs that he would need. Barry placed his bag down and opened the door to the bathroom, it was huge! Well it would need to be to support four guests, but he and Johnny were about the size of four together, so it would be fine; there was a large bath, a walk in shower and a beautiful tiled floor and marbled sink; then at the other end, a door similar to the one he had just walked through. The door to Johnny's room; Barry didn't know whether to knock or just walk in; but he found himself absent mindedly reaching for the door handle, opening it up; he walked into the twin room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Johnny, its me Barry' Barry said as he looked around the room; there he saw him, silhouetted by the window looking out to the city with his arms crossed, he slowly turned around and he was just as Barry imagined he'd be, handsome, well cut hair, a bit of stubble; large arms, a tight t-shirt wrapped around his big belly and a tight pair of Levis' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled and it was at that point that Barry realised where he knew the name from! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny is?  </span></div></div>",

Very well built muscle wise, but clearly he'd been doing more than putting on muscle over the years. Barry couldn't believe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my god, Johnny!' Barry said, putting his bag down and walking over to his old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey Barry, great to see you' he said and went in for a hug, their bellies touching together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm...shocked, I recognised the name but I couldn't remember where from' Barry said, Johnny laughed, 'I'm sure my photos didn't give any indication either' he said, whilst giving his belly a pat. 'It was kind of funny though. I knew it was you straight away, I remember being in the locker room and seeing that birth mark just by your pants line and seeing FatBaz with the same one, it just couldn't have been a coincidence' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh whoa, you remember that? Thats a good memory' Barry said, 'An elephant never forgets' Johnny said and gave Barry a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down and began to talk about various stories from over the years, Johnny was married but no kids. He worked as an accounts manager at a highly respectable firm. As he was talking though, Barry kept getting distracted by his sizes. He listened but kept looking down towards the great big sphere attached to his old school friend. Barry told him about his life and before long his belly grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny laughed, 'well it sounds like someones hungry' he said, 'haha yeah just a bit, I haven't eaten breakfast or anything' Barry said, 'eager to get things rolling, I like your style Barry' he said and smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just out of curiosity Johnny, have you ever done this sort of thing before...Like aided in the fattening of someone else?' Barry asked wanting to know more about how his huge friend ended up in this sort of thing, 'To be honest, no. Only reason I'm here is because I knew it was you and I wanted to see you and I wanted to help you grow' Johnny said, 'well I'm glad you decided to help me in this' Barry said and patted his own belly, 'I mean, you look like you are going to be a very good teacher' Barry said gesturing towards Johnny, he laughed again 'Thanks Barry, its taken a lot of work to grow this and I ain't stopping anytime soon, so it will be great to have someone to grow along with me'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So what happened for you to want to be like this...I mean you were always pretty muscular in high school.' Barry asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Honestly Barry, its something I've always wanted...Even in high school, I used to watch Coach as he got fatter and wanted that for me. After school, I went to college. Started putting on some weight for football and never lost it, got married a couple of years after and got my job. Then the pounds really started piling on. I found it pretty exciting and would stuff myself stupid for hours, knowing every bite I was just going to get bigger' he said. Barry was getting a bit excited himself as his friend explained his story and bounced and rubbed his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...And what do you weigh right now?' Barry asked, 'actually, I'm not 100% sure. There is some scales in the bathroom, if you're interested?' Johnny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry didn't need asking twice, he just nodded and the two went into their conjoining bathroom. Johnny stepped on the scales, the number rising and lowering constantly as it decided what weight he was. It finally stopped revealing that Johnny is.....</span></div></div>",

Right this way.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack showed Johnny and Barry to a table big enough for four people in close proximity of the buffet. He knew Johnny very well and knew that he would want to be close by to not have to move far as he filled up. 'Now can I get you two some drinks', 'Well I'm driving, so I'll just have a pepsi please Jack', 'excellent and for you sir?', 'Umm well I'll have a pint of lager please' 'of course, I shall be right back with those. I'm sure Mr.P here will show you how its done' Jack said before he left to fetch the drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright Barry, follow me' Johnny said. The two men stood up and went towards the food. Barry was salivating at the sight of it all, there was mexican, italian, chinese, indian, american, french, spanish foods all over! He couldn't wait to dig in, he picked up a plate and began loading up as much as he could and headed back to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 4 minutes later Johnny returned holding four plates filled with so much food! 'So I don't have to go back as often' He said smiling, soon after Jack returned with their drinks and left them to their eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*5 hours later* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry was absolutely stuffed! He managed to try almost everything from all the trays, even grabbing about 4 slices of different cakes. Totaling in around 15 plates of food. As a treat Johnny said he was paying for all this and made Jack keep refilling his pint with more lager, making Barry feel exceptionally bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny on the other hand was still going, he came back after his 9th trip with another three plates. Barry could tell he was pumping up bigger, his belly was so spherical underneath his t-shirt that he could see the outline of his belly button, he just couldn't stop staring at him and even felt mini-Barry come to life a bit. Before he sat down, he undid his belt, grunting as he did it 'bit more room' he said before diving into the next three plates. Johnny had been loading up on a lot of pepsi as well and soon found himself being completely done, with a whopping 36 plates of food in his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack came over and removed the dirty plates, 'Jack...if you...could be...so kind...could you bring....the bill...to me' Johnny said, 'of course sir, I'll give you chance to rest a bit' he said before walking off again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa Johnny, I'm so impressed buddy! You ate like a hog' Barry said with a smile on his face, 'thanks Barry....you didn't do too badly yourself'' Johnny said, reaching over and poking Barry in his full belly. 'Can't wait to get back to the hotel room' Johnny said, before Jack turned up with the bill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny settled up and soon the two waddled back to Johnny's car. He drove slowly as his belly was so so full. The two got back in the elevator, much to the shock of the lady at the reception desk, seeing them so bloated. Johnny leaned against the wall of the elevator, rubbing his belly slowly with his eyes closed as Barry watched him none stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry put his key card in the lock mechanism and let Johnny pass through the door first. He sat on the edge of the bed, which bent significantly under his 350lb body. He tried to take his shoes off but gave up, Barry just smiled and sat next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was so good Barry....Haven't eaten like that in a long long time' He said, placing a hand on his belly. 'No wonder you call yourself walkingGaia, Johnny' Barry said rubbing Johnny's belly. 'Mmm yeah...I'm just a huge fucking continent of a man Barry. That feels real nice, could you keep rubbing' Johnny asked, 'sure buddy' Barry said, rubbing his friends bloated middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes passed as Barry continued to rub Johnny's belly and he appeared to be in a relaxed bliss. Breathing softly and just enjoying the moment. 'That feels so great Barry, you're really good at this' Johnny said, 'thanks Johnny, its such an impressive belly' Barry said, 'mm glad you approve...I love being big...the feeling of waddling...the size...the shape...how it moves' Johnny said, 'I can imagine...I want your size so bad', 'just a couple of fat balls we'll be Barry...rubbing each others bellies' Johnny said, 'I can't wait....' Barry said, Johnny suddenly leaned in and kissed Barry on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry pulled back, 'I'm sorry...' Johnny said, 'no...I mean...I'm flattered but...I'm married' Barry said, 'So am I....I love her but she don't love me....she thinks I'm a fat waste of space...I bet your wife does too Barry...or you wouldn't have agreed to come here' Johnny said, Barry didn't say anything. 'I'm so sorry Barry, I spoiled our day...' Johnny said, but before he could say anything else, Barry kissed him back, this time Johnny pulled back. 'Barry....Are...Are you sure?' He asked, 'yes...we aren't doing anything wrong. Just two guys who appreciate the more ample figure...really really appreciate it' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny smiled and soon they began kissing again...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johnny smiled and soon they began kissing again. They wrapped each other in their arms as best they could from the side and began to kiss even more. Johnny let out a small moan as they did so and the two stopped kissing for a moment, they smiled at each other as a cue that it was time to take things up a peg or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fatties both moved up the bed and rested their heads on the pillows. They rolled on their sides and began to kiss again, where Johnny rubbed the side of Barry's belly in circles. Barry moaned this time and kissed Johnny harder, having to lean in a lot to get passed his gargantuan belly. The resistance he felt from the stuffed sphere of his 350lb exjock friend was magic to him. In that belly was so much food that was digesting and turning into more fat, but Barry knew deep down that Johnny could eat more and wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry rolled over off the bed, leaving Johnny looking perplexed as to this sudden departure. Barry wasn't stopping this moment of passion, he was increasing it. Grabbing his bag, he threw it on the bed and began to unzip it, 'what you got there Baz?' Johnny asked, still looking confused, 'Just some light snacks' Barry said as he tipped the contents out onto the bed, bags of crisps, brownies, donuts, cookies, muffins, 2L bottles of soft drinks fell out all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny looked at it all wide eyed and then back at Barry who began to open the first pack of cookies. He opened his mouth to protest due to his fullness but before he could say a world, Barry forced cookies in there. He chewed and swallowed and Barry shoved more in, every time it emptied Barry just pushed more in. Johnny tried to protest a few times but soon he gave in and began to just let Barry do it, opening his mouth every time to accept the food Barry was feeding him. Any empty packets were just thrown on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thats it Johnny, eat up' Barry said with a bit of a sly tone of voice, Johnny just did what he was told, not speaking but just looking at Barry the entire time. 'Keep feeding that belly. I want you bigger! I want you fatter! So god damn huge Johnny, just you getting so god damn fat with each passing day' Barry said, getting a bit more breathy in his voice, Johnny was enjoying this immensely. He could feel his member growing in his pants, pushing hard against the fabric of his jeans. His belly rounding out fuller as Barry stuffed more in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are just a pig Johnny, eating so many god damn plates at the buffet. Then eating all this? I'm surprised you aren't 500lbs already' Barry said, throwing another packet on the floor. He continued to stuff Johnny, who's belly was getting fuller and more bloated by the second. His clothes getting tighter and tighter with each bite. Soon everything was gone, expect for the two 2L bottles of Coke, Johnny saw this and rolled onto his back as if to say 'do it, make me swallow it all', his belly towering immensely above him and his erection growing larger still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry didn't need telling, he untwisted the top off the first bottle as it fizzed up slightly. He moved over to his stuffed friend and begin to pour it into his mouth as to allow Johnny to get a rhythm before pushing and holding the bottle in his mouth. Johnny chugged on the coke and kept draining it, feeling his belly get tighter with each swallow, he had no idea that his t-shirt began to rise inch by inch as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 3 minutes, the first bottle was gone and Barry threw the empty plastic onto the hotel floor and instantly picked up the second. Starting the process again, Johnny chugged, his belly inflated and his shirt road up higher stopping his under his belly button but revealing a whole lot of fat between that and his pants. It was getting difficult now as he closed his eyes, 'just a little bit more' Barry said as the bottle emptied down Johnny's throat. With Barry throwing it behind him on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry just looked at Johnny's face, it was so red and his chest and belly rose up and down as he tried to get his breathing back to normal. Barely moving, he looked at Barry who leaned over him and kissed him deeply on the lips. Johnny returning it and letting out a moan and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I cannot believe you ate everything Johnny' Barry said, Johnny still just lay there unable to move. Barry sat up to look at the damage and finally saw how far Johnny's t-shirt had risen up his bloated belly, 'god damn Johnny! Your t-shirt is resting just shy of your belly button!' Barry said with glee in his voice. Johnny perked up a bit at this. Barry slapped to bare skin between the rim of his top and trousers, making Johnny let out a small 'oof', 'thats a whole lot of belly on show, jeez' Barry said, getting more excited. That's when he noticed Johnny's erection, he knew this behemoth wanted release and he wanted it now. He undid the belt and pants button, with a sigh of relief from Johnny and he pulled them down as far as they would go with his shoes still on. Removing the shoes, he pulled off his severely tight jeans and left his gargantuan buddy in his overstretched t-shirt and extremely tight boxer shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his place back at Johnny's sized, Barry reached down and began to rub his belly. Receiving moans of thanks back from his friend. 'You look fucking amazing Johnny' Barry said and kissed him again. Johnny moaned more. Barry began to push up his t-shirt all the way up to his moobs, revealing his belly in its entirety, 'fuck! What a whale!!' Barry said smacking the belly again, Johnny began to curl his toes a bit. That was when Barry found his most sensitive part, 'and what a fucking deep belly button! I bet I can fit a whole finger in there' Barry said as he pushed his finger deep inside and moved it around, Johnny suddenly took a huge in take of air and clenched the quilt underneath his fat frame. 'Oh you like that?' Barry asked, Johnny just nodded with vigor, 'well...I better continue then' Barry said and winked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry began to wiggle his finger in all manner of ways inside Johnny's deep belly button, moving it fast and slow, up and down, moving it in a circle. It was phenomenal to Johnny, he began to moan louder and longer, his fists clenching harder on the quilt. Barry continued and picked up the pace, making Johnny squirm in delight, well as much as he could. His huge belly was pinning him, only allowing slight moments. He began to buck his pelvis slightly as his erection began to feel the sheer pressure of his belly button being played with. Barry pushed his finger in harder and began to make sure Johnny felt every movement. His breathing began to began to become more erratic, taking in huge gulps of air and exhaling it almost as quick. His toes began to move with excitement and his grip tightened further on the quilt, he was so close but he wanted this moment to last as long as he could. Barry could tell that his friend was in sheer pleasure but also great discomfort with this, with one mighty push he forced his finger in deeper and that was enough. Johnny blew his load, he screamed in pleasure and began to shake at the intense orgasm he was experiencing, his member spewing forth wave after wave after wave of love juice, all in his severely tight boxer shorts that got increasing soaked. This moment seemed to last forever for Johnny and soon the juice stopped and he lay there spent. His belly extremely full to the point of being barely able to move, his heart racing over this pleasure, his breathing labored as he tried to get it back to normal and his underwear soaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lay there in silence as Johnny got himself back together. It took 20 minutes before Johnny looked over at Barry and spoke, 'FUCK! That was....fucking amazing!!', Barry smiled, 'I'm glad you enjoyed' Barry said, patting Johnny's belly. 'I did...fuck...14 years of marriage and I have never experienced anything like that. Well not that I have had any in the last 5 after getting so fat' Johnny said rubbing his belly, 'well your wife doesn't know your true needs Johnny, a man wanting to get fat. He needs his belly worshiped and stuffed to get his sexual desires met' Barry said, 'true that! You stuffing me even further? That was inspired, fucking started getting me real hard when you took control and stuffed my belly further...and here was me thinking we were here to fatten you up, Mr.I want you bigger, I want you fatter' Johnny said, poking Barry's belly and winking, 'well...we are here for another 2 days, tomorrow can be fatten Barry day' Barry said and then kissed Johnny 'besides...I can't outgrow the teacher, I really want you to blow up as I do Johnny' Barry said, 'fuck. Well I can't disappoint my student can I?' Johnny said and kissed Barry back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lay there for another 5 minutes before Johnny rolled over off the bed, 'I'll be right back. I just need to clean up a bit' he said and chuckled about his wet pants. He waddled over passed the bed, giving Barry the perfect side view of his ginormous physique. He was such a ball right now. He disappeared into their joined bathroom and began to shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry used this time to clean up the room a bit himself, throwing all the empty food and drink packets into the bin. He then stripped down to his own boxers and lay back on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later and Johnny reentered the room wearing a fresh pair of boxers. He waddled his way back over to his original position as Barry snuggled into him and rubbed his belly whilst they watched TV. They spoke sparingly as they continued to enjoy their embrace for the rest of the evening and soon found it was getting late. The two cleaned up ready for bed and as they finished, Johnny spoke up, 'I don't suppose there was any need for two rooms after all...' Johnny said, 'I guess not' Barry said smiling, 'come on...we'll use my bed. Far less crumbs in that one' Johnny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got into the cleaner bed and soon began spooning, Johnny kissed Barry on the back of the head and soon the two drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Barry thought to himself he was at the point that if he started getting fatter people were going to notice more but this was kind of a turn on for him, imagining people staring, patting, poking, smacking and commenting on his growth made Barry hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange he'd always been quite a stocky guy not a gym buff but he went every so often but when he was sent away on a business trip for a week on his first night after a large stuffing in the restaurant he was sat on his bed in his work shirt and boxers rubbing his belly thinking about how fat he was and how he might end up like the fat guy who was on tv at the time, but the more he looked the more he imagined that he was the fat guy, as he took hold of little baz and pumped furiously at the thought. He didn't know why but the idea of him getting fat was amazing to him, after he was done he ordered a lot of room service and then repeated the process, he decided that he wanted to grow his belly, for the whole week Barry went to business meetings and returned to his room and stuffed himself silly, gaining 5lbs but now he was 7lbs heavier than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay on the bed and rubbed little baz, he rubbed one hand over his soft belly whilst the other did the work, it didn't take long for him to shoot his load all over his belly.  'mmmm that gets better every time' Barry said, he cleaned himself up and posted his new weight on the thread, he went and got changed and started preparing for his friends arrival, setting out food (whilst stuffing his face at the same time) but suddenly the doorbell rang?

What are you doing here?' Barry asked, 'I'm sorry uncle Barry, i didn't know where else to go' Sam said crying, 'its ok Sam come on in, god you must be soaked through to the skin!' Barry said as he ushered the young man in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stood there shivering and completely drenched from head to toe; 'wait here a second and i'll get you a towel' Barry said, he ran upstairs and grabbed the biggest towel he could find, ran downstairs and wrapped Sam in it; helping him dry off, it took a while but the water stopped dripping from him. 'Now lets get you out of these wet clothes' Barry said, Sam's eyes widened at this; which Barry thought was a bit odd, but he lead him upstairs into his bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now the bathroom is through there if you need to get undressed in private...you'll have to use my towelling robe on the back of the bathroom door as i doubt any of my clothes will fit you' Barry said giving his belly a pat and laughing 'honestly they hardly fit me any more' he said giving another chuckle but turning himself on slightly at the thought of out growing all his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thanks uncle Barry' Sam said, 'no problem mate, i'll be downstairs if you need anything' Barry said, Sam walked into the Bathroom and Barry walked downstairs, knowing how upset the young man was, Barry got his phone and text the guys that something had come up and he had to cancel, he didn't let onto Mark that Sam was here just in case; he got responses back saying it was all fine and they'll meet up soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his phone down on the side and thought what could have happened with Sam, but whilst he waited he began to nibble on bits of food that were placed on the table, after all he didn't like to waste food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he nibbled the food, he noticed in the mirror that one of the buttons of his shirt was getting tight, he smiled at this and heard Sam coming down the stairs; as he walked into the room, Barry couldn't help notice Sam was staring at his belly a bit, but Barry tried to change the subject 'Hey there' Barry said smiling at Sam who was wrapped in Barry's extremely thick and warm towelling robe, 'feeling any better?' Barry asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A bit, thanks uncle Barry, this towelling robe is lovely, its nice and toasty warm' Sam said, 'haha I'm glad you approve, but here come sit' Barry said gesturing towards the sofa, 'so tell me whats happened?' Barry asked, 'ummm' Sam said, 'come on Sam, you can't just turn up on my door step in the pouring rain crying your eyes out and not tell me whats happened' Barry said, 'dad and I had an argument.....he's thrown me out' Sam said as a tear rolled down his cheek, 'thrown you out?! What happened? Why?' Barry asked with a bit of puzzlement, 'because......i told him I was gay' Sam said crying again, 'oh Sam....' Barry said and hugged the young man, 'I'm sure he was just shocked, he didn't mean it'; 'yes he did! He told me he didn't want anything to do with me any more!!' Sam said as he held onto Barry tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry didn't know what to say, he'd known Mark for years and never suspected of him being homophobic, but he wanted to stand by Sam in this 'don't worry Sam, you can stay here as long as you like....you are still you, whether you are gay or straight, nothing has changed' Barry said squeezing Sam tighter, this lasted for at least 5 minutes in silence; after which Barry felt something on his side, it was Sam's hand and it was stroking Barry's love handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry let out a slight chuckle as it tickled slightly, and Sam pulled away, 'I....I'm sorry uncle Barry' Sam said, 'hey its ok Sam, i don't mind, felt kind of nice actually' Barry said smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would you mind if i continued?' Sam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Barry say </span></div></div>",

The pizza man placed the note in Barry's hand and walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry shut the door completely confused, he took the pizza's into the kitchen and placed them on the counter, they smelt really good to the ever hungry Barry.

If you have plans cancel them, log onto your instant messenger and i'll be waiting for you, ready to encourage you into an eating frenzy that will help you gain a lot of weight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry couldn't believe what he had just read, he thought frantically who it could be his wife? The Guys? Someone from Work? A secret admirer? He felt like shaking but his little member began to harden again, he read the note over and over before deciding to get his work laptop out of his bag and setting it up. He text the guys and appologised for having to cancel the evening but a work emergency had come up.They all seemed fine with it and none asking what the emergency was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry grabbed the Pizza's and headed for the living room his hands sweating with anticipation.

His dress shirt extremely tight around his belly as it wobbled up and down with each pump. It took 20 minutes but the deed was done, he cleaned up and left the restroom, satisfied and happy.

'Easy there Barry' Roger said placing his hand on Barry's shoulder; 'Don't want you popping out of that shirt just yet' he picked up a slice of chocolate fudge cake oozing liquid chocolate 'here try this' Barry lent in and took a bite of gorgeous cake, the liquid chocolate dripping on to his shirt.

I notice these things Barry', 'Over....280' Barry said, panting even harder, 'damn you really became a pig after your wife left. Mine would probably do the same, if I ever did that. But I don't want that, I just want one I can help get fat', 'you're gonna make me fat?!' Barry said, getting even more excited, he began to moan louder and louder. 'Yeah I'm going to make you fat, I want you fat Barry', 'then get in my Belly!!' Barry said, before unleashing his load right in his pants, he'd never felt anything like that before.

A few more pounds and we'll have to go out shopping for new clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark just rolled his eyes at his son's mockery. Though, he had to admit, Sam was right; his ball of a belly was getting bigger everyday - currently at the size of a basket ball - and doing a mundane task as shopping for clothing was becoming a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mark wasn't going to miss out on a chance to try out one of Barry's steaks, soaked in special home-made marinade his wife Betty was a master at preparing. He really needed to get that recipe for it. He dug into his light breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, at 1:30 p.m., after showering and dressing himself in a pair of tight jeans, a buttoned shirt, and a vest, Mark was on his way to Barry in his car, searching for his house in this quiet neighborhood. It wasn't hard to find it, though. At three storeys it stood out from the rest of the middle-class houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a senior manager at a big insurance company, Barry had quite a lot of money, and, through the recent years, it has been showing on Mark's longtime friend's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn obstacle presented itself in a form of a steel gate. All around Barry's house were stone walls, enclosing the building and making it look like some sort of castle. Security cameras were mounted on the walls, watching him like Big Brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rich people always want to show how much money they have,\" thought Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pressing a button on a metal stand, the metal gate slid open and Mark drove inside. He was greeted warmly by Barry when Mark climbed out of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike always, Barry had that bizarre ability to look bigger every time Mark saw him. He also had a habit to dress himself in some sort of tight clothing; right now he was wearing a tight blue shirt, which emphasized his swelling gut very well, over a pair of white trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you saved some room for the roast,\" said Barry as he was leading his friend inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, don't worry,\" said Mark, patting his rumbling stomach when he smelled the rich aroma of the roasting steak, \"I saved plenty of room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside he was greeted by Betty, a short, plump women with sandy-blond hair, brown eyes and a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hugged her with one strong arm, and she kissed him on his cheek, saying: \"It's good to see you again, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you, too, Betty,\" Mark replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grill was already lit awhile ago when Mark went into the backyard. Chairs surrounded it, set on a concrete platform. Some beers were set on the table and meat were sizzling over the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty stayed inside the house, preparing other meals.

But soon the talk shifted to weight and health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that big, am I?\" Barry asked, pausing his flipping to grab his belly and wobble it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark shrugged. \"When was the last time you were on a scale?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few weeks ago,\" Barry answered, \"but when I checked it was 246 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go check?\" Mark offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Barry's answer?</span></div></div>",

In his new job, he'd been feeling like the country bumpkin in his khakis and loafers.  Not to mention that the 36 inch slacks that he'd settled into after 20 years wearing 32's were now tight.  He needed some new clothes and he was going to up his game and go for the executive look.<br>\r\n\"I need a wardrobe upgrade.\" he told the salesman.  He was uncomfortable in the upscale men's store.  The prices seemed outrageous to a guy who thought JC Penney's was upscale but he'd thought long and hard about his career and dressing like a dweeb wasn't going to work.  His coworkers all wore designer suits.  He was never going to get his career in gear without looking like a million bucks.<br>\r\nThe salesman smiled.

The guy had fitted him up with a couple of suits, a blazer, 10 shirts, 5 slacks and some shoes.  He even had a couple of pair of braces- Mark always thought they were suspenders and he had deccided to wear his suit pants up around his belly rather than ciched below.  He'd flinched when he heard that his gut was 48 inches around but somehow that 48 inches filling a white dress shirt and framed by guady green braces made him look like a tycoon.<br>\r\n\"I'll pass on that undergarment.\" he told the salesman.  \"Good decision. sir.\"  The salesman siad.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the month Barry complained but with his jaw wired shut, he found it difficult to get his belly stuffed the way he wanted.  Gradually his appetite adjusted, he complained less amd his pants began to fit looser.  Barry's wife was torn as her big man slimmed down.  Originally she had liked Barry leaner and more muscular but as Barry turned glutton and got fat, she grew to love his soft excess and cooking large quantities of fatening goodies to stuff her ever growing man blimp.  Dean didn't much care whether Barry was fat or lean but he told him fight off that unless he stopped whining, Dean would let him suffer alone.<br>\r\nBarry sufferred with his limited liquid diet, experimenting with high calorie, high fat blender concoctions.  At first he dripped weight fast but as he perfected his liquid diet  he maintained after losing 30 pounds.  Barry complained about the loss but Dean told him that nobody could notice a mere 30 pounds loss for a tub of lard like Barry.  Meanwhile as Dean and Barry hung out together more and Barry's wife so accustomed to providing plenty to eat, Dean slowly found the 30 pounds Barry had lost.  It was hard for him to see located on his ever rounder rear end but once Dean plopped himself down on Barry's couch and split his pants, Barry never let him forget about his growing caboose.<br>\r\nBarry grinned as Dean settled his bag ass on the couch.  There was only one more week until his jaw would be free.  Although he had adjusted to a liquid diet and shrunken belly and had controlled his whining, he now had something to distract him- Dean's big ass.<br>\r\n\"So.\" he said to Dean, \"Where did you have to go to find pants big enough for those butt blimps?\"<br>\r\nDean had been busying himself with a bowl of nachos smothered with cheese and meat, quite oblivious to any thought of moderation.  He put down the bowl and wiped his hands on his bulging belly.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, belly boy?\"  Dean stiffled a small belch.  Perhaps he had been a bit hoggish lately and maybe his ass had gotten a bit bigger but nobody he knew had a bigger belly than Barry, even after six weeks of liquid diet.<br>\r\n\"Just saying.\"  Barry continued, \"Your butt must be 60 inches.  Who stocks pants to fit that much ass?\"<br>\r\n\"No way 60 inches.\"  Dean answered.  \"That's more like your belly.\"<br>\r\nDean wasn't going to share that his butt was over 50 inches and that he had had to buy 52 inch pants and take in the waist to accommodate his newly pear shaped body.<br>\r\n\"Stand up and let me see.\"<br>\r\nDean reluctantly stood, revealing his glorious ass, round and proundly pruotruding, tightly stretching his pants. Dean's belt cinched between the swell of his ass and the smaller bulge of his soft belly.  <br>\r\n\"Man!\"  Barry exclaimed.  \"You've blown up big.  All ass.  Me , I'm all belly.  What's your trick?\"<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, Dean felt pround.  Still maybe he ought to cut back.<br>\r\nAfter the jaw is healed...</span></div></div>",

Don't want you hurting yourself running into a door or anything.\"<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  Steve answered not able to make out anything in the darkness.  He listened as the door creaked and then he heard footsteps on the stairs.  Steve felt around until he identified the bed and he sat down to wait for Barry.  Soon he say light in the hall and Barry called.  \"Stay put until I get back with the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the light from a flashlight, Steve changed into dry clothes that Barry had given him.  Barry had said that he had outgrown them but they were loose on Steve.  He cinched up the belt to keep up the jeans and pulled on a baggy sweatshirt.  Then leaving his wet clothes in a pile, Steve joined Barry down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry had put candles around the living room but Steve heard his friend in the kitchen so he moved on back.<br>\r\n\"Tree must have fallen on the power lines.\"  Barry said when Steve joined him in the kitchen. \"We're just going to have to improvise until they got the power back on.  Want a beer?\"<br>\r\nBarry bustled around the candle-lit kitchen getting a beer for Steve and a second one for him. \"Sit down,\" he told Steve as he put a bag of chips on the table and opened the beers.  Barry wasn't even trying to keep his bathrobe tied exposing his belly.  <br>\r\nAfter some small talk and a second round of beer, Barry got serious.<br>\r\n\"Look, Steve,\" he began. \"I thought we'd be watching a game and have a few more beers before bringing this up, but there is no game with the power out and I;m all our of small talk.  I need your help with something.  I was hoping that it would be easier but I'm just going to have to blurt it out.  It's hard for me but I can't keep it hidden any longer and you've been a friend for so long, I hope it won't upset you or think less of me.\"<br>\r\nSteve wondered what was coming next.

He looked down at his belly.<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fat.\" he said.<br>\r\nSteve laughed. \"You sure are, big guy.  What's the matter with that? You aren't a kid any more.  Everybody packs on a few pounds.\"<br>\r\nBarry sighed again.  \"But my wife doesn't like me fat.  She told me that if I don't lose weight she'll divorce me.\"<br>\r\nSteve got serious.  \"That's a problem,\" he replied. \"But it's fixable.  Just cut back a bit at the table and exercise some more and you'll be back in shape in no time.\"<br>\r\nBarry sighed a third time and slumped in his chair.<br>\r\n\"You don't get it.\" he groaned. \"I like being fat and I have discovered that </span></div></div>",

But he didn't have to nerve to confess that for Barry, their relationship had changed.  Steve was still a good friend, maybe Barry's best and oldest friend but as Barry realized that he really wasn't attracted to women he realized that he loved Steve.  He had wanted to confess last night, hoping that Steve might at least accept his new feelings but the fear of losing Steve's friendship made him hold back. He longed to take Steve in his arms but that would probably never happen.  As usual lately Barry's frustration made him hungry.  Steve<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Paul asked as he walked over, 'oh hey Paul, not to bad, not to bad my friend; just taking in a light snack' Barry said gesturing to the plates on the table, there were 3 plates piled on top of each other at the side that were covered in appitisers and he was making his way through a fourth, 'bit peckish tonight fat Baz?'

Do tell' Barry said, 'well...I was sat in my classroom and one of my 6th form students comes in and says Coach wants him to bulk up and he comes to ask me on any tips of how to do so' Paul explained, 'he came to you for advice?

Paul gave a slight smirk and thought to himself 'no wonder Richie came to me for fat advice' before he walked over to the wardrobe and pulled on a navy blue polo shirt and a pair of well worn blue jeans, he tucked his polo shirt into his jeans; which made his belly have more emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went downstairs and sat watching TV for almost an hour; waiting for Barry to arrive; when suddenly the door bell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul stood up and went to answer <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was at the door? </span></div></div>",

They arranged to meet up again in 2 weeks and they drove off in their respective directions; as Paul began to drive his belly began to growl as he realised he hadn't eaten since lunch. He pulled into a local pizza place around the corner and ordered 3 15inch pizza's, 2 garlic breads and a couple of chocolate fudge slices before heading home. With his wife and son away he just wanted to chill and pig out like he used to before he was married. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul got back into the house and placed the food he had bought on the sofa as he went around and drew the curtains and grabbed himself a couple of beers from the fridge; he just wanted a lazy evening with everything within reach and as little movement as possible. He turned the TV on and found a couple of shows he wanted to watch for the evening and he was set. Paul undid his belt and unbuttoned his buttoned up shirt and pants, sat down on the sofa and pulled the recliner leaver on the side. He opened the first box with the 15inch pizza in and began to devour it; picked bits of his garlic bread to and sticking it in his mouth and taking swigs of his first beer; whilst watching a James Bond film. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 and a half hours Paul; finally lifted his hand heavily to his face and stuck the final bite of the chocolate fudge slice in his mouth and swallowed with difficulty. Paul let out a slight moan and he looked down at his extremely full belly that was covered in grease and chocolate stains, he rested his hands on it and rubbed it gently in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, I'm stuffed; haven't been this full in a long time...That Barry is a bad influence on me' Paul said chuckling, he gingerly rubbed his belly for another half hour as he continued to watch more tv, but as he did he began to get sleepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell asleep where strange visions came flooding to his mind; Paul was sat at his desk at work but much much fatter; his buttoned up shirt straining to keep his big fat belly held back, 'looking great there stud; maybe you could eat a couple more?' Dream Paul said as he looked over and stood there was Richie; a rather huge Richie, his belly so round and soft and stuffed full; his t-shirt not even covering the fat mass, his face having lost all its detail, 'mmm thanks Paul; I could go for some more' Dream fat Richie said as he picked a couple of pastries that wrapped around cream; as he downed another 5 his belly get bigger and bigger and weighed heavily down; splitting the seams of his no longer fitting top and jeans, dream Paul stood up and walked over to his fat student 'mmm, do you think Coach will think your fat enough yet?' Dream Paul asked, 'probably not; better have another to make sure' Dream Richie said as he stuffed another into his mouth and fully bursting out of his clothes bar his boxers, 'now I probably am' Richie said as he rubbed his belly in large circles, 'but what about you Paul; bet your sick of being thin?' Richie said gesturing torwards Dream Paul's belly, 'oh god yes, sick of feeling so thin.....feed me Richie; feed me till I can hardly move' Dream Paul said as Dream Richie began to stuff more of the cream slices into Pauls ever waiting mouth; Dream Paul began to swallow and could already feel his belly growing; he ate more and more and more as his belly get fatter and fatter and fatter; the buttons erupting off his shirt in all directions, this made Richie pick up the pace sticking two in at a time as Dream Paul swallowed more and more; his belly inflating bigger with each second, his clothes like richies burst off him in shreads as the two fat men stood their partially naked, Dream Paul's belly began to touch the floor on all sides as Dream Richie stuffed him more; but they ran out...'Oh god, Paul, look how big you are' Dream Richie said kissing Paul on the lips, 'I know.....but need more' Dream Paul said as he continued to be stuffed; 'More.....More!!.......MOREE!!!!' Dream Paul said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'MORE!!!!' Paul shouted as he suddenly woke up with a shock; his breath as heavy as his stuffed belly 'oh god that was amazing' Paul said as he continued to breathe heavily; but his member was still fully pronged as it pushed into his belly; 'Oh god....' Paul said as he ran to the kitchen; he opened up the fridge door and licked his lips as he began to pick at things in their and shoving them into his mouth; he stopped shoveling for a second with his left hand as he began to rub his distended belly, letting out sharp moans of pain and ecstasy but still he kept on stuffing. He slammed the fridge door and moved over to the cupboards and began pour packets of cereal, biscuits and other treats straight into his mouth, barely chewing. At this point Paul began to slow down due to the pressure but the member in his pants made him want more, Paul leaned against the counter and used one hand to rub his belly and the other to rub his member; but as he did it made him want more, he pushed his stomach; 'room.....for....ice cream' Paul said as he breathed heavily, he ran over to the freezer and shoved a big bucket of ice cream in the microwave and set it for 2 minutes, but the wait was driving Paul crazy, 'come on, come on, hurry!!!!' Paul said, when the ping went off he opened the door and began to drink the liquid ice cream, chugging it faster and faster; it pushed his belly out further and pushing harder against his member, the feeling was ecstatic and too much for Paul to take at this point as it finally erupted all on the underside of his big stuffed belly, it lasted for almost 2 minutes before it finally finished its job. Paul dropped the the large tub to the floor and held his distended belly, 'Oh....my....god' Paul said before dropping to the floor himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just lay there for almost 2 hours resting and rubbing his belly, when he was finally able to move again.....just about. Paul sat there thinking, why did he dream that, he could document a few photos to show Richie but he might get found out, but in his horny mind he thought it might be a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Paul do? </span></div></div>",

I've got some ideas for that project you were asking about.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, Professor Summers.  I've got English next but I can drop by about three.  Does that work?\"<br>\r\nAll weekend Paul couldn't stop thinking about Richie and the more Paul thought about Richie the more he wanted to stuff his gut.  By Sunday morning he had cleared the cupboards at home.  He'd made a trip to the supermarket to restock buy food to keep him going all day.  He had set up the camera and taken pictures of his overstuffed belly bursting out of his tightest pair of jeans.  The fact that they were his 'fat' jeans from two years ago when he started teaching just made him more excited.  He took a picture of the empty pizza boxes and by the time he was done he'd been hungry again.<br>\r\nAfter a big lumberjack breakfast  he went grocery shopping,  Then grazed through the day before fixing a welcome home dinner for his wife and son.  Fix in Paul's case meant running out to KFC for a family sized bucket and a few extra sides, knowing that his wife would nibble on one piece and his son would have some mashed potatoes and he'd have to finish up the test. Somehow he had finished it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi, Professor.\"  Richie as on time.  \"Is this a good time?\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect, Richie, sit down.\"  Paul was sitting at his desk feeling very fat after his weekend of indulgence.<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea about that project we talked about- the bulking up that your coach wants you to do.  Do you remember?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Richie looked embarrassed. \"I didn't mean to call you fat or anything.  I probably insulted you.  I'm sorry.  I hope you aren't upset about it.\"<br>\r\nNo.\"  Richie, \"That's not it at all.  I have gained some weight and although I've been telling myself otherwise, I think I've gone from a bit overweight to downright fat.  You aren't telling me anything I don't already know.  I'm adjusting but that's not what I wanted to tell you.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I really didn't mean to insult you or anything.  It's just that I didn't know what to do.  My family are all health nuts so I sure can't talk to them.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"  Paul smiled.  \"To you, I looked like an expert.  I'll take that as a complement. Well, I don't quite know how to say this so I'm just going to plow ahead.  This weekend my wife and son were away and after a few beers with an old friend I was on my own.  Before I knew what I was doing I'd ordered pizza and when that was gone I found I couldn't stop wanting more.  I cleaned out the pantry before I went to bed and then got un Sunday, went to the store and ate all Sunday.\"<br>\r\nPaul sighed and watched Richie for a reaction.  He looked interested not turned off so Paul continued.<br>\r\n\"I took some pictures to remember the damage.\"<br>\r\nPaul handed the picture to Richie.<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help feeling proud of being so stuffed.\"<br>\r\nRichie took the pictures and laid them on the table.<br>\r\n\"Well I can sure understand why you got fat.\"  Richie said. \"But how does that help me?\"<br>\r\n\"Here's what I was thinking.\"  Paul said quietly.  \"I realized that I've become an uncontrollable glutton.  I really loved stuffing myself and I will do it again.  What I thought was that maybe it would help you if we shared some meals from time to time. Maybe you would eat more when you've got a hog like me as a companion.  It's just an idea.  I have no idea if it will work for you or whether it disgusts you, but you did ask and it's the only idea I can think of.  You can think about it.  If you want to try, just let me know.  Otherwise just forget I ever mentioned it.\"<br>\r\nRichie was silent for a moment studying the pictures.<br>\r\n\"That's some big gut.\"  He said handing back the photos.  \"Bigger than Coach Edwards.  I appreciate your thinking about me but right now I don't know.  Let me think about it.\"<br>\r\n\"Take your time, Richie.  It was probably a crazy idea anyway.\"<br>\r\nPaul watched Richie walk out of the office imagining lean jock Richie fattened up into Dream Richie and stuffing eclairs down his throat.  \"It's probably never gonna happen,\" he thought.<br>\r\nOne week later Richie stops Paul in the hall to say that<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His belly still warm from Richie's hand on his belly.<br>\r\n\"You never can tell.\" he thought.  Richie was long and lean with tight muscles that rippled as he walked.  Paul would have killed to have a body like that in school.  Now Richie with his beautiful body and athletic grace wanted to look like him.  \"Go figure.\"<br>\r\nPaul swaggered back to his office feeling like a hunk.  He stopped at the snack bar for coffee, then decided to get some donuts.  \"I'm in training.\"  he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul had suggested that he and Richie have lunch on Friday at a buffet across town.  Much as Paul loved to stuff himself these days, he much preferred that nobody he knew was watching him be a pig.  Richie was less concerned.  So what if anyone saw him stuffing.  That's what young guys do.  No one would think twice.  Actually Richie didn't have any plans to gain weight.  Ever since he had seen Paul and especially since Paul's belly seemed to be growing, it had been Richie's dream to help Paul grow.  No way he was going to confess that to his teacher.  He chose the more subtle route of getting Paul's help.  It was working.<br>\r\n\"Hope you brought your appetite.\"  Paul saw Richie in front of the buffet. \"and wore baggy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul, himself had  worn his elastic waste Khakis and a baggy shirt.  He was turning into a real glutton.<br>\r\n\"Two for lunch.\"  Paul told the server.  \"No menus.  we going for the buffet.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the server answered eyeing Paul's overhanging gut.  \"Right this way..\"<br>\r\nPaul wedged his ass into a booth.  \"Should have asked for a table he thought.

'Yeah sir...each one is going to go one by one' Richie said, and slapped the side of Paul's belly, 'mmmhmmm' Paul said, as he made a noise of pleasure. He was extremely hard, and slightly nervous as he stood out in the hall with Richie. Paul looked up at the clock and saw that the final bell was about to ring, he had some work to do in his office and he really needed to get there before people started leaving their classrooms. 'I...I need to get back to my office...come by in about 10 minutes', Paul said, Richie smiled and nodded before the two parted ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul rushed to his office, his erection rubbing hard against the material of his tight pants. He went in and closed the door and sat at his desk, where he caught his breath for a few minutes. Time seemed to slow down as Paul waiting for Richie, the final bell had rang and Paul waited and waited. The clock moved towards 3:30, Richie was late. Paul began to get nervous, with Richie being 20 minutes late. Another 20 minutes passed and Richie still wasn't there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul felt slightly dejected, by this. Until there was a knock at the door. Paul composed himself, and shouted 'come in', as Richie opened the door smiling, he saw someone behind him, so he made up an excuse 'you wanted to see me sir?' Richie said and winked, 'oh well...yes. It's about some private sessions. Please come in' Paul said, as Richie walked in, Paul gestured for him to lock the door and Richie obliged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey there' Richie said, walking up to Paul and sitting on the edge of his desk. 'I'm sorry I'm late. I had an idea' Richie said, he pulled off his backpack and unzipped it, he pulled out a set of scales in a box that had just been bought, and then tipped out the contents of his backpack. Revealing packs of donuts, cakes, chips, drinks and other fattening snacks. Paul looked shocked, but extremely turned on by this, 'I guess I should say goodbye to this shirt. By the end of all that. Every button is going to be gone' Paul said, wobbling his belly. 'Oh god, I hope so sir. I mean some of it's for me...I got to follow in your footsteps. But you are just so damn fat. I...I need to make sure you keep getting that way' Richie said, Paul smiled. Here was this lean muscular jock, coming in here wanting to feed and worship his big fat belly, and that the jock wasn't going to let him go until he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'First...I want to weigh you sir. You've been pigging out so much since that first day you told me. I want to know what you've gained', Richie said pulling the scales out of the box. 'Of course. I'm curious myself, it's hard to weigh yourself when you are focused more on pigging out' Paul laughed, and he stepped on the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul knew that before he started this, that he was 240.

The digital display flashed up....260lbs, a 20lb gain in such a short amount of time! Paul smiled and looked at Richie, and within an instant Richie had his arms wrapped around Paul and began to kiss him passionately. Paul was taken back by this at first, but he allowed it to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see you approve' Paul said, 'Yeah. I do' Richie said, as he kissed Paul harder, Richie opened one of his eyes and saw a photo of Paul's family on his desk. 'God your family is so lucky, having such a big fat stud' Richie said, 'I wish. My wife hates that I'm getting fat. It's all she does is comment on it, and complain' Paul said, 'I'm sorry sir...that really sucks. She doesn't know what shes missing out on. What does your son think?' Richie said, 'he likes his big fat daddy. Says I'm real soft, but he doesn't know the truth' Paul explained, 'well. We better give the little man what he wants' Richie said, 'Yes. Oh god yes!' Paul said, he returned the kiss to Richie, 'I'm sure Coach will be proud of the fatty you become too' Paul said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie stopped kissing for a moment, 'actually sir...I have a confession. Coach never really said that' Richie said, slightly upset. 'What?' Paul asked, confused as to what he was talking about, 'I...I made it up. I've always had a thing for fat guys. I couldn't stop crushing on you. I...I wanted you to gain weight, and I wanted to be the cause. Even if it meant me getting fat too. I had no idea that after I came to you with it, that you wanted it. To the point of gaining 20lbs on your own. After seeing those photos you took for me, and the dream. I haven't been able to stop thinking about you getting fatter and fatter. I want it so bad. I know I tricked you, but this is a dream come true for me' Richie explained, Paul could see that Richie was generally upset that he lied to him, but he didn't care, 'that was a pretty good plan you had there. I guess me wanting it as badly as you, pushed up the schedule of it all. I don't care if you don't want to get fat. You think I'm attractive, and want to see me get fatter. My wife doesn't want me physically, for being a big fat pig. You want that for me, and it's so damn hot' Paul said, Richie was actually shocked Paul didn't care, he could see the determination in Paul's eyes, 'besides, once you start feeding me. I would never have let you have any of that any way' Paul said, he used his belly to push Richie up against the wall and put his arms either side of him, that way he couldn't escape 'holy shit' Richie said, as Paul pushed his belly harder against the young jock, feeling his teachers fat surround his muscular torso. 'I bet you want me as fat as my dream don't you? Have my belly grow so big, that I can't walk. That way you take care of my every need' Paul said, 'ye...yes sir. I want that so damn much' Richie said, as his erection began to toughen and poke Paul in his under belly. Then Paul whispered to him 'my body is your canvas, do whatever you want with it', Richie moaned extremely loud, before Paul moved back a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I...I want to fuck your belly sir' Richie said, 'I ain't stopping you' Paul said, 'it's just that....this is my first time' Richie explained, 'it's my first time with a guy too. Don't worry' Paul said, as he went in for another kiss, 'n...no. I mean, ever' Richie said, extremely shy. Paul was shocked, he thought for sure Richie would have slept with someone. Maybe due to his attraction to him, he didn't want to until it was someone he really wanted, which Paul was so appreciative of. Paul stroked Richie's face, 'don't worry about that, go at the pace you want to. You're in good hands' Paul said, and kissed Richie passionately. Richie returned the kiss 'thank you sir' he said, before placing his hands on either side of his teachers belly and began to rub it, 'I think it's time for some food. Don't you?' Richie said, Paul nodded in delight. </span></div></div>",

Walking back and positioning himself on the edge of the desk, which creaked slightly under Paul's 260lbs body. Richie walked up to the desk, placing one hand on Paul's belly, and the other he used to reach around and grab a pack of donuts. Opening them and pushing the first into Paul's mouth. Paul bit down and let out a 'mmmffff' of pleasure. Richie took that as a sign, and began to push the donut further into his teacher's mouth. Not allowing Paul time to swallow the previous bite. Paul struggled at first, but knowing what Richie was doing to him. It was getting him increasingly hard, so much so it started to hurt. Richie grabbed another donut, and shoved that in Pauls mouth, and another and another. Between the difficulties of swallowing, Paul let out increasing moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, the first box of twelves donuts was gone. But Richie didn't stop there, he shoved more donuts in Pauls mouth, cakes, cookies. Anything that was edible was going straight into Paul's mouth. Paul was getting full, and harder by the second. He removed his tie, undid the top button of his blue button up shirt, and reached around and began to undo his belt. 'Was it getting tight?' Richie asked, slapping Paul's belly. Paul moaned, and just nodded. Gobbling down another cake that Richie stuffed into his mouth. Richie grabbed a large bottle of soda, he unscrewed the top and forced it into Paul's mouth and began to pour it, making Paul chug the entirety of it. Paul began to moan even louder, he began to buck. Even though he wanted to resist, he really wanted to cum. Richie looked down and saw what he was doing 'not yet sir, it's not time' Richie said, Paul looked deep into Richie's eyes, and he began to relax a little more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul got stuffed with more treats, more soda. His belly feeling painfully bloated. Gaps forming between his shirt buttons. There was still more on the desk behind him. 'Looks like someone is getting extremely full' Richie said, 'Yeah....but don't stop....I want it all...in here' Paul said, breathlessly. Rubbing his belly. Richie smiled 'of course sir', Richie grabbed the final donut and pushed it into Paul's mouth. As he swallowed it, a sudden pop sound occurred. Paul looked down and realised one his shirt buttons popped open. 'oh my Sir, it looks like your shirt couldn't contain you any more', 'no....I guess not....' Paul said. He began to shift his weight and began wriggling out of his pants, and his underpants. His large erection springing upwards, free of it's restraints. 'Keep going' Paul said. Richie was shocked but also incredibly turned on, he dropped his shorts and underwear too. He increased his pace in stuffing Paul, forcing in bags of crisps, donuts and the final soda, and chocolates. One by one, Paul's buttons burst off. Letting his belly hang free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just one more bite sir' Richie said, forcing the last of the cake into Paul's mouth. With great difficulty he swallowed. Paul moaned, and breathed heavily. His belly rising and falling from the pressure. He stared at Richie, as if to say 'please relieve me'. Richie, moved behind Paul and moved everything off his teachers desk. Grabbing Paul's shoulder and gently pulled him back. Having Paul lay back on the desk. His legs dangling from the edge, and his belly high in the air. Richie walked around and began to gently lay the tips of his fingers across Paul's belly. Paul could barely talk. He just let Richie do whatever he wanted to his belly. Richie began to get more forceful, shaking Paul's belly. Slapping it, jiggling it. kissing it. Letting moans of pleasure escape Paul't mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie walked at Paul's side, he looked at his belly intently. Paul noticed this and grabbed Richie's hand, 'it's....ok' Paul said, Richie smiled, and began to thrust his dick into the side of Paul's belly. Both of them moaning loudly. Richie couldn't take it. He climbed onto the desk and straddled Paul's belly. Paul began to rub the thighs of the young jock. Who thrust harder into Paul's belly. Moving down so that he could buck into Paul's under belly. 'Obesity is so bad for you sir' Richie said, Paul looked confused 'Look at you. This is what happens when you eat like a pig, you become one' Richie said, Paul smiled 'I...am....a pig' Paul said, 'yes you are sir. We need to get you on a diet' Richie said, 'Yeah....before it's too late.....I better get to the gym......but....' Paul said, 'but what sir?' Richie asked, 'but the Pig in me won't let me!' Paul said, Richie began to moan louder. Moving further up Paul's belly, his erection pushing further into Paul's belly. 'You're not going to be able to walk when i'm done with you' Richie said, feeling himself get closer to climax, 'Good' Paul said. That was enough for Richie, he couldn't hold it back anymore. He began to cum all over Paul's belly, it was a constant unending stream, that covered huge areas of Paul's belly. Richie couldn't stop it, and was struggling to breath from the intensity of his orgasm. What felt like an eternity, Richie finished. Breathlessly, Richie struggles to get up. Paul just laying there, stuffed and covered in his students cum.

Paul began to moan louder. 'I need to keep feeding you sir...Watch your belly hit 300...400...600....1000. Nothing you can do, will ever stop me from doing that to you' Richie said, 'I...I don't want you to ever stop' Paul said, wanting this moment to last. 'Your wife, she will probably hate you. But it doesn't matter. You are doing what you want. Letting the pig take over' Richie said pumping Paul's erection harder. 'Yeah....please do that to me. I don't want to walk anymore. I will eat everything.....everything is food to me....1000 is nothing.....I want.....I want.....I...Ahhhhhh' Paul said, he couldn't finish his sentence. He began to cum, it shooting all up his underbelly and over onto the top of his belly. His belly muscles couldn't contort, they were so full and pushed to their limits. Making it even more pleasurable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie walked over to Paul and bent down and kissed him passionately. While Paul finished orgasming.</span></div></div>",

They didn't have much money and Paul was trying to hold down spending.  Paul was beginning to worry about getting fat and it seemed that his metabolism was slowing down.

Because money wasn't tight, Paul stopped worrying about how much Kathy ordered and gradually a pattern of eating half of Kathy's order because the norm.  Preoccupied with his career and then Kathy's pregnancy, Paul began to pack on the pounds and get a bit soft.  Kathy didn't mind.  In fact she believed that a fatter Paul would be less tempting to other women.<br>\r\n\"I told you that double cheeseburger would be too much for you.\"  Paul grinned as he lifted that sandwich to his mouth.<br>\r\nPaul knew he was heavier but so were all his friends.

There is enough here to feed 8 people!' Paul said laughing and making his belly jiggle slightly, 'well 8 or 1 man with a very large sweet tooth, i know you baby. After a large meal you always want something sweet, so i thought i'd be prepared' Kathy said, taking her husband by the hand and leading him to the bed, making him sit on the edge.

Kathy said, Paul continued to chew and swallowed 'then i'll get really fat' Paul said, he wanted to gauge his wife's reaction to this, 'good' Kathy said launching herself at Paul, kissing his deeply, whilst rubbing his belly, 'I want my Paulie to eat and grow his belly for me', Paul moaned loudly, his erection getting bigger 'You want me fat?' Paul asked, 'oh yes, each pound you gain makes you all the more sexy and even Paul Jr loves your belly, he loves sitting on his daddy's belly. Imagine his joy if his daddy was huge' Kathy said kissing her husband again, 'If my family wants me fat....then who am i to argue' Paul said, he lay back on the bed, his towel slipped open leaving him lying naked 'now you better get feeding, this belly ain't going to grow by itself Kathy' Paul said, he winked at his wife and gave his belly a slap, sending ripples through it. Kathy grabbed the plate of chocolate brownies and proceeded to feed each one to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul enjoyed 3 hours of feeding, every single one of the treats was now being turned to fat inside his belly. Throughout the whole event, Paul had been disciplined and was still extremely horny but as soon as he swallowed the last vanilla slice, he erupted there and then, Kathy kissed him deeply 'well done my baby; i can't wait to get you huge' she said before going for a shower herself and leaving Paul, full, sticky and still very much horny on the bed, he looked down at his belly 'oh god, this is going to be incredible'  </span></div></div>",

Taking him up to 265lbs. His face had fattened slightly, his moobs were a little bigger but his belly had grown quite significantly, it was much rounder and ball like but mostly due to how full he was all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mmm I'm going to miss my big boy for 3 days' Kathy said kissing the fatter Paul, 'I know baby, but I haven't seen Barry in 2 months and he got us a great deal on that golf course, it's only three days and Barry says there is some great restaurants around...so maybe I can sneak out and be a piggy' Paul said returning a kiss to his wife and finishing his packing, 'ooo that would be fab baby'. Paul continued packing, kissed his wife and son goodbye and jump in his car to meet Barry at the hotel and golf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't been on the road long and he got stuck in a traffic jam, an accident further up the motor way had closed all lanes until the problem had been resolved. Paul grabbed his phone and text Barry <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey mate, I'm on my way but stuck in traffic, so I'll see you when I see you' It wasn't long till Barry text back confirming he was at the hotel already but it was lashing it down, so the golf was postponed until the next day, so they could do what they wanted that evening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor 6 hours, Paul was stuck in that traffic jam! And he was famished! Rolling up to the hotel, Paul unloaded his bags, checked in and went to his room where Barry was sat on the sofa. It was a big room with two double beds, a leather two seater sofa, a large TV on the wall, a minibar stocked with snacks and beers, the bathroom to Paul right was heavily tiled, with a large bath and a large shower cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul set down his bags and clubs 'Hey Barry' Paul said wearily, 'Paul! Good to see you mate....' Barry got up and walked over to see his friend with his much larger belly 'Bloody hell Paul, looks like you've been living the good life' Barry said jokingly and poking Paula belly, 'haha yeah something like that' Paul said, he gently rubbed his belly as it let out a loud rumble. 'Sounds like someone's hungry' Barry said laughing and making his own belly jiggle, although it wasn't as big as Pauls, it was still very ample. 'I'm absolutely famished mate, any good places to eat round these parts?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well...There is this buffet we usually go to whilst we're here with work, pretty good food and it's as much as you want so.....' Barry said but Paul interrupted him 'you had me at buffet' Paul said. Barry smiled and the two gentlemen headed down to his car where he drove them down to the Chinese buffet called 'the oriental lotus'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the entered they were shown to a booth where Paul only had an inch or two to fit him. Barry headed up first loading up two plates, whilst Paul brought back 3 on his visit...This kind of sparked a little bit of competition between the two friends as each loaded up more on each plate they got. At a 14 plates each, they were getting stuffed, Pauls belly now touched the table whereas Barrys was pretty much at the stage Pauls was at when they entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry had finished but determined, Paul managed to get up to 18 plates and he was beat. Full to the brim, both Barry and Paul struggled out of the booth, paid, left for the hotel and headed back to their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul walked in and sat on his bed 'now that.....that was a meal' Paul said with slight relief, Barry laughed 'Sure was..can't believe you managed 18 plates!' He said nodding towards Pauls extremely full belly, 'neither can I' Paul said smiling, this started to make Paul hard, he tried to ignore it, 'anyway I'm just going to grab a quick shower' Barry said grabbing a towel off the side. Paul smiled, Barry closed the door and turned on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul fell back 'oh god that was so good' he said tohimself, he gently rubbed his swollen belly, but it was making him harder, he needed relief but didn't want Barry to catch him, he let out a series of moans and heard the water stop. He looked over to see Barry walk out with nothing but a towel resting below his own belly. It was large, very heavy, very round with a deep bellybutton and a big set of love handles, Paul couldn't stop staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You ok Paul?' Barry asked walking over and sitting on his friends bed. 'I'm getting fat Barry...' Paul said, 'I know...' Barry said looking at his friends belly up and down, 'may I?' Barry asked pointing to Pauls belly, Paul just nodded. Barry grabbed the rim of Pauls tight t - shirt and rested it on his chest and begin gently stroking it with the tips of his fingers, Paul moaned again, 'that nice fatty?' Barry asked, 'fantastic...' Paul said mesmerised, Barry then shockingly mounted Paul; resting below his belly, so he could rub either side, Paul just muttered button and Barry obliged by releasing his trouser button. Paul reached up to return the belly rubs to his friend and gently caressed his finger in his friends bellybutton, causing Barry to start moaning. He fell forward onto Pauls belly, causing a loud smack as their bodies collided and kissed passionately, Barry shifted up, removed his towel and began to thrust into Pauls belly, causing both to moan in ecstacy. The two erupted shortly after this began, lying there spent and breathless, Paul uttered under his breath 'want to go again?'</span></div></div>",

They were so far from home and nobody would ever expect to see either one of them at a gay bar anyway.  What could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry stuffed himself provatively into straining dress slackss and a curve fitting sweater while Paul bulged over some skinny jeans fillinf out a shirt front with new flab. Awkwardly they strolled into the club.  The club was mostly twinks and hunks but here and there were a few well dressed but unimpressive bodies.  Barry seemed concerned but Paul strutted proud and fat holding hands with Barry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul steered Barry to the bar where they found stools and sat.  They watched the couples dancing and cought their breaths.<br>\r\n\"What can I get you?\"<br>\r\nThe barman smiled at the couple.  Paul smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Beer for me.\"  he said.  Barry nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both men were into the partners and completely unaware that the had become the center of attention for everyone in the bar.  Most were apparently appalled to see such overfed examples of manhood let it all hang out.  Still there were one or two of the men who stared a bit too intently.  <br>\r\nBarry was breathing heavily from the exertion when Paul led him off the dance floor and over to a corner table.  Paul was breathing heavily too but as much from watching Barry flinging his fat around the dance floor as the dancing. Barry was still breathless but he was able to point to the Double cheesburger with onion rings, french fries and baked beans and a pitcher of draft beer.  Paul selected ribs and a selection of sides.<br>\r\nSoon both men had downed a massive meal and were happily draining their beers when a man appeared and addressed Barry.

Once there the young man draped his slender yet muscular body on Barry;s bulk while Barry swayed to a slow dance.  Gradually Barry  became more energetic.  He cupped the young man's tiny butt in his hands and balanced him on his belly while moving around the floor.<br>\r\nDean watched with amazement.  He hadn't seen this coming.  Sure Barry was hot and fat but he never expected any of the twinks at a gay bar to appreciate him.  Maybe it hadn't been such a good idea to go clubbing.  <br>\r\n\"Want to dance, Sime?\"<br>\r\nA deep growl interrupted Dean's musing and he looked up to see a muscle bear only a few inches taller than Barry but probably 100 pounds heavier with most of that weight being hard bulging muscle.  <br>\r\n\"I'm just waiting for my partner.\" he answered smiling at the man and appraising his hansome face.<br>\r\n\"I don't think he will mind.\"  the man growled.  Dean quivered at the secuality of that voice.<br>\r\n\"I promise I don't bite.\"  Dean was mesmorized by the man's size, his sexy voice and a killer smile.  Before Dean could refuse he found himself lifted out os his chair, pulled into an embrace and whrled around the floor.  Dean seemed to fit into the embrace, his soft roundness filling the gap beneath that huge chest  at the firm abst of his partner.<br>\r\nHe introduced himself as Rock.  He continued to make small talk and every word that Rock purred and growled made Dean quiver more. Rock's hands were exploring the soft curves of Dean's softer body.  Dean responded by embracing Rock to feel his hard chest against Dean's sofster one. Weak from lust, Dean found himself  delivered back to his table.  Rock seated him and kissed his lips. There hands touched and Dean felt a card between his fingers.<br>\r\nHe read the card.  Daniel Rockwell (Rock)  Security<br>\r\nHe looked up to see Barry looking all hot and bothered after his spin around the floor. His partner was in his lap feeding him.  Barry looked pleased byt embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"This is Scout.\" he announced. <br>\r\nDean nodded.  This was a completely unexpected development.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
