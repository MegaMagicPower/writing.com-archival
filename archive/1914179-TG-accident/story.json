The dark woods were on each side of him as his headlights painted the road in light. Lucas was going a bit over the average speed limit. He had always thought himself as an expert driver, that disaster could not touch him, but all that was about to change. <br>\r\nLucas took a sharp turn, the car veered off the road. <br>\r\n\"Oh gosh no.\" Lucas yelled. <br>\r\nThe car started to tumble. \"No, no, AGGHHH!\" <br>\r\nThe car tumbled off the road into the dark woods surrounding the road. The car lay in a crumbled heap of mess and mangle. Everything lay still for a while then a foot kicked the car window open. Lucas crawled out of the car amazingly uninjured but in shock. He walked out into the street and started walking down.<br>\r\nLucas walked for at least a mile when he came across....            </span></div></div>",

He had wild hair and a crazed look in his eye. He pushed his glasses up on his nose. <br>\r\n\"Hello young man,\" He said in a raspy voice. \"What happened to you?\" <br>\r\n\"I-I got in a car crash coming down the road. Can you be of any assistants, do you have a phone I could use?\" Lucas asked thinking he could trust him. <br>\r\nThe old man shined the flash light into Lucas's eyes again. \"Are you alone?\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucas questioned. <br>\r\n\"Does anyone know your out here?\" The old man said. <br>\r\n\"Umm no sir,\" Lucas said not expecting anything. <br>\r\nThe old man lowered the flash light and smiled. \"Good.\" <br>\r\nHe took out a gun and shot Lucas in the chest. Lucas fell to the ground breathless. He looked up at the old man wondering why. <br>\r\nThe old man smiled. \"Don't worry you're not dead, not yet.\" <br>\r\nLucas faded out.            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Lucas awoke unable to move. His arms and legs were strapped down to a table of some sort. He was still alive but barley, the bullet still in his chest. He looked around discovering he was in an all white room. But scattered around the interior were crude instruments and layouts. <br>\r\nA whole entire wall was posted with pictures of people titled FAILED EXPERIMENTS. In front of Lucas was a group of running computers. He wanted to scream but he couldn't. He heard a door open. The old man walked in carrying a white briefcase. He pulled a chair up to Lucas and sat down next to him. He studied Lucas. <br>\r\n\"Still alive, I knew I had found a strong one. But you won't be for long will you.\" The old man picked up the case  and placed it on Lucas's bare chest. He took some latex gloves out. <br>\r\n\"Your're probably wondering, why am I here. Or am I here to kill you?\" He said gesturing to himself. \"No, I am not here to kill you sir, I am here to give you rebirth.\" <br>\r\nThe old man looked over to Lucas, he was fading out.<br>\r\nThe old man took a needle and put it in Lucas's arm jolting him awake with adrenaline. <br>\r\n\"Don't leave me just yet. I need you alive for the process.\" The old man said taking out a long syringe with black goo like liquid inside of it. Lucas's eyes widened at the site. <br>\r\n\"You see sir, I was once a military R&amp;D employee for the military. They wanted me to create the ultimate solider. Perfect. But I told them that if they wanted the \"Ultimate\" solder they would have to long beyond this world and to another. You see long ago, I had found this concoction in the Norwegian mountains. Legend tells that whomever finds the \"Black Pool\" will be the father of the Valkyrie.\" <br>\r\nLucas gave the Old man a crazed look. He laughed. \"That is the same look they gave me!\" He said. \"They thought I was insane, kicked me out destroyed my reputation.....But I still had my formula, I still had my knowledge. So I set out to create my own solider. Now as you see,\" The doctor said pointing at the wall of pictures. \"I've had some mistakes across the way. But I've made improvements and you my son are going to be the first of a new spices, the dominant species!\" <br>\r\nLucas shook his head and mumbled no as the doctor injected him with the formula. <br>\r\nLucas's body twitched as his pale skin added color, the cut and bruises he had retained in the crash slowly faded away, the bullet in his chest ejected itself from his body like a crock on a champagne bottle. Lucas's body was repaired. Lucas looked over at the old man. <br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He said finally able to speak again. <br>\r\nThe old man was looking down at Lucas's area. <br>\r\n\"Oh it's not over yet my son.\" The old man said. <br>\r\nLucas looked down and screamed. His manhood was slowly, painfully, reseeding into his body. Lucas's hip winded. <br>\r\n\"What did you do to me!!!\" Lucas yelled. <br>\r\nThe old man looked at Lucas with wonder \"The Valkyrie is being born!\" <br>\r\nLucas screamed in agony as his body continued to transform. His body took on a more female shape becoming more lean and sexy. His stomach flat and chizzled, his legs baby smooth. His hair grew into long locks as his face shifted. He gave the old man one last look. <br>\r\n\"Goodbye.\" The old man said. <br>\r\nLucas's face became soft and innocent as two mounds started two grow on his chest creating two C sized breast. Lucas grew larger, his body extending a foot longer. Black nails shot out of his finger tips as the straps containing his popped off. He roe off the table as two black wings feathered wings exploded out of his back. He stood tall with his 5 foot wings extending left and right. Lucas was now a beautiful, alien like young woman. He looked down at the old man with pale blue eyes. <br>\r\n\"Father.\" SHE said soft and sweet. <br>\r\nThe old man smiled. \"Yes my dear, Father.\"        <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n                                      </span></div></div>",

Old gravestones popped out of the surface of the fog, on the far side of the cemetery stood an old crypt. <br>\r\nLucas grabbed his bruised side. <br>\r\n\"I can't go on like this forever; I need to find shelter in till morning.\" He said starting toward the cemetery. The cemetery was like something out of a horror movie. It was Erie, dark, and silent. Twigs cracked beneath Lucas\u2019s feet as he approached the old crumbling Crypt. Lucas looked up at Crypt with fear. An almost green aura surrounded the back of Crypt. Lucas walked up to the big stone doors of the crypt. Above them was the name, written in curvy lettering, Countess Vanessa. <br>\r\n\u201cCreepy,\u201d Lucas said as he pushed on the entrance to the tomb. It opened with a large CREAK!!! Lucas hesitantly walked inside. He looked around at the interior. Menacing looking statues were posted on the walls of the circler room. In the middle of the room lay a long gray open casket.  Out of it shined the green light that outlined the exterior of the building. Lucas, curious, started over to the casket. The door slammed close. <br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!!\u201d Lucas screamed.  <br>\r\nHe looked at the door knowing he should probably leave this place but something, something was drawing him, telling him to stay. The green light, he wanted to know what it was. He walked over to the tomb and saw a sight that made him jump out of his skin. A dead female skeleton lay in the casket with a stake jabbed through her chest, a green emerald necklace lay rapped around her neck along with the horrifying revelation. Her teeth, her teeth were pointed. She was a vampire. Lucas stumbled toward the door when he turned back around. He walked back over and examined it for a while, the emerald.  <br>\r\n\u201cI could be rich,\u201d He whispered under his breath. \u201cI could be filthy rich with that thing.\u201d<br>\r\nGreed over took him as he ripped the emerald off the vampire\u2019s chest. He held it up to his face examining the giant ruby. \u201cThey won\u2019t be missing this I know that much.\u201d He said. \u201cI guess this night turned out good after all.\u201d He said walking away when suddenly he felt strange, sickly even. <br>\r\nHe stumbled a little bit. \u201cWhat\u2019s what\u2019s going\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nLucas dropped the bracelet as everything started to blur.  He felt hot, extremely hot. Sweat poured down his face as if someone had thrown a bucket of water on him. He took off his clothes down to boxers. He still felt hot, almost as if he was melting. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat whhhaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslhlsdllggggg\u201d Lucas\u2019s skin slowly started to melt away from his body landing in little plumps of goo on the floor. Lucas was unable to scream as this un godly incident happened to him. Once it was over Lucas breathing deeply touched his face and head. All his hair was gone but his face was unusually soft. It actually felt good to touch. Lucas looked down at the rest of his body. All of his masculinity was gone. What was left was a pale skinny almost, Female creature. He started to gain a little more muscle mass as his nails elongated into black long spikes. A slit slowly grew where his penis formally was as something made Lucas\u2019s chest jolt out. Lucas let out an erotic cry as two breasts exploded from his chest, long dark locks flowed down his back as his butt expanded into something sexy and filled out. <br>\r\nHe held his newly formed breast. \u201cWhat the hell happened to me?\u201d He said. <br>\r\nLucas eyes rolled to the back of his head he fell to the floor unconscious.                                <br>\r\nAfter a few moments someone else arose, someone beautiful and full of new life. She laughed, \u201cHelsing thought he could kill me hahahaa, I thought it was going to be a few hundred years but,\u201d She felt her large breast. She directed her fabulous green eyes to the stone doors which slowly opened. She looked outside ready with a smile. <br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t know what hit em.\u201d She said triumphantly. </span></div></div>",

She dropped of branch toward the forest floor, landing hard on her soft feet. She got up surprisingly unharmed, walking over to Lucas.

He looked up toward the moon which seemed brighter than usual, it seemed, and it seemed to be resonating some kind of energy. He felt the energy of the moon.

Lucas let out a growl as his back collapsed in. Lucas finger nails grew out as his Face slowly melted and twisted around. He felt his skeletal structure rearranging itself under his skin. His hair grew out long and black. He rolled over on his back his face now that of a young goddess, his eyes a golden pigment. He let out a cry of ecstasy as his body continued to change. His hips and thighs grew wide and smooth.  His body grew fit and sexy; his penis sucked itself into his body. It was replaced by its female counterpart. Lucas let out another cry as his chest extended out forming two full breasts.  <br>\r\nAll was quiet as Lucas lay on the forest floor breathing in and out deeply.  He watched his breast extend with each breath. He got brushing himself off. <br>\r\n\u201cActually stayed awake for that one HA,\u201d He said wildly.<br>\r\nSomething had come over Lucas, something that felt good.  Lucas let his hands ride down his body feeling every curve; he put his hands on his soft breasts. <br>\r\n\u201cWow, wait till they get a hold of me.\u201d He said. He heard a hard landing behind him. He slowly turned knowing who it was. Just as he thought the girl form earlier, her eyes glowed with a golden hue. <br>\r\n\u201cSo, you finally changed? How does it feel?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\nLucas walked up to her, leaning in to her face slowly. \u201cExcellent.\u201d She whispered. <br>\r\nThe girl laughed walking around Lucas examining his new body.  \u201cIt seems your other side is pretty exotic.\u201d She said. <br>\r\nLucas patted his butt. \u201cSeems that way,\u201d She said with a sexy smile.<br>\r\nThe girl stopped in front of Lucas. \u201cSo, you feel like getting out of here and going out for a night on the town? I could introduce you to the others?\u201d She offered. <br>\r\nLucas took a few steps forward. \u201cShow me the way.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A stunning brunette walked onto a balcony overlooking a crowded club dance floor. She was wearing a short black dress that looked to be painted on. He ruby red lips separated as she looked down on the attractive attendance on the floor. She licked her lips. Another girl joined her wearing a similar dress only purple. <br>\r\n\u201cSo Lucas, you like what you see?\u201d She said. <br>\r\nLucas turned toward her smiling. \u201cYou know I do. Thanks for the upgrade,\u201d She said gesturing toward the dress. \u201cI\u2019ll defiantly pull more of them in wearing this. Hell actually I could do it without the dress.\u201d He laughed. Lucas started toward the stairs when the girl grabbed his arm. <br>\r\n\u201cHold up on second,\u201d She said. \u201cYou pretty sure you want to go down there with a name like Lucas?\u201d <br>\r\nLucas smiled. \u201cTrust me they won\u2019t be worried about my name with this body.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLucas, come on choose your Night name.\u201d She said <br>\r\nLucas twisted his face \u201cNight Name?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what you call your other side. You only use it during your morphs.\u201d She explained. <br>\r\nLucas looked down at the floor afraid. \u201cLucas, it doesn\u2019t give her more control.\u201d She said. <br>\r\nLucas wondered. \u201cWell, what\u2019s your name any way?\u201d  <br>\r\nThe girl took a few steps back. \u201cMy real normal form is called Amy, but at night, I become Amanda.\u201d <br>\r\nSuddenly the Amanda\u2019s eyes flashed golden and somehow someway she had grown more beautiful. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nAmanda felt the curves of her own body. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but the first time you address your other side on the nights you turn, you get the rush.\u201d She explained every word spoken sounding more erotic than the last. <br>\r\n\u201cThe rush,\u201d Amanda grabbed Lucas\u2019s cheeks pulling his face to hers, they were nose to nose. \u201cJust do it.\u201d She said. \u201cAnnounce your other side, trust me.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to lose himself but he also wanted to feel the rush. Amanda had been truthful to him so for so why stop now.  Lucas opened his eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cI got one,\u201d He said. Amanda let go of his face. \u201cSay it, say it!!\u201d She yelled. <br>\r\nLucas took a deep breath. \u201cScarlet.\u201d <br>\r\nSuddenly a giant magnificent surge of energy shot through Lucas\u2019s body. It was unlike anything he had felt before. It was arousing and enlightening. He could hear everything, smell everything, and he felt like a million dollars. He closed his eyes; he finally felt no connected with his other side, his shift. And she was a party animal. Lucas was mostly quiet and this was his loud side. He opened his eyes and let out a wild scream of joy. Tonight He was Scarlet and Scarlet wanted to have some fun.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas woke up exhausted in a very extravagant hotel room.  He rose out of bed still wearing the short black dress from last night. He smiled as all the unforgettable memoires flooded back in to his mind. The dancing, the grinding, the limos, and the girls.  He hadn\u2019t had a night like that in, well in ever.  Lucas got out of bed taking off the black dress. It slid to the floor as he heard high pitched groan. He turned to see Amy rising out of<br>\r\n the bed; she must have slept next to him. She was naked. The sight of her body made Lucas\u2019s penis shoot up like a missile. Amy turned toward him smiling at the sight. \u201cHappy to see me huh,\u201d She said. <br>\r\nLucas blushed. \u201cSorry, is there anything I could cover this up with?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThere are some robes in the restroom.\u201d Lucas quickly paced over to the restroom grabbing a robe. As he tied it around himself he asked. \u201cSo, did you and I do anything?\u201d <br>\r\nAmy curled her hair. \u201cNo, but if you want to, I know you\u2019re ready.\u201d Amy said studying Lucas. <br>\r\nLucas couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Amy. Her incredible curves, masterful tan complexion, and soft exotic face.  He noticed that he was staring at same woman from last night at the club. <br>\r\n\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t change back?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nAmy folded her arms against her small breast. \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d She replied. <br>\r\nLucas was confused. \u201cI mean that me and shift Amanda are one. \u201c <br>\r\nLucas was still confused not understanding what she was talking about. Amy sat down on the bed. \u201cYou know that time in the woods when I said your other side will brush off on you? This is what I meant.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re Amy and Amanda mixed together?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nAmy got off the bed and walked over to Lucas, seductively swaying her naked hips. She put her arms around his shoulders. They were face to face, lips almost touching. <br>\r\n\u201cI mean I\u2019m Amy with a little dash of Amanda. I have her body, her look, her speech. But Amy is still in charge.\u201d Lucas and Amy\u2019s lips came close when the door to the apartment opened. In walked six individuals, Mark, A tall muscled handsome young man who looked he was ripped off a magazine cover. Jesse, an average looking fellow like Lucas, Madeline a bikini clad model, Andrew a wide set fellow sucking down a martini, Lindsey a rather young looking girl, and finally victor, He was an old crow looking man wearing thick glasses. He looked out of place from the group. They all lined up in front of Amy and Lucas. <br>\r\n\u201cAre we interrupting something?\u201d Mark said in deep southern accent. <br>\r\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019ll get to it later.\u201d Amy said getting off of Lucas. <br>\r\n\u201cGood gosh woman, put some clothes on!\u201d Victor screeched. <br>\r\nAmy rolled her eyes going to the restroom grabbing a robe. \u201cYou know liked it.\u201d <br>\r\nAmy walked over to the group. \u201cLucas this is my pack, Mark, Jesse, Madeline, Andrew, Lindsey, and Victor.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe tried meeting you last night but we didn\u2019t want to interrupt your fun.\u201d Mark explained. <br>\r\n\u201cSo you guys are all,\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cShifters, yes,\u201d Mark answered. \u201cWe were all turned by one another so we decided to team up, becoming a pack.\u201d Mark explained. <br>\r\n\u201cA pack,\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLike wolfs?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nMark raised an eyebrow looking at Amy. Were they keeping something from Lucas? A phone ringer went off. It was Lindsey\u2019s. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh!!!\u201d Lindsey yelled walking over to the bed. She laid herself out on it. \u201cShe\u2019s calling again!\u201d She said. <br>\r\nThe group laughed. \u201cWe told you not to give out numbers.\u201d Madeline said in forging accent that Lucas couldn\u2019t pin point. <br>\r\nLindsey rose up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me! I gave Kevin a little too much control; you know how much he drools over blondes!\u201d She lay back down on the bed blocking the number. Mark grabbed Amy\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cAmy and I are going to have a little chat in the hall, why don\u2019t you guys get more acquainted with each other?\u201d Mark said as he and Amy disappeared into the hallway, closing the door behind them. <br>\r\n\u201cIs everything okay with them?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah there fine don\u2019t worry.\u201d Andrew said. <br>\r\n\u201cSo when were you turned?\u201d Madeline asked. <br>\r\n\u201cUh a few nights ago,\u201d Lucas replied. <br>\r\nLucas studied Madeline\u2019s amazing body. \u201cSo, are you a mixed shifter like Amy?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes, these boobs you\u2019re staring at are compliments of Macy.\u201d Madeline explained. <br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry,\u201d Lucas said. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be, I like the attention.\u201d  Madeline replied. <br>\r\n\u201cSo how long were to fucking last night?\u201d Victor asked Lucas. <br>\r\n\u201cWow that\u2019s straight forward.\u201d Andrew said throwing away his martini glass away. <br>\r\nLucas was offended. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Lucas answered. <br>\r\n\u201cReally,\u201d Lindsey said getting up from the bed. \u201cShe destroyed Kevin the first night she saw him.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cEwww you two,\u201d Madeline said disgusted. <br>\r\n\u201cIt was a onetime thing.\u201d Lindsey responded.<br>\r\nLucas looked over to Andrew. \u201cWelcome to the group.\u201d He laughed. <br>\r\nJesse went into the restroom and closed the door. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk much does he?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cNot when the suns up.\u201d Andrew responded. Amy and Mark re-entered the room. <br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s another party tonight. Who\u2019s all in?\u201d Amy said. <br>\r\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s a different club I\u2019m there.\u201d Lindsey said. <br>\r\n\u201cAnother one of Kevin\u2019s stalkers,\u201d Mark asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah and she\u2019s blonde!\u201d Lindsey said. <br>\r\nAmy looked over to Lucas. \u201cYou in Lucas?\u201d  </span></div></div>",

A bond was forming between them. <br>\r\n\u201cGreat, well we will leave you to alone to get ready.\u201d Mark said gesturing to the group to leave. They all began to leave. Lindsey whispered in Lucas\u2019s ear. \u201cPrepare to have your world rocked.\u201d <br>\r\nThey left the room leaving Lucas and Amy alone. <br>\r\n\u201cWe need to find a dress for you tonight.\u201d Amy said. <br>\r\n\u201cRight, I was thinking something Yellow?\u201d  Lucas responded. <br>\r\nAmy walked over to Lucas. \u201cBut in the meantime, while you still have your little friend,\u201d Amy pushed Lucas down on the bed jumping on top of him. \u201cLet\u2019s get to know each other a little better shall we.\u201d She kissed. They embraced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t********************** <br>\r\n   The club scene was electric. Amy and Lucas arrived just as it was getting good. Amy wore another seemingly painted on dress while Lucas who was still in male form, wore a suit. He had a small book bag on his shoulder. Amy walked up to the bouncer. She whispered something in his ear that caused him to look up at Lucas and smile. He took the rope off the gate. Amy gestured toward Lucas to come on in, he followed suit. Once they got in Amy turned to Lucas. <br>\r\n\u201cYou have five minutes,\u201d She said. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know. Where should I change?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cThe restrooms of course, pull a Clark Kent.\u201d Amy said. <br>\r\nHe looked over the restrooms. \u201cWhich one,\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cReally, you\u2019re about to change into a woman Lucas.\u201d Amy explained. <br>\r\nLucas understands. He begins to walk away when Amy grabs his shoulder. \u201cHold on.\u201d She said. <br>\r\nHe turned toward her looking into her golden eyes as she did the same. She kissed him, it was long soft kiss. She let go and said. \u201cJust one last time, I\u2019ll be waiting in the club. Hurry you don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d Amy said running off. Lucas started back to the restrooms. Last time for what? He thought. Lucas walked into the women\u2019s restroom thankful no one was there. He walked over to one of the stalls unlatching it. He went back inside locking it up. A timer went off inside his book-bag as sweat poured down his face. <br>\r\n\u201cDammit!\u201d He cursed under his breath. The shift had begun. <br>\r\nLucas\u2019s hips winded as he ripped of his dress pants. He grew shorter falling onto the toilet. The bathroom door opened. Someone walked in. They stood in front of the mirror probably fixing their makeup. Lucas covered his now morphing mouth muffling any grunts and girlish yelps. His naked legs smoothed out, thighs winded. His penis slowly sucked it\u2019s self into his body creating a vagina. His expanding buttocks elevated him a few inches off the toilet seat. Lucas\u2019s hair grew out as his face slowly morphed into that of his female form. He kept his hand over his mouth making sure he didn\u2019t make any noise. The woman left the restroom. Lucas took his hand off of his now puffy soft lips.          <br>\r\n      Lucas heaved as he felt his chest expand. He ripped apart his dress shirt as two voluptuous breast exploded on his chest. Lucas lay back on toilet, his transformation now complete. He breathed in and out tired from the change. He got up pulling off what was left of his dress shirt and jacket. Lucas rummaged through his book bag pulling out a yellow backless dress and heels to match. He slipped on the skimpy dress. It was tight, hugging every inch of his body. He slipped on the heels and walked out of the stall toward the mirror. He gasped at the sight of his image. He was lovely. Lucas went back to his book bag putting on some make-up here and there. He then threw the book bag away along with his shredded clothes. He looked at himself one last time before leaving the restroom. He looked at his now golden eyes, his soft face, and his large breast that the dress could hardly conceal. Is this what he wanted to be a party girl for the rest of his life, a Shifter? Every night in a different club and everyday day in a weird hotel, a group of people he knew nothing about his new family? Lucas looked down into the sink deciding what to do. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A group of six was walking up to Amy and Lucas, The pack. But they weren\u2019t the same pack from earlier. They had shifted. Mark and Madeline looked the same wearing their clad outfits, but the other four had changed a bit. A skinny but built young man walked beside Mark. He was devilishly handsome and had a suave smile on his face matching his blue dress suit. Along with him was an amazingly muscular man, a sexy vixen that seemed to be talking Madeline to death, and probably the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She had a dark wave of hair with a purple hue to it; breast as large as Lucas\u2019s, curves unlike any other woman in the room. She was perfect. They finally approached Lucas and Amy. <br>\r\n\u201cLucas, you\u2019re looking\u2026.let\u2019s just say I\u2019m very happy to see you.\u201d Mark said. <br>\r\n\u201cSo am I baby.\u201d The young man said kissing Lucas\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Lucas said stroking his chin.  \u201cLindsey?\u201d He asked the handsome man. <br>\r\n\u201cKevin,\u201d He said smiling. <br>\r\nLucas nodded going over to the other members. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Andrew, Jesse and victor?\u201d Lucas said pointing to the talkie, the muscle, and the angel of the group.  <br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d The muscle said in a bellowing voice. \u201cI\u2019m Andrew and that\u2019s Jesse.\u201d He said pointing to the talkie. The talkie, Jesse, leaped at Lucas giving him a large hug. She started shaking his hand like crazy. <br>\r\n\u201cHI I\u2019m Jesse I mean Jessica,\u201d The moment he uttered that that name SHE moaned with ecstasy. \u201cOh my gosh that feels good, do you feel good? I feel good! Let\u2019s go party, IM GOING TO GO PARTY!\u201d  Jessica ran into the crowd. <br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s Jesse...then that means?\u201d Lucas said turning toward the perfection of the group.  <br>\r\n\u201cThat I\u2019m Victor,\u201d The goddess in front of him said. \u201cYes. But that old crow doesn\u2019t pop up for another five hours, so for now I\u2019m Vanessa.\u201d She said as her eyes glowed with power at the sound of her name. Lucas raised an eyebrow.  They must all must have said their names already. But Vanessa seemed to be in control already? Lucas thought to himself. Before he could ponder on this thought more Amy grabbed his shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to go girl?\u201d Her eyes were radiating. Lucas realized this was Amada talking. <br>\r\n\u201cYou know it.\u201d Lucas replied as the Amanda and the pack walked off into the dance mob. Lucas closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He whispered the name \u201cScarlet.\u201d <br>\r\nScarlet opened her eyes and smiled. She balled up her fist as the energy surged through her. \u201cSee ya Luke.\u201d She said walking onto the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\t\t\t************************<br>\r\nAfter an hour of dancing, Scarlet went over to the bar. She sat down crossing her lushes\u2019 legs. She ordered a drink as an attractive young man took a seat next to her. <br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said staring at her legs. <br>\r\n\u201cLips are up here handsome.\u201d Scarlet replied. <br>\r\nThe young man was surprised by this. \u201cYour quick aren\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\nScarlet planted one on him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She said. <br>\r\n\u201cChris.\u201d He said raising his hand for a shake.<br>\r\n\u201cScar-Sc-Scarlet,\u201d Scarlet stuttered. Something was wrong. <br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Chris asked. <br>\r\n\u201cKiss me again and I will be.\u201d Scarlet said annoying her now throbbing headache. Their lips locked once again. Scarlet enjoyed every moment of this. Chris put his hand on Scarlet\u2019s thigh, stroking it. Scarlet began to twitch, her headache getting worse. Chris didn\u2019t notice as he kept on going, Scarlet was now in his lap.  Her eyes rolled to the back of her head as she muttered. \u201cNo,\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo what baby don\u2019t you like it?\u201d\u201d Chris said.  <br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Lucas said pushing Chris away. Lucas fell to the floor his head on fire. \u201cHey bitch, no one pushes me!\u201d Chris said slapping Lucas. Lucas inhumanly screamed as his body began to shake violently. Lucas\u2019s eyes glowed and his canines sharpened. He began to transform. Lucas roared over the load club music as every inch of hair on his body grew out, becoming a thick black sheath of hair covering  his body. He shot up a foot exploding out of his yellow dress. He yelled at the crowd of partiers as his nails elongated into long sharp claws. Lucas, now an unimaginable beast, leaped at Chris ready to kill. Almost out of nowhere, Andrew appeared pushing aside Chris and tackling Lucas. He screamed back at the crowd. <br>\r\n\u201cRUN EVERYBODY OUT NOW, LEAVE!\u201d <br>\r\nThe club dispersed as Andrew fought off the now feral Lucas. Mark and the rest of the pack showed up. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell happened,\u201d Mark asked. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know? She changed?\u201d Andrew said. <br>\r\n\u201cI can see that Andrew restrain her, end this!\u201d Mark commanded. <br>\r\nAndrew gave Lucas a quick elbow knocking Lucas out. He slumped to the floor unconscious. The pack surrounded him decided on what to do. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Andrew asked.<br>\r\n\u201cPut her in the Limo. We\u2019ll deal with her back at the hotel.\u201d Mark ordered. <br>\r\nAndrew and Kevin picked up Lucas taking her to the Limo in the back. Vanessa circled back around Mark.  \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s a she anymore.\u201d She said to Mark. Mark gave her pondering look. \u201cShe must have lost control of him.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sat and was startled by the group of glowing eyes that greeted him. The pack stood in front of him deathly serious. \u201cWhat- Why am I naked what happened?\u201d Lucas asked disoriented. <br>\r\nAfter a long pause Mark finally answered. \u201cYou changed.\u201d He answered.  \u201cTend to her\u2026.I mean him, Amanda, a word.\u201d Madeline went over to Lucas while Amanda and Mark went out on the balcony. Mark slid the door shut. Amanda looked out among the stars when Mark began. \u201cDid you and he?\u201d <br>\r\nAmanda turned toward Mark offended. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d She replied<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to know if you have any feeling for him. You know what might have to do?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do Mark.\u201d She said with smite. <br>\r\nMark nodded.  \u201cLucas is not supposed to be here anymore. Scarlet should have taken control, but she didn\u2019t how did that happen?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go find out shall we.\u201d <br>\r\nThe two went back inside of the hotel and approached Lucas. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cYou activated your defense shift; apparently someone really pissed you off.\u201d Mark said.                     <br>\r\n\u201cBut who, I don\u2019t know most of the night is a blur. Why can\u2019t I remember anything?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cBecause you weren't in control Lucas, Scarlet was.\u201d Mark answered. <br>\r\nLucas was dumbfounded. \u201cWhat, what are you talking about.  I thought I was always in control?\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe for the first few nights yeah, but after a certain point you\u2019re not. We then control.\u201d <br>\r\nMark enjoyed the terrified look on Lucas\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t get it what the hell are you people?\u201d  Lucas muttered. <br>\r\n\u201cSimply put we\u2019re Aliens pal.\u201d Mark smiled continuing. \u201cWe invade the body unlocking that perfect version of you molding it into the perfect version us. Then we take you, erasing the host.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIf you take us over completely why do they turn back to their normal forms? Why do they remember everything?\u201d Lucas asked pointing to the pack. <br>\r\n\u201cBecause we allow them to Lucas,\u201d Vanessa said taking a few steps forward. We want the host to think they are in control but truly they are not.  They may have control over what drink they get, what to say sometimes but the bigger things are up to us.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe give what they need to remember.\u201d Andrew concluded. <br>\r\nLucas looked over to Madeline, Amanda, and Mark. \u201cSo what about you guys. Why are you always in Shirt form?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBecause we have complete control, soon enough we\u2019ll all be like this.\u201d Madeline said. <br>\r\n\u201cYou were supposed to be like us tonight, you were supposed to lose control and become a permanent shifter.\u201d Amanda jumped in. \u201cBut somehow you regained it.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a glitch in the system Lucas and you need to be reprogrammed.\u201d Mark said. <br>\r\n\u201c Reprogrammed?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll scratch you again, letting our venom change you once more erasing your primary personal. It\u2019ll hurt but you\u2019ll no longer exist.\u201d Vanessa explained. <br>\r\n\u201cI know this is crony but any last words?\u201d Mark commented. <br>\r\nLucas swallowed thinking about his chance to walk away from this, thinking about\u2026Amy. <br>\r\n\u201cSo Amy, Lindsey, Jesse? They never existed did they?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cSome didn't and some soon won\u2019t.\u201d Mark said. <br>\r\nLucas looked up Amanda. \u201cThis was all ploy, wasn't it?\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cSadly yes,\u201d Amy replied. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about escaping Lucas. We have packs scattered everywhere you\u2019ll never get away.\u201d  Mark explained. <br>\r\nA tear slipped down Lucas\u2019s face when suddenly the door was kicked opened. The pack whirled around as three loud bangs echoed through the room. Gas filled the room. It was blinding. Growls and barks of shouts erupted causing Lucas to jump off the bed. Lucas tried to make a break for the door when he was hit up aside the head. He fell to the floor once again unconscious. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was still in female form. Lucas looked down at his stomach. A black chain was wrapped around it. His hands were also tightly wrapped. Lucas looked around the area. He could tell where he was. Bright lights shined on him from every angle blurring his vision. He sat in a cold metal chair. <br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d Lucas muttered. <br>\r\nHe was still scared not knowing who had taken him. A steel whine scraped across the floor in front of Lucas. Lucas sat up straight not knowing who was coming out of the darkness.  A young man, eighteen most likely, came out of the darkness dragging a steel chair. He had dark black hair and was in semi-military garb. He had a pistol on his right hip. He placed the chair right in front of Lucas taking a seat. He looked Lucas up and down studying his amazing body. He was getting aroused but trying to hide it. He looked Lucas in the eyes trying to ignoring his other features. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want form me?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nThe man slapped Lucas across the face. \u201cI\u2019m asking the questions around here.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas ignored the pain looking back at the man. \u201cWhat the no witty comeback, no insult and you\u2019re not going to try to come on to me?\u201d The man said. <br>\r\nLucas kept quiet looking into the man\u2019s soul. \u201cStop looking at me.\u201d He ordered. <br>\r\nLucas looked away following orders. The man was surprised by this. \u201cYou\u2019re a lot more obedient than the others. Why?\u201d <br>\r\nLucas didn\u2019t answer. <br>\r\n\u201cWell I take that back. You know you could break out of here right? Why don\u2019t you?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not like them?  Lucas said softly answering both of his questions.  <br>\r\n\u201cHow so,\u201d The man wondered. <br>\r\n\u201cLook at me. Do really look like one of them?\u201d Lucas said. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah you kind of do, glowing eyes and all,\u201d But the man studied Lucas\u2019s golden eyes. They seemed almost faded. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve apparently seen us before, you know about shifters right?\u201d <br>\r\nThe man nodded. \u201cSo look at me my demeanor, my speech. I\u2019m trying to cover myself up for crying out loud what shifter would try to that.\u201d Lucas pleaded. <br>\r\n\u201cYou just be faking.\u201d The man said. <br>\r\n\u201cNo, no I\u2019m not. Before you raided the hotel they said that I was a defected Shifter that something was wrong with me. They were going to reboot me or something.  I\u2019m not one of them I swear on my life!\u201d Lucas cried. <br>\r\n\u201cReally? because you were acting a lot like a full blown Shifter at the club earlier. How do you explain that? \u201c The man asked. <br>\r\nHe had been watching Lucas and the pack. \u201cAm I acting anything like Scarlet now?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\nThe man watched Lucas\u2019s eyes like a hawk waiting for them to glow. Nothing happened. The man stood up. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, you change back into man you live. You don\u2019t you die. And if you change into anything else you\u2019ll be shot on sight, got it?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI got it.\u201d <br>\r\nThe Man dragged the chair back into the darkness as Lucas waited for sun rise.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lucas heaved as a heavy lining of sweat started to cover his body. Though Lucas couldn't see it he could feel it...the sun was rising. <br>\r\nHe could feel his bones cracking and rearranging. His hair pulled itself back into his head shortening. His face popped and cracked back to his male image. His muscle was returning and he was growing larger. As he grew the chains became tighter against his still changing female stomach. The were cutting into his body not fitted for his larger male form. <br>\r\n\u201cOh shit!\u201d Lucas said in a mixture of his male and female voice. \u201cHEY, HEY CAN ANYONE OF YOU IDIOTS HELP LEND A GUY A HAND!!!\u201d Lucas yelled in his screechy deep voice. <br>\r\nThere was a loud commotion in the darkness beyond the lights. Doors could be heard slinging open followed by the sound of frantic footsteps. Three unbenounced young soldiers entered the light. A scruffy looking young man in the middle dropped his gun flabbergasted at the sight of Lucas\u2019s transformation. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my...\u201d He gasped. <br>\r\nLucas let out a painful chuckle. \u201cYeah this is what happens when you don\u2019t sleep through a sunrise.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas\u2019s head jolted back as his breast sucked themselves back into his body. \u201cYou guys mind cutting these chains lose? They\u2019re kind of tight and are starting to sink in, It\u2019d be much appreciated.\u201d<br>\r\nThe soldiers looked at each other searching for a answer. Lucas\u2019s butt and thighs deflated causing him to slowly gain his natural height and mass. The chains suck deeper beginning  to cut skin. <br>\r\n\u201cLISTEN TO ME YOU FUCKING MORONS, IF YOU WANT ME ALIVE AND WELL YOU\u2019D STOP LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND CUT THESE FUCKING CHAINS OFF!!!!!\u201d <br>\r\nThe soldiers moved accordingly to Lucas\u2019s demands. A mustached soldier cut Lucas free. He fell to the floor his body finishing out the rest of his shift. After one last furious CRACK Lucas was male again. <br>\r\nHe lay on his back breathing deeply in and out. The three soldiers looked at Lucas dumbfounded. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI have a condition.\u201d  <br>\r\nThe click off boots sounded off as someone approached. Lucas turned his head to see the young man from earlier. He looked down at Lucas with dissatisfaction. He wanted to kill a shifter this morning. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cGet up and put some pants on. We need to talk about my sister.\u201d The young man said. <br>\r\n\u201cSister?\u201d Lucas asked. <br>\r\n\u201cAmy.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Lucas looked around; he was in some type of circle shaped room. Lucas staggered over to a wall. It was glass like the floor.  <br>\r\n\u201cHello? Where am I?\u201d Lucas screamed toward what looked like an infinite ceiling of darkness. Strange sounds screeched from all around.  Lucas backed up back to the middle of the circle, afraid unable to see was going on when the whole room lit up in a flash. With the glass walls now transparent Lucas was able to see the horrors around him. Lucas was inside of a giant cylinder, the one you see in chemistry classes. Lucas had somehow been shrunken down to about two inches! But that wasn\u2019t the worst part; Lucas had discovered that he was in some type of futuristic laboratory.  He recognized none of the smooth white giant instruments. The screeches returned and Lucas face went pale, he had discovered the source of the sounds. Lucas dropped to the floor as gigantic towering beings examined him.  Their skin was gray, their bodies deathly skinny, they had big heart shaped heads and large black eyes that traced his every movement. Lucas looked up at their giant mouth-less faces and muttered the only words imaginable. <br>\r\n\u201cAliens\u2026Aliens?\u201d He whispered. <br>\r\nHe had been abducted by aliens, your classic big headed gray aliens. Lucas didn\u2019t know what to do; he spun slowly in circles looking at each of the three faces surrounding the cylinder. They exchanged screeches in what Lucas guessed was their language. One of the aliens raised its long skinny arms. It swayed its long fingers causing a holographic screen to appear. It pressed a few buttons on the screen while still looking at Lucas. The screen disappeared as a crumbling hum sounded over Lucas.  A black nozzle slowly manifested over the cylinder. Lucas didn\u2019t have time to react when a green liquid filled the cylinder. It shot in the cylinder like a fire hose filling it up with lighting speed. Lucas coughed up the green liquid as it blinded him.  As Lucas swam around in the liquid his skin began to melt away, his bones fell a part, he was melding with the liquid becoming it. Lucas yelled one last time as he disappeared into the thick green liquid.  </span></div></div>",

Lucas realizes the sounds are coming out of a device in it's hand. \"So sorry, you're biological structure did not take very well to the suspension agent. It completely destroyed one of your chromosomes. Fortunately we were able to duplicate your remaining chromosome to reconstitute you. It was Rasias fault, Rasias is new\", the alien explains motioning towards another alien. Lucas raises a hand and rub his head. As he does he notice his hand looks different, slender and feminine. \"What the hell\", Lucas mutters? Lucas then hears his voice, again very feminine. Lucas looks down at herself. Her view is obstructed by what appears to be two very large breasts with erect nipples on top. \"Holy shit, you turned me into a girl\",  Lucas shouts! Lucas can swear that the alien's face appears to be confused. \"Girl, this word does not translate. You do appear different, but this was programmed into your genetic structure. Please explain\", it says. \"Girl, the opposite of boy you alien idiots\", Lucas shouts! The alien appears to be thinking. \"Ah, boy, girl, yes I understand now. Your species is separated into two genders requiring two individuals for procreation. A very inefficient and primitive method. Why does it matter if you're a girl, or boy? Seems like a very trivial thing\", the alien says. Lucas swings off the table raises her hands and demands, \"Change me back right now.\" Alarmed by Lucas's behavior the other alien pulls out another device and pulls the trigger.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas continued down the dark road when he heard a roaring screech overhead. The sound of propellers and snapping wood echoed as a helicopter came crashing down in the middle of the road. Lucas ran down into a ditch as the fuel tank of the helicopter exploded sending fiery debris his way.   Lucas waited for everything to calm down in till coming out. Looked up out of the ditch, It was chaos. Small fires raged around the mangled remains of a military helicopter. The end propeller still slowly spun. Lucas slowly walked toward the wreckage, wondering if there were any survivors. Suddenly the cockpit was kicked open and figure crawled out. Lucas ran over to the figure. An old man lay in the wreckage bloody and bruised. Lucas came up to him, crouching down checking if he was alright. The old man\u2019s white lab coat was covered in blood and riddled with bullet holes. His glasses were bent and clothes almost torn off. What else had this man bee through? The old man jumped to life grabbing Lucas\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cGet away from me,\u201d He said. \u201cNow, get away before she comes.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas looked down at a blood stained name tag. Sanders, Fred Sanders it said.  <br>\r\n\u201cDr. Sanders it\u2019s going to be okay, you were in an accident.\u201d Lucas told him. <br>\r\nThe old man twitched unnaturally looking around. \u201cThey\u2019re dead, they\u2019re all dead. Nothing was stopping her bullets, grenades, nothing. My entire fault, I tested it on myself and she came out.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas looked down at the man\u2019s stomach. There was a large piece of shrapnel sticking out of it. He was fading. <br>\r\n\u201cI took the copter and ran but she followed,\u201d He said. Lucas looked around. \u201cShe\u2019s still here.\u201d Lucas looked back down at him horrified.  \u201cRun, now why you still can, she\u2019ll take you. You\u2019re young and healthy, fit for use.\u201d The old man\u2019s chest jolted forward unnaturally as he choked up. Lucas began to back away heeding the man\u2019s warning when he squeezed the Lucas\u2019s arm like a mad man. Lucas looked back at him. He had a crooked crazed smile on his face. \u201cTo late handsome,\u201d He said in a high pitched voice. <br>\r\nLucas yelled as black liquid slithered out of Sanders mouth and down Lucas\u2019s throat. Lucas coughed as the liquid swan around in his stomach like a snake. A faint whisper entered his mind. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry baby just relax. It\u2019ll all be over soon.\u201d It said. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Lucas said holding his head in pain. <br>\r\n\u201cPower baby, unlimited beautiful power,\u201d It said morphing into an exotic female voice. Something made Lucas rip off every piece off his clothing. He fell on his back naked as the liquid travel throughout his body. He felt it under his skin, on his bones, his muscle. It was cold and wet. It was rearranging his skeleton. It was changing everything. Adding new organs and destroying old ones. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are doing to me?\u201d Lucas muttered. <br>\r\n\u201cShhh this is the best part.\u201d The voice said. <br>\r\nLucas heaved as he felt himself grow a few inches shorter. His butt rounded, hips winded, and his penis softened pulling itself slowly within his body. That resulted in Lucas\u2019s voice ascending higher in pitch.  He cried out as the transformation continued to occur. He rubbed his smooth feminine legs together as a vagina took form in place of his member. The voice purred. \u201cMMM it only gets better from here.\u201d  Lucas\u2019s nails grew out. His arms loss his male lean muscle. Lucas\u2019s stomach flattened as his body took an hour glass form. Lucas\u2019s fat went to his chest forming two mounds that slowly grew. Lucas parted his soft pick lips unable to breathe as his new breast grew. His brown nipples grew hard in the cold air on top of his large sexy breast. His skin took a tan complexion; his face softened and shifted losing any trace of his former male image.  Black locks washed over Lucas\u2019s face as the voice said. <br>\r\n\u201cBabe, what\u2019s your name again?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cL-Lucas\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Lucas.\u201d <br>\r\nLucas grabbed his head in pain as he felt his brain sloshing around transforming its self. Blood trickled out of his nose down to his soft cheek. Everything Lucas was, his memories, his personality all of it faded away\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\nThe entity got up brushing her naked body off. She examined her curvy body admiring every inch. \u201cWow,\u201d She said. \u201cThis guy turned out way better than that old fart.\u201d She looked over to Sanders dead body.  \u201cWell dead old body.\u201d She let out an evil giggle followed by a soft moan of ecstasy as she let her hands ride down her body. A  Helicopter could be heard in the distance. The roar of Humvees sounded down the road. <br>\r\n\u201cHere they come.\u201d She said. <br>\r\nMilitary Humvees pulled up a few feet away from the entity. She smiled as soldiers flooded out of the Humvees taking positions in front of her, guns trained, ready to fire. An armed helicopter floated over head with a spotlight on the entity. Captain Patrick Martin exited a Humvee with a megaphone in hand. He started at the entity with the greatest hatred. <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are but we've seen the tapes, release Doctor Sanders now!\u201d Captain Martin commanded. <br>\r\nThe entity\u2019s long lock twirled in the wind. \u201cAlready released chief,\u201d She said gesturing toward Sanders dead body. Martin swallowed anger, Sanders was a good man.  <br>\r\n\u201cI didn't kill him,\u201d She said. \u201cYou did you trigger happy bastard.\u201d <br>\r\nMartin growled. \u201cRelease your new host now!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOr what you\u2019ll be pushed to use deadly force?\u201d The entity taunted. <br>\r\n\u201cSomething tells me I\u2019ll be granting your host a favor if I did!\u201d Martin replied. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nice, but Sanders was old so my body was pathetic. But this guy he\u2019s young and I have all the means to back myself up. Even if you were to get a shot in me and my host would be fine.\u201d The entity explained. <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that bitch, READY YOUR ARMS!!\u201d <br>\r\nThe soldiers cocked their guns ready to fire when ordered. The entity laughed letting her arms out and closing her brown eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cFIRE, FIRE, FIRE!!!!\u201d <br>\r\nA blitz of gunfire rushed toward the entity. The bullets riddled her body with no effect. Martin watched in disbelief as each bullet hit her wondrous body. Each bullet sparked and disintegrated with each hit. Her body lit like the fourth of July, spark after spark on each inch of her body. The soldier\u2019s fire stopped as silence took over. Nothing was heard other than the sound of the helicopter and the crackling of fire. The entity opened her eyes and licked her lips. Martin gulped knowing nothing good was going to come from this. The entity lowered her hands to thigh length. She twirled her fingers. The small fires surrounding her came to life, slithering down the asphalt like a snake. The fire crawls up her body, making something of a suit. The fire burns on her body like a living suit. Her brown eyes glows with the fire. The soldiers begin to back up. <br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to play with fire?\u201d <br>\r\nThe entity raises her hands, tentacles of fire fly off of her body toward the soldiers who run for their lives. The tentacles exploded on contact, destroying Humvees and burning soldiers alive in a flurry of explosions. A fire ball is excelled toward the helicopter blowing it up. In crashes to the ground abolishing anything left of the Humvees. Fires rage atop mangled metal. Burned deceased bodies lay in the street. Martin lays on the road barley alive. He starts to get up when a hot bare foot steps on his throat, pressing him down.  The entity stands over him with anger. <br>\r\n\u201cYou see all of this; I can do so much more just try me. I left you alive this time, just so you what the hell you\u2019re dealing with. But if you ever come after me again, if I ever see that face of yours again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d <br>\r\nThe entity took her foot off martin\u2019s throat and walked away into the darkness with her new body.                                                   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
