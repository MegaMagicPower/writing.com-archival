You vaguely remember being knocked out by the rogue slayer Faith when she attacked you and Cordelia together at Cordelia\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around finding yourself lying on a bed in an empty room. Cordelia is nowhere in sight. Neither is Faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCordelia...\u201d You murmur worriedly, If she's here you have to find her. You walk out of the room cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaving so soon Wes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Faith standing in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to attack her but you are no match for her slayer strength. She forces you against the wall and pins you there pressing her arm against your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t tie me up to begin with. You could have avoided the whole escape attempt thing.\u201d You say struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026.I didn\u2019t know you were into that.\u201d She grins. \u201cTruth is I don\u2019t need it though, I can handle you like a child.\u201d She releases you and giggles as you catch your breath. \u201cCase in point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Cordelia?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles \u201cRelax\u2026I only took you with me. I figured that we would get to spend some alone time together.\u201d She strokes your arm seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Faith?\u201d You ask her obvious contempt dripping from your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a little hurt but she she quickly covers it up giving a fake smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about you Wes\u2026you\u2019re just the bait for Angel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip realizing that she intends to use you to set a trap for your friend. You make another escape attempt throwing a punch towards her face but she dodges and pushes you to the ground holding you there by placing her foot on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to make this difficult. Just give him a call telling him you need his help, where we are, yadda yadda yadda...maybe throw in a scream or two. My bad girl reputation would do the rest.\u201d She says taking her foot off of you and letting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough in response. \u201cLike hell I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \u201cFine, I guess that I will have to make you wriggle around for me like a good little worm.\u201d She pushes you onto a chair and begins tying you to it. \u201cThought I would take you up on your rope recommendation you gave me earlier.\u201d She says giving you a playful wink. \u201cYou know Wes, I never did pay you back for turning me over the watcher\u2019s council as a rogue slayer\u2026did I?\u201d She pulls the rope tightly hurting your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles \u201cSo let\u2019s see...5 basic torture groups to play around with\u2026 blunt, sharp, hot, cold and loud\u2026do you have a preference?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what you want\u2026I\u2019m not going to cooperate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \u201cLook who grew a spine since he left Sunnydale. It\u2019s still not going to help you though. I\u2019ll have you begging to please me soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up a shard of broken glass lying around the room but then smiles as she reconsiders. \u201cNah I\u2019ve got a better way to deal with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up a chair in front of you, Faith sits down and begins taking off her boots and socks. You stare at her bare feet awkwardly as she teasingly places them in your lap. You\u2019re embarrassed to admit but Faith\u2019s feet are really cute. You estimate them to be about a size 7. Her toenails are painted a dark shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I always suspected you had a little bit of a foot fetish Wes. The way you would always glanced towards the floor every so briefly when me or Buffy were in the room. Sure, she would just chalk it up to shyness, being polite or a bizarre British personality trait but I didn\u2019t quite buy it. Do you like my feet Wesley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sees a bead of sweat drip down your face and grins taking it as confirmation. \u201cLook like I was right. Heh heh I knew it. I figured that acting all polite and proper you had to be masking something kinky,\u201d She wiggles her toes playfully as she brings them to your face. \u201cWell this is your lucky day Wes\u2026you get to be my footslave for awhile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do to you?</span></div></div>",
