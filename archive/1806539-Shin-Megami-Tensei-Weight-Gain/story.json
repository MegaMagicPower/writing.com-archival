She'd been stressed about it all the time, and she'd usually been eating to cope. All those months of snacking led to a substantial amount of pudge. Not that you ever pointed it out to her, you were too good a man for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu however, was most certainly fat. While she was a rather busty woman, she now had a rather large DD set that strained on her pink top. Her round belly formed a muffin top so apparent that her navel could easily be seen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While discovering  that you were quarantined inside the Yamamote Loop and being forced to do battle with the swarms of demons surging through the city would tire out anyone, Yuzu already looked on the brink of giving up. Though she had held her own thanks to her COMP's shielding capabilities, the battle had winded your out-of-shape friend.  She was plodding next to you, bent forward a bit to emphasize her exhaustion. \"We need to get out of here before we have to do something like that again! I don't know if I've got the energy for any more of this...besides, if the whole city is locked down, its only a matter of time before we starve to death!\"  Yuzu had raided a candy story immediately upon learning the city's predicament, claiming to have survival in mind. Considering there was a grocery store directly across from the convenience store Yuzu had chosen, her choice seemed a little more focused on stress-killing indulgence rather than long-term survival.  The was barely a nutritious morsel in the bags and bags of snack cakes, candy bars, and instant noodles she had looted. Yuzu was about to bust open a sleeve of watermelon-flavored kit-kat bars when she plowed, chest first, into a woman who had swiftly appeared from a nearby alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's mound-like breasts made the collision harmless to both parties. Even if you were the one who had bumped into the odd woman, however, you don't believe injury could have possibly resulted; the woman looked to be about 200 pounds!  Yuzu pressed on the top of her breasts to make sure they weren't about to loll out of her overly tight top, though she neglected to tug her shirt over her prominent muffin top.  Belly button bared, Yuzu looked up at the stranger.  She appeared to be in her mid twenties, and her facial expression was serene but a little cold.  \"Pardon me...I am a member of the Shomonkai, and it is our mission to serve God, so that he may deliver us from this awful situation. If you are willing to fight for what is truly Right in this world, I can provide you with a device that will help you bind these foul Demons to your will.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu raised her thick, jiggling arms in negation. \" I already have one,  and I sure as heck don't need another. This one's given us way too much trouble as it is!\"   The woman looked surprised, but then her eyes caught the bags of junk food Yuzu was carrying.  \"Well then, perhaps you would like a demon? To be honest, I'm quite famished, and would gladly give up one of my own for some of your food...it would help me start...my diet...\"  While the Shomonkai's robe fit, the skirt and top she wore under it looked incredibly undersized, to the point of near-indecency. You wondered briefly how she got them on in the first place at her size.  Yuzu looked almost offended at the idea of giving up food, but then an even more offensive prospect seemed to dawn on her. \"I only have that pixie...if I had another demon protecting me, I wouldn't have to do anything if we got into another fight...my legs are -so- sore...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Yuzu consented to trade a bag heaped with goodies for another demon. After trading it through the auction house installed on the COMP,  Yuzu summoned forth a petite looking demon with a pointed tail and a white leotard. The transaction completed, the large Shomonkai women waved goodbye to the demon then hurried off, looking strangely discontent, as if she was only making the trade because she needed to.  \"Heya, I'm Lilim!\"  It gave her a quick look over. \"Look, this whole being owned thing is aw-ful! I'm -totally- the queen of deals. My sisters and I are kinda supposed to offer you physical pleasure, and you don't seem to be the type who would want me, so how about you release me and in exchange, I'll slake your gluttony instead of your lust! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu folded her arms under her chest, propping her heavy mammaries up slightly with her soft, fleshy forearms. \"I'm no glutton! I'm hedging underweight! Sheesh, being well-endowed sucks sometimes...\"    Lilim flapped around her briefly to confirm that her rear end told the same story as her flabby stomach and overgrown chest.  \"Suuure, so that's a no? In exchange for releasing me, I'll keep you fed until you find a way outta here! You won't have to move a muscle to have a delicious snack whenever you want!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's eyes were as wide as saucers. \"Hey ___, guess I can give my back a rest, we won't have to carry all these stupid bags anymore!\"  Yuzu tapped a few buttons on the comp, and the Demon was freed from her digital shackles. Lilim waved a hand, making a platter of pastries appear on her fingertips.  \"Fresh Devil's food, coming right up!\"  <br>\r\nYuzu brought a cupcake slathered in what looked like fiery-red caramel  to her lips. After a test-nibble, she quickly scarfed up the batch of six, crumbs raining into her ample cleavage.  \"That is the best food I've ever tasted, EVER!\"   The delicious snack was clearly helping Yuzu forget about her grim circumstances.  \"Yeah well, no backsies like that weird girl did!\" Lilim readied another batch, this time large sweet rolls topped with red sprinkles, but held it over her head out of Yuzu's reach.  \"Say, would you want to help out some of my sisters? Word's going around that lots of demons are being sealed into those stupid machines, and if you save them, I'm sure they'll offer you the same deals! I was always the worst at baking, to tell the truth!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu gulped down the drool that was pooling in her mouth. \"You're the <i>worst</i> baker?! We have a deal, right ____?\"   Before you could get a word in edgewise, the sweet rolls were being scarfed down and Yuzu was waddling down the nearby alley. Maybe it's your imagination, but you could have sworn Yuzu's muffin top was less severe a few minutes ago...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was even bigger than Yuzu! You think they've got a huge stash of food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shook your head as you pointed ou what the Lilim said about the woman \u201cgooing back on their deal\u201d. From the evidence before you, it wasn't hard to put two and two together: Yuzu was probbably going to blimp up like the priestess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are we going to do?\" Atsuro asked, worry pervading his words. \" Do abou what?\" asked Yuzu walking over, curious as to what you were talking about. \"Uhh... how to get out of the loop of course!\" Atsuro spouted quickly, a trickle of sweat coming out of his cap. \"Oh... well anyways, good news! I found another one of those demons!\" said Yuzu, practically salivating at the thought. She released the demon and explained the situation. This Lilim, unlike the last, made an entire cake. As Yuzu started to dig into the huge dessert, you knew you saw her visibly gaining at least 20 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Yuzu made it to her third slice, she had a full-on double chin, coated in frosting. Her chubby hands gripped both the cake and her rather large stomach, one holding the cake, the other massaging her round tummy. \"Man, this was such a  great deal eh ______? But did you see that woman who gave the demon to me? She was huge! How could someone be such a blimp in times like these?\"</span></div></div>",

It is you! Man, long time, no see eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtsuro went on to explain this woman was his tutor during middle school, but made an offhand comment only to you that she was more...lithe back then. Mari, however, heard this comment and yet surprisingly, she wasn't that offended.<br>\r\n\"I admit, I never thought I'd be a victim of the freshman 15  in nursing school,  but here I am now!\" she said as she shook her belly for emphasis. \"Of course, as you can see, it was a bit more than 15...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo kidding, you thought to yourself. 15 pounds doesn't give a woman the cup size she had, probably somewhere in the mid to high DDs. It takes quite a bit more than 15 to give a young woman the double-fold gut Miss Mari had, peeking out over her pants with a rather conspicous muffin top,  and even more to create the two beach balls she called a rear end. She was probably heavier than the Shomonkai priestess from before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bidding farewell to Miss Mari, Atsuro turned to you and asked just why there were so many fat women in the lockdown.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been done, Abel, the newly crowned Demon Overlord was able to defeat Metatron and free humanity from the clutches of God's hands forever. His crusade was peaceful towards humanity and scornful for the angels that had troubled humanity for all of recorded history. Managing to convince the government of Japan to submit to his will, the Overlord peacefully set up a stronghold in the heart of the former lockdown zone, the tower that was used to summon Babel. The Overlord's first goal was to unite all of humanity in order to achieve a sense of peace on Earth. The second was to overthrow God himself and usher in a new prosperous age for humanity. However, there was no rush. Despite all of his shortcomings, God did not desire for the humans to perish, so the Overlord had plenty of time to plan his siege on heaven. For the time being, he simply wanted to relax and enjoy the perks of being the strongest on the planet. Weeks had passed since the defeat of God' second in command and things had been going smoothly. The Overlord left humanity to its own devices, so long as the government did not provoke him. Many had tried, but armies around the world failed to impede his powers. Sitting on his throne, the Overlord watched as various demons came in and our, many with business and tasks to carry and others were simply lounging about. He looked to be like a regular teenager, albeit with blue spiral horns coming out through the back of his head and a rather impressive cloak and dark blue short hair.  The demons were good company and he rather enjoyed seeing demons coexisting peacefully with humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Overlord. How are you doing this morning?\" asked a certain young woman, walking into the throne room, walking around busy demons and rubbing her eyes. Amane Kuzryu came to live with the Overlord, having no real place to go to after her father's sacrifice to Belberith. She had also chosen to remain by his side, to aid humanity anyway she see fit. The young woman had shoulder length purple hair, along with matching indigo eyes and sported an orange, ceremonial like robe that fell before the top of her thighs. Amane was not the only human to come to live in the tower of the Overlord. He welcomed all people that were in need of shelter and food and those who wanted to follow him were free to stay. Because of his power and other qualities, he had amassed quite a following. He had also gathered an impressive amount of woman under his hand, ones that willingly decided to support him in any way they could. However, it was Amane who he preferred the most.  Patting his lap, Amane understood the gesture, and began to walk over to the throne. Sitting on his lap, his arm curled around her midsection and she wrapped both of her arms around his upper body. She didn't know how it happened, she simply fell in love with the one who managed to protect her many times during the lock down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing much better now that you're here. I'm going to have quite a long day today, dealing with a few politicians and meetings so I could use some of your 'love points.' said the Overlord, gently kissing the nape of her neck. She responded by nuzzling her head into his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Amane, during last night, I noticed something quite peculiar about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what is that?\" Taking his free hand, he brought it over to her midsection and gently rubbed it, feeling the fat of a small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seemed to put on a bit of weight. I know it is very ungentlemanly of me to say, but you're health is of my top concern. After all, I couldn't last one day as Overlord without you.\" A heavy blush forming on her face, she looked away at him in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well you see, with the Shomonkai, I've always been told to act conservatively in order to better serve the order. That included food as well. Now that I can live being my own person, I may have indulged a bit here and there. The demons can create delicious food as well...\" trailed on the girl. Smiling, he hugged her tightly, gently squeezing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, I'm not as selfish as to deny you that sort of stuff. As long as you're always with me, I'll always consider you to be beautiful. Now, I do think its time for you to have some breakfast. It is the most important meal of the day for humans.\" As he was no longer human, the Overlord did not have to eat as regularly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snack?\" By the clap of his hands, a red devil like creature, with a large nose and dressed in a black chef's outfit flew to his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what can I do for you my master?\" asked the flying creature, ready to serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to whip up a nice breakfast for Amane her. Please make sure she is satisfied.\" Nodding the flying creature flew off in the direction of the massive kitchen of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me after breakfast, Naoya's going to brief me soon, so I need some 'love points' for that.\" Kissing her on the forehead, she gently removed herself from his lap and headed towards the kitchen. Placing a hand on her fleshy midsection, she thought of his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perhaps indulgence isn't so bad after all?\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, this decision also led to the destruction wreaked over the last week to remain.  Upon returning from Polaris' throne, the party was very much aware they couldn't travel beyond Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, the major urban centers of Japan under the protection of JP's barriers.  A few days passed, and most of the tamers found themselves lodging in the underground JP's base in Tokyo, spearheading the effort to improve life for humanity and begin rebuilding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing from a meeting with Yamato and other JP's personnel, Makoto's attention was arrested by Fumi; she had set up a wall of computers in the main lobby of JP's, and had apparently collected most of the team's cell phones; they were scattered about her workspace and plugged into various ports leading into her machines.  Makoto stopped to inquire. \"What has gotten you interested in our phones again, Fumi? The devil summoning app hasn't worked since Polaris and Alcor were destroyed.\"    <br>\r\nFumi looked almost bothered by the disruption to her concentration. \"That's just it. Nicaea is still up. It has only sent one phone a single message since things calmed down, but even so, that means the server's still active. If we could get the some of the apps it once offered back online, we could perhaps summon demons to help us do things like rebuild and provide supplies.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's expression hardened. \"It's true. Otome and Ronaldo confirmed we will need a renewable source of food and medicine set up by the end of the year, or many survivors will be at risk. Many of the demons we had under our control had the power to heal injuries; they could be critical in keeping society afloat.\"  Fumi grunted, focused on her coding. \"Not to mention we've only used these demons in combat scenarios, for all we know some could provide food or help us rebuild. If I remember, some even asked if they could help cook and clean when they were purchased.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nodded. \"It goes without saying I support your investigation, I'm sure Yamato and the rest have no objections, either.\"   Makoto turned and began to walk to her room when she heard a high pitched beep begin to blare from Fumi's terminal. She wondered if she was about to regret what she had said. </span></div></div>",

Something you need?\" asked the scientist as she absentmindedly put a straw connected to a soda can in her mouth, lightly slurping up the carbonated contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I er...wasn't sure how to say this Fumi but...you've let yourself go. So to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chemosang garbed woman finally swivled her chair to face Makoto, showing off her newfound weight gain. Her form now fitted the chair more snugly, her wide hips brushing the armrests whenever she shifted.

Sometimes you've just got to sit down and...enjoy life, I suppose. Now I want you to take that tray of food and eat it. All of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumi, this is crazy! Just because you're fine with getting fat doesn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was interrupted by Fumi heaving herself out of her chair and getting the tray herself, returning to her seat afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto, a few tiny plates of snacks isn't going to make you a blimp. Who knows? Maybe when this is all over, fat will be the new black!\" said Fumi as she mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto soon began her feast upon the snacks, becoming enveloped in the texture and flavor, finding herself eating more. Craving more. Soon the tray was polished and the JP's operative was stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*urp* Please...no more...\" groaned Makoto as she rubbed her bloated stomach with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumi merely smiled as she got back to work.</span></div></div>",
