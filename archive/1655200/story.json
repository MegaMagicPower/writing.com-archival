By the time I got home and went to check on her, she was dead. All because of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, it wasn't my fault she killed herself, or became depressed. She was fine when we separated. You can't blame this on me. It could have been someone else after I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you see, she left me a note and told me all about you and how you left her high and dry. They anger I have carried for so long developed into this little play on you.

I looked around and the first thing I noticed was that I was outside in the forest. The trees were like skyscrapers all around me. Skyscrapers covered in light green leaves and moss. The second thing I noticed was the thing lying in front of me. I looked down at it, barely able to figure out what this thing is. It took some time before I finally realized, this is her body. <br>\r\nThis girl which caused me months of searching and days of planning to find. This girl who was the reason I was activated in the first place, well at least one of the reasons. The other two reasons were still out their walking the Earth and I knew then and there that I must find and kill them both to set things right. This girl was only the beginning, the beginning of my own personal Hell.<br>\r\nI tried getting up but then I realized both my legs were broken. \"Damn that prankster, Ellis!\" I shouted. He pretended to put me out of my misery, he pretended to kill me. Only to drop me down from death and impede my mobility in the process. I tried getting up again. Extreme pain flared up my legs and shot through my entire body, I screamed in agony and gritted my teeth. Something laughed in the distance. It wasn't Ellis, it was a new voice.<br>\r\n\"Is the little baby going to cry?\" It asked. The laughter started getting louder as it neared. I knew at once what was coming. It was a spirit and judging by it's voice it didn't sound like a very nice spirit.<br>\r\n\"Begone evil spirit! Let me tend to my own wounds\" I yelled out into the open. The air around me started getting thicker, the spirit was right above me. Though it's body was transparent I felt it's presence all around me. It started laughing again.<br>\r\n\"Why, young child. I just want to help you on your way.\" The spirit laughed again. I felt an incredible weight on my shoulder and the air was so thick I could hardly breathe. \"Now child, breathe deep and I will show you your worst nightmares.\"<br>\r\nSoon my eyes closed and I passed out.

Those were the first sensations. It was like being in a dream, likely of the nightmare persausion. The dark tunnel walls became less sollid as I sped on through the cold air like a rag in a hurricane wind, eventually dissolving entirly into a frigid, black mist. I guesssed I was still moving, but the fog was too thick too distinguish anything to judge my spee din relation to. I was terrified-it actually felt good, to be scared again. Perhaps it meant I had accquired something to lose. A red glow shawn through the fog from below, and my anxiety grew. Suddenly, I broke through the clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the lanscape below, I had succesfully died and gone to the eternal reward for my actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other quasi-corporeal figures-souls, I assumed- streamed down beside me, their expressions locked in rictuses of despair and horror to equal mine. Below, the sources of the glow became apparent. Huge foundries that looked like full-sized volcanoes shook and roared by the dozen across the ladnscape. Lava and molten metal poured from  the peaks, hissing and shrieking like my fellow damned as it met up with the lakes of boiling blood and acid that pocked the hell-scape. In between, on, and over these someone had taken the liberty to build a vast city, extending to beyond the infinite horizon. The architecture varied; in some areas, skyscrappers of exotic bone leaned haphazardly, bordered chaotically by ghettos of still-cooling magma and palaces of infernal iron.  A gargantuan, obsidian tower that exuded horror loomed in the far distance. The heat haze, smoke and fumes, and the very questionable physics of this dimension made its size and distance away hard to judge, though. I was falling towards a complex ringed with warehouses, several deep pits in the middle of which already throthed with a sea of screaming souls. Occaionally, one of the large, hideous figures dancing around them would reach down, skewer one with a long hooked pike, and drag it shreiking up and away.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I jerked to as stop, agony paralyzing me. It radiated out from my right shoulder, and I weakly turned my head to regard the bat-winged thing that had impaled me with several of its claws. \"Master's to see you now.\" It hissed nassily, flapping off towards the tower, dragging me along. I might have passed out or something, because suddenly I was kneeling in a massive hall. Gigantic pillars hundreds of feet high rose into the darkness on either side, extending in rows beyond my vision. As I noticed the curious way in which they met and joined with the floor, I realized that they must have been hewn out of some impossibly vast diamond or other gemstone, inlayed with enough gold to recreate a large city using nothing but the valuable metal. But the array of finely dressed, pwerful fiends all about me, or the innumberable other wonders situated around the chamber, couldn't begin to hold my attention in comparison to the titanic figure seated on a throne before me. The physical, tangible feeling of raw power he gave off drove me into the floor. I couldn' t begin to describe what he-she-it, looked like, except that it perfectly summised my greatest terrors and most intense bestial desires-including one's I had never befor experienced. I felt keenly the satisfaction of gluttony, the delight in knowing my works were better than anyone else's crafts and boasting openly about that fact, and the feeling of power that came from commiting a cold blooded murder, to name but a few. Rage, lust, envy, hunger, pride, fear, and hate all couresd through me as I lay there. I knew that I must be looking at the lord of Hell himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">You are arrogent and foolish, worm</span>. Boomed a voice within my mind, alomst shattering it instantly with its' raw power. <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">I am far beneathe such mighty powers; but a proxy, ordered to personally return you to conduct your Lord's bidding. You will return, to spread sin, but also  to have your vengeance on the many who have wronged you. Perform well, and you may not be justly punished upon your return here. Now...go.{/font <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was blasted from the hall, mind barely safe from overwhelming chaos left in the aftermath of the monsters tellepathic voice, and awoke on the floor beside the body of the young women I had murdered. Pain suffused me. I coughed, and blood poured out my mouth and down my throat. Ellis stood over me, the butcher holding his trademark jagged knife. \"The authorities are closing in. I will mis you, Lidon. You were a useful pawn for a time, just like that girl there.\" He gestured to the still form, and a wicked possibilty blossomed in my still-worn mind. \"Ah, good, my stupid friend. You see exactly what I did to enlist your services. After all, <i>someone</i> needed to scar that handsome face of yours. Someone needded to ensure you realized your full potential. This girl presented herself, with a dear old father who's failing, expensively maintained health she would have done <i>anything</i> to preserve-and so I 'convinced' her to asist me in this endeavor. I convinced your family, your friends, your lady, that you were a monster. I saw too it they were all horribly tortured and killed, before your helpless eyes, and that you were framed for the crime. Then I approached you, pretending to be somone else wounded by this monstrous creature,this fox, and goaded you off the path of just walking away and restarting your life, and onto seeking vengeance. So, really, Lidon, I'm the one you should be mad at. She was just a tool- I choreographed your unlocking your own abilities. It is too bad that you became obsessed with dying, and asked me to asist you in your suicide as your friend. We could have gone so far togethor. But now...The police will catch you. You will be sentenced, and then executed for treason, conspiracy, murder, man-slaughter, rape, arson, and much more than a few other delightful crimes. Well, I'll see you in hell-in a few millainea. In the meantime...\" He brandished a small machine part, a cylinder and pump with several other pieces attached. \"I have what I came for. The murder of a tortured innocent in the nearby vicinity even gave it some starting fuel too! Yes, you were quite usefull, would have made a valuable minion.\" Sirens sounded in the distance. \"So long, sucka'!\" He smirked, and strode out, while I still breathed shallowly on the floor. The pain in my legs and chest was excruciating, I guessed I had broken several ribbs, at least one of which had punctured my lungs. How was I still alive? I din't want o bee-the pian nedded to stop at any cost!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I felt  something moving in my leg, and looked down. My pant leg bulged and spasmed gruesomely, and I grunted as something snapped back into place within, unable to muster the strength to scream out. I breathed deeper, and realized the stabbing pains in my torso were fading. Seconds later, I could stand, and staggered over to the bench holding an array of knives and other weapons. I picked up only one- the same one I had stabbed the vixen with. She had been forced to torment me, to kill my family and all I cared about, to destroy the ex-me. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unconsciously, I looked at her face. Earlier, her eyes had been filled with pleading for life and a terrible remorse I hadn't fully understood at the time. Now, they just stared blankly ahead. Her entire body was relaxed, peacefull. Wherever her soul was bound, I doubted it was the hell-scape I would someday see again. That was immaterial, unimportant. I cleaned the knife-on my sleave,not the corpse- and looked in the direction taken by the departed Ellis. My own life, my own soul, was not important. All that mattered was that demon-that he suffered. He was going to hell for a long, long time, if only when I dragged him to the lowest pits along with me.      </span></span></div></div>",

You try to look up to see if someone is pushing your head down, but no one is there. Your face edges closer and closer to her's until you're only centimetres apart. Your head turns to the right whilst her's turns to the left; and you press your lips against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This story you can add on an extra chapter adding to the plot or end it right then and there. I'm cool with everything but please make each chapter at least two paragraphs long. </td>",
