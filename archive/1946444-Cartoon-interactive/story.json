Never mind that I gotta at least do something, hmm perhaps this gadget labeled big light should help.\" You said after noticing you've transformed into that of a toon and apparently are on Dizzy Devil's territory as you proceeded to use one of your mysterious gadgets that apparently transformed you into a now giant robot cat while you looked at the camera with a rather embarrassed look on your face while blushing as you managed to break the 4th wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make a long story short, I'm not really from around here nor am I apart of this show whatsoever. But do you folks hear singing because I sure do.\" You said as the camera turned towards Babs Bunny the star of this segment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've got my picnic spot chosen, it's chow time.\" Babs said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's time to make my big debut I guess.\" You sheepishly said with a cheesy grin on your face as you began heavily walking towards Babs Bunny and her picnic spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Babs Bunny had just finished her picnic lunch until she heard heavy footsteps approaching and soon enough caught a glimpse of you, as you proceeded to introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how's it going?\" You asked Ms Bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon introducing yourself, Babs bravely introduced herself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Babs Bunny but who are you? Never mind that as the script's about to send Dizzy Devil our way.\" She explained after introducing herself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Dizzy Devil arrives on the scene per his instructor's orders to eat a yummy pink bunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what will you do?</span></div></div>",

Just mere moments ago, Perry was briefed of his mission by his superior, Major Monogram. Apparently, all the dolls and doll-related accessories have been swiped from every supplying store in the Tri-State Area, much to the sadness of little girls everywhere. There was only one person ridiculous enough to be responsible - Doofenshmirtz, back at it again with one of his overly complicated inators, a daily issue for the young platypus to overcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying into the building, Perry was suddenly snatched by Doofenshmirtz's giant and clumsy robotic man, Norm, who proceeds to shove him into constraining, platypus-sized, doll clothes, severely limiting his ability to move. \"Ah, Perry the platypus, nice of you to get dolled up for the occasion. Hahaha, get it?\" Dr. Doofenshmirtz asked, hysterical. Perry gave a lifeless stare in return. \"Well you're no fun. Anyway, I bet you are wondering what <i>evil</i> and <i>diabolical</i> scheme I cooked up for today. Well behold!\" Doofenshmirtz pulls away a large sheet that was covering a massive machine in the center of the room. The device was shaped oddly like a large, pink dollhouse, fitted with a funnel piped into the chimney and a large laser attachment sticking out of the 2nd story window. The funnel was stuffed with discarded dolls, dollhouses, doll clothes, and other miscellaneous accessories. Near the south side of the house, where a circuit breaker would normally lie, laid a few buttons and switches to control the machine. \"The Dollification-inator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wonder what it does, eh?\" Perry released a monotone purr in response. \"I knew you were going to say that, but I'm going to tell you anyway. But first, a backstory. You see, back in Drusselstein, as you probably know, I was always second to my brother. As a result, I was forced to wear hand-me-up dresses and, more importantly to this backstory, play with girly dolls while my brother always played with the latest actions figures. So, with my Dollification-inator here, I will give Roger a taste of his own medicine by turning him into a puny doll. Unfit to lead, he will be forced out of position as mayor, which will open the spot up for me to take over the whole Tri-State-Area!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry rolls his eyes back, unimpressed. \"Hey, don't roll your eyes at me. Do you know how hard it is to think up and create a new evil scheme every day? It's hard you know.\" Doofenshmirtz begins to push his -inator from the center of the room, out towards the balcony. Meanwhile, he continues to ramble as he puts all his body weight into pushing the heavy machine. \"First I have to think up of some tragic backstory, to which there is a lot to choose from, but then I have to figure out whether or not I can incorporate one into a Tri-State-Area snatching evil scheme. Once that's decided I gotta make blueprints and collect all the materials to build the inator, and then build the inator of course, and this is all happens before you get here. It's stressful, that kind of time crunch, so they can't all be winners here. It's like they say in Drusselstein, 'You get what you get, and if you cry Der Kinderlumper will come and take you away', though I'm not sure how that saying translates over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry continues to stare as Doofenshmirtz slowly pushes the inator towards the balcony, making a terrible screeching sound as it drags along the floor. Doofenshmirtz is visibly tired from pushing the machine. \"Man, I really should have put wheels on this thing. You see? This is what I was talking about, the time crunch. There was only time to install either wheels or a self-destruct button before you arrived and, well, I think you know what I chose.\" After an agonizing few minutes of monologue and loud screeching, the machine was finally settled on the balcony, and began to power up. Exhausted from the physical labor though, Doofenshmirtz walks over to Perry and leans himself upon his head to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gasp</i> ... <i>gasp</i> ... just give me a second Perry the Platypus to catch my breath. I'm not in the best shape to be doing such strenuous physical labor, at least, that is what my doctor told me.\" As Doof's hand laid upon his head, Perry saw his opportunity to escape. So, he lifted his bill up and bit one of Doofenshmirtz fingers, causing his nemesis to cry in pain. \"Ahh! Cheap move, Perry the Platypus, biting a off-guard evil scientist who just called for a truce. For shame Perry the Platypus, for shame. Well if you want a fight, take this!\" Still unable to move, Perry was forced to take a direct kick from Doofenshmirtz, launching himself across the room and ripping the doll clothes constricting him in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a perfect landing, Perry immediately started to advance towards Doofenshmirtz and the inator, set on ending this mission quickly. \"Oh no! You've escaped Perry the Platypus, but too late for you, because my Dollification-inator is all charged up. Norm, be useful for once, and take care of him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye aye, sir!\" Towering above Perry, Norm easily blocks his progress towards the inator. \"I'm sorry, but Dr. D says no running in the apartment.\" Norm begins to bend down in order to grab Perry, as he did earlier by surprise, but this time Perry is prepared. He leaps out of Norm's grasp and, thanks to his slow movements, is able to hit Norm with a good blow to the head with his tail. With his head spinning out of control, Norm dizzily spins out of Perry's way and falls into a pile of inator components in the corner. \"My head is a merry-go-round!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too late Perry the Platypus! My Dollification-inator is charged up and all I have to do now is press this but--\" Suddenly, Perry interrupts Doof mid-sentence, causing him to slam into the control panel of the inator. As a result, the inator begins to fluctuate in aim and manages to fire off two unnoticed, rouge shots into Danville. Meanwhile, Perry and Doofenshmirtz continue to brawl it out, trading blows back and forth, the usual procedure. Eventually however, as things usually go, Perry gains the upper hand and manages to give Doof a forceful kick across the apartment, not so unlike the one he just gave Perry a moment ago. With no one left in his path, Perry is free to run up to the inator and hit the convenient self-destruct button, ignoring the cries from his nemesis for him to stop. With a huge explosion, pieces of the Dollification-inator are launched across the room, and a significant portion of Doofenshmirtz's balcony is damaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Perry jumps off the building to land in his flying car, he could hear the defeated cry of his nemesis, \"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone, Dr. Doofenshmirtz rises to his feet and begins to assess the damages, \"I knew I should have installed the wheels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated brand inator is complete without a self-destruct button, sir,\" Norm states, sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so we got a wise guy, huh? Well if you want to act like that, have fun cleaning up this mess. I'm going to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Doofenshmirtz's plot foiled and Agent P returning to his family, the Tri-State-Area is safe yet again. Except, what happened to the rough, Dollification-inator beams?</span></div></div>",

You wish you could stay on the island in order to see the spectacle, but you have to get rid of the evidence of your involvement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg went into the common room and shouts: \"Yo guys, pizza is in the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast boy: \"Finally!

Beast boy and Cyborg immediately dug in, Robin and Starfire took it somewhat less hastedly. It was then that Raven realized that something was wrong with the pizza. \"Wait guys, stop eating!\" She shouts, but the magic was already activated.  All four of them shot up in height, reaching 70 feet in Beast boy's, 80 feet in Robin's and Starfire's and 100 feet in Cyborg's case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, no one moves, but eventually Beast boy interrupts the silence:\"This. Is. Sooo. Cool!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile were returning to your warehouse.  The guy you impersonated was in there, drugged and bound, but alive. You take out the eye contact lenses you used, and throw them with the clothes you wore in a fire.  You untie the pizza delivery guy, and remove the drug infusion needle from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you head torwards a parking house with a telescope,  in order to enjoy the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back at the Titans,  ...</span></div></div>",
