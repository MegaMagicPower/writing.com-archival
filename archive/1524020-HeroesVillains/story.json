The first 4 choices are like set comics. they will focus on those set heroes the whole time with every episode and can be told in first of third person and will not have the Hard core villains in them like Malice or Clockwork. the last option will be told in third person only and have all the heroes on a team and all the villains. I will be the only one to add villain intros on this one meaning you can add to it but not a a villain that has not been mentioned before in this option so do not add to it till I get a few episodes in there.</span></div></div>",

Even 'The Dark Destroyer' wasn't even doing anything that you could laugh at, everything was just so terrorfingly boaring. Then suddenly you heard screams over by the park and perked up running towards the park as fast as you could using your fire to propell you with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the park came into sight and you could see ghost scaring people away from the park and zombies standing guard around it in a protective formation preventing police from getting anywhere inside. You knew instantly that it must be Jill Collis since she was the only one who bothered to use zombies as minions thats not locked up at the moment. Though you had never seen her use this many at once before. Whatever she was planning it had to be big you jumped off the building and tossed a fireball at the wall of zombies making several fall and making many more begin to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world entered a twilight state and you looked up to see an eclipse. You cursed and sent forth a pillar of fire trying to get through the zombies as quickly as possible, you could only imagen what Jill could do durring this unnatural twilight. You sent forth a wave of flames that swept a few more zombies out of your way and kept it coming as more zombies staggered towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have time for this!, you thought angrily as you blasted more zombies aside, Time to let loose the big guns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared a small circle around you with your fire and began to charge up for your attack after which the news had named you as you shouted, \"Nova Burst!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick wave of fire flowed away from you devouring zombies and burning trees to matchsticks as the the flames eagerly consumed all around them. As the flames and smoke cleared and you got your breath back you spotted Jill standing next to a huge summoning circle that looked to be made of the blood of countless people. The circle was glowing as she continued her chant and a black mist began to rise up and take shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed again and formed another fireball before hurling it at her hoping to disrupt the ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                        TO BE CONTINUED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you succssessful?</span></div></div>",

To your surprise it instead hits a large creature that's standing in the summoning circle that seemed unfazed by the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It stood 12 feet tall with no skin and a slimy dark gray body with living faces covering its torso. It had 1 hand with claws and a bone like lance in place of the other. Its eyes were a dark purple and its teeth were a crooked jagged yellow and it had blood stained horns on its head and a small stump like tail with a little bone sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At first the creature just looked around confused till it spotted a group of cowering children and there parents trying to hide in the bushes and ran at theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly shoot an even larger blast of fire in hopes of taking it down but you only drew its attention to you. the creature looked between you and the bystanders as if torn between the 2. To help it make up its mind you hit it in the face on its head with another fire ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It worked, the creature was charging at you with blood lust in its eyes. It held out its bone like lance to impale you and you use fire shooting out of your hands to super jump out of the way. The creature moved with super speed but seemed to have trouble stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Since you can't burn it you run for a hot dog cart. and set it on fire and use your fire to launch it at the creature. The cart breaks against its body with the umbrella pole stuck in its body as it howls in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The creature puled the pole out of its chest in 1 of its faces cheek and the hole healed instantly. All of a sudden it started making a strange sound as all of its mouths open wide and start screeching. You cover your ears and fall to your knees and look on as all the ghost start flying into the creature's mouths and it starts slowly growing till it reached 20 feet tall and its stump tail grew into a ling spiky tipped tail and its lance grew to 17 feet long with a ice pick thin tip and it grew bat like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The creature just smiled down at you mockingly and you can hear in the background as a man screams \"oh CRAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short moment of panic you start hitting it with as much fire as you can throw at it and unlike before it did not even step back by the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he he... Your wasting your time, my friend hear was born of fire.\" You look to the side and see that Jill is standing under the tree holding her throbbing head. \"Lench! he attacked your mistress! make his death nice and slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                    TO BE CONTINUED.</span></div></div>",

The creature looks at you puzzled at first as if trying to think of a way to think of away around this new obstacle standing in its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After some thinking time the creature quickly dashed around behind you an prepared to strike but you super jumped with flaming feet juts before its lance struck down where you were just standing and you land in the pool of blood that was used to summon the creature. as you step back you step on something large, soft and pulsating and the creature falls to its knees clutching its chest in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking down you see a large beating heart in the middle of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                    To be continued</span></div></div>",

What do we do doctor?\" The scientist pondered hard as he looked at the new bio-weapon made for the defense contracts. (scientist) \"if this stuff gets out it will melt the flesh of anyone who comes in contact with it. We must make shore that they don't get it, even if it cost us our lives.\" he said as he looked at the picture of his grandchildren. Both of the other scientist and the 9 guards nodded in agreement as the guard that asked rubbed at his wedding ring. All of a sudden the loud banging on the doors stopped as a new voice came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Intruder leader) \"Your taking to long move! get out of my way!\" All was quiet for a moment but then a fist crashed threw the door passing a inch in front of one of the guards face and then retracted and came threw again this time sending a large crack across the door. Before the hand retracted one of the guards grabbed one of the large and sharp spike like lab tools and rammed it threw the top of the fist just above the fingers and into the arm but no scream came. Instead it slowly retracted and one last blow to the door as it fell over onto the guards that tried to hold it closed as a man stood there with one leg held up for a brief moment hen slowly lowered to the ground as he pulled the instrument from his hand. He wore black shredded jeans a torn black t shirt and over it was a worn, holy old trench coat that was completely open. He wore torn black gloves and had pail skin and long grayish black hair that partly covered his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Instantly there was an explosion of gun fire as both sides let loose but it did not last long as there were only a few guards left and a small army of the intruders. As the leader walked up to the large titanium case holding the canister of the bio-weapon. HE bent down to examine it for a moment and grabbed the handle and bashed it against the table a few times before terning to his men (intruder leader) Spread out and find the 2 keys to this thing. I want that canister!\" At this his men spread out in search of the keys as there leader waited by his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then 1 of the guards got up slowly with shaky legs and blood dripping down his face where a shot grazed him. (Guard) \"You!... lets see how tuff you are without your men around\" as he ran toward the intruder shooting his gun and hitting almost every time. But the intruder did not even flinch as the guard charged him but when the guard was within arms reach of him the intruder grabbed him and flipped him onto his back pined the guard down. (Intruder) \"Where are the keys?\" The guard responded by spiting in his face. (Intruder)... where are the keys?\" he asked again this time pulling out a large knife and tearing open the guards shirt. (Guard) I don't care what you do to me you'll never get those keys!\" the intruder just stood there for a moment and then took his knife and skillfully cut the guard open without cutting anything vital and set the knife back in his pocket and grabbed one of his ribs with both hands while the guard tried to hold up a brave face tho he looked as if he was about to cry. (Intruder) \"Tell me, where the keys are.\" (Guard) Fuck you!\" At this the intruder snapped the rib in two and rose the piece he removed and rammed it into the guards intestines while the guard screamed passed out and died<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the guard drew his last breath the intruder took out his knife and cut off the guards hand, got up and clutched his fingers tightly around the handle of the case and dragged it off the table while holding the hand in the other and walked threw the broken door into the hall and to the elevators. He pushed the basement button and when the elevator doors opened he was in a steel room with a large thick steal door and next to that door was a hand print scanner. Pushing the hand against the scanner the door slowly opened and the intruder stood there smiling like the cat that caught the canary till a volt was revealed on the other side and his expression quickly turned to annoyance then anger as he ran up to it, twisted one foot on the ground while kicking up with his other and striking the huge volt door making it slightly vibrate but did no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking very pissed the intruder terned back to the elevator and went back up to the first floor and walked up to the security station near the entrance and grabbed the microphone. \"Everyone get to the entrance we need to pay  Mr. Rolens a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon the small army of casually dressed intruders were pouring out of the building and packing into several cars, trucks, and vans parked in a messy pattern with skid marks behind them as if they were speeding in and slammed on the breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the intruder leader got into the back of a rusty looking car with an old and broken razor sharp steel bars stuck out the front. (Intruder leader) Do you have his address?\" (Driver)\"Yes Malice.\"<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***************************<br>\r\n(Warp) \"Giliat any new leads on the lab masker?\" Asked a man with short  hair and a blue with black swirly designed suet at a command center in the hero base.(Giliat) Not yet sir\" Replies a women's voice. (Warp) \"How about you Blaster hows the bank job going?(Blaster) I'll tell you when its over sir.'(Warp)oh, you need back up?(Blaster) No sir its Dark Destroyer, hes got himself stuck in the revolving door and I'm waiting for the cops to get him out. (Warp) Well your not needed there so why don't you go help Giliat. (Giliat) ya you can bring me an strawberry ice cream from the shop down the road from me. Ring ring, (Warp) \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Blaster pules in to the lab parking lot with spiky brown hair and a white T-shirt with a dragon on it and blue jeans and white and red shoos and a ice cream in his hand as a 1/2 foot tall woman with black shoulder blade length hair in a pink shirt with a butterfly pattern and long pants. She slowly grows back to normal size and gets her ice cream when the voice of Warp kicks in to the team communicators. (Warp) Everyone get to the Rolens house we have a break in in progress and its an army of them!<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                   To be continued</span></div></div>",

Do to his being unafected by Holly things it is clear that what keeps him on this earth is not demonick in nature. <br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nRaces<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoseans<br>\r\nWhen someone dies feeling 1 fixated, powerfull emotion there the energy given off gives birth to these beings. they look human but they all have super strangth and can tern ghost like to phase threw solid objects. They can only ever feel what emotion they are born from at all times. if they are born from a posative emotion there is nothing to wory about but if they are born from something negative they are known to be prone to violance without provoction. 1 strange thing about this race that stricks most as odd is that they all take the word of there birth energy as there names. like Joy, or Alone.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAnools<br>\r\nA half human half animal race that rarely venture from there terratory. There planet Mars has long been distroyed by there mistakes with palution they tunneled out and colanized the inside of moons and uninhabited planets. they are verry untrusting of strangers but extreamly friendly when there trust is earned. They collect knoledge and resorses from all over the galaxy so they are a prime target for invaders that force thim time and time again to inlist the help of heroes and villains to help them.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMutants<br>\r\nIn this world evalution was scientifacly dispruoven long ago. That the body can change to adjust to its inviermant but stops at a point. Mutants get there powers my enjesting a rare and dangeras substance called Baktoneam-X that will give powers to the one that drinks any depending on the way there body has adjusted to its inviermant. for example before he got his powers Nova worked in his fathers steal mill so his body was exposed to high levels of heat every work day. Baktoneam-X also terns those that drink it into a sepret groop of mutants called shadow dwelers. they are mutated to extream diformatys, there powers are averadge.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nGols<br>\r\nA race of war, oger like beings they go from world to world sucking them dry off all resorses and inslaveing and eating the inhabatence.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nSubstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ<br>\r\nA type of hard to come by drug that was made as a bio weapon. It is more potent then any other drug giveing the user a hour long trip of pleasher and one wiled ride. the main problam with this stuff is if a user dies at any time after use they get back up with a craving for flesh. Giving it its name Z for zombie. Z is a typ of fungas in pill form it will spread threw the body and atatch itself to everything and start growing and spreading. once it has covered the intier blood stream is starts cloting which kills the victam. the fungas in the brain blocks the blood stream in the head from the rest of the body. when mixed with the brain juces the fungas praduces the oxygen and notrishan and energy to keep the brain alive, while the fungas in the rest of the body only praduse energy. for the musals so the unsastained parts start to decompose including the outer flesh. The victams sastain masive brain damage makeing them un interagent and the fungas that gets in the eyes gives them a look of glowing yellow eyes in the dark. the fungas grows espeshaly fast in the mouth or if trancferd into a host threw a mouth do to the bacterea and inzymes in it. In drug form its in a capsal so it dose not tutch the mouth.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nBaktoneam-X<br>\r\nA rare and hily dangeras mutagenic substance that when injested makes its way into the blood and start reworking your DNA. the body changes as life gose on and the body ajusts to your enviernmant. Baktoneam-X changes the body depending on those changes. some just get super powers but 75% of those that injest this substance take intence body reconstruction makeing them look like grotes monsters that call themselves Shadow dwelers becous they only come out at night and stay in dark hidden places at day like tunels.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nkeep it pg13<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will be like episodes. The story will start with <br>\r\n          Episode #<br>\r\n(Title based on the story)<br>\r\nthen the story itself, then a new story after. there can be diferant ways to go in the story but do not branch a episode becous when a episode is done I will take all the chapters that make up its body and get it all into 1 page. That way we will have room for more episodes in the future, credit will still be given to all who add the parts of the episodes. I have not yet added all the heroes and villains in my head but will in time. Sometimes the villains will win just to make things interesting. nothing story changing of corse.</td>",
