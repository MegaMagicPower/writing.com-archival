She had so much left to do, and she really wanted to be prepared so that she could enjoy the celebration. She still needed to buy a gift, make travel plans, and pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she needed to get Robert &amp; Michelle a gift. Looking at the department store registry, Sarah's indecision grew with each moment. She wanted to get them something significant, something they\u2019d appreciate, and something they\u2019d actually use. Robert had told her they had only put some of the items on the registry after Michelle\u2019s mother chastised them for only selecting a few items; she was afraid her relatives would be offended by the lack of choices. Sarah didn\u2019t want to waste money on a gift they didn\u2019t really want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat gift did Sarah choose?</span></div></div>",

You really thought that was appropriate for a wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped tears from her eyes, humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they were done practicing, and left for the restaurant.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah decided to pack heavy. Steve would have a fit, but she didn't care--that was her attitude these days. Her mother would die if she knew how much she was bringing. They were supposed to stay at her mother's house for the weekend but with all the wedding confusion, she didn't know how much she would be able to handle. Steve would be wrapped up in his work, as usual. Her kids would be with Grandpa walking in the woods, her mother Josephine would be picking up after everyone and cleaning the house over and over. That would leave her with Michelle. Dear God, how was she going to survive? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked Michelle, really she did, most days. But then there was the rest of the year where she absolutely hated to hear the sound of her voice and her click-clackety high heels, her exclamation of \"LOVE IT!\" Let's face it, Michelle was like an overprivileged teenager from Bel Air. Her twin could have been that Cher girl on the movie CLUELESS. It was disgusting sometimes because she would just chatter away on her cell phone and talk about clothes, hair, makeup, and of course her sex life. Talk about gross! That was Sarah's brother she was talking about for heaven's sake! Sarah didn't even want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd really, how did Robert even stand her? He was so shy and quiet compared to Michelle. She knew opposites attracted sometimes, but this was extreme. Robert worked 6 days a week and did everything a sweet gentleman was supposed to do. He bought Michelle gifts and left notes for her in her car. He called her everyday at lunch, and yet he seemed distant when everyone else was around. It was like he was two completely different people where Michelle was concerned. Everyone thought he was deep in love and that he was devoted to her. But then there were those tiny moments when he thought no one was looking, and he would be staring at Michelle with a look of pure hatred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah really wished that she knew what was going on in her brother's head. With all this wedding hoopla he must feel like he was all alone. She would find out when she got there. Sarah thought about her own husband and how happy they were together. She was proud of her life: a wonderful spouse, terrific marriage, two great kids, and a gorgeous home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had been coming home later and later everyday. Sometimes she wished he would quit his job and find something that didn't take up so much of his time. Around 5pm, Sarah called him on his cell to see what time he would be home, but again, no answer. <i>He must be in a meeting,</i> she thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to pack Steve's suitcase next. As she began going through his drawers to find his socks and underwear, she came across a pink piece of folded paper. Sarah picked up the tiny paper and opened it up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">2pm sharp.Dont be late.Bring your appetite! xoxo Cali</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had to read it again and again. What was this? Who was Cali? Was Steve cheating on her? What could this mean? The questions just rolled over and over in her mind. Her hands started to tremble as she dialed his cell number, only to have his voice mail pick up. Disbelief flooded her as she hung up the phone. Where could he be? He should have been home at 1. They were supposed to leave for the airport by 5:30. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing to do, go to his office. She wouldn't wait until he got home. She would do it now. And if he wasn't there, she was coming back home and leaving without him. Her daughter, Lacey, was 15 and could watch Jed, who was 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lacey, I've got to run to your father's office. I will be back in just a few minutes. Your father seems to be running late. Stay here and watch your brother,\" she instructed. And with that, Sarah was out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to the office was only 10 minutes into town. It was on the second floor of the Leppen's building. Parking her car on a side street, she raced for the door. Her heart pounded erratically as she walked to the elevator and pushed button 2. Sarah couldn't even think as the elevator climbed higher. Finally the door opened and she walked over to Steve's office. Upon opening the door she found.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was all she needed to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, \"Trash and filth is what you are! Do not come home! Do not follow me to my parent's house! We are done!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she threw her ring at him and ran out the door. All those late working days and he was out screwing around on her with what's her name. How dare he do this to her right before her brother's wedding? She would go home pack up the kids and fly to her mother's for the weekend. It was time she let loose some steam. Two could play at this game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got home, she totally unpacked her suitcase as fast as she could and threw only the important stuff back in it. She was in dire need of a new wardrobe all of a sudden. With a wicked grin, she hurried the kids out the door and to the car. It was only a short drive to the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was nowhere in sight, and that was a good thing. The kids asked where he was and if he was coming. All she told them was that he had an important meeting with someone, and he couldn't afford to miss it or he would lose his job. That seemed to satisfy their curiosity. They had never gone anywhere before without Steve. This was a whole new experience for them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane ride was smooth, and soon they were on their way to Grandma's house in a rented car. When they got there, her mother looked like she hadn't slept for days. Her father was sleeping on the porch swing. Her brother was working intently on his computer, and Michelle was sitting by the pool talking on her cell phone. The house was a wreck. Clothes  were piled high in each corner, leftover food and dirty dishes lined the sink, and the trash hadn't been taken out for 2 weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, what happened here? Is there something wrong? Is there anything I can do?\" Sarah asked. \"You look horrible. The wedding is in 2 days and you haven't done anything to the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother shrieked, \"I can't do it anymore! I can't plan this damn thing by myself any longer! She's driving me mad! I want her to get out of my house but she won't leave. Robert is holed up in their room and won't lift a finger, either. And your father is always asleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one word could describe the coming events: disastrous. So Sarah helped her mother clean, clean, and clean some more until the house was spotless. By then it was late, so she shoved the kids off to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents finally asked her where Steve was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she said was, \"I don't know. I wish he had called me and let me know he wasn't coming.\" She hated lying to them, but their lives and nerves were fragile enough already, and she did not want to give Michelle the satisfaction of having the better marriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your hubby's not coming to my special day, huh? What a pity that you're going to be all alone, and won't have anyone to dance with or talk to,\" Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah wanted to wipe that smug grin off her face. This was gonna be one hell of a weekend. She went upstairs to take a hot bath and curl up in her bed to cry. She took along look in the mirror and decided she needed a change. She was tired of being the perfect housewife and mother with two kids. Tired of always being so perfect. Tomorrow there would be change for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got into bed with a new-found confidence. The next day she.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But of course I'm sure he can get his girlfriend to help him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, her mother cried, \"What do you mean? Did he leave you? I have to call him and talk some sense into him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just shrugged her shoulders. \"Look, if he can shack up with his secretary, that's fine by me. Frankly, I don't care. I am contacting Maurice on Monday to file for divorce. There's no telling how long he's been cheating and lying to me. Probably our whole marriage.\" She drew a deep breath and turned to their guest. \"But anyway, Hayden, how have you been?

She did a little dance on the inside remembering all the things she used to like about Hayden in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you stay,\" she encouraged. \"I'm sure he'll be here any moment now. He's probably picking up his tux. How about we take a walk to the creek?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door and Hayden followed, leaving her mother standing in the living room dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked down the old dirt path to the creek that ran by the house. This was a special place, one that they both knew quite well. Many years ago, they had lain down on a blanket here under the stars and made love for the first time. Just remembering that night brought a slight flush of pink to her cheeks. Looking at her, Hayden could tell what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a magical night,\" he said, \"one that I've never forgotten, Sarah. I'm sorry about your husband. I thought by the way your parents talked, you had a fantastic marriage. Guess we were all wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it was great for a while. Everything was perfect, maybe too perfect. But I'm putting it all in the past. Looking to the future now is what I want. By the way, you never said anything about my hair. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden reached up to cup her face with his hand. \"I love everything about you. From your hair to your cute behind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was again, that blush that made her the most beautiful thing alive. He had never gotten over her. All these years, and he still felt like that awkward teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayden, kiss me. Make me feel alive again. Please, just do it. I know I'm still technically married but do it for me,\" she pleaded. Her eyes filled with tears that she didn't want to fall. Her heart had been broken, and maybe this was the answer to repairing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tranquil sound of the creek rushing by was shattered by Michelle's shrill voice. \"Oh my God! You little tramp, you! You just wait 'til I call your husband and tell him what a lying cheat you are!\"  she screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Hayden jerked apart. Standing there with her hands on her hips and snarling, Michelle glared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, go away, this is none of your business. Besides, don't you have more important things to attend to? You're getting married tomorrow. Why don't you go decide where you want the flowers set up, and I'll be there in a minute,\" Hayden suggested. Michelle turned and stomped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayden I am so sorry for putting you in the middle,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, don't worry about my cousin. She's just a spoiled little brat that thinks she can stick her nose in everyone else's business.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His cousin?</i> Sarah hadn't realized they were related. This was not good. She had to get away. This whole weekend was becoming more and more complicated by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard Robert's truck pull up, and she rushed over to greet him. Trying to distract herself and everyone else around her she said, \"Robert I'm so happy to see you. We have got to get everything ready for this afternoon. Mom will be nuts if you don't help plan seat assignments for the dinner guests.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and twenty minutes later, they were all seated at the table in the dining room. The rehearsal had gone off without a hitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had tried not to notice how good Hayden looked in his suit and tie standing at the altar. <i>Stop it,</i> she told herself. <i>This is Robert's weekend and wedding. Do not do anything to mess it up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the toast to the happy couple who were getting married tomorrow. As Sarah's father raised his glass, Michelle started to smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, Sarah turned around glanced at the petite blonde with super curly hair and big blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rushed over and threw her arms around Hayden and gave him a big kiss. \"I've missed you, sweetie,\" she said. \"The trip was such a long, boring one, and I just had to get away.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden peered over the woman's shoulder at Sarah, whose face was steaming red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calissa,\" he began, \"I would like you to meet Robert's family. This is his mother, Jospehine, his father, George, and his sister, Sarah Rimple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't want to raise her head. Her cheeks were burning and she knew Michelle was grinning from ear to ear. There was something familiar about this Calissa girl. Was it the dress, the hair, or the big doe eyes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Michelle said,\"Sarah don't be so rude. My brother is trying to introduce you to his girlfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Sarah raised her eyes to meet Hayden's. He was mortified. <i>Good, he should be,</i> she thought. What was it with her and cheaters? Did she attract them with a big neon sign on her forehead? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah moved her gaze to Calissa and looked her in the eye. Seeing Calissa's face directly, Sarah remembered a dress rumpled, the hair undone, and the eyes big with not innocence, but shock. It was <i>her</i>--Steve's partner in crime, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as not to disrupt her family's dinner, she quietly said, \"It's nice to meet you dear,\" her voice dripping with sarcasm. Sarah sat there for the rest of the meal without saying much at all. The embarrassment, together with the hurt and humiliation, was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner was finished, Sarah claimed she had a migraine and excused herself. Without a second glance back at Hayden and his girlfriend, she rushed up to her room. Closing the door and throwing herself onto the bed, she cried. Why was her life falling apart so fast? In the last 48 hours her world had been turned upside down, her heart ripped out of her chest, and now she was humiliated in front of the one person she hated most, Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cried herself to sleep, expecting that the next day was going to be even more miserable. All she wanted to do was run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shone brightly through the window as she got into the shower Saturday morning. Her mind was filled with questions. How would she face Hayden? Did he know that Calissa was the girl who was sleeping with Sarah's husband? Should Sarah tell him, or let him find out on his own? She would make her decision after her shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd let Hayden figure out for himself what kind of person Cali was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up the phone and called Steve. She listened to him cry and apologize and cry some more about how sorry he was. She told him to get on the next plane and come to her parent's house for the wedding, asking him not to tell anyone what happened. He agreed and she hung up the phone. She figured this was going to be the most interesting thing that had ever happened in this house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled to herself imagining the looks on their faces when they saw each other and figured out it was her who had set them all up. If people intended to screw with her, she would give it right back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFixing her hair and applying her makeup, she decided to wear black leather boots, short black pencil skirt and the baby blue sweater Trudy had helped her pick out. She was taking a trip into town, and was sure she would run into Hayden. Sarah grabbed her purse and sauntered out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared her car, Michelle called to her, \"My don't we look super sexy today. Going into town to see Hayden, I presume? I mean, he does have a girlfriend, and you have a husband. Gee, what a dilemma you have here. What do you plan to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gritted her teeth at Michelle's sarcastic insincerity and smiled. \"Well, silly little girl, I'm going to the airport to pick up my husband so that I will have date for the wedding. I will see you in a bit, dear. Don't forget to wear something blue.\" She drove away, leaving Michelle on the porch, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving into town was a little more nerve-wracking than she expected. Steve was coming, but not for another 5 hours. She had just enough time to catch up with Hayden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cell phone rang moments later as she was pulling into a space on Main Street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hayden. \"Look, I've got to see you. I need to explain what happened last night. I'm so sorry for not telling you, but you asked me to kiss you, and we were standing there in our spot, and all I could think of was you,\" he said, without stopping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered it and replied, \"Oh, and you wanted to get me naked right up until when your girlfriend walked into dinner. Look, I don't want your excuses, I just want to have lunch. How about Rico's?\" Rico's was a little Italian restaurant where, as teenagers, they'd had one of their sexcapades. Man, they had been great together, and she planned on reminding him of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure, sounds fine. Let's say 12:15 then,\" he said nervously. He remembered Rico's, too, and the corner booth they'd had where she would slip under the table and...well, he didn't want to think about that right now. He just wanted to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How will the meal turn out?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was not as though she couldn't afford to spend that hundred dollars and see the gift disappear into limbo if things went awry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I ought to put more thought into my wish for my little brother's happiness,</i> she mentally admonished herself. <i>I'm sure he'd like to be able to say, in years to come, 'That is what my sister gave us for a wedding gift.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to come back the next day to scour the store registry for some item that would be personal. The trouble was that he was so impractical, the necessities of daily life were not what interested him, so what he needed is not always what he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How can I find an item that is attractive, not useless, and yet can be returned for its full value if needed? It has to fit my budget too--that limits my choices,</i> she thought. She made a screeching right turn just before the lights changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was driving past Vale Avenue when she spotted the refurbished front of the old furniture store. An attractive long-case clock stood in the front display window, obviously beyond her budget; but it wouldn't hurt to have a look. She slowed and searched for a parking spot, fortunately finding one just about fifty feet down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in to the cool, high-ceilinged interior. The new owner walked up to her with a pleasant greeting and courteous old-fashioned charm. He was in his mid-forties, with just a hint of silver wingtips to his gleaming brown hair. He was neatly attired in gabardine slacks and a crisp white shirt with sleeves half-rolled up to show muscular and tanned arms. <i>Not quite your idea of an antique dealer, eh?</i> prompted her irrepressible alter-ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained her dilemma to the dealer and told him she wanted something unique, useful, not too expensive, that would retain its value. He showed her some chairs from the era of George III, but she would be able to afford only one at best, and since they were affordable replicas, not originals, they had little resale value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe browsed many impossibly priced or totally unsuitable items, including a brass cuspidor and a lovely commode which, contrary to expectation was not a bathroom fixture, but a commodious chest-of-drawers. She was so engrossed with the voice murmuring information she nearly forgot her purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she glimpsed something in the far corner: an oval-shaped mirror with a decorative cedar wood frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genuine Indian workmanship, early nineteenth century, and it is made of sandalwood,\"  explained the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could now distinguish the faint sweet fragrance of the wood. It was just five dollars above her budget. It was sure to retain its value, maybe even appreciate. Genuine Indian artifacts were rare. She made her decision and walked out of the store with the promise of its safe delivery to the wedding venue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the glow of satisfaction due to having made a choice of a personal and appealing item, which was both useful and of sound value? Or was it because a certain antique dealer now had her telephone number and address?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And thus began a sibling dispute that went down in family history - whose teddy was the one still remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mine, you'd taken yours down to the lake, you must've left it there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this one's mine. You'd taken yours for the sleepover at Nancy's, you must've left it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did, too. And I didn't take mine to the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe did-too-no-I-didn't went on for days - weeks (Mom said MONTHS), till finally Dad locked up the remaining blue teddy in his closet, never to emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't the time right, now, to hand out the olive branch - in the form of a new HUGE blue teddy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thus, the resulting storylines have different potential joys and pitfalls! Feel free to add your own choices and characters, particularly colorful family members. Please try to follow a general flow of typical events: traveling to the out-of-town wedding, the rehearsal, rehearsal dinner, Saturday morning before the wedding, the wedding, and the reception.
