He was in his first year of University, was dating his best friend's sister and worked part time at a grocery store. He and his friends enjoyed talking about a variety of topics including time travel. Henry had always insisted that if he somehow found himself in the past that he would be able to use his modern knowledge to conquer the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Odval</b> lived in the early twelfth century on the Mongolian steppes. Her tribe was in the middle of a war with their neighbouring tribe. The war was not going well for her tribe, resulting in nightly raids. It was in the middle of one of these raids that she hid from the raiders, wishing for a better and safer life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Emelyn Putzkammer</b> lived in the early part of the 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire. Her Father had gone off to join the Army, leaving her in charge of her younger brother Maximillian as they struggled with life in the midst of the Reformation. Amidst all the troubles of daily life, Emelyn prayed for an easier life, free from Religious prosecution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of these young women will get their wish and swap places with Henry Barnaby. The question is, who is the lucky one and will you follow them or Henry as he finds himself in his new time.</span></div></div>",

Though it was dark, you could clearly see that your hands were different. They were smaller and their calluses showed that they were used to much labour. Looking down at yourself you saw that you were wearing simple and roughly sewn clothing. Despite everything you could plainly see the bulge of your chest.

I like that!\" From the way everyone is behaving you guess this man is their leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I could impress you so easily,\" you say back in a girls voice and the language of these men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you speak!\" exclaims the man, \"Truly you are a trophy worthy of a warrior such as myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am no one's trophy!\" you reply, taking a step back only to be pushed down in the mud by another soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, prove to me you are not a trophy!

Make your choice, but remember, you get only one chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around you at the death and destruction. You can't survive here even if you escaped, and until you know what is going on, you have to survive and try to return to your life. You make the only choice you really have.

But as you feel your breasts being pressed into the saddle with each motion of the horse, you realize that you are in no position to argue. Not only that, but this is obviously a more primitive culture than you came from, and one where women do not have 'rights'. If you are to survive, you will have to do it as a woman, and what exactly that means in this strange culture, you have yet to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours, you arrive at what must be their camp. You hear jeers thrown at the man who had taken you. At last, you stop at some kind of tent made from animal skins of some kind. The man gets down from the horse, then proceeds to pull you down and throw you over his shoulder. You pound vainly on his back until he pulls you off and stands you in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turns you around, you hear a man say, \"What is the meaning of this intrusion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who brought you laughs and replies, \"This is your intrusion Bataar!\" He pushes you into the young man. He is huge and you feel very tiny and weak as he grabs you and looks closely at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBataar smiles, \"A worthy intrusion, but what is one more wench?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who brought you laughs, \"Your father thinks her worthy. He has named her as your bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBataar looks surprised, then smiles at you, \"You must have impressed father indeed!\" To the other man, \"Leave us alone. I must learn more about my new wife!\" The other man left. Before you know what is happening, in one smooth motion, he rips the rags from your body. You yell, but do not protest. He grins, \"Very nice indeed! And these rags are not worthy of your body! Come to my furs woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You walk over to it and look out at a shocking view. The room you are in appears to be raised high off the ground, even higher than a church steeple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around on the ground below you see strange buildings, many made entirely out of huge panes of what seems to be glass.

You spot someone walk out of one of the doors and head towards you. You run off down the hall in the other direction. Suddenly, the shiny metal doors you see in front of you open all on their own.

Terrified you decide to follow the person through the strange doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the doors close again and you feel like you are falling. You grip at a railing that is rimming the small room you find yourself in. Suddenly the falling sensation eases and the doors open again. Looking out the doors you see crowds of people, all talking and moving about in groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make the sign of the cross as you exit the tiny room and walk in the direction most of the people seem to be coming from.
