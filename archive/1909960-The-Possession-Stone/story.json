            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David sat in the back office of the used car lot that he owned.  It was midday and he was busy sifting through the paperwork required for an insurance claim.  One of his cars was recently lifted from the lot and apparently used in a few home robberies.  In addition to the nightmare that was the insurance company, he was also having to deal with the police. They hadn't recovered the car yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could have an employee handle this but the truth of the matter was that he was tired of dealing with customers as a salesman.  That was how he started out. Though he was good at it, he was tired of it.  Administrative work, however tedious, was preferable to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be glad when this is over,\" he mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his desk phone rang. \"We've recovered your car,\" the voice on the other line said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, David was looking over the car that had been recovered. The damage wasn't too bad. Looked like he'd only have to extract enough money from the insurance company to have some minor repairs done.  He was thinking about how he could convince the insurance company that a few things that were broken previously could be attributed to the theft as well. \"Might as well get some compensation for the headache too,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that he noticed was that the floor was damp. He added upholstery to his growing list of things to get insurance money for. He bent down to feel the damp floor. In his cursory inspection he flipped the floor mat up  to see how bad it was underneath. It was quite wet. \"Damn!\" he cursed as he ran his fingers over the damp carpet. He then pulled his hand back abruptly as he began imagining some possible sources of this unexplained moisture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to flip the floor mat back down when a glint in the crevice of the floor caught his eye. He tentatively reached forward and grabbed a small chunk of glass that was wedged between the floor and the center console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the small object out of the car and looked at it. It appeared to be just a chunk of glass at first. As he looked at it he realized that it was cut into a symmetrical shape. This wasn't glass, this appeared to be a diamond.  \"Probably fake,\" he grumbled as he put it in his pocket. \"Even if it isn't, it doesn't make up for the headache of the stolen car,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to ask one of his employees to take this down to the mechanic that he had a contract with to check for any unseen damage. This was a small enough place that he didn't have that sort of thing on-site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily,\" he said as he saw one of his salesmen walking by. She didn't seem to be up to anything right now. He asked her to get the car down to the shop and have it looked at. She smiled and took the keys from David. Then she grumbled under her breath that this didn't pay commissions. David couldn't help but watch as Emily climbed into the car. Her skirt rode up a bit before she closed the door, blocking David's view of her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid walked back to his office and sat down in his chair. His thoughts were dwelling on Emily. She was actually one of the best salesmen at his company. She was extremely attractive which David thought had to help her out for sure. He put his hands in his pocket and absently turned the diamond around in his fingers. As he was doing this he wondered what it was like for Emily. Did her appearance make it easier for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's vision blacked out extremely quickly no sooner than he had thought this. All of his senses faded. A fraction of a second later his vision and senses returned. He wasn't in his office. \"Where the hell am I?\" he shrieked. He was too panicked to notice that his voice was way off. It took him a fair bit of time to realize that he was driving a car. He slammed on the brakes in the middle of the road. The car behind him honked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" he shrieked again. This time he did notice that his voice was off. He raised his hands to his face to see two perfectly manicured dainty hands. He felt like he couldn't breath. He heaved for breath. Finally he turned the rear view mirror toward his face so that he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked when he saw Emily's beautiful face staring back at him. \"This can't be, this cant be ...\" he stammered as he frantically touched his face. He was shocked that Emily matched his movements exactly. He looked down at his own body. He was inexplicably wearing a skirt and a blazer. He frantically ran his hands up and down his body. He shuddered every time something felt different or out of place, which was pretty much the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe forced his eyes away. His mind raced. \"what should I do?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

He took a deep breath and released the brake. The car was still in the middle of the road but fortunately traffic wasn't too bad. He looked around and after a few confusing moments recognized where he was. He was about two block away from his dealership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe performed a u-turn and began heading back to the car dealership. He found it hard to concentrate on what was going on. On more than one occasion he nearly hit something. His hands were shaking and his mind was racing as he thought about this very strange situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he made it back to the car lot. He drove right up to the front door and hoped out of the car. He barely remembered to put the car in park but he did leave the engine running. He darted through the front room and into the hallway where the few offices are. He stopped at his own office and hesitated for just a moment. He took a deep breath and turned the doorknob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next</span></div></div>",

His body was sprawled out on the floor, unconscious. What was worse, there was blood coming from his head. David let out a shrill and piercing scream. Unable to really focus much he collapsed to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong,\" Dan, another salesman, said as he rushed into the room. \"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan rushed over to David's unconscious body while David just watched in shock and horror. The thought that he had somehow died crossed David's mind. He had no thoughts as to how he ended up in Emily's body however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call an ambulance!\" Dan barked at David. David just stammered and trembled. Soon David was let off of the hook as more coworkers rushed in and helped. Soon an ambulance was on its way as Dan attended to who he thought was David. David just watched in shock. There wasn't really anything else he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the paramedics arrived and attended to David's body. It happened so fast, and David was in such shock, that he didn't really know what was going on. They swooped in and got David's body onto a gurney and whisked him out the door extremely quickly. A police officer also arrived on the scene. He asked everyone lots of questions. especially David since he was the first to find himself. David was in such shock that he barely was able to get through it. Finally the officer was satisfied that there wasn't anything other than a medical condition going on here and he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a lot to deal with,\" Dan offered his sympathy, \"Don't worry about it, you did what you could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven David knew that it he was simply trying to make who he perceived to be Emily feel better. However, David couldn't help but feel that he had somehow caused this. He was starting to doubt his earlier thought that he was dead. His main worry was how his body was doing and if he could get back into it somehow. He debated going to the hospital, but he was still in such shock that he couldn't think clearly. What does he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David didn't know what to do, but he had to make sure his body was okay. He left the building while Dan asked him where was going. He found the engine of the car he had driven in still running , he stepped inside the car and moved back as he made his way to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds of questions filled David's head as he automatically drove. What happened to him? Why did it happen to him? Where was Emily? Was she still inside this body? David didn't know, and each question made another question pop up. He hoped seeing his body would answer something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived at the hospital he parked the car in the visitor's section. He pulled out the key as he would surely spend some time. He stepped inside and walked over to the reception. \"Miss can I help you?\" The receptionist asked. David was still a bit confused to be addressed as miss. Yeah I'm looking for the man who was just brought in here from a car sales lot. The receptionist typed it in the computer. Wing 4D, she answered.  The receptionist tried to hold David but he brushed her off and went off to find his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived in the wing, it was quiet, but he could hear some mumbling. He walked further and then saw his body lying in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors. He had to wait a bit until nobody was there, he couldn't tell them what happened to him. David sat down on one of the benches, he suddenly saw a coffee machine standing there. Without nothing to do he walked over to it and got some coffee, black. But when he took a sip, he suddenly couldn't stand the taste of it. Then he remembered Emily was always adding sugar to hers. He popped open a small bag of sugar and put it in. When he took a sip it tasted much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt something underneath his stomach, it felt like he had to pee. David thought of it, he had to violate her privacy to pee. He wasn't supposed to do it, but on the other hand he really needed to go. He could walk around trying to avoid to pee, or try to think about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David tried to suppress the urge by pressing down on his abdomen, applying pressure to hopefully ease the feeling, and squeezing his legs together, However, the action backfired, as the tight pencil skirt forced David to press against his bladder instead, which increase his desire to pee. Additionally, it made him aware of the \"void\" between his legs, which flustered him. Sensing that he was losing the battle against nature, he gave up on stopping this urge. \"We're both adults here, and this is a natural thing. I'm sure Emily will understand,\" David reasoned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid began to look around for the nearest facility to use. As expected of a large city hospital, finding a bathroom was not easy, as there are many rooms and facilities in the hall. Eventually, he saw a restroom sign near the stairwell at the end of the hallway. David slowly ambled there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the end of the hallway, David instinctively walked towards the male bathroom and was about to open the door when a man walked out. The middle-aged man, wearing jeans and a casual t-shirt, was startled for a second before saying, Ummm.. miss? I think the ladies' room is over there.\" He pointed at the door right across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid immediately noticed his mistake, mentally slapping his head. \"I'm sorry!\" he said in Emily's sweet voice. \"It has been a long day for me...\" David turned around to enter the female bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his current situation, David felt a little uneasy entering the ladies' room. Opening the door, he was somewhat expecting stares and screams as an \"intruder\", but none were heard. Instead, he was greeted with an empty restroom with five stalls to the right and sinks to the left. Aside from the lack of urinals and more toilet paper on the floor, the restroom is actually similar to the mens' room. David entered the stall furthest from the entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter locking the stall door, he hung the purse on a hook on the door. David then turned his attention to the articles of clothing on his current body. Looking past the mounds on his chest, he started to fumble with the belt around his waist until he realized that he can't void like he has done before. Taking a sigh, he carefully lowered the toilet seat. Figuring it would more sanitary, David rolled his grey pencil skirt up to his waist, revealing the pink lace panties underneath his dark polka dot pantyhose. Containing his temporary excitement, he stripped the pantyhose and panties to his knees. He then sat down on the seat. He finally relaxed his pelvic muscles to void. David was relieved that at least that sensation is the same in males and females. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the similarities ended there. David realized that the urine is coming out of a lower point on his crotch. Previously, if he needed to sit, he would need to hold his penis down to direct the flow into the toilet bowl. That was not necessary here, as the flow naturally hits the bowl without manual assistance. The urine, however comes out as a spray of sorts, not as a uniform stream, due to the lack of the equipment. As the flow lessens, the spray starts to angle downward from the front of the bowl to the bottom, resulting in the last several drops to flow down his pubic region. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, David noticed that a nice, warm feeling is developing while he was peeing. Unlike anything he has felt before, voiding somehow makes him feel good, sending slight spasms along his back. \"Wow... peeing as a woman actually feels...nice,\" David whispered in short breaths. This has caught David by surprise, as he never expects a mundane activity to feel this good. As the flow ended, the nice feeling dissipated. David was envious that women can experience this, hoping that this would have lasted just a bit longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the drops of urine around his vagina, David ripped a section of toilet paper and began to wipe the region. Wiping led to another good sensation, leading David to want to finger his pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his better judgment paused himself from doing so, as the feeling of violating privacy returned. He has definitely seen more of Emily's private regions than Emily would have wanted. And what if Emily's consciousness is still inside this body? Is she currently watching this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David decided that he had more important things to do than to go to the bathroom. He was here to check on his body and that is what he was going to do. He waddled back to the room where the doctors were attending to his body. He peered inside, he could hear the sound of the heart monitor that they had hooked him up to. There was still quite a bit of activity. David vaguely registered that the doctor ordered a CT scan of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn some level David was aware that they didn't want him in there. \"But its my body,\" he reasoned to himself. He decided to walk right in there and demand an update. He didn't want to get in their way since he did want them to do their jobs, but he damn well wanted some answers. With that thought, he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he doing?\" David asked. \"Is he ... OK?\" he managed to ask. He was crying. This prevented the doctors from questioning that this young woman was related, however they didn't have time. One of the nurses came up to deal with David mainly to get rid of him, but she also provided some cursory information. \"He hit his head,\" she offered. \"And he is unconscious. We need space to fully asses the situation. We need you to wait in the waiting room,\" she then deftly nudged him out of the room and drew the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDejectedly David wandered off. For now he had no choice. The overwhelming sensation that he had to pee came right back. \"Fuck!\" he exclaimed. He hit the wall with the side of his fist in a most unladylike fashion. The entire situation was too much. Having to pee was not really his biggest problem, but it was the last straw. He stormed into the family bathroom that was in the hall. David was glad that he had a nice private bathroom. He didn't really feel that he would belong in either variant of a more public bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter entering, he took another look in the mirror. He was hoping that he'd see himself in the mirror and that this whole ordeal was just some kind of dream, or hallucination, or something other than the impossible and scary situation that it was. \"Let's get this over with,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention to the toilet. He knew that he'd have to sit down so he pulled a seat protector out of the pack and laid it on the seat. \"Here goes nothing,\" he muttered and tried to pull his skirt down. It didn't slide off of his hips like he'd hoped. It took him a moment of exploration and fumbling to find the zipper on the side. When that was unfastened he slipped the skirt down. Next he grabbed Emily's stocking and panties together and slid those down. He tried not to think about what he was wearing. Up until now he had barely noticed since he'd been preoccupied with his own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everything down he took a seat and relaxed. He found that in spite of his different plumbing, it was the same muscles that had to be relaxed to let the stream flow. He tried not to think about the sensations and just let it happen. Finally he was done. He thought it felt great. He could feel just a bit of urine between his legs. \"Gross,\" he grimaced as he took a small wad of paper and wiped. \"I did not need to have to do that,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he was done with the whole ordeal and pulled up his panties. He tried not to look down until the panties were in place and managed to succeed. Next he slid the pantyhose into place. Again he tried to ignore the disconcerting sensations that screamed to him that he wasn't himself. Finally he pulled his skirt back up and just barely remembered to zip it. He washed up and wandered back to the waiting room. For lack of anything else to do, he sat down and thumbed through a magazine. He just sat there in a stupor for what felt like days but actually about forty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the nurse came. David scrambled to his feet. \"Is he OK?\" David asked the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" she asked him. David vaguely remembered that anyone who knows a full name can inquire about basic status but it may not be detailed. David gave the nurse his full name, and for good measure recited every bit of information that it might be reasonable for a close relative or friend to know. \"It's serious,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" David asked. Then for good measure added, \"He's my fiance.\" She looked around for a minute, unsure of what to do. She knew she wasn't supposed to give out any more than the designated one word basic status. She looked at David, in Emily's body. She felt deeply for the woman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she said, \"Well, he doesn't have any family that we can find.\" David nodded. It was true. He had no siblings and his parents were dead. He might have had some extended relatives out there but he didn't really know them. The nurse contemplated his request. \"OK, you might want to sit back down. He is in some kind of coma,\" she said tenderly. \"He has a minor bump on the head that needed a few stitches, but that is the extent of his external injuries. We are worried that something else that we aren't seeing may be wrong and causing this coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid didn't press the nurse any further for details. He was well aware of what was going on. \"So Emily isn't in there,\" he whispered to himself quietly as he thought about it. \"Can I see him?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" she said. She was already worried about repercussions for divulging as much as she had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Please\" David said, placing Emily's hand on top of the nurse's. \"I need to see him\" he said in Emily's voice. His skills as a salesman had taught David how to fake emotion extremely well and he made sure that there were visible tears in Emily's eyes. \"He's the only man that I've ever loved.  I just have to be there with him\" she said, her hand shaking as the tears began falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse frowned. How could she keep this beautiful young woman away from the person that she loved? \"Alright...\" she said kindly. \"I'll take you to his room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you so much\" David said to the nurse as he pulled some tissues out from Emily's purse. He wiped the tears from Emily's eyes as he followed the nurse. As the two women walked, David's mind drifted away from reality a bit. His head was throbbing ever so slightly. He noticed that the more time he spent in Emily's body, the more natural that her body felt to him. He also realized that if he tried to recall some information about Emily, that information would come to him naturally. David realized that that must mean that Emily was still inside of her body, but David had overwritten her at least for now. He had access to all of her memories but she was likely in a sleep-like state, unaware of anything that was going on. Ironically, Emily's mental state was very similar to David's body's physical state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take as long as you need\" the nurse said, bringing David back into reality. He realized that the nurse was holding a room door open for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded politely to the nurse and stepped into the room as the nurse closed the door behind him. David took a deep breath and then turned his attention to the bed in front of him. It was a strange experience. He walked over to the bed and looked down. His own body was laying there. There was a mark on his face, where he had hit his head, but for the most part he appeared to just be sleeping. His body was on a sort of autopilot where natural functions were still happening, but there was no consciousness driving it. That would likely be because his consciousness was now 'driving' Emily's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that David had had time to adapt to his situation, he realized that something must have caused him to jump into Emily's body. He had been thinking about her, but he often daydreamed about her beauty without something like this happening. That meant that there must have been something else that had caused this to happen. But the only thing he could think of that was new was...\"The diamond!\" he exclaimed, suddenly coming to a realization. David had been fidgeting with that diamond just before he found himself in Emily's body! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid quickly reached into his body's jacket pocket and pulled the small stone out. He held it up to the light and grinned, giving Emily's face a mischievous look. \"This diamond must have the ability to let the person who's touching it transfer themselves to a different body...\" he said as he began thinking. If he thought of himself right now, the diamond would likely send him back into his own body and 'wake up' Emily's mind. If her mental state was really the same as David's physical one, then she wouldn't remember anything that had happened since David entered her body. She'd have no idea what she was doing here. After telling several people that Emily was David's fiance, David knew that having her wake up in the hospital was a very bad idea. however, if he brought Emily somewhere and then switched back to his body, the Diamond would now be with Emily when she wakes up and David would have almost no way of getting it back. And the Hospital would definitely not release a comatose patient to let David be near his body but out of the hospital. David sighed. That meant that he would have to stay as Emily for the foreseeable future. Going back into his own body was totally impractical. Besides, there was very little exciting things going on as his old self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next question that came to David's mind was a harder one. He opened Emily's purse and slid the diamond into a small compartment in order to not touch it and accidentally leave Emily. He then looked at his old body. If he just left it here to rot, then the hospital would be left taking care of a patient that would never wake up. His body would wither here until it died and would be taking space that could otherwise be given to someone who really needed it. David would always smother his body with the pillow under it. That would be the easiest way to end this. That way, the hospital would not have to waste time on him, and David wouldn't accidentally jump back into his body if he happened to think about it while holding the diamond. But if he did that, what would happen? Would his mind die too? That seemed unlikely. Would Emily's mind die, making her body David's permanent new home? If that was the case, would Emily's body become like Davids when he left her? If that was the case, he'd never have to worry about the real Emily being a liability. He'd be able to continue experimenting with the diamond, but would live out the rest of his days with Emily's beautiful body as his default. But then what would happen to Emily's personality and memories that he currently had unlimited access to? Would he lose that access? Or would them become a part of his own mind? Did that merge mean that he would have continued access or would he and Emily actually combine into one person that was neither David nor Emily yet somehow both? There were so many questions running through David's mind, but he knew that there was only one way to get any sort of answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked down at his body and decided that it would be best to...</span></div></div>",

He was all to aware of his new breasts jiggling as he did so. He fought the temptation to explore them. For the time being he was desperately trying to figure out how he suddenly wound up in Emily's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slumped over and cried. He hadn't cried in years but he reasoned that this was certainly an acceptable time for it now. Another car behind him honked for him to get out of the road which only added to his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up in the mirror again. He held out some hope that he'd see his own face and that this was somehow some cruel sick joke. Instead of his own face as he hoped, he saw Emily's as he expected. Now her eyeliner was smudged from crying. Her face looked like a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go back,\" he cried. \"I want to go back, I want to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision blackened and went dark. All sensations started to fade. He could no longer feel Emily's arms, legs, or any part of her body. For a moment he felt like he was just floating in nothingness. Soon his senses returned. He could feel his arms. To him it felt as if he was growing new arms but in reality his mind was starting to process the sensations that were thrust upon him all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, David found himself sitting in his office right where he was when this all started. His hand was in his pocket and he felt the diamond there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he asked aloud but to nobody in particular. He looks around his office in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, boss man! You finally wake up?\" David was greeted by the voice of Jim Andrews, one of his salesman. A man in his early 50s with only a horseshoe of hair left and most of that being gray as well as a bit of a gut. However he was affable and outgoing and these factors served him well in being able to close a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, yeah, sorry Jim.\" David responded, \"It's just all this shit with the car and everything has left me kind of worn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, you don't need to tell me.\" Jim replied with a smile, \"Just thought I'd come in here and tell you that we've got someone here. Girl with her mom lookin' to buy her first car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some teenager huh? This should be an easy sell.\" David smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any kid. Tell me: does the name Audrey Tran mean anything to you?\" asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave it a bit of thought. \"Audrey Tran...?\" was all he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about Tim Tran?\" Jim asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim Tran... you mean that big name anchor on the news?\" asked David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" Jim exclaimed, \"That's his daughter out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that David perked up. \"Well then,\" he started as he stood up and made sure everything was in place, \"we shouldn't keep her waiting should we?\" As the pair walked outside he spotted Audrey, as well as her mother, browsing around. \"Hello, ma'am, how are you doing?\" David beamed as he shook Mrs. Tran's hand. \"And you too, miss!\" he exclaimed shaking Audrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well you know my daughter just turned 16 and got her license so we figured it was time for the next step.\" Mrs. Tran stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you came to the right place!\" David grinned, \"My name's David and I'm the owner of this little place. Small size but I like to think it gives us a more intimate, friendly feel ya know? I'll hopefully be seeing the two of you later but for now enjoy browsing around and please, if you have any questions, my buddy Jim here will be more than happy to help.\" With that he shook their hands once more and headed back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell this was just wonderful! Tim Tran was a very well known local celebrity and if he could sell something to his daughter... well word gets around and it'd definitely be a real big boon to his business. Absentmindedly he pulled the stone out of his pocket. That girl... must be nice living in a family with the money to do things like buy cars as birthday gifts. Probably makes her kind of a spoiled brat but it also makes life much easier. David wondered just how easy this girl had things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that he was outside looking at a white Prius. He looked down, noticing he was wearing a dark blue blazer, white shirt with a tie, and a knee length skirt. Holy shit, no way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey? You alright?\" Mrs. Tran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. I'm, uh, fine mom.\" David answered, \"I, um, just gotta use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right in the office, side hallway on your left, can't miss it.\" Jim pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that David dashed into the office and into the women's bathroom. He looked into the mirror hanging over the sink and saw what he half-expected: a 16-year-old Vietnamese-American girl with shoulder length black hair pushed back with a headband, glasses adorning her face and dressed in the uniform of a private school. He saw Audrey Tran or rather himself in Audrey's body. \"This is so fucking weird.\" he said to himself, fully aware of his girlish voice, as he ran his hands over his face and gave himself a hard look. Kind of cute, not bad, if a bit nerdy looking. Of course uniforms, real uniforms not the \"sexy\" fantasy kind, had a way of doing that to teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice in one day? How the hell does that happen? Unless... the stone! This all started after he found that stone! There was no way it could be a coincidence, right? David exited the bathroom and went into the office to find it. What he saw made him recoil. He saw himself, or rather his body, lying face down, blood pooling out of its forehead from an incredibly nasty gash. There was a bit of blood on the corner of the desk and... shit! When he switched his body must have passed out or gone unconscious or something and then... fuck! Fuck fuck fuck! He looked around and caught sight of the stone on the floor under the desk. He grabbed it and looked at it; maybe he could use it to switch back to his body and--no, that would be no good. Not now. Not in the state his body was in. That could be suicide. So he pocketed the gem and did the only thing he could do: screamed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on he was still talking to the police as Emily arrived. She wanted to know what happened and David blurted his guts out, tears welling out of his eyes. Emily grabbed him and hugged him, telling him things were going to be alright and that Audrey did good calling attention and getting help. That if she hadn't run into the bathroom they would've never known. And that hopefully she saved David's life. Saving David's life... hopefully that was the case. Because right now his \"life\" was in the body of a 16-year-old girl. A rich 16-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might not be so bad. His body would recover, surely, right? And he had been miserable the last little while. Maybe a break is just what he needed and what better way to do it than by staying right where he was. But still, someone needed to run his business while he was out of commission. Emily was pretty much his right hand; his Girl Friday. She would be the natural choice to run things, hell he had already signed documents stating that she gets 50/50 ownership of the dealership with Jim should something happen to him, and she could probably do a good job of it but maybe it'd be a good idea to to try and ask for a job here under the excuse of feeling \"bad\" about what happened and wanting to help out. Of course David's real goal would be to keep an eye on Emily and make sure things went well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time he should probably have faith in Emily and enjoy a bit of time away from things.</span></div></div>",

He was frankly more worried about his body and the circumstances of his occupation of Audrey Tran's body. David rolled the stone around in his fingers and wondered how it worked. Finally he just put it the purse that came with this new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you still want the Prius?\" Mrs. Tran asked. In spite of the circumstances, it took David a moment to realize that she was talking to him. David thought about it for a moment. He didn't really like hybrids much. He felt that they were under-powered. Nevertheless, he could tell distinctly that that was the car Audrey had set her heart on. David somehow even knew that Audrey had already test driven that very one earlier and they were really just here to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" David thought to himself as he realized that he could access her memories. His thoughts were still his own, but he could remember anything that Audrey knew. As he thought about it he realized that he could even allow himself to act like her if he chose to. He could let Audrey take over, or override Audrey's desires or mannerisms with his own. This would certainly prove to be invaluable in passing as Audrey for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mother,\" David replied with the same formal respect that Audrey would normally show to her mother. Even calling her mother rather than Mom as is more common. Once David's body was carried out, Emily seeing to David's body, Jim worked out all of the paperwork with Mrs. Tran. David had gone through this process many times before. He was excited. He couldn't help but feel some of the excitement that Audrey would feel in this very circumstance. He was about to get his own car. The fact that he had his own car, in addition to the ability to use any of the cars on the lot at any time, didn't change his excitement. He allowed what would have been Audrey's excitement to be his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they were done with all of the paperwork and Mrs. Tran, Mom, was handing David the keys to his own nearly new Prius. \"Now be careful,\" Mrs. Tran warned as she finally relented and handed the keys over. \"Be home in an hour,\" she finally said before going to her own car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's mind raced. He was excited by the possibilities. He wondered what he should do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fishing around Audrey's purse for the stone, David figured he ought to figure out more about this thing before he venture forward. If this thing really was responsible for him taking both Emily and Audrey's bodies, then it had a <i>lot</i> of potential, and David might need to harness that potential. Climbing into the Prius, David searched through Audrey's memories again to find where she lived. Thankfully, he didn't need anyone's memories to know how to drive. Putting a small foot to the gas pedal, he left the car lot and drove out to Audrey's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came straight home deary?\" Audrey's mother asked, surprised to see her daughter returned so quickly. \"Are you sure you don't want to take the car around town some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mother,\" David replied as he kicked off Audrey's shoes, \"I'm just a bit shaken after finding that man back at the dealership is all. I think I need to lie down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey's mother nodded sympathetically towards the person she thought was her daughter. \"Feel free to come on down if you need anything, okay sweetheart?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded and headed up the stairs to what he knew was Audrey's room. It was a pretty typical place for a teenage girl - pink walls, a big makeup table, posters of bands she liked, and a lot of clothes. With the stone in hand, David lowered himself down on Audrey's bed and began to think about what he did last time. For both Emily and Audrey, he had wondered what their lives were like. Surely it had to work again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, David thought about Ms. Tran downstairs, his 'mother'. What was her life like? It must be different being married to a local celebrity, right? Once again, his vision went dark. Upon opening his eyes again, he found himself sitting on a couch in the living room, the TV playing some sitcom he didn't care for. He looked down, finding himself in a taller, more mature body, but still female. He ran off to the house's bathroom, long black hair bouncing about as he found the mirror he was looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile formed on Ms. Tran's face as David realized just how far this could go. \"I can be anyone... anyone! Can... I even die now? Could I switch forever?\" He looked down at his new chest, patting down his boobs through her blouse. They were definitely more well developed than Audrey's. Ms. Tran was also wearing pants, which David appreciated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, David had to know, what happened to the last body he was in? Would Audrey regain consciousness? Or was Ms. Tran now her daughter? It was hard to know, since his original body apparently went comatose. With this question in mind, he made his way over to Audrey's room and opened up the door, only to find Audrey's body still asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey?\" He asked, shaking her shoulder. \"Are you awake?\" She didn't respond, but a quick check confirmed she was still breathing and her heart was still beating. David wasn't sure what this meant. \"Does my last body always go to sleep? Surely if Ms. Tran isn't in her daughters body, Audrey wasn't stuck in mine... but what happens if mine never wakes up...\" David decided to push the thought of his potential mortality out of his mind, instead opting to snatch the stone out of a sleeping Audrey's hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Audrey,\" he said in Ms. Tran's voice to the comatose body, \"<i>someone</i> has to be you, and I can't exactly go back to my body until it gets the green-light, so I guess I'll just have to hop back in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Ms. Tran one more look in the mirror, admiring her more mature form. The responsible thing would be to return to Audrey, lest someone worry about her. However, he could probably stay as Ms. Tran for a little while without anyone noticing. He could also try to jump into a third body, perhaps, to see what would happen to Ms. Tran's consciousness. What'd he decide to do? </span></div></div>",

He placed the Diamond on Audrey's dresser and left the room, sliding the girl's door closed behind him. David knew that he would have to return to Audrey's body eventually, especially if she was now not waking up. But what was the reasoning for that? David remembered that Emily had returned to the car dealership just fine soon after David had left her body. That meant that it wasn't for the people he took over to remain comatose. what made Audrey different than Emily? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David began thinking, he grabbed the remote and absent minded began flipping through the channels on TV. Grace Tran, what David found out was Ms. Tran's full name, may have been interested in what plots were developing on her soap opera, but David didn't care for that. Unlike what he had done with Audreys car, David did not let Grace's desires overwrite his own for this. He stopped surfing the channels when he saw a familiar face on the screen. Tim Tran was on the screen, but David was more interested in the picture in the upper corner. It was a picture of himself. David quickly raised the volume to hear what the anchor was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...earlier when a girl, whose name is being withheld due to her age, discovered him. He had apparently tripped and his his head against the corner of his desk. David Masters was rushed to the hospital, but sadly passed away this afternoon. He has no known family and will be greatly missed by the community...\" Suddenly, David felt his stomach sink. He...he was dead? But then how was he still here right now? If his body had died then shouldn't David be in heaven (or hell) by now? Suddenly, David came to a realization. One that he hoped was not true. He remembered how he had returned to his body from Emily's earlier by thinking about returning to his body. David quickly changed the channel back tot he soap opera and sat Grace's body down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed her eyes and focused on leaving Grace's body. \"I want to go back to my body\" he said out loud in his sultry voice. \"I want to go back to my body..\" he repeated this over and over with concentration, hoping that this would work without him needing the diamond. As he expected, David began to feel the familiar feeling of losing Grace's body. He then felt another body forming in it's place. This body didn't feel like his familiar male form though. When he opened his eyes, he quickly sat up and looked around, seeing that he was back in Audrey's room...back in Audrey's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit...\" he said in Audrey's voice as he hopped out of her bed and held the diamond in his dainty hand. David was quickly putting together what had happened, and he did not like the conclusion that he reached. David's body must really be dead. If it wasn't he would have returned to his own body instead of to Audrey. His body likely died while he was inside of Audrey's body. When that death happened, Audrey's body became is new default body. When that happened, Audrey's real soul must have ceased to exist since her body was already being controlled. David still had access to her memories and personality, but since he was the only one in her body, it would be left comatose when he leaves it just like his old body was. Whenever he would want to leave someone's body and return to his own, the body he would return to would be Audrey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and looked down at the floor. There were so many thoughts going through his mind right now. David, no longer existed. The diamond had made him more or less immortal. As long as his previous default body died while he inhabited a different one, David would never die. At the same time, he had unknowingly caused the 'death' of a sweet 16 year old girl. The real Audrey Tran would never again be able to control her own body. Besides for the times when David lets her personality out to play his part as her, Audrey would never again exist. David now had to throw out any ideas of returning to his old life and his old job. The least that he could do was live out Audrey's life in more or less the way that she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note, David say down on Audrey's bed and closed his eyes. He concentrated and whispered out loud. \"David is dead. I am Audrey Tran. David is dead, I am Audrey Tran. David is dead. I am Audrey Tran. I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm rich. My father is famous and my mother is a beautiful former model. I'm enrolled in a private school where I'm getting the best education money can buy, and I'm a good student. I have a bright future ahead of me, but I don't know what I want to do yet...\" this continued for several minutes as David allowed for Audrey's memories and personality to flow into the forefront of his mind. Within ten minutes, the 16 year old girl wasn't even thinking of herself as David again. She smiled and jumped out of bed, looking at the full body mirror in her room with a playful smile on her attractive face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs to be David, anyway? My old life totally sucked\" she said, talking exactly as she always had. \"Like, my name is Audrey Tran. David is dead\" she blew said just before she blew a kiss at her reflection. The new Audrey smiled as she picked up the diamond and licked her lips. \"Well what should a gorgeous, rich 16 year old girl do with her time now?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, if this was a dream, then anything was possible, right.<br>\r\nMaybe he could have some fun?<br>\r\nHe focused hard trying to will the door open and for Emily to come inside. No? What about his childhood ex-girlfriend...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up. It was all just a dream. He rolled over to look at the clock. He couldn't see it.<br>\r\nThe middle of the night. Seriously. That dream felt like hours.<br>\r\nThe big question. Had he actually wet himself. He manoeuvred his hands under the sheets to his crotch to feel for wetness.<br>\r\nThere was nothing.<br>\r\nPhew.<br>\r\nThere was nothing.<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\nTHERE WAS NOTHING!<br>\r\nWhere was it?<br>\r\nWhat the hell?<br>\r\nHe spread his legs and groped at the smoothness where his scrotal region used to be. Through his pyjamas, he found a small crack just above his anus. Maybe he had had some kind of surgery or something and forgotten. He poked into it and...<br>\r\nSpasm.<br>\r\nHis legs convulsed, bending at the knees, spreading them wider.<br>\r\nBut it wasn't pain.<br>\r\nIt was pleasure. Pleasure. A wave of it sweeping through his whole, entire body.<br>\r\nCurious, he prodded it more and more as it slowly sunk in what it might have been. <br>\r\nHold on.<br>\r\nHe calmly moved his other hand below this strange wound. A pretty large ass. Between. Down. Further. Yep. Definitely an anus.<br>\r\nHe tickled the upper anus and then the lower anus. One was definitely odd.<br>\r\nSo tired...<br>\r\nHe jolted back awake. He had hardly noticed how exhausted he was, but, now the the adrenaline and shock had worn off, he no longer wanted to move. He wanted to sleep. Perchance, to dream.<br>\r\nA dream. Maybe this was another dream. Maybe he really had wet himself. If he fell asleep now. He'd be even more layers down in dream. A loop of dreaming.<br>\r\nOw. He'd tried to pinch himself on the thigh but felt razor-sharp nails the end of his fingers.<br>\r\nHe never slept on his back so he rolled back over onto his front and adjusted. His arms felt uncomfortable, so he moved them under his stomach but was unable to pass his chest.<br>\r\nThat was strange.<br>\r\nHe pushed at his sweaty breasts and then realised their size and sensitivity. He wiped at the sweat and then touched a nipple.<br>\r\nooh.<br>\r\nHe raised your heavy head. Lifting a tense neck and jaw. Breathing heavily from effort.<br>\r\nUp with the heavy, womanly boobs. Then his light stomach and finally, he rolled his thighs to his calves and looked down at his fat, effeminate body. Nobody would love that on a guy.<br>\r\nBut his belly. Man that had gotten flat somehow. He could swear he was a little smaller too. Losing fat in the wrong places? He guessed. Still, he'd make a cracking crossdresser. Tiny balls. Big waist. Skinny abdomen.<br>\r\nLegs. Nice legs. He liked legs like these. Maybe he should buy tighter clothes. Like the pyjamas. Flowery pyjamas.<br>\r\nGay!<br>\r\nButtons. He didn't remember these. Maybe that was why his moobs were sweating so much more. He undid two buttons at the top to reveal slight cleavage.<br>\r\nNo. That was wrong. No.<br>\r\nHe strained his tired brain harder. Harder. Harder.<br>\r\nHe rolled back again onto his feet, which struggled to hold him as he wobbled and shook, <br>\r\nHe was definitely weaker. What was going on? One of these changes would have been enough. Why was he torturing himself with details?<br>\r\nHe continued to massage his titties. They were the weirdest thing of all. That and his missing crotch.<br>\r\nEvery pound of his heart and intake of breath in his lungs caused a jiggle.<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped as he realised. He prepared to scream. Scream with a voice he knew wasn't his.<br>\r\nHe smelt like a girl...<br>\r\nHe felt long, silky hair down to his shoulders.<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it.<br>\r\nHe was a girl.<br>\r\nWho? A gender bend of himself. Too hot. Emily again. No, the hair was too long. A random girl. That didn't make sense, this one smelt familiar.<br>\r\nCassandra. his girlfriend at the start of high school. He thought of her and then he was her. Just as he had thought of Emily and become her.<br>\r\nJust as he would think of... He cycled through celebrities in his head, but he possessed none of them.<br>\r\nHis teachers.<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\nPeople he had connected with. Mutually. It had to be.<br>\r\nHe thought of his family by accident.<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\nWhat could it be?<br>\r\nDavid.<br>\r\nHe couldn't do it before the stone, so it was obviously that. But he had jumped back from Emily. So it had to be people David had established a psychic connection with and one of them had to be holding the stone, he guessed.<br>\r\nHow would he apologise to Cassandra for this though. It must humiliate her to have fallen unconscious for such a time. It was certainly lunchtime when the stone had projected him.<br>\r\nHang on.<br>\r\nThis bed wasn't hers. He had Skyped her on her bed once and it was definitely smaller than this. A...<br>\r\n...Hotel<br>\r\nThat was right. Cassandra was a businesswomen now. A telecoms giant or something like that. She was probably on a business trip to... Asia he guessed. Based on the time. That would best explain why she was tired. Jet lag had worn off and it was late.<br>\r\nSomething like that.<br>\r\nThat was sad. He couldn't use her to experiment and find out about this new power. What a shame. She was too far away.<br>\r\nTime to hop back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there he was, David, in wet trousers, holding in his hand a stone to seize control of an individual, totally.<br>\r\nHe had to experiment, but on who? It had to be someone connected to him, right. He felt most confidant with his connection:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his friend who was now the woman working at the coffee shop so she could investigate what happened to Emily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the rich wife of a long time customer of his, to bring him lots of money and a pair of new trousers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the hot school counsellor with the flashy sports-car<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his pretty female doctor to check on a sick friend of his in hospital<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cassandra just to catch the next flight back</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story revolves around a man named David. He is a lonely single man who throws himself into his work since he doesn't really have anyone in his life. He owns a medium sized used car lot where he spends nearly all of his time working for lack of any real meaning in his life. He is in his mid thirties and lives alone. He is generally a nice polite guy, but is a bit bitter and will sometimes take advantage of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe acquires a small gemstone that allows the user to project their mind into the body of anyone that they have ever touched. Please adhere to the following when adding chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) The person being possessed doesn't have to be nearby. There is no limit to the range. Their whereabouts don't even need to be known for it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) The person using the stone can only possess people with whom they have had some form of physical contact at any point in the past. A handshake is probably the most common way to achieve this. One can't just possess a famous person or a politician without having first touched them in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) The person being possessed is completely unaware of the whole thing. When the possessor leaves, they will regain their full faculties.  They will perhaps be a bit disoriented and will have no memory whatsoever of what the other person did, or even that there was another person.  To them it will appear as a complete memory gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) The body of the person using the stone collapses into a catatonic state until such time as they return. All bodily functions remain normal while the stone's user is away. That means the body still needs sustenance and hydration even while nobody is home.  It is completely unable to care for these basic needs on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) In order to possess someone, the user must be holding or in some other way touching the stone directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.) Chains are allowed. If a person uses the stone to jump into the body of another, they can return to where they are located, pick up the stone and jump again. Their second body will fall down in a catatonic state until such time as the user leave the third body and returns to the second. The limitation of having had physical contact applies to the body that they jump from. This is perhaps a good way to get around that physical contact limitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.) If the person's body dies while they are elsewhere, then the body they are currently occupying becomes their permanent body.  The person who was displaced cannot come back in any way in this case.  It will be as if their mind also died. Assuming that the stone is reacquired, one can only jump into other people from this body that this body has touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to have some people be immune or more difficult to possess than others.  Descriptions of sex and violence are fine but try not to limit the story entirely to that.  Don't end the story or kill David (at least not his mind).  Please use correct spelling and grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGP will be awarded for chapters that are well written. I may do minor editing on a chapter if there are some minor mistakes. If there is no content in a chapter I'll probably delete it but I'll be conservative about how often I do this as I really do appreciate additions.</td>",
