            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The afternoon fall sun shone on a lone figure hanging from a tree. A shortish young woman, no older than eighteen, hanging from a noose. Her pale, blue-gray eyes were staring down as the small curls of her shaggy blond hair hung out from under her beanie and into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Someone gonna let me down?\" She asked as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile, a frightfully out there young woman, was rather bored with her life. She was always very strange in how she questioned everything in her life, to the point of annoyance for anyone else. She always had a rather...strange view on how to live her life. When some girls came over to her house to try and bully her a good two years back, they found her standing by the wood chipper with red, pulpy gunk flying out. Those girls never bothered her again, leaving Lucile to laugh as she tossed another watermelon inside the chipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lived alone, what became of her parents no one knows. Each time she answered it was a different story, her father vanished into the ether during a trip to Las Vegas, her mother died playing Russian Roulette because she thought she won, but the safety had been turned on, they both moved to Canada to escape the IRS...always something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile struggled, kicking her legs as wind blew through the rips in her black jeans while gripping the head of the noose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to see what it would be like to try and kill herself, what it would feel like to people who didn't want to live anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe branch above broke, and the skinny young woman fell, hitting her back on a cluster of tree branches, groaning as she lay on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuicide was far too painful for her taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on the ground pitifully for about two and a half minutes before she brought herself up to her legs, clutching her back with one hand as she readjusted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not my best choice to pass time.\" She groaned as she reached for a Hershey bar she kept in her front pants pocket that, thankfully, had not broken or crumbled on impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite, looking up into the early afternoon sky with her bored, dull blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't have time to kill myself, but I have time to kill\" She said to herself with a straight face, taking another bite of her candy bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could always just go for a walk, see what happens.\" She said to herself aloud with a mouth full of chocolate. \"Not like anything weird's gonna happen to me or anything really eventful in my book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carelessly tossed part of the ripped-off wrapper aside as she walked passed a taxi that had crashed into a 1970's Lincoln.</span></div></div>",

So, she sought out the nearest restaurant, finding an out of the way diner that had apparently just opened a few blocks away from her attempted suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the fairly large establishment, Lucile sat herself down at a booth, a waitress soon appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lucile's eyes went a bit wide at the sight of her waitress. This woman was massive! A gut that jiggled and quivered as she breathed in and out, a rear that was casting half of the wall behind her in shadow, and a face with four chins, this Sky, as her nametag read, clearly loved to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's good to eat here?\" Lucile asked, as she stared directly at Sky's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's what I'll have then,\" Lucile replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you said everything was good, so I'll put that to the test. If anything's bad, you don't get a tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sky grumbled as she watched Lucile slide into a booth, sitting down and folding her arms over the table. She grabbed the salt and pepper shakes, then jostled them around as she pretended they were both a couple of people in order to pass time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I feel like I know her from somewhere...</i> Sky said as she looked down at her note pad. For simplicity's sake, she filled out the order as, \"One of <u>everything</u>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for her food, Lucile noticed Sky hovering over her. Not that it was hard to do, given her massive fat body that almost looked too big for her to even be mobile. The one thing that drew Lucile's attention the most was the flawless, supple breasts Sky possessed, the tanned skin exposed enticingly, revealing the deep chasm of her cleavage. Lucile retained her poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Standing there trying to pressure me won't get you any tips either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I just...can I sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can fit.\" Lucile mused in her deadpan voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky frowned, feeling sweat roll down her fat neck. It was true, fitting in there would be a hell of a squeeze. She decided to compensate instead, taking two stools, one to support each thick butt cheek, sitting atop them and making them groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...how long you been working here...Sky...\" Lucile said as she read the waitress's nametag aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I started High School. Oh and it's 'Skye' with an e at the end. There was a mix-up when these were made and they're printed on metal so correcting it would be thirty bucks out of my paycheck.\" Skye said with sarcasm-laden cheeriness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. ...Hey don't I know...wait you're Skye Haymeyer from Queen's Brook High right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she know-? Wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lucile?\" Skye questioned, cocking her fat face to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've uh...heh, you've grown.\" Lucile said, a semblance of a smile forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I took to eating when I found out the girl I like was straight. And a member of the baptist church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit happens.\" Lucile said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame as ever. That usual powerful bluntness to her words was exactly like the Lucile she knew. She'd remembered seeing Lucile around when they were small children, but back there Lucile was dressed less in a punk ensemble and more like a Victorian doll. What was it called again? Gothic Lolita?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so err...how's life been?\" Skye was never one for asking particularly heavy questions. She tried to start off slow, take it step by step. She didn't want to make it seem like she was coming on too-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$20 for a regular, $15 for oral.\" Lucile said with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye almost fell off her stools at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-NO! I-I just wanted to make conversation!\" Skye's puffy face was so red it looked like a ripe tomato, her dyed silver bangs falling over her eyes. Lucile just laughed, her trademark manic insane laughter that was less fitting for an audacious joke and more for when she starts punching a man's head in. Flustered at her attempt to try and pick Lucile up crash and burn so miserably, Skye got up, her fulsome rear jiggling, the rest of her form following suit, wobbling and waddling over to the kitchen area to pick up Lucile's first dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man...well...maybe if she's...like me, then I'll have a shot...</i> Skye thought as she looked down, observing her full figure with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile clasped her hands together as she observed her first meal, ham and eggs with buttered toast and a stack of buttermilk pancakes with syrup piled on them and topped with a generous square of butter. Lucile tore into her meal rather impressively, the food likely tasting better due to her recent suicide attempt. Or...that's what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If food can taste this good, I should try to kill myself more often!</i> Lucile thought gleefully.</span></div></div>",

They had told her it would make her heart's desire come true and right now her heart wanted a lot more of Lucile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile finished off a plate of spaghetti, belching mightily as she did so, the button on her pants flying off as her ballooning middle surged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lucile paid it no mind and ate more, each bit of food expanding her, the booth soon becoming filled with Lucile and Skye found her arousal growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the food?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile answered with a fart and a pant, her now obese face red. \"Pretty...hnn...good...huff...phew...must've walked a bit much today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's probably it,\" Skye replied with overt sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did she have to fall for the oblivious ones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lucile was almost done and was now...</span></div></div>",

Oh sweet mercy that was great~\" Lucile cooed as she rubbed her bulbous, blubbery belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye's jaw was agape as she looked at Lucile. She must have been the same size as her, if not bigger! A massive woman packed full of copious amounts of lard and cellulite, a food filled balloon almost in her size and figure. Lucile's massive belly and assets gave her a sort of apple shape, so to say, but unlike Skye less of her body fat went to her breasts and more went right to her booty. Somehow, Lucile's jeans warped in size enough to fit over her rear, but still allowed for the fulsome booty to wobble and jiggle with each and every one of Lucile's even smallest movements and even so much as breathing encouraged shaking and jiggling. She was gargantuan in her girth, just as Skye was and that was how she wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-s-say...my, uh, my shift is ending soon so...you ergh, uh...wanna hang out when I get off work?\" Skye asked. She stammered, admiring how beautiful Lucile looked, her alabaster skin remaining flawless and making her adipose look even softer then it was even thanks it its pale shade. Her round, puffy face was almost chipmunk-like, adding an innocent look to her otherwise dark and psychotic demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll just kill time outside.\" Lucile said in a matter-of-fact tone. She didn't really like other people much, but she felt like she could trust Skye. She did seem pretty cute and the two of them did go back. Plus, she could tell Skye wanted to try her luck with her, which was a compelling thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Skye went back to work, Lucile felt her usual snake-like smile form on her face. She looked out the window and saw a large SUV, a gas-guzzler no question. Waddling out the door, which was altered for Skye due to a complaint as she grew in size. She saw the key had been left inside and allowed a sinister giggle to pass her lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye walked out wearing a white jacket with fake fur puffs on it over a button up green and brown shirt, with black slacks and brown and black boots. She adjusted her amethyst necklace as she walked out the door, smiling like an idiot. Lucile may have been creepy and acted like she was a relative of the Addams Family, but she wasn't all bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that thought, Skye saw a large yellow SUV crashed into the Dairy Queen across the street. Lucile was getting out as the manager ran out and started yelling angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! The hell did you do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill giggling and grinning like a snake in the grass, Lucile raised a plump finger, sausage like in thickness, and pointed at her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm guessing that's gonna be your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Me not giving a shit face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile laughed as she walked away, the manager yelling angrily at her. Skye just stared dumbfounded, feeling herself slump forwards, thick doughy arms dangling downwards as she looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did you seriously have to do that?!\" Skye freaked out. Lucile's expression returned to its stoic one as she looked back at the steaming wreck of a car plowed through the wall, then at Skye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right; maybe I should have painted the car with blood first. Goat maybe, or dogs? I don't wanna kill any cute cats just for the sake of my fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye rubbed the bridge of her nose with her fingers as she exhaled deeply. It seems thinking of Lucile as her \"ideal\" girlfriend was far too strong of a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...where we off to?\" Lucile asked, hands jammed in her pockets as she impatiently fidgeted a bit.</span></div></div>",

Squeaking and shrieking at the same time, Skye whirled around and belly bumped Lucile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...you never told me you could make such cute sounds. Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye just walked away, wondering why she didn't wait and see just what Lucile was like nowadays before her heart decided it was set on her. But it had been a long time since she'd gotten any, she reasoned to herself, and Lucile was sexy. Maybe she could just drone her out with thoughts of a happy, more submissive Lucile?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her thoughts were cut off as Lucile farted, face scrunched up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye groaned and just waddled on ahead, looking for the first place to vanish into, hopefully somewhere dark.</span></div></div>",

IDEEEA!\" Lucile belched by squeezing her doughy belly, causing Skye's hair flow backwards a bit. Skye stared blankly at Lucile for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on...I wonder if we should even go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually the best stuff is off the beaten path anyway. Don't eat where someplace is popular, just eat where locals eat.\" Lucile said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye nodded, admitting internally Lucile did have a point. They made their way down further, finding what looked like a ramshackle house by the end, plants growing out from under the concrete and cats galore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh~!\" Lucile waddled forward, sending Skye for a spin before eventually falling on her blubbery ass as Lucile picked up a nearby black cat and started cuddling it into her fatty body with glee. The cat itself didn't seem to mind, as it closed its eyes and stuck its tongue out partway while purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucile, no no no! Don't touch that cat, it could have rabies or hepatitis or fleas!\" Skye cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't mind at all really.\" A voice called out. A woman who looked some thirty-odd years in age stepped out, wearing a dress like a 1950's housewife with her raven colored hair in a perm and a her hands held a pumpkin pie in them. Lucile's pupils dilated as she smelled the pumpkin and cinnamon and the cat she was holding in her doughy arms against her bosom began to struggle as saliva poured onto its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be darned if I didn't expect guests at this time of day.\" The woman said in surprise as she set the pie on the sill of a window close to her door. A cat walked over, but she sternly shooed it off before the feline could taste that pie. \"Oh, please come in, come in! Make yourselves at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile looked to Skye, who shrugged her thick shoulders and went along with it. Lucile walked alongside her, cats stuffed between her folds, two held in her arms and another sitting comfortably on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you two just sit down and I'll be back out. Oh, I-I can tell you girls love to eat so how about I make you some desert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pie!! Lots of pie!\" Lucile yelled as she leaned back and grabbed at the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pregnant silence in the air, interrupted only by the occasional meowing and mewling of cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yyyyeah I don't mind some too. Oh, do you have any ice cream to go with it at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a fresh gallon or so of vanilla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, if you don't mind uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course!\" The woman smiled as she walked over to the kitchen, Lucile bouncing in her seat and muttering the word \"pie\" over and over. She looked in her kitchen drawers as she searched for what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...rolling pin...pie sheet...pie plate...pocket book of spells...ah here we go!\" The woman grinned as she pulled out a black, leather bound book. She looked it over quite quick, looking at her spells as she grinned. This woman, being a rather strange minded witch, looked the book over studiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...those girls look like they have something unique about them! I should try and see just what they'd think if I...ohh which spell should I use now?

Skye couldn't help but sigh like a lovestruck woman as she stared, propping her head against her hand and playing with her ice cream as she imagined fantasies of herself and Lucile feeding each other, fattening further until they both out grew a whole city and then started to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye paused. Was Lucile...developing black spots on her body? She could swear that, not only that, but Lucile's breasts were looking larger and perkier too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Skye felt a bit of pain surge through her as she rubbed her swollen rear feeling...something curly. Like a small spring. Skye played with it a bit, wondering what it could be but it felt like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pig tail??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye felt something atop her head as well. Soft, fuzzy ears. She looked in one of the mirrors nearby to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had ears like a pig and in addition her nose had become a button nose. Her belly looked a bit more swollen with fat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...a..aaahhh...AAAAHHH!! I'm a PIG!!\" Skye cried as she gripped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else is new?\" Lucile snarked. Skye turned around to try snapping at her, but stopped as she saw that Lucile had changed as well. Her larger breasts were perky and round, likely quite swollen with milk. She had curved horns on the side of her head, larger black spots and she was even sporting a spotted cow tail with a blond tip to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo.\" Lucile said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye blushed, but shook her head back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, why did we turn into animal girls?! Whoever did this I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably that woman, whatever her name was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mallory and I'm sorry I didn't say so earlier.\" Mallory stepped out of the kitchen, looking a bit guilty. \"I suppose I should have asked first. Ooh, this is just what mother said about me going off like a loose cannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye and Lucile blinked as they stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?\" Skye said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was a quick confession.\" Lucile said as she swallowed the last of her pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a witch. Ah, not a bad witch like in Hansel and Gretel. Though, sadly, I was there for the funeral. She was buried in a gingerbread casket as per request. Anyway, I wanted to try some new spells but I forgot! Mortals aren't like us witches and warlocks. So...I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do you believe words to be made of gold, Mallory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye turned her head. Lucile had a tone that was evocative of some villainess trying to make a deal with the hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing how my...friend and I are so perturbed, would you mind setting us right somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! And if you name your request, I can try to make it happen if you don't mind letting me try another spell or two in exchange. Uh, just don't mind if a cat or two explodes in the process...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the cats in the room started meowing cautiously and nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what happened to Al...\" Someone could be heard whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile thought for a moment. Considering the price was one favor per spell, she wanted to chose wisely...</span></div></div>",

No, the real reason she had gotten so fat was the complete and total abandon she threw into eating.

Her breasts ballooned and swelled in front of her, squishing against her increasing number of chins as her massive, playfully round and ample butt expanded outwards behind her farther and father. Her chair, to no surprise, gave out under her as Skye continued to swell up with more fat. More and more and more, becoming blob-like in her form as she finally felt her legs had become useless under her quivering, swelling bulk as she finally planted her massive, bulging booty onto the floor as it wildly shook and wobbled. Her increasing bulk easily started to overtake the furniture in her kitchen area, chairs and the table becoming wedged and engulfed in her creamy fat and increasing, deepening folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye didn't know weather to be freaked out of her skull or absurdly turned on. Likewise, Lucile didn't know weather she should keep the spell up or stop and see if she couldn't join in as well. This whole fat thing was pretty cool far as she cared, either way.

It wasn't blood, but it was white and smelled sweet. As she wondered what it was Lucile felt her body swell up as her body swelled with new fat, but along with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet, thick white cream began to leak from Lucile's very pores as her body swelled outwards with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whoa! Okay this feels freaky as shit, Skye!\" Lucile cried as she started panting, sweat mingling with the cream that leaked out of her body while the rest stayed inside of her and became more fat for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye drooled both in arousal and hunger as she playfully watched Lucile's body puff up like a lard filled balloon. She grabbed Lucile, squeezing her impressive chest. Lucile moaned and panted as cream was squeezed out of her perky, huge breasts and fell into Skye's mouth, instantly adding more fat to the blobby woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing where she was going with this, Lucile leaned herself over Skye's open mouth, panting and moaning as cream passed her body, falling into Skye's open mouth as the two women only grew larger and larger. Lucile was looking rather blob-like herself, but thanks to the magic, she kept from \"melting\" into her fat. The ecstacy of the moment started to overtake the two fat-laded ladies' minds, both of them well into the quadruple digits in terms of weight and still growing well, when they finally stopped. Lucile panted as she rubbed her sore body, cream still leaking out, while a hand wandered under the bottom curve of her belly to her sensual area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhmmm...<b>BBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRPPP!!!</b> God that was amazing...\" Skye panted, feeling turned on just by looking at the scene in front of her, Lucile's cream seeping into her folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah but...this form is a bit, eh, exhausting. If I'm constantly aroused and <b>BBUUUURRRRPP!!</b> gaining off all this cream, how am I gonna bust any heads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...you said I could...<b>UUUUUURRRRRRRPPP!!</b> change you in some way. Holy crap, why are we belching so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then pick <b>BBUUUURRP!!</b> something else please...?\" Lucile panted as she started rubbing at herself, feeling her lust read maddening heights as she swelled and swelled with doughy fat and sweet cream. Skye looked on at Lucile, entertaining the idea for a few seconds.</span></div></div>",

It was interesting to see how far you could get without deviating from the path.  Sometimes you had to climb over things or walk across somebody's yard or through somebody's house, but she didn't see why such people as urban planners and homeowners should get to make all the decisions about how somebody else's walk should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she started off on the sidewalk, but when it curved, she kept going.  She walked into the woods and down a hill and splashed through a stream and climbed up a muddy embankment and fought her way through some blackberry bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was starting to look like a hobo had mated with a leaf collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuffed the rest of the chocolate bar in her mouth and smacked loudly.  It was pretty good.   Somehow, things tasted better when you'd very nearly died.   She decided to buy some more at the first opportunity.   She had to walk for nearly two miles before her arrow-straight path carried her into a 7-up and past a rack of candy bars, where she picked up a box of Hershey's.  Unfortunately the straight line went nowhere near the cash register.  Instead, she was forced to shoplift the candy bars and wriggle out through the bathroom window.   It's not that she was a thief, but the As The Crow Flies game was a matter of principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile plopped down on the first park bench that crossed her path and unwrapped a candy bar.   It was delicious.  She wondered if she could eat the entire box in a sitting.  Now, that would be a new experience.   It <i>was</i> a hell of a lot of chocolate, though, she thought.  <i> By the end of this, I'll either be puking up mudslides, or I'll hold it all down and just get fat as hell.</i>   She wondered which it would be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn't like a little extra weight would hurt her.    If she'd been just a little lighter, after all, she'd be twisting lifelessly in the wind like an underweight ham right now.  When you thought about it, packing on a few pounds was a vital safety precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt exhilarated, and wasn't sure if it was the new lease on life or all the sugar, or a little of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucile rubbed her hands together with a wide, toothy grin. People she had associated with oft preferred her stoic rather than happy or elated in some way due to the fact, plain and simple, they found her VERY creepy in such a state. Not only did her grinning expression make her look somewhat creepy and perhaps even a touch insane, but what really creeped people out was her laughter. Some found it strange, others, plain and simple nightmare fuel. Lucile had a high, childish and perhaps even hyena like laugh, sort of like a female equivalent to Hazama from BlazBlue's laughter some even said. It didn't help she had a habit of staying up late or was possibly malnourished in some way, given her narrow figure, which resulted in thick, dark circles under her eyes. Grabbing her first bar and tearing the paper, off carelessly tossing it aside, she crammed as much chocolate in her mouth as she could, as if she had hung herself after skipping breakfast. Which she did, but that's not the point. As she tossed another wrapper aside while still chewing the chocolate in her mouth, a passing Native-American man wearing an argyle sweater and khaki pants looked down at the carelessly discarded wrappers and, with a face as unmoving as the stone of a great mountain, a single tear rolled down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile paused as she hastily unwrapped her third bar as she finished off the second, looking down at the discarded paper as a feeling of sudden guilt washed over her inexplicably. She looked over at a wastebasket sitting by the obligatory park water fountain and grabbed the paper in her now free right hand, walking over and tossing it in the basket, then dragged it over to the bench as she leaned back to sit down, grabbing yet another bar and unwrapping it, afterwards licking off and sucking off some of the chocolate stained on her fingers. The odd young woman had no idea chocolate could even taste this good, at least run of the mill Hershey bars. She felt her stomach fill a bit, but if there was one thing she was known for it was being stubborn. In middle school, for example, Ashlin, who had bullied her for years, threw Lucile's cell phone in one of the displays at the Zoo her class was touring. The gorilla cage no less. After about ten minutes, the Teacher realized she was gone and wondered where she could have gone to. twelve minutes later, Lucile rejoined the group with a black eye, her right leg bruised and battered and her clothes tattered in multiple areas. She was clutching her cell like a security blanket in her left hand. It was reported after this incident that one of the gorillas had its arm broken and since then, they had a tendency to howl in fear whenever young girls with blond hair got too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile began to groan as she felt her stomach become more taut now. It bulged outwards from all the chocolate stuffed inside and felt uncomfortable as Lucile tried to rub it with her hand. She feared that a mudslide would be imminent. Regardless, she wanted to finish this box in one sitting and she was going to. In an attempt to plow down the brick wall, she forced herself to stuff two more bars into her mouth, her brain fighting against her body to chew the sweet chocolate in her mouth and commanding her esophagus to swallow it. She groaned as she felt the mass of solid milk chocolate land in her stomach and she could swear she felt her belly swell a tad more it filled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in the name of God did I bork the King-Size box?\" Lucile bemoaned aloud, her voice strained as she struggled to eat the seemingly endless box of chocolate bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurrrrp!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile belched loudly as she rubbed her stuffed belly, which was so distended with eaten chocolate that it stuck out in a chubby round gut. She lifted her \"Dark Side of the Moon\" T-shirt to rub her hand gently against her stomach, leaning back against the bench and groaning as she felt sort of sick from eating that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fucking hate myself.\" She said aloud to herself after a pregnant silence. As she lazed back, the afternoon sun felt welcome against her body as a couple leaves fluttered by from the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucile rested, she though she could hear giggling. Two women, close by. Opening one of her eyes, she could see two girls looking in her direction and laughing to each other, turning their heads as if to glace at her. One had reddish-brown curly hair and wore an embroided pink cardigan with denim shorts that were ruffled at the end of the legs along with brown fur boots. The other had straight hair that was dyed a metallic silver, with a green bomber jacket slung on over a black turtleneck along with slate cargo pants and black work boots. Lucile couldn't tell if she was groaning from the chocolate she just ate or the fact she recognized the two girls. The red haired one was Ashlin, who was basically her sitcom rival of sorts who had nothing but unrequited hate for Lucile since day one, leading Lucile to try and ignore her like a plague. The other girl with dyed hair was Skye, a girl who came from a military family and always loved to talk about guns or military tech. She wasn't so bad, and possibly one of the closest things Lucile had to a friend, acting as a moderator whenever Ashlin tried to pick on her. The one area the two loved discussing was the affects of different caliber firearms on the human body, such as using a .454 hand cannon on an unarmored enemy head or firing from cover using a Barret-REC7 at an enemy's limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'up piggy~?\" Ashlin said in a mock-friendly tone. Lucile groaned louder. She saw Ashlin's lips moving but thankfully, she was zoning out due to her sugar coma, resting her head back and closing her eyes. The next thing she remembered hearing was some back and forth between Skye and Ashlin before she awoke with a start as she felt Ashlin's foot kick against her shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you even <i>listening</i> you freaky lard ass?\" Ashlin said with a spurning tone, her arms crossed. Skye just stared with an expression of \"I want no part in this\" written all over it. Lucile just scowled back at her.</span></div></div>",

I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Ashlin's boot catch her right between the cheeks, and sprawled forward against the bench, nearly losing all that chocolate. Both her knees were painfully skinned against the ground. She picked herself up and whirled just in time to see Ashlin retreating down the street, screaming with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit,\" Skye said.  \"I'm sorry about this, Lu--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel sorry for her,\" Lucile snarled.  \"I'm gonna wring her neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off after Ashlin as fast as she could manage.  Normally she would have caught her easily--Ashlin wasn't really that athletic--but Lucile was in no state to be running.  She was stuffed so full she could barely put one foot in front of the other.  Agonizing stitches blossomed up and down her sides as she speed-waddled down the street.   Within four blocks she had to give up.  She sank to the ground, curled up in the fetal position, and moaned piteously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty seconds, she heard a pair of footsteps approach her and then stop.

She knelt down, offering a hand to Lucile so she could get up. Lucile looked up with a pitiful expression on her face, her agonized state giving her forehead a blue tint. She reached up and, with some pained groans, she got back on her feet. As she gripped her still bulging belly, letting out another burp as her hands pressed against her taut gut and blowing a couple more cocoa bubbles that popped in Skye's face. Skye raised an eyebrow, then sniffed the air a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hershey?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hershey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye nodded. She looked down at Lucile's skinned knees through the rips in her black jeans. They were red and bleeding a little, with skin peeling in some areas. Skye looked over Lucile's shoulder as she was preoccupied poking her stomach to make herself burp \"Axel-F\" and saw small drops of blood on the sidewalk from where she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...C'mon.\" Skye said, turning around and started walking down the street. Lucile just stared with a nonchalant expression and followed behind. She lost her place in the song and now she had to start over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about eight minutes, Skye led Lucile outside a grey, non-descript looking building. There was only a parking lot and some double doors, but no indication as to what in the world it was. No signs or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here.\" Skye said. \"And for God's sake I mean <i>stay</i> here. No running off like last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skye I already told you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I told <b>you</b> and will tell you again: Garden Gnomes are not mocking you nor are they plotting to kill you. <i>They. Are not. Alive</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye walked inside of that building. Lucile watched with her half-closed eyes as she could see Skye reach into her leather wallet and present what looked like an ID of some kind. Lucile's stomach was audibly growling and churning all the chocolate inside, as it had been for a minute or two now. Lucile found it odd, wondering if this was an onset of some form of ravenous hunger. She remembered it was a favorite plot devise of someone she knew who was an FA. Well, not so much knew as watched him secretly to figure out why it is some people have a fat fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around, Lucile looked over at one of the houses, a small colonial building with a white picket fence and green, freshly mowed grass that she could smell somewhat even from where she was standing and on the lawn...there was a gnome. One of those damn gnomes with a white, long, straight beard and a red cone hat. Lucile scowled, her eyes opening fully as she brought two fingers up to her eyes and then pointed them at the lawn gnome as if to say, \"I'm watching you, you son of a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome sat in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could go over and give that gnome a taste of the old E&amp;I, Skye stepped out of the doors. She was carrying a brown, cylindrical bottle of rubbing alcohol and a box of gauze as well as a one liter bottle of Dr. Pepper, Lucile's favourite, a pack of unfiltered Malboros and a zippo lighter with a chrome finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did they have those? Is it some secret army grocer?\" Lucile puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just an Army co-op. They usually put these by bases. If you have family in the military they give ya an ID you can present to places like this for stuff.\" Skye said as she slipped the Malboros and the zippo in one of her back pockets. She unscrewed the white plastic cap on the alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down. It'll be easier.\" Skye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile obeyed, knowing what she meant to do and sticking her legs out all the way. She had to lower herself slowly as her stomach was still sore, but at least she'd gotten some time to let all the damn chocolate digest. She didn't even flinch as she felt Skye apply the rubbing alcohol, using a cloth in one of her back pockets to apply it on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I didn't know you smoked.\" Lucile said as Skye proceeded to pull open the gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all the time, but when I'm alone it feels nice to just have a smoke. Helps you relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile pulled off her jeans, carefully lifting the legs up to keep the denim from rubbing against her knees so that Skye could properly apply the gauze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have better ways to relax or keep calm.\" Lucile said. \"Like revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye stopped in place for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave Ashlin be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time was too far. If you kick a dog enough, it'll bite back and you'll be to blame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucile just be patient and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skye, patience is for people who don't own guns. I'm taking action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye allowed a defeated sigh to escape her mouth. She proceeded to lift Lucile's leg and wrap gauze around, covering her skinned knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what are you gonna do exactly?\" She asked as she made a full layer over Lucile's right knee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...well I always wanted to try something ironic, perhaps with a hint of poetic justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wanted? Wait you </i>wanted<i> to have a vendetta against someone eventually</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye felt a drop of sweat flow down the back of her head. As far as she knew Lucile, she would probably do this eventually for a much pettier reason. Like taking it out on a pizza boy just because she felt he cheated her out of twelve cents. Lucile stared down at her belly, still groaning as it churned and digested its sizable payload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh~ I think I have it!\" Lucile smiled.

Now, here's what we're going to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin stifled a yawn and stretched out on the couch, resting her powder-blue laptop on her stomach.  Of course, she had to rest it on a pillow, because her stomach was so <i>totally</i> flat, not like what that crazy liar Lucile had said at <i>all.</i>   It wasn't fair to call her fat just because she called them like she saw them.  She'd taken up the Thin Girl's Burden.  After all, if you didn't tell fat people they were fat, they might forget, and that would be bad for their health.  When you thought about it, she wasn't just trolling Facebook looking for chubby cosplayers who she could inform of such little-known afflictions as diabetes and heart attacks.   She was <i>saving lives</i>.   She was a goddamn <i>hero</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang.   Ashlin skipped over and swept the door open it.  \"Who iiiiiiis it?\" she sang.  Followed by \"Guhh\".  She didn't sing \"guhh\".  She just guhhed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\", said the boy on the doorstep.  \"I'm internationally famous tween sensation Dustin Castor, multi-platinum selling artist and originator of the musical genres of bubblehop, thrash glitter and interfaith gospel.   And I'm here to deliver a pizza.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged a pizza box from the top of the towering pile into her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guhhhh...\" Ashlin said again, taking it.  She didn't even notice the searing grease soaking through the cardboard and dripping from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ashlin?  I must say, you're looking especially beautiful tonight,\" said Dustin Castor.   Ashlin fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going,\" Lucile said, rolling her eyes.  \"You broke her.  I told you to let me do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye put down the microphone.  \"Do you even know how to work one of these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a perfectly simulated humanoid robot with four hundred points of articulation, not brain surgery,\" Lucile said.  \"I think I can handle it.  Here, give me those controls and I'll get her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye handed over the control pad and Lucile bent over the drone control console, squinting at the image on the screen, which currently showed Ashlin sprawled on the floor under a pile of pizza.   She pushed forward on the control stick, and the Castor-bot leaned down over the unconscious girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up!\" Lucile said, and yanked the arm control stick to the right.   The drone gave Ashlin a left hook across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Skye observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was supposed to be a slap,\" Lucile shrugged, \"but whatever works.  It seems to have got her attention, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin got unsteadily to her feet, dripping with grease and her own overflowing juices.   \"Ooh, Dustin, I can't believe it's really you,\" she swooned.  \"Somebody pinch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin reached forward awkwardly and gave her a double titty-twister that brought tears to her eyes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow-how-how, oh my, you don't waste any time, do you?\" Ashlin said.  \"Well, I won't either.  My parents are totally gone and they have a water bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin frowned.  \"As much as I'd love to pump you full of my Castor oil, my dear sugar-butt, I have these pizzas to deliver first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them here,\" Ashlin begged.  \"I'll pay for them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I hate to think of them going to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll eat them!\" Ashlin assured him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not that good once they're cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll eat them all <i>now!</i>\" Ashlin pleaded desperately.  \"Just stick around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellletmethinkaboutithmmokay,\" Dustin said.  \"Go to it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hustled Ashlin to the couch and plopped the towering pile of pizza boxed into her lap.  She gulped.  The pile came up to eye level.  She opened the first box and lifted out a steaming slab of cheese and dough buried under spicy sausage and anchovies.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If it'll get me a night with Dustin Castor,</i> she thought, <i>my stomach can take anything! </i>   She stuffed the first slice in her mouth and chewed furiously, cheeks bulging and stringy mozzarella hanging her from her lips like Spanish moss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The carbonated beverage helped her burp, cleared more room down in her stomach. Even though clearing twelve extra large loaded pizzas was much harder than she initially thought, just looking over at Dustin Castor, who stared at her stoically and silently with his nearly flawless face was enough to rekindle the vigor inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one pizza down, eleven more to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Two weeks later, ma was in Tunisia killing a man.\" Skye finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Lucile said in her usual tone, munching on some potato chips from a bag that came seemingly out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hey Lucile.\" Skye asked, her tone becoming more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah?\" Lucile's mouth as full of half-chewed chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have any idea why Ashlin's got such a vendetta against fat people? I never understood that about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin groaned as she was about halfway down her third pizza. It tasted good, of course! ANYTHING given to her by Dustin Castor personally couldn't NOT be the Fillet Mignon of it's grouping! Her stomach felt taut and began to bloat outward a while into her second pizza, making it look a lot like Lucile's big cocoa filled belly when they met earlier. Maybe she should reconsider. She thought to herself, as her gaze turned to Castor...and then to his belt area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waistline be damned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on what I learned in dabbling in psychology, Ashlin may be projecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye blinked. \"Projecting? What is she jealous of fat people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Lucile said as she crumpled her now empty chip bag and tossed it aside carelessly. \"I knew her before you did: She was always chubby in preschool up to...I wanna say second grade. Her parents...they were colder than dry ice. They wouldn't berate her, instead they'd just look and speak to her with this chilling, tranquil disappointment. Know why they're out and leaving their little girl by herself? Probably so they can fuck on a private Yacht off the coast of Wales or some shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye seemed surprised. Where, she didn't know where to begin. First was the fact Lucile seemed angry. It wouldn't be an understatement to say inside, she was even outright <i>pissed</i> by the notion of Ashlin's parents coming off as so neglectful. Second, for a moment it sounded like she pitied Ashlin. It seemed hypocritical with just what they were doing, but as far as Skye knew Lucile either thought putting Ashlin in a great enough stressful situation would help her somehow see not to let her parent's judgement control her life...or Lucile just didn't want to see Ashlin get off the hook without punishment for her usual stunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guhh...\" Ashlin groaned sickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix. Freaking. Pizzas. She was halfway and already, she felt like she hit a brick wall. Well, not so much hit as rammed into going from naught to 60. Lethargy reared it's head as Ashlin leaned back, her arms folded out along the back of her sofa. Her stomach stood out in front of her, swollen, taut and red, looking like a tight beachball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more...\" She groaned as she stifled a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastor walked over and gently placed a hand on Ashlin's cheek. He looked in her eyes, entrancing her and making her blush, then kissed her on her lips, which tasted of mozzarella and tomato sauce. Not that he would know as he was just a humanoid robot, but it was there. As if through sheer willpower, her stomach seemed to somehow compact the eaten pizza in her gut, kick her brain and metabolism in the ass AND give a middle finger right to the face of common sense as Ashlin suddenly began to plow through the seventh pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't care if I get fat. I don't care if my stomach explodes!</i> Ashlin yelled in her head. <i>Right now, all I care about is getting that Castor Oil inside me!</i><br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile sat back, reading Game of Thrones, her back against a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hasn't it been some time since we checked on Ashlin?\" Skye piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh? Oh yeah right.\" Lucile said, putting the book aside and placing a folded, small paper inside as a bookmark. She grabbed the control pad and leaned forward, looking down at the video display from Castor's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Lucile said aloud. \"I think we killed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT WHAT!?\" Skye yelled. Lucile moved Castor forward, revealing Ashlin's comically overstuffed gut as she laid back limply on the couch. The drone moved forward and checked her pulse. Lucile hit a button and the screen switched over to a heart monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, spoke too soon. She's alive.\" Lucile said calmly. \"She just passed out from all the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye let out a sigh of relief, running her hands through her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, thank Christ...\" She muttered to herself. Lucile, for some reason, shot Skye an annoyed look for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think now's as good a time to move out. We'll retire the Drone for now and see what we come up with next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap there's more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, LOT'S MORE.\" Lucile allowed a cheshire grin to form on her face, making Skye frown in discomfort seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin awoke like a smackhead who had just gone on a bender the night before. She was dizzy, disoriented, felt like vomiting, hated herself for reasons she didn't rightly know and there were pizza boxes scattered all over the place. She felt a discomfort in her stomach, as she rubbed at it, hoping that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach felt soft. And squishy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her T-shirt, Ashlin looked down at her stomach and gasped as she saw she now had a sizable, pudgy stomach. She reached back, feeling her \"curvy\" ass had gotten some extra cellulite added as well, giving it a soft and plush feeling to it. As she looked down at her belly, her breasts seemed slightly larger as well, likely also from the added fat. The one thing she wanted to see, Dustin Castor awaiting her with open arms (And possibly no pants) was gone. It felt like a dream, a very bad and disappointing dream. Unable to think of anything else to do, Ashlin threw her head in one of the couch pillows and SCREAMED.</span></div></div>",

Maybe if I were my baggiest sweater on Monday... and my baggiest jeans... and my baggiest...urggh... bra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up unsteadily, unbalanced like a late-game Jenga tower with fat and pizza slapped onto and in uncomfortable places, and stumbled to the bathroom.   After a process outside the scope of this narrative (but quite necessary when one has eaten a stack of pizzas bigger than R2-D2), she returned, feeling a lot less bloated but still much fatter than she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to exercise!  Really, really, hard.  Yeah, that's it...first I'll get rid of the junk in the room, and then I'll get rid of the junk in my trunk, before that creepy shitbag Lucile gets a chance at it.  That freaking fatty is just the kind of hypocrite who would make fun of other people's weights.\"  Ashlin picked up pizza boxes and discarded crusts and cheese particles as she talked.  Suddenly, she realized that one of the pizza boxes was not, in fact, a pizza box at all, but a pizza-box-sized heart made of pink satin and trimmed with lace, and tucked into the ribbon was a note, \"From your Dustin-poo\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped off the lid, revealing row upon row of chocolates nestled in formation like terra cotta soldiers, milk and dark, cream and caramel, dusted and topped and coconuted, knotted, polka-dotted, twisted, beaded, braided, powdered, flowered, and confettied, bangled, spangled, tangled, and spaghettied.   A tiny card was laid right on top of them, and, in delicated script, was written the words: \"Special chocolates that make you lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, that creepy shitbag Lucile was having a fucking field day.   \"Oh man, watch this!  She's totally going to eat them now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\" Skye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?  And she'll get even fatter!\"  Lucile giggled.   \"I'm going full Anna Nicole on this one!  What's that your grandpa always used to say?  'No half-measures'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Skye mused.  \"I wonder whatever happened to him?  My sister said he just said he totally ditched her at the park one day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, look, she's going for it!\"  Lucile shrieked happily, watching Ashlin pick up one of the chocolates.  \"She's going to eat it!  Welcome to Fatville, Ashlin!  Population: your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lucile,\" Skye sighed.  \"Not even Ashlin is THAT gullible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin tossed the chocolate into her mouth and chewed thoughtfully.  Hmm.  Key lime and peanut butter.  Interesting combination.  But if that was what it took to make her thin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed and looked down at her stomach.  Still sticking out.   She reached behind her and felt her butt.  Still felt like two pillows in a pair of jeans.  She cupped her boobs.  Eh, that part was okay.  But it was obvious that the chocolate hadn't fixed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still</i>, she told herself,<i> I didn't get any </i>fatter <i>just now, so at least I know they won't</i> hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she continued stuffing chocolate into her face as she cleaned up, hopeful that by Monday morning she would be back to her slender old self again.</span></div></div>",

She was now meatier than she had been before. She felt bloated but less in the \"Why did I eat so much freaking pizza\" sort of way and more of the \"I hate how fat I am\" sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plump stomach was too large to hide under a sweater, not to mention much too big for any of her shirts to fit her anymore. The thigh-high socks she decided to wear to school today looked closer to knee-high thanks to her thick, fat legs. She had to buy a new skirt to wear, a black non-descript looking one like you'd see on a corporate secretary, because she outgrew all those too and the ones that did fit her showed off her stretched out panties. Her breasts, even under her sweater and with the bra she had bought the other day, managed to jiggle ever so slightly if she moved too much due to their size and the extra fat stored inside. She had gone up to a large DD, maybe even a small E for all she knew! That part she didn't mind, but it didn't really matter when you looked so...meaty. To keep people from recognizing her for as long as possible, she wore her reddish-brown curly hair down when she preferred to tie it back and she wore a new pair of large, black framed sunglasses with dark brown shades over her hazel eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could imagine Lucile would have a blast, but at least their schedules were so drastically different, she could only have seen her during lunch, at which point Ashlin planned to hide herself in her car, drive about five minutes away and hope to god Lucile didn't wind up catching up to her. There's no way she'd let Lucile have any pleasure in mocking her if she could help it. She imagined Lucile's thin, long, creepy smile and her high-pitched, manic, super-villain laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...at least it can't get worse\" Ashlin said aloud to herself, taking a pause to hope she didn't jinx things. At least on the upside, she'd found an eraser by her desk during first period. She tended to lose things, but just as likely found new ones. She considered herself lucky like that and hoped that luck would be of some help in the days to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile scowled as she sat by her desk, listless as her history, Mr. Pius (who lived up to his name) teacher droned on. They'd already covered today's lecture on the Middle East so he was taking about the origins of Christianity around those parts, rambling about the origin of Lucifer and how he had become Satan (which, from his mouth, was MUCH less interesting than Lucile would have liked it to be). She wanted to get out there and grin and laugh at Ashlin after she'd eaten those chocolates. She felt proud that she'd not only had them made to suit Ashlin's tastes, but also dipped them in metabolic alteration drugs given to people who needed to achieve a healthier weight within a short timespan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile rapped her gloved fingers against the desk. She got some flak from certain individuals (especially Miss Tenenbaum, her Composition teacher) for dressing too much like a punk or \"not feminine enough.\" In order to play around with both parties, she made it a habit to show up to school dressed in a fine suit. Today, she wore one of her favorites; a double-breasted black suit with red vertical striped on it with matching slacks accompanied by fine white gloves and brown boots with steel-toes for decoration. She had gotten in trouble for these boots before, claiming the metal plating was far too thin to result in any further damage and would only be a threat if she was actually considering hurting any students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer record had at least been clean in the violence department so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile's body did have some new curves to it. Over the weekend, she decided to expand upon her original idea of gaining weight so she could better survive. After all, skinny and healthy were two different things. Her pudgy stomach appeared flat under her suit, but she had noticeable breasts. They were still small, but they were there and her behind, to her minor chagrin thanks to Ashlin's comment, had become a bit more round and full with more feminine looking hips. Lucile sighed dreamily as her mind drifted, watching clouds as she reminisced on the last time she did this. She saw a dog get emancipated in the grill of a huge truck. Everyone freaked out when she suddenly burst out laughed that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucile...Lucile!\" Mr. Pius called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does Lucifer's name translate to from how it's written in the Old Testament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The Morning Star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, so you ARE listening. I suppose that makes up for you seeming to lose your erasers on a constant basis.\" Pius teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile looked over as Mr. Pius took a sip of his coffee. It was then she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...augh, my coffee tastes a bit different. What, did the cream go bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way.\" Lucile grinned her trademark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sitting in desks near hers moved away out of fear she would suddenly disembowel them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever hear the saying 'who pissed in your coffee?' sir~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Mr. Pius groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worse~ Someone outright jacked off in your morning Joe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Pius ran out the door as he suddenly began to dry heave. The other students began to pipe up with raucous laughter and groans of disgust at the reveal as Lucile took this moment to saunter out of class.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nAshlin looked around as she moved on. It was almost lunch and no sign of Lucile. She just needed to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'uuup pig~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin froze in place, like her feet were trapped in stone. She wanted to run, just run for it and never look back! But, she felt held in place as the only movements she could make were to turn around and look as Lucile leaned against the wall, her head held low as the blond girl smiled scornfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hih hih hih~ Why do you look so scared? We're friends aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin could only scoff as Lucile cut her off before she could deliver her witty retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw no need to be cold around present company. After all, with that extra padding you should be plenty warm come winter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin's face flushed red as she pouted with an embarrassed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyahahahahah!! How's it feel to be the lard ass now huh?!\" Lucile cackled, clutching her side and her face as she was positively beside herself in laughter. \"Always throwin' around put downs like they were going out of style. Well how's it feel to be the lard ass now!? For your thighs to touch and your body to jiggle?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile cackled again. Ashlin felt like she would cry from just how embarrassed she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even in her cocoa-addled state, Lucile couldn't help but smile scornfully. She started chuckling to herself before breaking out into her high, hyena like laughter, almost sounding a touch wheezy at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyahahahah!! Oh suddenly <i>I'm</i> the freak now? You actually consider yourself normal in the least bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkye seemed rather surprised. As far as she knew, Lucile had been more prone to take the passive response, maybe at times respond with some tranquil fury, but she had NEVER seen Lucile outright mock or attack someone in any way before. She was either very tired of Ashlin's shit or she had been pushed right off the deep end and she wasn't particularly comfortable looking at that snake-like grin on Lucile's face along with the ominous look in her eyes. Ashlin just crossed her arms over her chest and scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh what are you even <i>talking</i> about you mass social reject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile's grin fell back to a faux polite smile as she looked up at Ashlin's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at the facts after all Ashy-dear. You maya been queen of shit mountain at school but what about aside from that? Up until a couple years back I had myself a kind, caring family that loved me, a well-adjusted home that featured a supporting environment and even then I STILL get support from distant relatives in the form of gifts and checks. True summa the gifts I just send back or pawn off but that's not the point. How could someone who's supposedly \"normal\" lecture me on being a normal person when all she does is bitch and moan about her life while her parents go off screwin' each other on private yachts or whatever. Not to mention screwin' you outta the love you think you deserve right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin winced, her facial expression beginning to become unstable. It was painfully obvious that Lucile had hit a very sensitive nerve and Skye didn't know what would come of it. Lucile merely laughed scornfully, bringing one hand up to her face and the other to her right side, which was admittedly in stitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hya hah hah hah! That's right the old 'Mommy and Daddy never loved me' Schitck! 'Mother...father why don't you love me...? Why do you ignore me?' Aww how cruel of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe politeness in Lucile's voice was obvious, thinly veiled mockery. Ashlin balled her hands into fists. Given what she'd seen Ashlin do to Lucile in the past, Skye was honestly at a loss as to weather she should stop Lucile or just keep staying out of it. Not to mention part of her was afraid of incurring Lucile's wrath upon her as well and being, essentially, mocked to the point where she was left at such loss and humiliation the aftermath looked as if she had been assaulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they have a reason why they don't love ya. Maybe they're too busy with their jobs and enjoying their own lives they just never gave a shit about you. Maybe they decided that you would be shit from the day you were born and basically threw you on the backburner for their list of priorities. All the guys you dated, all the 'friends' you had, they all didn't mean a damn thing. They just wanted to be friends with the rich girl who could make anything happen by bitchin' to mom and dad about it, who themselves couldn't care less if you'd died in a gas leak while they were gone!\" Lucile broke into a hyena-like fit of laughter again, which seemed crueler and more scornful that the last two bouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlin was in tears. Her face was red and her lips were trembling. Her eyes had quickly become red as she pitifully let a quiet whimper escape her lips. She only allowed herself to sob after she took off running, making sure she was as far from Lucile as she possibly could be before she make her pain fully plain to everyone. Skye stared in awe and even some terror at Lucile. All this time, she sat and took all the berating and bullying Ashlin put her through and when she finally had her chain pulled around enough, she sure bit back. She watched as Lucile, almost instantly, swapped from being a merciless, scornful psychological destroyer to the same oddball she usually was, poking her stuffed belly to make herself burp in quick succession to the tune of \"Gluttony Fang\" from BlazBlue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kinda not cool what you did there.\" Skye said after along silence on her end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucile looked up at Skye with her usual dull blue eyes, the shading on her face from her black beanie accentuating the dark circles under her eyes.</span></div></div>",
