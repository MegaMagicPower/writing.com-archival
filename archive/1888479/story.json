Jamie found nothing better to do on the first day of summer but sleep, he kept himself in the bed since the morning, objecting to joining Wendy for grocery shopping. James and Mary we're left home alone, as Carla left for her ballet practice just before they left. He decided to go back to the bed he has to share with his sister, and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Jamie woke up to the sound of giggling and bad smell. Jamie opened his eyes to see Carla laughing and a ballet slipper placed on his nose, he immediately gagged and threw the slipper off of his face. Carla laughing at the sight.<br>\r\n\"How long was that on there?\" He asked wiping his nose with his blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only smiled. \"Two hours.\" Carla said while leaving the room. Jamie sighed and changed into his normal clothes. He walked out of his shared room and walked downstairs, seeing his sister Wendy in her gym clothes, her feet resting on the coffee table, her gym socks not too far from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning sleepy head, I guess Carla woke you.\" Wendy said, stifling a giggle. She laughed at the expense of your sense of smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he answered simply. Wiping his nose in disgust at the recent memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least your dressed Cathy will be here any minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, where is Mary?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's outside on the swing set.\" Wendy said, pointing her can of soda outside. Jamie nodded and walked outside, and sure enough his sister was swinging on an old swing that was probably older than his parents. He made his way around the pool, and passed the garden. Mary waved to her brother and planted her feet firmly on the dirt, nearly stumbling on the ground. Jamie chuckled to himself as he helped his sister regain her balance. He couldn't help but notice that his sister kicked an anthill without knowing, he also noticed an ant climb around her sock, only to be crushed by her other foot that scratched her leg. Jamie felt a chill down his spine as he watched the ant die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's everything?\" Mary asked, Jamie just shrugged. Mary's connection with Jamie was able to tell her he was feeling odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help but feel something is off.\" James said quietly, Mary thought nothing of it and figured it was best to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cathy's here!\" They heard Carla yell out the back window, both twins ran up to the back door. They both scrambled to the front both eager to see Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, there was an accident in the highway and traffic was ins-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy!\" Mary screamed while diving towards the taller blonde. Catherine smiled and did her best to hold up the ten year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there short stuff.\" Catherine greeted happily, letting down the girl from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Catherine.\" Jamie greeted her almost formally, he was self conscious on the way she taunted them for being the youngest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's the smallest,\" she rubbed in. Wendy crouched down, but she managed to be slightly taller than him. Jamie groaned as she patted his head with a look of adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral Hours Later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie clutched his chest in pain, feeling something strange wash over him. He sat up in bed, stifling a scream so he drank the water he had on his bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie?\" Mary asked, she sat up next to him. Her chest burning with just as much pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mary?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My stomach hurts...\" Mary whined, reaching for her own glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine does too.\" Jamie added, he felt the pain slowly go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie woke up to the sound of thundering footsteps, he jolted upwards and looked up to the ceiling. Jamie noticed that the ceiling was farther then usual, he stood up and saw that the landscape went on for miles. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief and hoped to himself that it was just a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Jamie stood up and was thankful that his pajamas shrunk with him, even though he figured that his pajamas would provide little protection from the cold. He compared himself the the pillow and figured he was about half an inch tall. Panicked, the shrunken boy ran in the direction that his sister might have been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary! Mary, where are you?\" James shouted out loud, hoping that his sister was safe. He ran along the massive pillow, running faster than he was used to. Once he reached the end of his pillow... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In front of you to the right you could see that the door opened and in came your sister Carla, completely dwarfing the two of you in size. Her blonde hair was braided into a crown on her head and her fingernails had been painted blue like her eyes. She had on a light blue ballet dress with wide, fluffy tutu that stretched out so far that it looked like she was wearing a football stadium around her waist. For some reason reason she hadn\u2019t put her ballet slippers on but you were about to why. \u201cWhat\u2019s up nerds. It\u2019s time for you to smell my - where\u2019d you go? You look over to your sister and say \u201cI think we\u2019d better run under the covers and hide before she finds us.\u201d Mary nods her head vigorously. \u201cI agree.\u201d You both bolt it for the covers as Carla makes her way over to your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this would\u2019ve taken no time at all but the two of you were less than an inch in height so it felt like you were a mile away from safety under the blankets and Carla\u2019s booming footsteps were not helping your confidence. You looked up and found that Carla\u2019s head had already come over the bed. Luckily she was still having trouble finding you. Maybe you were small enough that she wouldn\u2019t notice you. You had almost made it to the blankets when you hear from up above you \u201cThere you two are!\u201d before Carla\u2019s enormous left hand slammed  down in front of you, blocking you exit. Before either of you had a chance to react Carla\u2019s other hand came in and scooped you up. You were brought up from the bed and when you gathered your senses you found the utterly frightening face of your sister Carla. She was giving you this smile that stretched from ear-to-ear yet covered the width of your peripheral vision. She made sure to show her pearly whites in a very shark-like fashion as her deep blue eyes drilled into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, what do we have here? I have both of you shrunken, at the same time, in the palm of my hand, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. This is too perfect! It seems that sneaking my shrinking formula into your dinner last night worked as well as had hoped, although it seems to have had more of an effect on you Jamie.\u201d It was true. While both of them were less than an inch, you came in below Mary\u2019s shoulders. You had no idea how Mary\u2019s height had escaped you. \u201cIn any case, right now is the perfect time to play a game with you before I shove you in my slippers. I\u2019m going to chase the two of you around the house and attempt stomp on you with my feet. But since I\u2019m so sweet I\u2019m going to give you a head start. I\u2019ll place you by the doorway and then I\u2019ll walk back here to the edge of the room to give you plenty of room so that I don\u2019t squash you early. After that you have until the count of Ten to run as fast as you can but I don\u2019t expect you to make it very far considering how well you did earlier. Alright, don\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness, that would be a BIG mistake and don\u2019t have too much fun down there \u201clittle\u201d siblings. Sister Carla\u2019s about to get you!\u201d Carla began walking over to the doorway, paying no attention the unsteady surface that was her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hand down to the wood panel flooring and signalled for the two of you to jump off. Looking behind, you could see Carla\u2019s bare feet. Her toes looked like cars with blue toenail polish. She veins on the tops of her feet, obviously from the many hours of practice strengthening them, except that they looked more like tree trunks. Looking up was your sister rising up to her full height, her upper body blocked out by her cloud-length tutu. All you could see was her pale calves and thighs. Looking at her legs was like looking at two washington monuments, with the sun\u2019s rays coming through her tutu giving them a bright pink canopy. Carla then began to turn around and headed to the edge of the room, giving you a view of her dirty soles. She probably didn\u2019t notice the dirt but to you it seemed like she went jogging barefoot in the forest before she came here, which come to think of it, she probably did just to torture you and Mary more with her dirty, smelly, feet. Before you knew it she had turned back around and said \u201chere we go, Ten\u2026\u201d Crap, it was go time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you sprinted out into the hall and found to your dismay there was no hiding places in sight, just miles of hallway. \u201cNine...\u201d The situation felt hopeless but there was no point in turning back now. \u201cEight...\u201d Maybe you could find help from Catherine. \u201cSeven\u2026\u201d No, she was probably still sleeping. \u201cSix\u2026\u201d Perhaps Wendy was wondering where you everyone was and could be looking for you because of her early bird tendencies. \u201cFive\u2026\u201d Although you had no idea when she would come around here. \u201cFour\u2026\u201d If that one hole in the floorboards was still here in the hallway it could be your safe zone. \u201cThree\u2026\u201d Then again, you were pretty sure that was in some other part of the house. \u201cTwo\u2026\u201d Plus, you were pretty sure that the hole had already been patched up. \u201cOne. Ready or not here I come!\u201d You had to keep running, maybe something else would come up. You could feel Carla\u2019s steps ,like earthquakes coming toward you. You decided to look behind you to see how far she was behind you. Bad idea. You found that you where you had barely covered any ground at all, Carla was gaining on you fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFee fi fo fum, I\u2019m the giantess here I come.\u201d You were screaming internally as you saw your sister, smile plastered on her face, coming toward you. You stared ahead, best not to look back again. Suddenly, the ground beneath you started to look pinker. Oh no, that was the sun\u2019s way of trying to tell you to watch out. Out of nowhere BOOM! Her foot stomped the floor to you left and then again to your right. \u201cDangit, it\u2019s so hard to see you tinies with my tutu in the way.\u201d Carla kept repeatedly missing, your heart rate jumping up each time, until she didn\u2019t. You look behind you and see mary trapped between the big and second toe of Carla\u2019s right foot with her lower body underneath the rest of her foot. \u201cYes, got you! Now it\u2019s time to see my prize.\u201d You ran back and tried to pull Mary from Sarah\u2019s foot but she was pinned. You felt two forces pinch on your sides and lift you up. You launched 500 feet (to yoy) into the air in two seconds. You felt sick. After opening your eyes you see Carla, happier than ever. \u201cYay! That was fun! We should do this more often. Sadly, the game must end but luckily your time with my feet has just begun. Hope you like Ballet!\u201d Carla started walking, you between her fingers and Mary clenched between toes. Clara turned the corner and saw:</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, her fingers tilted a little far, and her hand-ramp was too steep to walk down.

Jamie grabbed his sister and blocked her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Mary! Just shut up. We can get through this.\" Jamie said quickly trying to think up of a plan. Mary calmed down before pushing up against the massive wall of pancakes. Jamie took a bite of the pancake, after a second he began munching on the flapjack. He signaled for Mary to do the same, the two finally ate enough to stop themselves suffocating, but both kids were still trapped underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Wendy,\" the blonde woman thanked her sister. She wasted no time before digging into the stack of pancakes. Catherine ate the first one fairly quickly, she stopped to take a quick swig of a cup of milk that her younger sister poured for her. Catherine eyed the syrup bottle, it was nearly full the brim and Catherine loved to drown her pancakes in syrup, much to the annoyance of Wendy. The golden brown syrup oozed onto the stack of pancakes slowly flowing towards the small crevice where Catherine's younger brother and sister were trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Jamie groaned to themselves as the syrup slowly stuck to them, the sticky liquid soaked them from head to toe, getting into their hair and mouth. The twins panicked and tried to swallow as much as they could, most of it was too hard to swallow so the spit it out in a separate direction. Every minute or so they could feel the weight pressed up upon them lessen as Catherine devours another pancake.Mary and Jamie listened to the small talk that Wendy and Catherine had, both hoping that Wendy would mention the stature of the two of them. It wasn't long before Catherine got to the last of the four pancakes she ate this one slower than the others making sure to savor each piece that she had cut, sucking off all the syrup that had soaked to last pancake. She had gone to the last few pieces before skewering her fork into the piece that had imprisoned Mary and Jamie.</span></div></div>",

Typically, Catherine and Mary would get start at each other, Catherine convinced that Mary was a spoiled, bratty little girl, (which she could be), and Mary screaming back about how Catherine was a bossy, big mouth.  Carla would jump in next, defending her big sister's bossiness, simply because she was older and 'wiser'.  She also liked to earn as many brownie point with Catherine as possible.  Mary, feeling overwhelmed would back down some, before Wendy came to her aide, not taking sides, but fending off Catherine and Carla's attack on the now crying 10-Year-Old.  Jamie usually saw this coming a mile away, and would hide in his room with a book until the screaming stopped, either by parent, or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary would never call Catherine 'big mouth' again, Even if she did survive this predicament, in association with Catherine's mouth being anything other than small and appropriate for her face would likely send Mary curling into fetal position.  That is, *if* she survived this predicament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things were not looking good for the tiny twins.  Initially, buried under the pancake, they clung to each other out of fear.  Now, being lifted away from the plate and into the air, the only thing holding them was the syrup. It prevented them from plummeting back down to the cold, hard table, but was also preventing them from avoiding a very dark, painful death in their sister's mouth, or worse, stomach.  As the fork holding the pancake they were stuck to moved closer to Catherine's mouth, the realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no no...Jamie!  You're...youre slipping!\"  Mary gasped, watching Jamie, who had previously been at eye-level with her, now slowly fell to waist height.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, grab me!\"  Jamie said, reaching to grab his sister's leg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't grab me!  This could be your chance to get away!\"  She cried, tears beginning to stream down her face.  \"Save yourself, Jamie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere with you!\"  As he replied, he realized that they'd been hovering in the air for nearly thirty seconds now, more than enough time for them to have been eaten already.  Turning his syrup-covered head, Jamie looked out towards Catherine, whose lips were only a fork's length away.  <i>'Why hasn't she eaten us yet?</i> He wondered, before finally seeing the reason, she was still chewing the last bite!  Catherine's soft, pouty lips scrunched and stretched and contorted in and out of shape quickly, as her jaw lowered and raised to chew the previous victim of her appetite.  It was surreal, they'd seen Catherine eat dozens of meals, hundreds even.  She came home every weekend from college, every break and holiday, and even randomly during the week.  But never before had Mary and Jamie gotten such a look at the process of her chewing.  They could even hear the sound of the pancake mush being mulled around and chewed into a thick, sticky bolus for the gigantic blonde to swallow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened, the fork moved away, just barely, from those huge lips.  Had they been saved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cath', here's some OJ!  Don't choke on those pancakes, the way you're going through them, they must be good!\"  Wendy giggled, setting the orange juice down next to Catherine's plate.  In response, Catherine swallowed her mouthful, and held back a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yeah...they're amazing, Wendy!\"  Wendy blushed some, setting her coffee down on the table next to the glass of juice, to do a little curtsey in thanks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me get you a few more!\"  Stepping back over to the plastic container holding the warm pancakes, the sixteen year old beamed at getting her sister's approval, without some sort of mean-spirited joke behind it.  At least not yet.  \"Just save some for Carla and the twins...you know how grumpy Mary gets without breakfast.\"  Mary, at the moment, was decidedly finished eating breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the shrunken twins on Catherine's pancake were not sure if they were overjoyed or washed with fear.  After hearing that thick mouthful of pancake that used to be the sky of their world plummet down their sister's throat, they knew that going there behind it would mean death.  Even worse, Catherine's mouth opened, and poured a syrupy sweet torrent of warm breath over them.  Even slightly farther away from the mouth than they were a moment ago, the mouth was entirely too large to behold, and now they were watching it in action, while Catherine talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did they have that to deal with, but that binding syrup has lost some of it's sticky integrity, and now both twins were sliding down the flat surface of the pancake.  Still hovering in front of Catherine's lips, they knew that they only had precious seconds before they fell off of the pancake, or were delivered in the deep, dark, humid cave of their sister's mouth.</span></div></div>",

Ultimately, she was not given the option, as Catherine could no longer wait for the next bite.  Without any further hesitation, Mary was whisked away back to Catherine's mouth, and shoved inside, her sister's lips closing over the spoon and locking her inside behind those pearly white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie, in free fall, had only a few seconds to look down and see just where he was going to land.  Due to Catherine pulling her hand toward her mouth just as he fell, the shrunken ten-year-old did not simply fall, but was tossed into the air a few inches away from his original destination.  And what was only a few inches away from the plate he would have landed on?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine and Wendy's drinks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's coffee was still warm, but no longer scalding.

Immediately everything turned into chaos as Catherine began to chew her mouthful, unaware that her tiny little sister was amongst the churning mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary watched her life flash before her eyes as her fragile body was shoved back and forth and spun all around. The pancake and syrup mixed with Catherine's broiling saliva to create a gooey sludge that buried her alive. With each pass around, Mary wondered if it would be the one that would send her underneath an unyielding molar and crush her. Her prison was pitch black, save for the brief flashes of the outside world that she would get when Catherine's lips smacked open. Whatever fun she thought this whole shrinking thing could be was now forever stricken from her mind. Even if she survived this ordeal, the poor girl would be scarred for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thick slurp and a jarring motion of the pulsating tongue beneath her, Mary yelped as she felt her body shoved forward into an unforgiving crevice. The pressure increased yet again and she cried out in pain as she was forced forward even further into a tight squeeze between two extremely thick structures. A wave of saliva washed over the poor girl and threatened to drown her. Coughing and sputtering, Mary had to summon all the strength in her body not to vomit. Where was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living cave Mary was trapped in rumbled deeply. She cried as the booming sound of her sister's voice reverberated all throughout her prison. Not too long after, the tremendous lips began to part flooding everything with light. Now, Mary could see just where she was trapped-- between two of Catherine's front teeth. She could also see a giant glass of orange juice drawing near!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tidal wave of beverage roared through the passage with such force that it nearly ripped Mary from her little alcove and down the unending tunnel of the throat beyond. The citrus stung her eyes so bad she couldn't help but weep. Why was this happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to make things worse, Catherine's slithering tongue began sliding and rubbing against the ten-year-old, trying to pry her loose. Catherine thought she was a piece of food stuck between her teeth! Whimpering, Mary crawled deeper between the two teeth and held on best she could. Not too long later, the tongue receded, but then the lips parted again and Mary was made aware of her next foe, her sister's giant pinky nail!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine jammed her pinky between her bottom teeth, trying to pry the small piece of food from within. The nail easily slid between the two masses and struck Mary hard, forcing her backward. Sobbing, she tried to hold on between the teeth by stretching her arms, but before long she felt the tip of the loathsome tongue pressing on her back, trying to scoop her out. Soon the finger withdrew and the lips sealed shut and the pressure increased to the worst level yet as Catherine began sucking on her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakened and about to give up, Mary wondered what would happen to her if she did end up in Catherine's stomach. Would she be dissolved instantly? Or would it be a long painful process? She tried to recall what she learned about digestion in school, but her mind was drawing a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, an annoyed Catherine...</span></div></div>",

He remembered how she sat on his  back before he woke up yesterday, how she sat on Mary's lap when they were watching tv, and how she farted on Mary while she sat on her face. He really hoped Clara would have the decency to not fart on them now. His hopes were crushed when he heard a gurgling sound. Clara...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her tongue bucked underneath the twins and quickly tilted itself upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny twins tried to throw themselves onto Catherine's uvula, but the dangly bag was coated in mucus. They were unable to keep hold, and soon a smelly, unladylike belch was the only thing slowing their plummet down her throat and into the rancid abyss that is Catherine's digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"clgreen\">*buuuURRRRRAAAAAaap!*</span></b> Damn, that felt good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than satisfied with breakfast, Catherine lumbered to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they were barely a quarter-inch tall, Catherine's esophagus didn't even register the twins' presence. They simply fell and fell until they landed on a squishy, yet firm formation that makes up Catherine's lower esophageal sphincter. Poor Jamie and Mary couldn't do anything but wait until the rest of the syrupy mush above meets them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pancake and shrunken human mixture were forcefully squeezed through the sphincter and crash-landed in the dark, musty cesspool below.

From making Catherine burp them out to going out...the back door (both Jamie and Mary shuddered at the mere thought), they had a few paths to pick from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have to act fast though, as Catherine's stomach acid is pouring in very rapidly. Their only hope besides escape is that their big sister's even bigger metabolism is kind enough to spare them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine rubbed her belly as it continued to work down the pancakes.

Catherine, both confused and a little freaked out, tried to figure out what her younger sister was looking at. <br>\r\n\"Uh, Wendy, Who are you talking to?\" Catherine asked. Realizing how crazy she might have looked, Wendy glanced at her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I say this?\" Wendy quickly asked herself. She found it hard putting it into the correct words while making sense. Then again, nothing about the situation seemed to make any sense; she held her youngest siblings in her her hands and still had no idea on how to explain it. With a long sigh, Wendy simply said, \"see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy swiftly scooped up Mary and Jamie in her pale, fleshy hand and brought it to her blonde sister. The shrunken twins lost their balance and rolled over each other, bumping their heads together with each shake. When they recovered, they were greeted by a large pair of blue eyes that belonged to their oldest sister, Catherine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello, Cathy,\" said Jamie nonchalantly, waving his arm slowly. Mary added her own greeting in a much more enthusiastic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi...\" Catherine trailed off, her eyes wide open. She waved a finger at them. \"Wha- I don't even... What?\" Catherine brought her index finger up to the children, poking them softly; Mary let herself tumble over with a giggle while Jamie fought back with his little strength. \"What happened to you two?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered with a simple shrug of the shoulders from Jamie. \"We just woke up like this, Cathy.\" Mary's answer was just as ambiguous, leaving Catherine a little annoyed. Catherine kept her mouth wide open in shock, giving them an unsettling view of her open mouth. Small strands of saliva hung from the roof of the mouth, and giant white boulders of teeth jutted from the pink ceiling; the sight scared the twins, and they backed away in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine caught the twins' discomfort and brought a hand up to her mouth to hide the massive cave, and they finally began to approach their sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, noticing the pancakes almost burning, unceremoniously dumped her siblings into Catherine's palm, and the the twins found themselves plummeting towards the ground. Fortunately, Catherine reacted quickly and caught the two, preventing an accidental death. Instead of air resistance, Mary and Jamie suddenly felt another soft surface, accompanied by a soft, strawberry scent. Another audible laugh came from above; it wasn't mocking or even playful. Her voice seemed coddling, like someone would treat a baby or a small animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are so cute like this. I could just eat you two up,\" she cooed while making an exaggerated kissing motion. Moving her palm and the tiny twins closer to her  massive mouth and puckered her lips. Catherine's obvious poor choice of words had caused the twins (mostly Jamie) to beg for her to stop. Catherine tilted her hand at a steep incline, and the twins began to fall towards their sister's large lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing slightly, Mary and Jamie found it hard to stand up; their attempts to stand up ruined by the slight tremors caused y the small, unnoticeable movements of their sister. And seconds later, a fleshy pink snake slid out of the two soft pieces of skin. Jamie, being the unlucky twin, was swept up by the viscous saliva, prompting the boy to scream in surprise. Mary watched from the upper lip with the same look of shock. Extending her hand, Mary tried to grab her brother and pull him to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie!\" Mary screamed, \" grab my hand!\" Upon hearing the instruction, Jamie reached out for his sister's waiting hand. He waved his hand blindly, sapping his strength and motivation by the second. He let out a sigh of relief as he felt Mary's hand make contact with his, and both siblings gripped tightly, nearly hurting each other's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere small victory was short lived as a huge gust of wind followed by a tidal wave's worth of spit hit them. They kept their tight grip, though. To their giant sister Catherine, it didn't seem like she put them through much harm. It was a simple breath and an unnoticeable amount of spit to her, but to the shrunken kids, a hurricane and tsunami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, gross.\" Jamie complained while wiping away his older sister's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we smell like your breath!\" yelled Mary. She twisted her locks of brown hair, trying to remove all traces of her oldest sister's spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what you have done, Cath. Now they smell like pizza and potato chips.\" Wendy teased, pointing out Catherine's unhealthy eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually not a bad thing to smell like, in my opinion.\" Catherine joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy, you're home!\" Carla beamed, entering the room with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Carls.\" Catherine greeted, adding a nickname that never failed to annoy Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat,\" Carla replied bitterly. Her counter was ineffective at being insulting and only served to make Catherine's joke more annoying, and Catherine found that completely adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love ya too.\" Catherine teased, \"how's the food going?\" The conversation quickly shifted from playful jokes to food. Wendy simply dumped a small pile of pancakes on Catherine's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat,\" Wendy answered plainly. The red head made her way around the table, dropping  the breakfast foods on her siblings plate. With the final two, Wendy placed both on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, Jamie? Where are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here!\" their voices rang. Wendy glanced downwards and saw the twins pinned by the pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops.\" Wendy said with a chuckle, lifting up the pancake from the twins.</span></div></div>",

The two continued to scream and plead for their lives until Wendy finally looked down to see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shi-crap!\" Wendy quickly changed the word, realizing what she was about to say in front of two impressionable children, although it was the least of her problems since she did almost eat her siblings without knowing it. \"I didn't see you there.\" Her voice both sheepish and ashamed, she was still glad that she didn't eat her siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy tried to hide what almost happened by grabbing the twins and acting like nothing happened, but Catherine and Carla caught on  easily. \"Did you just?' Carla asked and stopped just before starting a laughing fit, and Catherine later joined in as well.

Wendy swiftly moved towards her messenger bag, forcing in the emptied out contents and the twins. The red head left the room and shouted, \"I'm taking your car by the way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly angry Catherine yelled, \"take the bus, freeloader!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late,\" a muffled voice came from outside, Carla chuckled a little before receiving an angry glance from her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the twins?\" Catherine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I saw them, they were in Wendy's hand...\" Carla answered her voice slowing down in realization, \"and she shoved them into her bag.

They bounced along with Wendy's steps, and they felt each rise and fall in a rhythm like pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bridgette.\" Wendy greeted casually, and a brunette girl with shoulder length hair waved in response. Jaime's ears perked up at the call of her name. She was probably one of the only people to prefer him over Mart and her overall optimism. Plus, she shared the same interest in comic books as Jamie did, causing the boy to develop an innocent crush for her. He would occasionally look at her and study her features ranging from he tan skin to her hazel eyes. \"I want to show you something.\" Wendy then put her hand into her shirt's pocket and fished out two disoriented children.<br>\r\n\"Is that?\" Bridgette asked, putting a hand to her mouth in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's who you think they are.\" Wendy confirmed, placing them onto the counter top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to them? When did this happen? Are they stuck like this?\" Bridgette began to ask a series of question which Wendy didn't have a correct answer for most of them. <br>\r\n\"They're okay as far as I know.\" Wendy finally answered.<br>\r\n\"Hi Bridgette!\" Mary chimed, finally recovering from her slight dizziness.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" the girl waved awkwardly to the little girl, not knowing how to respond properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Jamie! I know what to do.\" Mary looked overnto her twin brother and shook him as a way to snap some sense into him.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jamie asked, wondering what ideas his sister had.<br>\r\n\"Let's build a book-fort!\" Mary shouted, running to a nearby pile of books.<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\"</span></div></div>",

A little to the right, a little more, okay!\" She smiled lightly as her brother, nearly doing most of the grunt work, panted heavily. Mary stepped backwards eyeing her architectural achievement, but instead she was greeted by books scattered sloppily on their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need Wendy's help if we're going to get anything done.\" Jamie stated blandly. Mary simply nodded in assent as the two made their way across the massive counter to the corner, where Wendy and her coworker Bridgette were conversing about their favorite shows, books, et cetera. Wendy was bent over the counter, balancing on her forearms as she leaned forward to show interest in her friend's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking charge, Jamie knocked against his giant sister's arms, hoping to get her attention, but his attempts only worked when Mary contributed to catching Wendy's focus. Feeling a slight, rhythmic tapping on her side, Wendy turned to see the shrunken duo waving up to her. She carefully lifted them up and brought them closer to her and Bridgette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" <br>\r\n\"We kind of need help with our fort,\" answered Mary, pointing to the scattered books on the counter.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I can definitely help out with that,\" she said as she walked towards the fort, here two strides reaching the books, which took the twins five minutes to traverse on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, with help from Bridgette and small contributions from Jamie and Mary, set up a small, castle-like structure as it was an empty rectangle with book spires on the four corners. From Wendy's view it was a simple building, but to the twins, it was a large room with many illustrated covers surrounding them like the finest paintings one would display in their homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for the finishing touches,\" Wendy said while reaching into her pockets. The redhead pulled out her slim phone and unlocked it, placing it in against the wall. The giant sister selected an animated movie, and let it play for the twins to be entertained.

Both girls sat on the counter, talking to each other and working the register whenever a customer came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jamie. Be cool,\" he said to himself, walking towards the titanic girls not too far from him. Jamie walked up to Bridgette's generous rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgette, noticing the tiny boy by her thigh, reached over and grabbed the boy between her index finger and her thumb. She giggled as she dropped him onto her fleshy palm. \"Hey, cutie,\" she cooed as he landed with a soft thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Jamie's hard landing left him with a sprained ankle and a bruise or two, he found himself ignoring the pain and focusing on the massive woman that toyed with him and called him 'cutie.' He rationalized to himself that being manhandled by a giant girl wasn't even that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was actually enjoying it. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept staring up at the Bridgette's beautiful face mesmerized by her soft, pursed lips. Stop it, Jamie. You're being creepy, he thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, bud?\" Bridgette asked, looking at the unresponsive kid in her palm. He kept silent, unable to speak to the radiant giant that held him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what, oh yeah I'm fine.\" Jamie stumbled over his words, feeling nervous about the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better be more alert, or else I might eat ya.\" Bridgette teased, brandishing her shining white teeth and sticking her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're scaring him, Bridge.\" Wendy said teasingly, lightly shoving her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he doesn't mind,\" Bridgette commented, tapping the tiny boy's chin with her index finger. \"Right, little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\"Jamie droned, while awkwardly nodding his head with vigor as there was a  certain appeal to being called 'little man' . He was still staring at Bridgette's lips, completely caught in the thought of being eaten. He began to blush and smiled dopily as he realized he didn't actually hate the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jamie felt a bit weird about himself as the thought of being in Bridgette's mouth registered itself again in his head. He imagined himself being tossed around her hot, humid mouth by her powerful tongue. The entire reverie left him feeling... tingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you he's fine with it. I'm just teasing.\" Bridgette defended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hand him over,\" Wendy ordered, feeling uncomfortable with the way Bridgette was recklessly toying with her tiny brother. The brunette only smiled sweetly as she practically dumped the tiny boy into the giant ginger's pale palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched the tiny boy lift himself up with some struggle and looked as he immediately grabbed her attention with his slight limp. She nearly clenched her fist, but quickly stopped the motion as she realized she was still holding her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bridge,\" Wendy chimed, \"Why don't you go help, Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The librarian? You know she just camps out here and never buys anything.\" Bridgette protested, sliding off the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you can get her to buy something and win that bet we had going.\" Wendy answered, \"You get yo really stick it to Janine and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you convinced me.\" Bridgette  said, feeling motivated enough to take on anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bridgette nearly sashed away, Wendy turned her attention to her tiny brother. \"Are you okay? You look a little hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie faked a smile as he uttered some generic words stating his well being, although in truth he had a sprained ankle and a bruised leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she accidentally hurts you, don't be afraid to say anything. Okay, Jamie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie only nodded, keeping his words selective as he felt a bit defensive over liking being toyed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later and it was near closing time as Wendy stepped off to the bathroom, leaving the twins unattended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary spent the entire day reading certain comic books involving the likes of Ant-Man and the Atom, hoping to get any clue to either getting big again or exploiting their small size. And now Bridgette was off helping some person buy a box set of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie walked around the edge of the cashier's counter, biding his time and waiting for closing time. He straddled along until he noticed an open bag which belonged to his crush, Bridgette. He weighed his odds, although his math was severely clouded by his infatuation with the brunette.</span></div></div>",

A little chuckle escaped Wendy's lips at the thought of her shrunken siblings devouring a small carton of fried potatoes. She curled the twins back into her palm as she walked over to a stall and asked for an order of fries. After paying and recieving her food, she scouted for a table.

The other girl looked up from her meal and awkwardly waved back. She was sitting in a four-person booth, but had bags covering most of the surface of the table.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Sarah,\" called Wendy, \"mind if we sit with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Sarah replied, gesturing to the seat next to her, \"but who else is with you? And what's in your hand?\"<br>\r\n\"To answer both you questions: my little brother and sister, Jaime and Mary. Jaime, Mary, this is Sarah. She works with me at the bookstore.\"Wendy lowered her hand to the table so everyone could meet. While Mary hopped around excitedly, Jaime stared up at the giant girl who was now observing them. Sarah had to be at least 17 years old, with wide-rimmed glasses and a fair complexion. Her dark brown hair was twisted into two tails that draped down her skinny shoulders. In her hands was a book which had a title Jaime didn't understand, and on the table was a carton of fries she had apparently been nibbling at while reading. She certainly fit the stereotype of a bookworm, but Jaime found himself staring longer than he should have.<br>\r\n\"You weren't joking when you said little,\" Sarah noted, \"how did they end up like this?\"<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but aren't they just adorable?\" Wendy responded. Sarah let out a sigh of warm air that nearly knocked the twins over. Clearly Wendy wasn't taking the situation very seriously.<br>\r\nMary had taken to eating the fries that Wendy had since placed on the table next to Sarah's, showing her lack of interest in this new person and instead her desire to eat. Jaime was tempted to join her, but Sarah turned her attention back to him.<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what happened?\" she asked as she extended a finger for him to step onto. He climbed aboard and was lifted closer to her face as the warm breathe from her nostrils rushed over Jaime.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" he stated. \"Both of us had really bad stomach aches, then fainted and woke up with Wendy's giant face looking at us.\"<br>\r\n\"Stomach aches?\" repeated Sarah, \"that's weird. I think I have a book about something like that.\" She went searching through her bags, which all held books, until she found the one she was looking for.<br>\r\n\"'Gulliver's New Travels.' It's an updated version of the classic tale we've been assigned as summer reading, and one of the things that happens in this story is the hero, Gulliver, gets really bad stomach aches right before changing size.\" It seemed a bit far-fetched to Jaime, but he figured it was worth a shot. Sarah opened the book and began to read to herself. Wendy, knowing how focused her friend could be, motioned to Jaime to excuse herself and went to find something to eat.<br>\r\n<i>Why would we be living like a storybook character?</i> Jaime thought, as he wandered back to the fries his sister was munching through. He shook his head in disbelief at the thought of such bizarre circumstances behind his situation. <i>It's just so... weird.</i> A shadow moved over him as Sarah's hand reached absently for a fry. He watched as it descended into the carton Wendy had bought for the twins and pulled out the fry Mary was attempting to eat.<br>\r\n\"Mary!\" Jaime yelled, hoping his sister would figure out what to do. He ran back to Sarah in an attempt to stop her, as he watched Mary...</span></div></div>",

Jaime was relieved, partly because his sister was safe, but also because the incedent wasn't nearly as traumatic for either of them as it could have been.<br>\r\nSarah picked up the tiny girl by the back of her shirt while Mary giggled uncontrollably. Clearly the girl wasn't afraid of heights, or the prospect of digestion. The giant brunette moved most of the fries from her carton to the other and put Mary in with the smaller of the two amounts.<br>\r\n\"Since I know you're not going to be able to eat all those fries, we'll just switch,\" Sarah explained. \"And this way I won't make the same mistake twice.\" She grabbed a fry to demonstrate and nonchalantly tossed it into her mouth. \"See?\"<br>\r\nSarah went back to reading her book while Mary resumed eating fries. Jaime, on the other hand, took a moment to contemplate what had almost happened. <i>How do you live with yourself after you watch your sister get eaten alive?</i> Appetite gone, he simply sat on Sarah's previous book and kept watch over his sister. Not a minute later Wendy returned empty handed.<br>\r\n\"Man, they said I have to wait another ten minutes until my food's ready,\" she complained, \"so I'm just gonna wait here until then.\" Recieving no response, she picked up Sarah's original carton of fries, sending Mary flying to the back. Wendy peered inside and dumped the contents into her mouth before Jaime could say anything.<br>\r\n\"Wendy, stop!\" he yelled at the top of his lungs, to no avail. He watched his big sister grind up the contents of the carton inside her mouth and swallow them without so much a thought.<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind, but I ate the rest of your fries,\" she told Sarah. \"I'm just so hungry, I need something to hold me over until my food's ready.\"<br>\r\n\"That's fine, just be sure to take the one with more fries,\" Sarah responed, finally looking up from her book. \"The twins... are...\" She couldn't finish her sentence, as she watched Wendy pour the rest pf the fries into her open mouth and chew them without regard.<br>\r\n\"Are what?\" Wendy asked before swallowing, still not aware of what she had done. \"Jaime's right there, and Mary should be...\" She turned the other carton and expected to see Mary sitting on top of a fry, munching away. But it dawned on her why the other two had gone silent. Tears formed in her eyes, as her hands moved to her belly. \"Oh my god. I'm gonna be sick,\" she cried quietly.</span></div></div>",

The only problem is she might not know what to do.\"<br>\r\n\"How can we tell her?\" questioned Jaime, \"I don't think she can hear us from out here.\"<br>\r\n\"If you go in with the string tied around your waist we can get her out.\"<br>\r\n\"Why can't I just throw her up?\" Wendy asked, still tear stricken, yet hopeful as they continued to move to the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"And what about the stomach acids?\" contributed Jaime.<br>\r\n\"it's very likely she wouldn't come up if you tried to vomit, and if she did it would be extremely messy and difficult to find her,\" Sarah explained. \"As for the acids, Jaime, digestion is more of a mechanical process. You're not gonna get dissolved or anything, like in cartoons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio made it into the single-person women's bathroom. Sarah locked the door and had Wendy sit down on the toilet. She then picked up Jaime and tied the string tightly around his waist while explaining what he should do.<br>\r\n\"When you're in there, it's going to be loud, dark, and probably smelly. You're also gonna get knocked down a lot because her stomach's gonna try to digest those fries Wendy ate earlier.

She was too small for your tongue to detect her and push her towards the teeth.\" Sarah finished tying the makeshift harness and sat Wendy down to prepare for the decent. \"Oh, and Jaime. If you start to feel itchy or burny that's just... a food allergy. Ignore it, and you'll be fine, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jaime replied nervously. He feared for a lot of things, and that was just one more thing to fear.<br>\r\n\"You have ten minutes, okay? I won't pull you out any sooner or later, so once you find her hug her tight and <b>don't let go.</b>\" Jaime nodded, ready to save his sister.<br>\r\nA tug was felt around his waist as Sarah hoisted him up to put him into Wendy's mouth. As he hung over her freckled face, he saw the tears in the corners of Wendy's eyes.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll find her,\" Jaime said with brotherly affection. More tears welled up in Wendy's eyes, but they were quickly wiped away by her soft hand.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she replied, opening her mouth for Jaime's journey.</span></div></div>",

He looked back up at Wendy's swollen red eyes, remembering exactly why he was doing this in the first place. Jamie took it upon himself to be the strong one for now, since he kinda needed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly screamed as he was lowered towards Wendy's waiting mouth, but he held his screech in, knowing it would only panic his sister forward. He let out a warm smile to try and reassure his giant sibling and more importantly himself. Wendy's lips parted and showed the tiny Jamie the moist, dark cavern of saliva. He wondered about his twin sister, and how scared she must have been while inside of Wendy's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tug the string twice, and I'll lift you back up, okay?\" Sarah asked, making it clear to the tiny boy of his next step. Jamie only nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie was lowered even more as he came into contact with the humid air. He could smell the french fries that Wendy had eaten earlier, and he was relieved to see there were no signs of a chewed up person anywhere in Wendy's mouth. He was hanging directly above the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Wendy?\" Sarah chimed. \"You kinda have to swallow him.\" Wendy nodded while making a groaning sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt strong, oppressive muscles grip him as he was pulled downwards. The throat muscles contracted and expanded around him, pushing he tiny boy to the darkest depths of Wendy's innards. After a long few seconds, Jamie found himself inside Wendy's stomach and plummeting down to the acids below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary!?\" he shouted. There was no response. He called her name again, still no response. \"Mary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polo!\" A childish voice giggled. Jamie rolled his eyes at the ridiculousness of the situation. The two twins sloshed against the stomach acid, feeling no pain from the liquid much to his surprise. He was elated that Sarah was right in the sense that they weren't instantly dissolved. The two messily hugged each other, completely ignoring the contents of Wendy's stomach around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you the least bit freaked out?\" Jamie asked, almost entirely confused on why Mary wasn't breaking down.<br>\r\n\"I was,\" she answered quietly. \" But now you're here to save me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Jamie confirmed as...</span></div></div>",

I mean, it HAS to have been at least a few hours...\" Jamie pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I never thought of that...I honestly thought we WERE dead for a while...\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, sis.

Can you hear me in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the outside world, Wendy was grieving over the apparent loss of her dear brother and sister.

Something was definitely moving inside her.  What's more, she could make out a little voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jamie?!?  You're alive?!?\" Wendy asked in complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Mary and I are just fine!\" Jamie replied,  \"Mary, say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!  Yes, I'm alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...how are you not...you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie said, \"To be honest, I don't even know...My guess is that it has something to do with whatever made us this tiny in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Wendy think.  After all, tiny people couldn't be explained by science, so why should the inability to be digested?  Then another thought hit her.  There's no oxygen in the stomach!  And yet, Jamie and Mary were both just fine!  But there was one more thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how are we going to get you out of there?\" Wendy asked.  \"Throwing you up won't work, and clearly neither will the string.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah replied, \"Well, if they'll survive, there IS one way out...Though I don't think they'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins heard this and knew at once what she meant.  \"EWWWW!\" they screamed in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you have any other ideas?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the twins replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, it's settled!  Let's get back to shopping!\" Wendy then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and Mary sighed in relief and worry.  Relief because they wouldn't be digested, and worry because of how they'd leave their sister's body.  They then decided to relax and play around - after all, they were going to be here for quite a while.</span></div></div>",

Catherine effortlessly moved a comforter that Jamie would just get lost in. He then watched Catherine put her hands on her hips, the sunlight from the window shining on her back. The sight made her look like a Greek goddess judging mortals, he couldn't help but stare in awe at his older sister.

While hiking, they'd always go to an abandoned cave to look for bears.  Obviously the scoutmaster had already done his research and checked with the park to be sure the cave was safe and abandoned, but that didn't lessen the thrill of being inside an actual, real cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, the thrill was different, here.  It looked like a cave, sounded like a cave, and even sort of smelled like a cave, but Catherine's fluffy slipper simply was not fun, or exciting.  It was just...scary.  Maybe it was because his best friend Scott wasn't there, or maybe because there was no way Scout Master Jeff could have checked for any poor bears living in his sister's footwear, but Jamie wanted to get out as soon as possible.  Trying to remain brave, Jamie begin hiking through the thick strands of fluff that sprang from the insole of the slipper.  As he walked, the toeprints left by his gigantic sister were cratered in several yards around him.  Catherine's big toe, the print of which he was walking through, would literally be like a two-story building.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to shake the thought from his head, Jamie pushed forward, picking up his pace.  The combination of his sister's musky foot sweat, and her fruity body wash, or foot lotion...whichever it was, was giving him a stomach ache, and making him dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a shadow came overhead.  It didn't completely cast him in darkness, but blocked the light from his room enough that he stopped in his tracks and looked out of the mouth of the slipper, to see Catherine's ankle there.  Her toes, and part of the rest of her foot, were obscured by the elevated platform of the slipper he was standing on.  Eyebrows raising, and jaw beginning to drop, he watched, then, as Catherine's ankle flexed, and the foot began lifting into the air.  Her huge toes flexed gently into an arch as the reached over the edge of the slipper, then lifted higher still, to allow the rest of the foot to begin the motion of sliding in.  Catherine was putting her foot back into the slipper, and Jamie was still inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, Jamie began to step backward, feeling as though time were slowing down.  His sister's toes continued their dramatic approach, and as more of her foot entered, the world around him began to shake, as she shuffled her foot a bit encourage the footwear to welcome it's owner.  He fell over backwards, just as the toes reached the roof of the slipper, Catherine's toenails scratching at the woven surface.  With the underside of those toes, and part of her pale sole visible to him, he couldn't help but imagine that this would be the last image he would see.  His huge sister's majestic foot gliding in place, toes wiggling some against the soft fibers of cotton that made up the insole.  And all the while, Catherine completely unaware that it was her brother she was about to squish between her toes, bury under her sole, or crush with her heel.</span></div></div>",

She cared for them, but often would torment them, sometimes for no reason.  He knew it was all in fun though, and though she would take it a little too far, she would never actually hurt them.  But now, as Catherine's sole had begun to descend on him, Jamie was almost paralyzed in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Catherine, don't step on me!  I'm your brother!\"  The little boy sobbed, falling onto his knees, and eventually curling into a little ball, hiding in the depths of the furry insole of Catherine's footwear.  Though things looked rather grim for him there, fate was going to give him the silver lining to the cloud that was darkening his world...a cloud shaped like a gigantic foot.  He didn't realize it, but he had positioned himself so that Catherine's arch was going to land right on top of him.  Her baby blue toenails glinted in the morning sunlight, and caught his eye in just enough time to see her powerful, writhing toes squirm into the slipper above him.  Each one of her toes were round and soft, without any signs of abuse.  He remembered watching Mary help Catherine paint her toenails earlier that week, and how he thought that it was a good color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that same foot he'd watched get painted was about to crush him to pieces.  The warmth of her skin was already changing the temperature in this graveyard of a prison he was trapped in, and it only got worse as things got darker.  WIth Catherine's foot completely in her slipper, it wasn't long before the resounding thud of her foot landing on top of Jamie announced what shrunken sibling thought was the end of his life.  However, instead of his body exploding, he simply felt....squeezed.  Squeezed harder than he'd ever been squeezed before, but it only hurt, he wasn't injured, yet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes opened, and he was briefly able to see only darkness, Catherine's foot had buried him alive in a world of strawberry scented foot-fleshed.  Trapped under the foot, Jamie was glad Catherine washed herself daily, and used scented lotions.  Part of him wondered if the lotion also tasted like strawberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had gotten a chance to find out, everything change.  Calm became confusion, darkness became light, and stillness became motion.  Above him, Catherine gave up looking for her siblings and assumed they had both left the room before she noticed.  Sighing, Catherine began walking out toward the living room, where Wendy was sitting in the living room having some oatmeal and Carla was having frozen waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of Catherine's walking made Jamie's situation all that he had expected it to be.  Though he was still firmly under her arch, every step she took would toss him several yards deeper into the slipper when she lifted her foot.  When it was thrust forward, he fell back several more yards, rolling back to relatively where he started.  He did manage to grab ahold of a fuzzy fiber, but that only lasted as long as Catherine's foot moved.  Once the step finished, he was treated to a view of his sister's naked sole coming down for him, and burying him under the hundreds of yards of wrinkled foot flesh on the bottom of her foot.  Slamming back on top of him, Jamie felt like his bones might break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, she didn't have to go very far.  Catherine wandered over to her sister's whose plates were both on the coffee table, and she kicked her legs up onto the coffee table as well.  Crossing her legs at her ankles, she had no idea that Jamie had been lost inside her shoe, and was now...</span></div></div>",

The softness of her fuzzy slippers might have felt wonderful for Cath', but Jamie on the under hand, had found no comfort in them.  Her punishing sole crushed him within an inch of his life, after he'd been tossed from under her arch.  Sometimes he got a quick view of the world outside of his sister's shoe, but it was fleeting at best, and he was plunged back into pain and darkness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only lasted a total of twenty seconds, but that twenty seconds was the longest of his life.  As she finished her walk, Jamie found himself plastered against the sole of her feet, the combination of pressure and the slight bit of sweat that had accumulated had him stuck to her sole.  The world inverted, suddenly, at that moment, and after a brief sensation of being carried into the air along with the rest of the foot, Jamie knew Catherine's foot was now resting on her heel, toes pointed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, he heard voices, three distinct ones.  His sister's were discussing something.  It hadn't dawned on him yet that his trouble had only begun.  Plastered face first into her sole, Jamie's question from earlier was answered...her lotion did NOT taste like it smelled...like strawberries.  Spitting the taste of lotion and foot sweat out of his mouth, he felt himself peeling off of her foot.  Gravity was beginning to pull him...and with this slipper open heeled, he'd fall right onto the table top, or worse, the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe at first thought to struggle, but then knew that might be the worst thing he could do.  However, immediately behind him, the insole of the slipper, now a huge vertical wall instead of a vast plain, was within reach.  The furry fibers made excellent hand holds.  Now all he had to do was reach backward and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH!\"  Jamie screamed, as Catherine's foot shifted once more.  He didn't know what was happening, but whatever it was had been enough to send him falling from the sole of her foot, down towards her heel.  Looking down, he immediately noticed that the heel wasn't  on the table anymore, but it was moving.  Where to, he didn't know, and didn't care...he was about to fall to his death.  As he fell, he closed his eyes, waiting to land on an unforgiven surface at a speed that would crush his young body into pieces.  </span></div></div>",

Closing his eyes, he tried to mentally brace himself for what he was sure would be instant death, but instead of a brutal bone-shattering slam, he felt himself land into a thick, gelatinous and very warm substance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie opened his eyes and saw... well nothing, but he felt himself sinking rapidly. Gasping, the tiny boy attempted to throw his arms out and yell for help, but the oozing substance immediately flooded into his mouth, gagging him. It almost tasted like... oats? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrashing wildly, Jamie could hear the muffled voices of his sisters in the outside world and tried to follow them. It only took a few seconds before he broke the surface of wherever he was, but the sight that greeted him almost made him want to dive back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, blown up the IMAX proportions was his big sister Catherine spoon in hand, and his other sister Carla to her side. A quick glance around him confirmed his worst fears-- he had fallen into a bowl of oatmeal and was about to be served for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's Wendy's oatmeal. She's gonna be furious if you eat it.\" Carla warned. \"Have some of my waffles instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine frowned. \"Nah, I'm in the mood for oatmeal,\" she looked down at the bowl hungrily, unaware of the severe danger she was putting her little brother through, \"Wendy can make more. Finders, keepers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla rolled her eyes as Catherine began stirring her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie quickly began realizing screaming was useless. He was just too small, and now that he was covered in oatmeal, he had no chance of being seen either. Tears streaming down his face, he tried to paddle his way to the edge of the bowl in some sort of vague hope that he could scale it, though he wasn't sure how. A large shadow began to form over him and he looked over his shadow to see a godlike spoon descending. Choking on tears, he tried to redouble his momentum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon collided with the oatmeal with such force that Jamie was plunged beneath the surface a few times. He was not shown any mercy as Catherine's titanic hand began pulling the spoon through the muck at a speed Jamie never thought possible. The stirring created a whirlpool of slime that sucked the shrunken boy within several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSputtering, Jamie burst from the surface of the oatmeal yet again. Choking and retching, he screamed up at his big sister's uncaring face as she began to lower her spoon for the first bite...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jamie, drenched in second hand milk and stupidly spicy oatmeal, wiped the half-digested oats off of his face and clothes. Hoping he would get out of his sister's stomach soon, and he prayed even more not to leave the other way. Unfortunately, his preferred option wasn't much better. Swallowing his pride (and more spicy oatmeal), Jamie accepted the fact he was going to end up in the toilet with his sister Catherine's body fluids around him. The searing burn of the ghost pepper sauce led him to wonder what was going on in the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine clutched her stomach, feeling the burn spread from her mouth to her insides. Her stomach let out a loud, unsettling gurgle, almost notifying Catherine of what comes next. Catherine had a gut feeling she wasn't going to stop herself from puking, but she could at least prevent herself from vomiting on the dining table. Standing up from her seat, Catherine made her way to the bathroom sending a death glare Carla's way, prompting the younger blonde to smirk victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest sister forced her way into the bathroom, pushing her sister Wendy, who was nearly finished washing her face, out of the way. Catherine collapsed on her knees and quickly brought her face to the toilet bowl, hoping the hot sauce wouldn't burn as much going out than in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Cath? You're not looking so hot right now.\" Wendy said sincerely, but given the circumstances, Catherine took it as another snarky statement the two often shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh trust me, it pretty... FREAKIN HOT!\" Catherine screamed, stopping an outburst of vomit. \"Who the hell puts hot sauce in oatmeal, sis? What kind of a sick joke is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, having no idea what her sister was talking about, quickly put the pieces together. \"Probably the same maniac who keeps a bottle of ghost pepper sauce under her pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it, Carla! I'll get her back for this,\" she groaned, feeling the breakfast rise back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right for eating my food.\" Wendy said matter-o-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get me some water and some more milk,\"  Catherine let out a audible gag, \"please, hurry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt the entire world rumble ominously, teasing him with a means of escape. The quakes grew heavier as the entire stomach swayed, sloshing the half digested breakfast around. Jamie held on as the moving came to an abrupt stop, bracing himself as the rumbling grew worse and worse. At this point, Jamie was able to hear the grumblings and roars of the conversation being held above him. Jamie felt himself and a large load of food begin to rise up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine wretched as a violent torrent of puke came from her mouth. The sauce once again brought pain to her mouth and throat. Wendy rushed back into the room with a jug of milk and a glass of water. \"Took you long enough,\" she said angrily as she spit into the toilet to rid the taste of vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie felt himself being forced through a tight, fleshy prison, which he correctly assumed was her throat. He was eventual brought back to the familiar and still terrifying sight of his oldest sisters maw, except he was created with an inside view of her mouth. The tidal wave of puke and spit began to push him out the mouth. He saw Catherine's massive jaw open, and a flood of light seep into the dark confines of the mouth. Jamie was immediately thrust forward and out into another, much larger body of  liquid, this time it was clean water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie waded in the toilet staring upwards at the sky which held the image of his sisters reeling face that rivaled the biggest of IMAX screens. He always found Catherine pretty but seeing her insides thoroughly and seeing her vomiting changed all of that, practically traumatizing him for life. He watched her say something with a pained moan, and she then spit directly at him, but of course he knew she didn't really mean any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine hung her head against the toilet, just in case there was more to throw back up. Instead, she felt her stomach calm down, and the burn in her mouth took back her attention.  She quickly leaned over and greedily grasped the glass of water, chugging it with absolutely no hesitation. She brought her head back to the toilet, hoping she didn't need to puke again. And while she was staring directly into the bowl, she saw something that sent a chill up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny object floating in the puke, and it was her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God...\" Catherine said meekly, looking over towards Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Catherine ordered warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, no,\" argued Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look!\" Catherine demanded, grabbing her sister by the arm and forcing her down to the toilet bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't see anythin--OH MY GOD!\" Wendy went wide eyed as she caught the glimpse of her shrunken brother in the center of the toilet. \"Jamie! What the hell happened!?\" Wendy wasted no time in grabbing a wad of toilet paper and lowering of into the toilet water, waiting for the tiny boy to hold on, in which he did. The giant red head cupped her tiny brother into her palms and ran cold sink water and lathered soap onto him while Jamie reluctantly recounted the events that led up to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so... So sorry, Jamie.\" Catherine apologized profusely, hoping to gain her youngest sibling's forgiveness for the horror show she put him through.</span></div></div>",

I felt like I was going to die!\" \"Serves you right for eating Wendy's oatmeal!\" Carla argued. *BURRP* \"Ohhh my stomach... It feels like something is moving around in there...\" \"It's just the spices in there, now are you done complaining?\" Carla replied. Catherine sat back down and began spooning up her oatmeal again. With loud wet gulps Catherine's oatmeal vanished down her throat, consequently forcing Jamie to keep climbing in the dark cavern of his sister's belly. *GULP* \"Ahhh... There ya go, down into mama's belly...\" Catherine said patting her stomach. Catherine unbuttoned her jeans and allowed her bloated tummy more room. \"uh oh, looks like Catherine is going to be fat and happy this morning\" Catherine chimed as her belly began emitting gentle rhythmic gurgles and groans clearly beggining to digest it's contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie could hear the argument between his sister's outside, followed by the giant gulps of Catherine, all to be confirmed by the globs of oatmeal raining down on him again.

The shrunken boy landed roughly on a soft, sponge-like surface; he looked up but was greeted by a dull sight of evenly spaced square holes. The ground beneath him had a slight stickiness to it, not enough to stop his movement, but enough to slow him down.  Strangely, he had the taste of maple syrup in his mouth, giving him another clue on where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat sore from his landing, Jamie crawled slowly against the surprisingly small amount of syrup that served as a hindrance to his escape. After a few seconds of struggling against the thick mess, Jamie reached the edge on the waffle; he stared downwards and felt slightly nauseous as the floor seemed hundreds of feet away. The odds of surviving a second fall wasn't enough to convince him to jump from the stack of waffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie stared up from the waffle and up towards the distance; he was able to spot Catherine's massive feet, her toes twitching and feet rubbing together. Jamie watched her glance over towards his direction, his heart nearly stopping when he heard Carla offer up her waffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie could do nothing but watch as Catherine glanced in his direction; her large hand reached out towards him, and he shut his eyes again while waiting for his inevitable death. However, his death didn't come as soon as expected it due to a simple change in taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine, finding herself already comfortable and her sister's oatmeal within arms reach, decided to grab the bowl of cinnamon seasoned oats under the pretense that Wendy could quickly make more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Carla asked condescendingly, looking at her oldest sister with a confused look.<br>\r\n\"I'm sort of in the mood for oatmeal-- thanks anyway,\" she answered, stirring the oats in the bowl.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, more for me, I guess.\" Carla retorted, lifting up the plate towards herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire world below him began to shake violently, causing him to drop to the ground.

She wasn't too worried that there was no evidence of the twins because it was almost noon, and they could have easily left to a friend's house or something.

Each step causing him to rise enough to hit the roof of the slipper, then as she lifts her foot up gravity catches up to him and slams him into Catherine's fleshy toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine walked to the kitchen and grabbed the ingredients required to make a bowl of cereal. Without even paying attention Catherine tapped her foot against the floor as she was putting the cereal together. Jamie was bouncing around the slipper, after a while he grasped her smallest toe holding on for dear life. As much as he hated the smell it was probably going to keep him from getting an injury. Catherine just walked over to the table and sat down to enjoy her cereal, but she was subconsciously shaking her foot and immersing Jamie into the shaking torture again. Catherine curled her toes and it wrapped around the miniscule child and rubbed her sweat over Jamie's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about three minutes of wiggling torture that seemed to drag on much longer than Jamie would have wanted, Catherine put her bowl away and marched happily towards the television.

Stop!\" Jamie screamed in pain. Carla was silent but she loosened her grip slightly.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" He asked, the blonde stopped and then smiled. Carla took her brother and threw him in the air, his body only rising about two feet, but to him it seemed like miles. Carla giggled to herself, juggling her little brother for her own amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie never liked heights, now that he was less than an inch tall anything was stomach churning for him. Jamie was launched into the air at near neck breaking speed. He caught glimpses of his sister's entertained face as he fell back down to her left hand. Jamie was at least glad to feel the slight softness of her palm, but his time of peace was interrupted as he was blasted back into the air, he heard Carla's laugh invade his ears, her voice penetrating his ears. The juggling went on for about a minute, but it felt like hours to the tiny child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jamie came back into contact with his sister's sweaty palm. He was too dizzy to notice that Carla...</span></div></div>",

He watched the dark green athletic bag come closer at an alarming speed. He struggled against his sister's grip, choosing to take his chances with the carpeted floor over the sweaty clothing the gym bag held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasingly, Carla spoke up, \"I heard Wendy's friends call her, and they invited her to the gym again. At least I think it was the gym. Then again I've never seen her that excited for going to the gym. Maybe it was something special, who knows. I guess you will in a bit.\" Carla kept teasing her younger brother, dangling him precariously over the gym bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do this!\" Jamie begged, struggling to keep himself upright. \"How did you even shrink me!\" Jamie yelled up, hoping to get an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda put something in those ballet flats I hung on your face. It was the only way to mask the scent of the shrinky thing.\" Carla explained, lifting Jamie onto her palm and allowing him to stand up.<br>\r\n\"You don't even know what the thing that shrunk me was called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I remember is that it's from South America and surprisingly easy to get a hold of. That and I can unshrink you by keeping you in my flats along with the shrinky thing for a couple hours, so it's not impossible.\" Carla clarified, keeping the smug grin. At that point, Carla dangle her brother again and made sure he got a decent look at her light tan shoes as she pulled her heel out and mocked him with the gaping hole. \"So, how desperate are ya to get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very!\" Jamie begged.<br>\r\n\"Well then, I can't deny you of your size then.\" Carla announced immediately letting go of her tiny brother. Jamie  was freefalling as Carla's foot got closer and closer Jamie closed his eyes and braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIKE!\"  Carla mocked, prompting Jamie to open his eyes. And as he did so, he noticed the open gym bag filled with well worn socks and sweaty shorts. Jamie let out a horrified shriek as his destination approached, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a minute later, Wendy entered the room and immediately eyed the gym bag. Wendy bent over and rummaged through the bag, causing massive earth quakes for the shrunken boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Wendy...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Whatcha doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy answered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: \"My friends and I are going to the gym again,\" as she zips the duffel bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: \"My friends and I are going to the water park today.\" Wendy then pulls a pair of sandals in which Jamie was unluckily stuck to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: \"Nothing, just looking for some socks to wear.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course she had her reasons for refusing to buy new running shoes like her somewhat frugal nature, or the reluctance to break in new ones, or even her neurotic social anxiety when out shopping. Wendy thoroughly believed she'd rather die than to have someone near her feet and helping her try on shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Wendy knew her brother was suffering even worse because of her oddly irrational self consciousness. Jamie was pinned down under a weight he couldn't even fathom as he was deeply pressed into the well worn insole. The ground beneath him contorted, giving him some space to breathe in the rank, foul smelling air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy wiggled her toes as she tightened the laces, regretting the decision to wear dirty socks as the moist fabric made itself known beneath her. The redhead sighed to herself as she made a mental note to actually put some effort into finding clean socks. Although, she quickly dismissed the note as she realized she wasn't really hurting anyone, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie forcefully swallowed another mouthful of sweat, as he felt the salty fluid seep into his body, getting in his hair, his eyes, and what felt like his joints. The tiny ten year old screamed out for help but received no answer from the deep confines of a stylish yet equally practical running shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy found himself directly under both Wendy's second and third toes as the titanic redhead pounded the massive columns of flesh into him, unknowingly of course, given Wendy's skittish behavior about her own feet. If Wendy knew, she would never forgive herself for cruelly torturing her brother without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy slammed her right foot into the ground, feeling the sole contort to her foot. She smiled slightly before leaving the room, expecting a text or something to hurry her up, but no text came as Wendy took her sweet time in getting ready. She tied her hair into a long pony tail as she shifted her weight between her feet at random intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out to the living room, catching her older sister Catherine helping herself to a bowl of cereal while watching early morning cartoons. At the somewhat childish sight, Wendy questioned if Catherine really was the oldest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Cath, can I borrow your car?\" Wendy asked, hoping her sister was in a generous enough mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest sister thought to herself as she took another spoonful of sugary cereal, savoring the taste in her mouth while dragging on her answer. </span></div></div>",

And, that squelching would only get worse, she thought, as she stepped outside to a humid, warm day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gagged as the moist socks bore down on his body, and nostrils. By ten minutes in, Wendy had worked up a fresh batch of sweat more than enough to re-soak the sock with warm sweat as opposed to clammy cold - not that it made much difference to Jamie, As the toes wiggled nervously over him, smushing him deep into the tight sneaker. </span></div></div>",

The foot slowly crept forward towards Jamie. \"No please Wendy don't crush me\" Jamie yelled but it was worthless, her toes enveloped Jamie and he sat snuggly underneath them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After minutes of Jamie hitting his twin sister's face, signs of waking began to show. It started with a groan of protest and shifted to her acknowledging what tried to wake her up, albeit it was a lazy, unfocused \"five more minutes.\" Groaning, Jamie began to press harder against the smooth skin of his sister's face, pulling, hitting, and nearly biting to get her attention. Seconds later, a shadow loomed over him, and he turned to witness a large hand moving towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to stop it, all of Jamie's attacks on her face were repaid and then some. The titanic fingers curled and uncurled, rubbing her cleanly cut nails against her face. It didn't take long for him to notice that she was just scratching her face, but it reassured him that his attempts to wake her up were not in vain.  Although, he would have to take a less subtle approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurveying his options and his landscape, he noticed her left ear was not blocked by anything. Seeing that he hasn't tried it before and it was a lot less dangerous than any other way, Jamie had decided to yell into her ear to rouse the sleeping giant. Jamie began his trek across the pillow landscape; he tugged at heavy strands of hair to move it out of the way, almost tangling himself in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie made it to his twin sister's ear, huffing and panting in exhaustion. He gripped the lobe tightly and steadied himself from falling. Feeling secure, Jamie made his way downwards into the ear canal. He stopped before entering the cave, hoping he had gone far enough. \"Mary, wake up!\" Jamie waited a moment for a response before trying again. The shrunken boy yelled out her name again; this time he received a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Mary's voice boomed, her voice incredibly close. It was weary and sleepy, still handicapped by sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this might sound weird but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" Mary asked again, sounding a little more awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" she said before erupting into an earth shaking giggle fit. \"Next thing you're going to say is that you're in my ear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter balancing from the the earthquake, Jamie angrily replied, \"I am.\" Once again the floor beneath him shook, and he kicked himself for not preparing for another laughing session. Not wanting to fall deeper, Jamie said, \"I can prove it! Just... cup your hand by your ear, and I'll come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill skeptical, Mary just decided to humor her brother by doing what he asked. She sat up first in a way that almost launched the tiny boy out of her ear. She put her hand against her left ear, and impatience soon took over her as she tilted her head and practically forced her brother out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor beneath Jamie vanished, and he found himself falling towards his sister's hand. Screaming loudly in both surprise and fear, Jamie eventually made contact with Mary's hand. After regaining his composure, the tiny boy was greeted with his giant sister colossal, freckled face. \"Woah, look at you. You're so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it... I spent half an hour trying to wake you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you wanted to wake me up, you should have messed with my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jamie, they're not that bad.\" Mary teased. \"Give 'em a whiff!\" Mary closed a grip around her itty-bitty brother and began to slowly move him towards her waiting feet, and Jamie could do nothing but watch as he approached his sister's wiggling toes.</span></div></div>",

He looked upwards at the hole in the shoe that only displayed Mary's beaming face. He struggled to get on his feet, and an earthquake shook him off along with leaving him gasping for air. With each breath, he got another smell of the cheesy stench that came from the depths of the cavern that was his twin sister's sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gasped in terror as Mary's smiling face was replaced with something much more horrifying. Mary's bare foot. Jamie, still breathless, began to crawl backwards as he was unable to look away from the toes that began to creep it's way towards the shrunken boy. Within milliseconds, the wiggling toes reached Jamie and trapped him between her second and third toes. He was immediately humbled as the toes dwarfed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie found himself unable to move as the shifting foot squeezed and pulled him. He quickly adjusted to the situation, attempting to make like of the situation. His mental compromise seemed to get better as he felt the pressure lift off him. In a word, Jamie described it as weightlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was immediately derailed as the weightlessness transformed into g-forces as even the greatest freefall ride couldn't compare to Mary taking a single step. The impact was rough but not fatal, and Jamie wasn't sure if he wanted it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Mary simply slipped on her shoes. She wiggled her toes, feeling the tiny boy who was trapped between them and smiled contentedly.<br>\r\nMary lifted her right foot and held it up, trying to make the descent much more suspenseful, before immediately slamming it down with an earth shattering stomp. Mary then shook her foot playfully to tell her brother the worst was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary walked out the room and down the hallway, spending more time on her right foot to make Jamie's punishment near unbearable, stomping him out with each step, and surprisingly Jamie wasn't severely wounded. Bruises were another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the thumping from the hallway, Mary's red head older sister came in with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, why the heck are you stomping?\" </span></div></div>",

It was so dark under the covers that all he could make out was that he was trapped under the arch of her second and third toes. While you couldn\u2019t see much, you could still smell a lot. Your sister didn\u2019t have the worst feet but she definitely didn\u2019t shower regularly either. At least she hadn\u2019t gotten them all sweaty yet. In addition to the absolutely atrocious smell he could also feel things. The ridges on her toes and balls of her foot were huge. At this size you could even see the dirt in between them gathered from her bug hunting adventures. Hopefully, you wouldn\u2019t become yet another insect squashed under her. You attempted with all of your might to push your sister\u2019s toes away from you but it felt like the more you tried the more she squeezed you. It was almost as if she knew you were there and she was tormenting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you were violently shaken by Mary\u2019s foot, and then again, she was tossing and turning. \u201cOh no\u201d you thought. She would only shake like this in her sleep if she had a particularly bad dream. This couldn\u2019t be good. Mary clenched you tighter than before. Her boa constrictor toes left you struggling for air and when you did breathe back in, it was just her foot stench. This went on for several minutes but it felt like forever. You weren\u2019t sure you were going to make it but then she suddenly went still. Thank god it was finally over. Light washed over you as Mary yanked of the blankets and sat up in a cross-legged position. \u201cJamie, I just had the worst nightmare. Carla was there, but she was huge and chasing us with her big stinky feet and - where are you?\u201d From your position you could see her face blocked out slightly by her huge thigh. She was still groggy but confused as to your whereabouts. \u201cWhere did you go jamie? What\u2019s this thing on my feet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary moved her left leg out of the way and put her hands on either side of the foot to bring you closer to her face. You could see her dimples becoming more pronounced as she squinted her eyes to get a better view. \u201cIs that\u2026 Is that you Jamie?\u201d You tried your best to wave your arms and shout \u201cI'm here Mary\u201d to get her attention. The look on her face turned from one of confusion to one of surprise as her mouth and eyes went wide with excitement. \u201cOh my god! Why are you so small? And why were you in between my toes?\u201d Her voice boomed down at you like a megaphone. \u201cI don't know what happened. I tried to wake you by tapping your toes but you just grabbed me with them and started squishing me under the sheets in your sleep.\u201d She wiggled her toes a bit, squeezing you in the process and said \u201cYeah right, I bet you're lying because you're too embarrassed to say that you like my feet.\u201d You became disgusted by this statement and shouted \u201cGross! I'd never like your feet! I only did it because I thought it would be the best way to wake you up.\u201d Mary rolled her eyes and said \u201cExcuses, excuses Jamie. When will you learn that lying only gets you in trouble. Now kiss my toes.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d \u201cWhy not? I mean you're already so close to them, and they love you so much.\u201d Mary then started clenching her toes open and closed, each time saying \u201cmwah mwah\u201d to imitate kissing. \u201cSee? They love you. Now love them back Jamie.\u201d \u201cI'm not going to kiss your gross toes Mary, I'd rather smell Carla\u2019s after ballet practice.\u201d Mary made this sad pouty face and said \u201cAwww, now you made them sad. In that case your wish is my command Jamie.\u201d Before you had a chance to say anything your sister scrunched up her toes so much that you were in complete darkness and completely enveloped. Next came a huge thud. And then again. She was walking but where to could not be in your favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your sister was finished slamming you with her toes (you were pretty sure she was hurting you on purpose), they opened up and you experienced free fall. Once you came to your senses you could smell an unbearable yet familiar stench from all around you. Crap, You knew why it smelled familiar. You were in Carla's ballet slipper. You looked up all you could see was your mountain of a sister with a smile on her face. She got down on her hands and knees said \u201cThis is what happens when you don't treat my toes with respect Jamie. I know that you probably didn't mean what you said before, but you should have been more careful. Maybe this will make you more grateful after Carla's ballet lesson. If it does I promise I'll be nicer to you next time you want to play with my little piggies.\u201d Mary stood up to her full height and brought her foot over the slipper wiggling her \u201cpiggies\u201d. Mary waved and said \u201cDon't have to much fun down there \u201clittle\u201d bro. Just think of this as my early birthday presnt to you in the form of an adventure. Bye!\u201d After that your sister walked away, each step shaking the ground beneath you but descending in force as she left. Looking around you there was no chance of escape. You could climb out the top but the shoe is several times your height. However, if you remember correctly then you once overheard Carla complaining about a hole in one of her slippers. You began searching for this hole, hoping you were in the right slipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou marveled at your surroundings. If you were regular size this shoe could be held in your hand, but at this size it took you a while just to walk across the width of the sole. You were nearing the end of the shoe and thinking all hope was lost when you step in something wet. After taking a step back and crouching to get a better look you come to the gross realization that this was Carla's sweat. Yuck, what was a single drop of sweat to Carla has become for you a puddle big enough to step in. Suddenly, the puddle vibrates a little and then a little more. You start to feel like you're in that scene from Jurassic Park when you realize you might not be too far off. \u201cAlright Catherine, I'll be ready for ballet practice just as soon as I can find my slippers.\u201d Crap, it was Carla, and judging by her booming steps she was getting closer and closer. You start bolting for the edge of the shoe, hoping to find your fabled escape route. \u201cThere they are, I thought I'd never find them.\u201d The ground beneath you shifts as Carla lifts her slipper into the air. You fall forward rapidly and slam into the toe section. Once you gather your bearings you find no exit to speak of, but above your head is something much more frightening. You could see two thumbs curling around the opening of the shoe to stabilize it and a big white sock coming down. You shouted and begged for your sister to stop but it was no use. The sock kept coming at full speed and slammed into your body. You heard a muffled \u201cI'm ready Cathy!\u201d From outside. The shoe hit the floor and you were once again in the dark and trapped with one of your sisters\u2019 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf being held hostage by Mary's toes was an endless nightmare, then Carla's ballet practice was nothing. Sessions usually go on for an hour and a half at least, but Carla was a good student so she would put in extra time to practice. This was especially true as she had a recital coming soon. Most sound was blocked by Carla's sock but at times you could hear her instructor and she was relentless. The worse parts were when she told the dancers to stand on their toes and Carla was forced to put her full weight on you. The only solace you could find in this torture you were experiencing was that sometimes the smell would get so bad that you blacked out and missed some of the pain. That was until Carla stood on her toes and the sheer force of it woke you up again. The whole ordeal was worse than anything you had ever experienced. You just hoped that Mary would never put you in such a position ever again. When Carla got home she began to take her ballet slippers off. You prayed that whatever happened, she didn\u2019t see you.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, there was no scent of smoke in the air, but something still didn't feel right. It was a certain neuroticism about me that wasn't shared with any of my siblings; still debating whether it's a good or bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm also trying to figure out a way to say this without sounding narcissistic: I don't think my family would have lasted without me. God, I should probably explain that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister Catherine might be physically older than me and technically an adult, but she might be a little too reckless for my liking. There's my younger sister, Carla; not much to be said about her other than she's like a carbon copy of Catherine; only a lot more mischievous and clumsy. I mean under the right guidance, Carla's a good person, but she likes to gravitate to Catherine, like freaking twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of twins, I should probably mention my youngest of siblings, Mary and Jamie. The two are polar opposites, in a good way. There's a nice dynamic between the two. The girl, Mary, she's excitable and just pleasant to be around, and her brother, while quiet and slightly high strung, manages to make up for that with his own maturity. Although, I wouldn't trade any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm off the tangent, aren't I? Sorry. Where was I? Oh yeah, I just woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the room, grinding my feet against the carpet for warmth. I swear, it's summer and it's still freezing in the morning. Ambling slowly across the house until I noticed my older sister graced us with her presence, albeit in a rather unannounced way. She was passed out on the couch in a curled position, with her legs hanging over the edge of the couch.  I figured she arrived late at night, and my theory was confirmed by the clothes thrown around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to myself, I simply picked up the clothes and went about my morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course my previous hunch had to be right. Mom and Dad were gone for only one day, and the impossible happens. Story of my life, I guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a great day going for me: summer just started (my favorite season), and a new shipment of books was supposed to come in today, with my name written all over them. No, I don't find it the least bit immoral to read any of them early... as long as I don't spoil it for anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff topic, again, sorry. My mind's still a bit... blown, like everything I knew about biology, physics-- reality was thrown out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm still being cryptic. Well, I should be blunt: my little brother and youngest sister shrunk to half an inch. Yeah, I'm not kidding. They f*cking shrunk; sorry, again. They allow one f-word per PG-13 movie, right? Just felt it was worth noting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were right there in the palm of my hand, literally. Two tiny children nestled into the fleshy bits of my palm. They snored peacefully, clutching each other for warmth. It was definitely cute, but that wasn't on my mind. They looked so peaceful, yet they don't know what happened to them I need to ease them into this.</span></div></div>",

Her sandy blonde hair was tied into a lazily made bun and she brought her hand over her tight shirt which had her favorite band's logo plastered on her chest. She scratched a tiny itch on her stomach and let out a quiet yawn. Overall, the sight should have been innocent and borderline cute, but it instead left the shrunken family awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine came closer at an increasing speed as she called out her younger siblings' names. She looked down at the unmade bed with no evidence of the twins anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Jamie, Mary, I'm tired of playing these games.\" Catherine said, clearly not in a good mood. The titanic blonde leaned over the bed and sifted through the covers as if she was humoring the twins and hoping they would come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie watched Catherine's massive body arc over him, catching a glimpse of his older sister's slightly exposed stomach. The shrunken boy felt the world around him shift as he was thrust into darkness. At first he was convinced that he had died, but he was quick to find out he was just buried under a thin blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling out of the blankets, Jamie caught another look at her gigantic form and was able to see the frustration and annoyance in his sister's face. He was once again transfixed by the sight of his massive sister so much that he was unable to react to her hand coming straight at him. Completely paralyzed by the terrifying sight, he was too scared to run out from under the plummeting palm as he stands there, accepting quick death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a sudden but not fatal pain on his side, and a second later he was tumbling on the bed sheets. Arms wrapped around him and a worried shriek that called his name. Regaining his focus, Jamie opened his eyes and found his older sister Wendy lying right next to him face down, with her left hand clutching him tightly. Wendy quickly got onto her feet and immediately began tending to her younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamie, please tell me you're okay!\" Wendy practically screamed. The shrunken boy let out a soft wheeze as he felt the need for more air. \"Oh thank god!\" She buried his face into his chest and brought him into the tightest hug Jamie as ever felt. Wendy let out a laugh of relief, literally forgetting the giant wreaking havoc right above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, Wendy! That was awesome!\" Carla shouted from afar, towing Mary along with her to check on Jamie. The four finally reunited, but a massive roar from above reminded the shrunken family of their situation. \"So what are we gonna do about our big, and I mean BIG sister?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,' Wendy groaned, moving a disheveled tuft of orange hair from her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of all of the siblings, Wendy was probably the most scared, and the least mentally prepared for this sort of adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, sis? That doesn't seem that safe.\" Carla said, bring the surprise voice of reason.<br>\r\n\"Now's  not the time to question me right now!\" Wendy panicked, her brain fried enough to be completely redundant. \"Just get the twins on the counter, okay!?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Carla simply answered, grabbing hold of both Mary and Jamie's hands in her own and quickly ushering them away from the epicenter of the quakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's going to be okay, right?!\" Mary asked after a few terror filled seconds of running.<br>\r\n\"Of course she will.\" Carla reassured, \"didn't you see how she saved Jamie's butt? She practically has enough adrenaline to be Wonder Woman.\" Carla kept going, appealing to the twins' love of super heroes and comic books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be safe!\" Wendy screamed, speaking more to herself than her younger siblings. She immediately scolded herself for volunteering to do something so stupid. \"It's simple,\" she said through an anxiety ridden chuckle, \"Just grab onto her clothes and climb.\" She let put another nervous chuckle, sizing up the details of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny ginger eyed her titanic sister's navy blue soccer shorts which had Catherine's old high school's name and logo printed on the thigh. She quickly took note of the white string used to tighten shorts. She was at least thankful for it being thick enough to grab onto. \"Okay,\" she huffed, bobbing back and forth as if she were gaining momentum to jump. \"Just jump and hold on. Simple, easy, safe- oh who am I kidding? I'm gonna die...\" Wendy took a deep breath and bolted towards Catherine's midsection, praying to whatever entities determined her fate.

She looked again, ready to dismiss it as lint or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had been thrown around as Catherine sat down. She flopped down on the now horizontal plane of navy blue cloth. She looked up at her sister's towering upper body. From her spot on the blimp-sized thigh, Catherine's fit stomach was like a sheer cliff. Her face was partially obscured by her, once average, now humongous chest. The tiny girl hopped up and began jumping around and shouting for the giant blond's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine leaned in closer to inspect the...thing. She scrunched her nose at the strange little object. \"Is it...moving!?!\" She nearly screamed as she realized it was moving. It was the size of a bug but it definitely didn't look like one. Too anxious to touch it or even move her leg, she took a deep breath and leaned in again. She made out a tiny form that was vaguely...human. \"What...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe smaller of the two sisters rejoiced as she was noticed. She saw the expressions on her sister's huge face change from apathy to curiosity then confusion and finally disbelief. Wendy did not rejoice, however, when Catherine's hand reached out for her. She instinctively stumbled backward in fear. She could not outrun the giant thumb and and forefinger, which easily pinched her up. She was trapped but thankfully Catherine was gentle, obviously not wanting to squish her. Wendy squirmed between soft fingertips much bigger than her to no avail. She was carried to nauseating heights with equally disorienting speed. She came to a stop in front a pair of huge blue eyes. At her current size she was dazzled by the stunning details she could see in these vibrant orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at the tiny form she began to recognize it. Her jaw dropped as she noted that familiar red hair.\"...Wendy?\" She said, in shock as she brought the shrunken girl even closer.

Catherine was amazed at their weightlessness as she raised them to her eyes. \"What the fu- heck happened to you guys?\" She censored herself for the sake of the twins, a habit that had become second nature. She was met with a flurry of incomprehensible squeaks. \"Oh right,\" she said, moving them to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy relayed the events of the last few minutes into Catherine's giant ear. The larger girl winced when Wendy told her about the near crushing of Jamie. They were moved back in front of the face which dwarfed them.

The table they'd ate at so many times was now a giant plain that seemed to stretch for miles. Anything on the table like the bowl fruit or a glass of water Catherine had set down next to them was like a towering monument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muffins O.K.?\" Catherine's booming voice shook her siblings out of their awe. She held up some fresh blueberry muffins from the grocery store as she leaned over them. She absolutely dwarfed them with her enormous upper body. Her huge form blocked out the golden light from the window, completely bathing them in her shadow. They were all so amazed and intimidated they didn't answer. \"I'll take that as a yes.\" The blonde giantess said, moving away with shocking speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine hummed as she got a small saucer from the cabinet. She then sat down at the table with her food, grabbing a napkin and setting it near her plate. She looked over at the minuscule group by her glass. \"I think we should share.\" She smirked, breaking off a large crumb and dropping it on the napkin. She watched as they gathered around it, giggling benignly as she noticed it was about as big as one of the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was amazed by the sheer size of the \"crumb\". In Catherine's fingers it looked like a bite-sized little morsel. To them, however, it was enough food to last a few days. She broke off an apple-sized and enjoyed its buttery flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Catherine watched them eat she had a playful, slightly mean idea. Since they were little, Wendy hated it when she would talk with her mouth full or chew with it open. This meant, like any normal sister, Catherine would go out of her way to do so. At her current size it would be infinitely more annoying and, for the larger sister, infinitely more amusing. She could barely contain her laughter as she plucked up the shrunken redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was just finishing her piece of the crumb when she was abruptly lifted from the napkin. She was carried upward past the billboard sized logo on Catherine's enormous chest. She passed an incredibly wide neck before coming to a stop before two massive lips. The naturally pink, plushy-looking lips were curled into a familiar playful smile. She began to wonder what was going on until the muffin came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" Wendy realized what her sister was doing as she took a monster bite. She could hear the squishing and squelching as Catherine chewed her disgusting mouthful. She was brought even closer to the maw as the golden-haired girl began to speak. \"This is so good!\" The oldest sister said in an exaggerated fashion, displaying the soggy mush inside her mouth. Wendy wanted to vomit as she looked into the huge mouth. \"Want some?\" Wendy screamed as Catherine stuck out her tongue. The slimy, pink organ was almost touching her. She squirmed trying not to join the masticated pastry to no avail. She struggled in horror as she was lowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine thought it would be hilarious if she dropped her into the mash but her conscience told that was enough. She pulled Wendy away and smiled at her as she swallowed. She dropped her back on the napkin and went back to eating her muffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smirked at the green-faced Wendy as she walked over. \"Not a word.\" Wendy said flatly as she sat down, appetite nonexistent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone finished eating (besides Wendy) and Catherine took them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The oldest sibling smiled down at Wendy and Carla, knowing exactly how to get back at her sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout jostling her siblings, the giant girl bent over and picked up a single ballet slipper, teasingly waving it in front of the owner. Carla's expression shifted to one of dread, knowing exactly what was in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got ya a new bedroom,\" she taunted. \"It's a little worn, but it should be familiar.\" She dropped the pink slipper to her side, snickering slightly at the discolored dirt brown foot prints. Without warning, she plucked Carla between her fingers and lifted her  high up to her face, giving her younger sister a patronizing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather unceremoniously, Carla hit the sole with a sickening squelch, and the smell hit her like a freight train. It was muggy, stale, and completely her own fault for refusing to clean her ballet slippers from time to time. Within seconds, she could feel the beads of sweat form on her forehead as she began to feel a layer of filth wrap around her. She looked at the curved walls of the heel, rising into the air at a slope too steep to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the massive hole in the sky, Carla was treated to Catherine's smiling face, completely content with her sister's situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine turned away from Carla's prison,focusing her attention on Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you, my dear sister Wendy...\" </span></div></div>",

It stretched skyward higher than the<br>\r\nGreat Wall of China, which the family had seen on vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine's massive form distracted him from his thoughts.

He also saw Wendy and Mary panting a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm mph!\" A muffled scream rang out from somewhere. Jamie quickly realized Carla was missing and began to scan around for her. His eyes quickly fell on an arm weakly clawing at the sofa. The owner of the arm, no doubt Carla, was pinned under the mountain of flesh that was Catherine's thigh. The monolith in question checked on them. \"Oh my! I hope I didn't sit on anyone!\" She said, pretending not to feel her shrunken sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her leg and gasped, feigning a look of surprise.

Her long legs seemed to stretch for miles, the toned muscles flexing within as Catherine leaned just a scant few inches farther away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's eyes closed as she desperately grabbed empty air time and time again, knowing with all of her heart that one of these attempts would end with her hand grabbing a fistful of fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\"  She heard her name called first, and she opened her eyes again mid-flight, just in time to see the edge of Catherine's shorts flash by, zooming off above her.  That could only mean that she was descending now, and she certainly was not holding onto anything that would stop her fall.  She screamed again, watching the length of her sister's leg zoom by her.  She'd missed, and was now plummeting to her death.  Her brother and sisters stood by helplessly as she fell towards the ground, quickly falling farther than their field of vision.  Mary gasped and covered her face, looking away.  The Carla fell to her knees, and Jamie stood there speechless.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Wendy's fall went by more quickly as gravity pulled on her, and she couldn't bare to see the last few seconds of her life flashing by her eyes, in every since of the word.  She waited for death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Catherine had shifted her position, reaching up to pull the chain on the overhead lamp to turn it on.  As a result, her right foot was leaning up on it's toes, and her left leg, the one closest to Wendy, was now lifted off the ground, with her slipper barely dangling by her toes.  Wendy, obviously, had not seen this, and was unaware that her descent was not to the ground, but into a very warm, dark new atmosphere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only seconds after she'd closed her eyes that she'd felt herself crash against a soft, warm wall violently, and she felt as though she injured her shoulder.  Her tiny body bounced off of that wall and into another wall, this one soft as well, but much fuzzier.  From there, she tumbled down the last several yards, rolling to a stop at what she felt was the end of this strange cavern.  She didn't want to open her eyes yet, but she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few feet above her was sight she might have would rather died a quick death than seen.  Five toes, Catherine's toes, patiently hanging there with the rest of her foot, just barely inside what she realized was a fuzzy slipper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no!  Catherine!\"  She called out, trying to scramble up the side of the slipper.  Unfortunately, as she grabbed one of those fuzzy strands, her shoulder, which had slammed against the vertical sole of Catherine's foot, screamed out at her, and she immediately let go, sliding back down under where those long, powerful toes would be any second now.  Humbled as much as she was afraid, Wendy couldn't believe she was trapped in Catherine's slipper, tormented by Catherine's menacing toes. </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, they didn't as her open mouth was treated to the stale taste of feet and blueberry lotion in a naturally unflattering combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy felt the pressure on her chest rise as her torso was caught beneath the pressure of Catherine's big toe.

She was ticked off to say the least as she couldn't even fathom the torture Wendy was going through without even being noticed by the titanic sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sized up the slope of the twins' bed sheets, finding it safe enough to slide down. The tiny girl felt herself tumbling down the covers until she hit the soft carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Catherine stood at a modest five seven, she was a full on force of nature, standing at hundreds of times larger than the shined Carla, forcing the tiny girl to regret her decision on recklessly joining her sister inside the morning footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine stood still, stretching her arms upward to get the kinks out of her stiff joints. She let out a small sigh of comfort as she wiggled her toes in her warm slippers, feeling the shoe conform to her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla stored at the edge of Catherine's slipper, wrong carefully the small opening that she would have to squeeze through. She groaned, feeling a little squeamish about sidling against her giant sister's barefoot. Swallowing her pride, Carla ventured forward with saving her sister Wendy as her only motivator to keep moving on against the slightly rank foot. She struggled and fought through until she reached the toe section, finding... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well they finally did it. The loving parents of the twins finally trust the older sisters enough to leave them home alone with the medical surprises that were Mary and Jamie, also known as the Tiny Twins. They were born as a mystery to the science community as the two were born an inch tall. The two in their early years were studied closely by scientists until the age of four, when it was deemed safe for them to live at home. Mary and Jamie's parents tried to keep them away from reporters and the common reality show executive away from the shrunken son and daughter. They also tried their best to keep their youngest children safe from the danger of their older sisters, Catherine, Wendy, and Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins saw their sisters at least once every two days, since their overprotective patents shielded them from the outside world. And with good reason. Almost every time Mary and Jamie were left alone with any of the the three ended badly for the minuscule children. The eldest child, Catherine usually had them work, often claiming that it will strengthen their durability and resistance. She would make them massage her gigantic feet or wash her shoes, but she would reward them handsomely with pieces of candies twice their size, or with a trip to the foreign world that happened to be their backyard. Mary and Jamie saw Catherine a lot less than the other two when she was enrolled into a college, but her visits were well received by the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, their red haired sister seemed to be the most caring, but at the same time she happened to be the most negligent. Wendy worked at a local bookstore and would use her money for some things for the twins, including a dollhouse for the two to live in instead of an empty shoe box. Unfortunately, her kindness was often overlooked by her parents because of the rare moments when she would harm them, like accidentally sitting on them or pinning them under her foot without even knowing. Wendy would explain what she did, but her parents would hear none of it, saying that her sisters would say the same exact excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was trusted the least with the twins, since she would purposefully put them in bad situations but mask it as a new game. At times she would actually come up with something fun so it seemed that the less fun ones were purely accidental. The \"games\" ranged from remote controlled car races to the human yo-yo which consisted to either Jamie or Mary tied to a string and treated like a yo-yo. Of course, her parents would always would always walk in on the more dangerous games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom it's okay. They're safe and it's only been an hour since you left.\" Catherine's slightly annoyed voice spoke into a blue cell phone. \"You want me to put them on? They're asleep, but if you want me to wake them u-- okay I won't then. I'll let the sleeping angels lie.\" <br>\r\n\"Mom giving you trouble?\" Wendy asked, looking up from her laptop.<br>\r\n\"Do they really expect we're going to kill one of them?\" Catherine asked. <br>\r\n\"We might.\" Wendy joked, sharing a laugh with her older sister. \"The real question is, which one is going to die first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I like Mary, her happy go lucky attitude is going to get her killed.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! We're right here!\" A tiny voice called out, barely catching the attention of the two girls. They looked down to the couch that they sat on and noticed the shrunken children and Wendy brought them up to eye level. Mary and Jamie stumbled at the sudden change in altitude, causing the giant sisters to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad are gone for the next few weeks, so we'll be your caretakers.\" Wendy stated, grinning slightly.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to hell.\" Catherine added, making the twins feel uneasy. Catherine showed a wide, toothy smile to frighten the twins even more.<br>\r\n\"She's kidding.\" Wendy reassured, noticing the fear in the faces of the two. Wendy brought gem in closer and gave them a short, but comforting hug. \"Now, if it was Carla, then you'd have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Really!?\" Mary and Jamie asked in unison, their voices rising in excitement.<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" the blonde sister stated. Wendy smiled warmly and placed the twins on the counter to her left. Mary and Jamie carefully stepped down from the fleshy palm and landed on a bright brown counter. Wendy stood up from the couch, leaving the group and going for a gigantic box. The box was decorated in a blue wrapper with multicolored balloons. The box towered over the two, posing as a large building for the twins.<br>\r\n\"Woah, it's so big!\" Mary yelled, causing her older sisters to share an odd look. Catherine and Wendy shared a laugh at a joke that flew over the twins' innocent heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jamie asked. He walked up to box and pushed it, hoping to feel rustling noises.<br>\r\n\"Open it and find out, squirt.\" Catherine teased, lifting Jamie to the bow on top. He grabbed a string but had trouble pulling it as the knot refused to untangle. Jamie only sighed in embarrassment, and his sisters above laughed. Wendy leaned over and lent a helping hand to open the bow.<br>\r\n\"Come on Jamie, you're the man of the house now. Show off your strength.\"  Wendy chided, using her pale index finger and thumb to pull out the ribbon effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy unwrapped the present and began to pull out the gift. It was a large train set, with enough tracks to outline the house.<br>\r\n\"It's so you guys can go around the house safely.\" Wendy explained, taking out the train and placing it next to them. Mary and Jamie immediately boarded the locomotive and explored the train cars.<br>\r\n\"That's not all, we even got a cake.\" Wendy stated, causing the twins to sqeal happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad never got us a cake!\" Jamie yelled, clearly excited about the treat.<br>\r\n\"Well mom and dad aren't here, so we make the rules. And we say, let them eat cake.\" Wendy said, having some fun messing around with he family. Wendy grabbed a handful of the tracks with the intention on setting them. \"Help me out here, Cathy.\" Catherine agreed and helped her sister set tracks. They laid the tracks along the walls to avoid accidentally stepping on the tracks. They made sure to have it travel to almost every room, including a splitting tracks into their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday!\" Carla yelled from behind the twins, startling them enough to jump. <br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" the brunette boy said sarcastically. Jamie took a deep breath to calm his short burst of anxiety. <br>\r\n\"Wow, a train set. I guess mom and dad didn't like my helicopter idea.\" Carla said with a hint of disappointment.<br>\r\n\"Because having tiny children flying around the house in a helicopter at a dangerous height is a good idea.\" Wendy said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally ruined something I had in mind.\" <br>\r\n\"Whatever it had to do with that helicopter, I'm pretty sure it wasn't a good idea.\" Catherine scolded, setting down the final pieces in the living room.<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I'm done!\" Wendy yelled from another room, catching the attention of everyone else in the room. Catherine grabbed the toy train and set it on the plastic traps. The train whirred to life while a whistle came from a speaker. The locomotive began moving through the tracks, and Carla got an idea just by looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about ten minutes later, and Carla was left alone with Mary and Jamie. Wendy left to cook breakfast, and Catherine left to shower. The twins were watching the tv while Carla walked about the room. Carla searched the cabinets for some string, but she eventually resorted to using shoelaces. Mary and Jamie were peacefully watching tv until they were lifted up into the air by their sister. <br>\r\n\"Woah! Carla what are you--\" Jamie was interrupted by the shoelace wrapping around his mouth.<br>\r\n\"No it's not the yo-yo.\" Carla assured, wrapping Mary up with another shoelace. Carla carefullyplaced them on the center of the train tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going to grab a drink, so stay right here.\" Carla instructed, turning her back on them. They stared up at her giant form and screamed for help. They struggled against the string, but neither could get the string untied. Thirty seconds later, the high pitched whine of the train horn nearly stopped the hearts of the two. They felt the vibrations caused by the train and screamed louder than before. The train finally came into sight, and the two fought against their bindings. The little locomotive approached quickly and continued to threaten the lives of Mary and Jamie. The train grew larger and larger as it barreled down the tracks. The twins shut their eyes and hoped that some one would save them. The train's whistle was louder than before, an the two believed that they were screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud crushing sound in the air. Jamie opened his eyes to see a pale foot to his left, and the train that had threatened their safety was blocked by his older sister's foot. Carla's toes twitched and wiggled cockily, mocking the twins who were tied up against their wills.<br>\r\n\"I can't leave you alone for two minutes, without you two nearly getting killed.\" Carla scolded, stifling a giggle at the same time. The shrunken kids looked up at their sister and marveled at the sheer size of their sister. Whenever the twins were place on the floor, they were immediately humbled by their different perspective. Carla bent over and grabbed the tied up twins; she smiled at them while they gave her a look of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla opened her massive mouth and said...</span></div></div>",

This isn't a madhouse, so there will be rules to how this story turns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Rules:</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: A somewhat decent understanding of grammar is preferred.<br>\r\n2: One sentence chapters will be deleted after three days if there are no further acceptable additions.<br>\r\n3: A character purposefully killing a tiny is not allowed, but accidentally is acceptable.<br>\r\n4: Probably don't need to say it but no incest or sexual content please.<br>\r\n5: Feel free to add characters. (Friends, extended family, etc...)<br>\r\n6: Perspective shifts are okay as long as you make it obvious. <br>\r\n7: Enjoy yourselves and feel free to add chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, please make this include some sort of family bonding/hijinks. And by bonding, I don't necessarily mean taping a tiny person to another's foot. Try to write it like a normal, (or abnormal) family going through this situation. There are many stories on this site that have family members practically murder or torture their own kin for absolutely no reason other than, \"You're tiny, and I have always hated you. Now I'm gonna kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Characters:</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames \"Jamie\" A ten year old boy with messy brown hair and brown eyes. He's smart for his age and likes to think of himself as the mature twin, even though he's eleven minutes younger than his twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, (Twin sister) Jamie's slightly older, yet much less mature sister. She's silly and optimistic no matter what happens. She has the same shade of brown brown hair and eyes as Jamie. She'll probably think of shrinking as a fun situation with many opportunities for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine, the oldest sister, she's twenty one years old, and she is the one that is most likely going to play with the two of them for her own entertainment. Her parents wanted her to care for them because their mom doesn't trust her other sisters. She's blonde haired with blue eyes and a decent figure. She's incredibly bossy but not in a way that makes anyone dislike her. She's currently on break from college and she spends as much time home as she can.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWendy, the twins' eighteen year old sister, with strawberry-blonde/red hair and green eyes. She's gentle and treats them the nicest out of the three, but her somewhat playful instincts take over while seeing the two of them the size of dolls. She's laid back and lazy but will always be there for her family, even if  they're half an inch tall. She's not that athletic, but she often goes to the gym if her friends force her through the power of peer pressure. She's usually away from home at the local bookstore as her part time job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla, she's fifteen and looks up to her oldest sister, looking like a younger version of Catherine. She's extremely mischievous and slightly mean spirited, but she's a bit too clumsy for anyone to take serious. She's rough with the twins because they're the only ones she's really older than. And she might be oblivious to accidentally causing them pain. She's part of a ballet school in her free time, and she'll often tease Jamie and Mary with her smelly ballet slippers. </td>",
