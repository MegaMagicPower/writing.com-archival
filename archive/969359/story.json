            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pete looked out the window of the van at the five storey office buildings and shopping malls on the east side of the town of Spring Lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father had just signed on as manager of a local food processing plant. Unfortunately it meant a move - Spring Lake was a long way from the suburbs of Chicago that Pete had called home all his life. But at least Spring Lake wasn\u2019t a tiny town. And another plus was that it's in California - good bye snow, hello sunshine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Pete hadn\u2019t minded the cold that much - at least in Chicago he could hide his corpulent body under layers of thick clothes. Now, in the famous California heat, he imagined that there\u2019d be no way to go around without people staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete disliked being stared at - but stared at he was, due to his size. Pete was fat - hugely, undeniably fat. Just 18 years old, he already carried 350 pounds on his six foot frame, and a lot of it was fat. Pete was not at all muscular - one of his crueler classmates in Chicago had described him as a big blob of jiggling lard with arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's dad was a small, slight guy, just five foot six, and barely 140 pounds. He was a single parent with a busy job, and it seemed as if he tried to make up for the lack of time he had for Pete by making sure his only child had plenty to eat - plenty at every meal, and lots in between. Pete, to his occasional chagrin, had inherited his father\u2019s all-around appetite but not his hummingbird metabolism, and consequently had grown into an obese young man.  His dad did occasionally wonder how Pete could be so different from himself - yet still he provided Pete with endless snacks and always ensured he had generous meals every day, acting at times as if food could make up for his lack of time and the absence of Pete\u2019s mother. Pete, as a hungry male teenager, ate everything his dad provided - and Pete's size was the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete\u2019s dad stopped the van at their new house. It was a ranch style house in the suburbs. Pete slid out of his seat and stepped down into the yard to get a better look at the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the heat shocked him. Although Chicago is still hot in late August, it doesn\u2019t have the heat of California\u2019s sunshine - and Pete had just spent the last three days inside an air-conditioned van with his father, who ran warm, and liked to keep the air conditioning cranked. Within moments, Pete began to sweat so he reached down and pulled off his sweater. The white t-shirt beneath rode up with it and exposed his entire belly, which hung out like a vast sack of jelly. Pete quickly covered up his untanned white skin by pulling down the t-shirt. But the t-shirt was too short for Pete\u2019s gut, and ended an inch before his belly did, leaving a ring of furry white gut hanging below. Self conscious about his soft white gut, Pete glanced over at the house next door and noticed a curtain moving back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had seen him? \"Oh no!\u201d he thought, \u201csomeone saw me without a shirt! Great, nice first impression Petey boy.\" He quickly put his sweater back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad saw Pete putting his sweater back on and said, \"Ummm Pete? It's kinda hot here son, what are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, dad. Let\u2019s look inside...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***** <br>\r\n-&gt; NOW, PUT YOURSELF IN PETE'S SHOES &lt;- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push open the large French doors into the house and sigh with relief knowing no one can see you inside. You take off your sweater again and walk around in your too-small t-shirt. Dad walks in behind you and says, \"It's a nice place, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad. Looks great,\" you say and walk towards the back windows. There is a large patio and an above-ground pool (still empty) but at least it'll be someplace to swim later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow your dad down the hallway and he points out your room. You enter the roomy bedroom and are amazed at the space. There is a place for an entertainment system built into the wall (though nothing\u2019s installed yet) and the room is big enough to be a living room. You walk to the window to check out your view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the house next door.  But this time, there\u2019s a teenage jock standing in the yard, leaning against the fence that separates the houses. Wearing just a tank top and shorts, you can see that he is built, and is incredibly handsome. By the time you catch sight of him, you realize he is looking directly at you and smiling (or is that smirking?)  You decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You drag the bin into your room and realize that your sweater is making you sweat like a pig. You whip off the shirt and sweater and use your t-shirt as a towel wipe yourself off.  After a few minutes of cooling down you open the bin to find a new shirt to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter digging through the bin, you pull out a dark green t-shirt - the biggest one you own, though it still stretches to cover your fat torso. You always wear it with a vest, to distract from your fat, but it\u2019s really hot outside. You pull out the vest and drop it by the t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it isn't as hot as a sweater,\" you justify it to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a grease stain on your pants - probably from lunch on the road - so you haul out an old pair of jeans to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you strip off the pants, your tight briefs reveal a large ass crack. You\u2019re pulling on the jeans when you hear someone say, \"Oh! I didn't know you were in here! Excuse me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you look around, all you see is a shadow behind the door. <br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" you ask. <br>\r\n\"It's just me, your new neighbour. I saw you guys moving in and thought you might need some help,\" the voice explained from around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that it must be the handsome jock, and you feel embarrassed.  The guy must have seen you nearly naked!  He turns the corner and walks into the room. You freeze at the sound of his steps, you're not wearing any shirt yet, only jeans. You turn to meet him as he comes closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost...\" he says as his hand reaches out for your shoulder. He pats your shoulder, setting off a wave of jiggling through the fat all over your body. Your soft fat pecs bounce slightly and you raise your arms to stop the jiggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fold your thick soft arms over your flabby chest and tell him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's California, man, you don't need this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to wonder just how bright this guy is - he looks good (awesome physique, in fact) and he recovered quickly from being barrelled into, but he speaks just a little slowly... like maybe he's a bit dim?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you reply, and take off the vest - it IS too hot for it - and continue.  \"Come with me to the truck, if you want to help - there's lots to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me all the heavy stuff - I'm really strong,\" the jock answers.  As the two of you move down the hallway, he continues.  \"I'm Cal - what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete,\" you reply, thinking maybe Cal is just a touch slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Pete, glad you moved here,\" Cal replies.  He doesn't say anything else until you both get to the truck.  \"Grab that box,\" you say, pointing to one that you know is full of books and weighs a ton, \"and follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCal reaches for the box, then grunts slightly as he picks it up.  \"It is heavy,\" he says, and follows you back into the house.

Maybe he's not the type who makes fun of people who are different,\u2019 you think hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk outside where Dad is carrying a table out of the back of the van, pick up a couple of chairs and followed Dad back into the house. The two of you return for another load, and then another, then you speak up as you see a Sunfire pull out of a nearby driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I'm going to the mall with our neighbor Robbie Rosado.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Peter. Be back by nine, please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Dad'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later a shiny new black Pontiac Sunfire pulled up to the curb. You walk over to the car and drop your fat self onto the low seat as rap was blares from the stereo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool car, Robbie. Is it yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is.

He\u2019s changed, too, out of the t-shirt and shorts you first saw him in, into a pair of baggy jeans, a WWF baseball shirt (which he wears unbuttoned), a gold chain with a medallion that says Robbie on it, a pair of blue Timberland boots, and a sideways New York Yankees baseball cap.  And, boy, do these clothes look good - you wish you could dress like that.  You speak up, \u201cI like the way you're dressed.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could dress like you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you?

Why be should you be self-conscious about your size?\u201d Robbie begins, suddenly erudite.  \u201cJust because a person looks different, doesn't mean they're not a good person. People shouldn't be judged on appearances . It's whether or not they're a good person. When my family first moved here from LA we got harassed because we were the only Puerto Ricans in town. But once people stated to realize we were good people, we made friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\u201d you reply, a little surprised by Robbie\u2019s eloquence.  \u201cYou know, that\u2019s cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFreezer burn cool!  You and I are going to be great friends,\u201d Robbie says and grins at you. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he adds as he pulls into a mall parking slot next to an older Ford. He gets out and you follows him into the mall. Do the two of you... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite his big feed, Adam fairly bounces away -  with Moisha in tow - and they soon return from the ice cream shop with not two, but four absolutely huge banana splits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s two-for-one day at the ice cream shop,\u201d Adam explained.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t pass that up, now could I?  So I got two for each of us.  I know your appetite must be as big as mine, Pete,\u201d he adds.  Is this a challenge, you wonder, or just Adam trying to be friendly?  You look and there seems to be a glint of challenge in Adam\u2019s eye.  Oh well, big as he is, you\u2019re certain you can put away even more food than Adam.  With a flourish, Moisha put her two splits down in front of you, and Stacey picks up the spoon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you Pete?\u201d she purrs into your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d you reply.  After the six pieces of pizza, you feel a little full, but you\u2019re not going to let Adam get ahead of you - especially not with ice cream, one of your favourite foods.  Stacey feeds you the first spoonful, which tastes incredibly good.  You open your mouth again, and let her keep spooning the rich dessert in.  You are enjoying yourself so much, and the ice cream is so good , but Adam is a bite or two ahead of you...you motion Stacey to speed up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stacey spoons the last of the banana split into your mouth, you feel incredibly full.  Your pants are near to bursting - you really want to undo the top button, but not with Stacey beside you.  Moisha brings Adam a supersized Coke, but you turn down a similar offer.  Adam then suggests,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adam leads the way at a near jog, leaving you puffing to keep up.  Stacey sticks close to you, while the others trail along behind.  Adam stops outside the window of the mall\u2019s Big \u2018n\u2019 Tall, but Stacey suggests, \u201cThe Levi\u2019s shop has big sizes now, Adam.  Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they enter the Levi\u2019s shop, you wonder why Stacey suggested it. All the mannequins are rail thin.  But when a fairly porky sales assistant approaches, things look up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Adam,\u201d says the sales assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Brent,\u201d says Adam.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know you worked here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, they offered me more hours than the Big \u2018n\u2019 Tall, and since they have clothes in my size, I decided to come over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrent, this is Pete.  He needs some cool new threads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Pete, you\u2019ve come to the right place.  What size do you take?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate - you\u2019ve always hated announcing your size - it seemed so big, though with a big guy like Adam around.... Brent notices your hesitation and saves you from embarassment by whipping his tape measure from around his neck and saying, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s best to check.\u201d   He stretches the tape around your chest, then slips it down to your gut. \u201cBuilt like a barrel, eh?  So am I.  Those jeans are a bit tight, aren\u2019t they?\u201d he continues.  \u201cWe can do better.  Would you like black or blue?  And how about a bright new polo? Or are you a Levi\u2019s shirt man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Levi\u2019s shirt?  You haven\u2019t had one of those since he was 10 or 11!  Do they really come in your current size?  \u201cBlack jeans.  And a denim shirt,\u201d you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brent returned, with a couple of pairs of jeans and two shirts, you are both relieved and curious.  You take the clothes and go into the changing rooms - which were quite spacious - and look at the labels.  \u201cSize 54 jeans,\u201d you think.  \u201cAnd a 3XL shirt.  Wow.  No wonder these old 48s are so tight.\u201d  You try on the shirt, which fits snugly across your chest but a big tight across your gut, and then the jeans.  They are loose in the crease left by your old jeans, but aren\u2019t quite big enough to do up over your gut.  You call over the door to Brent, \u201cCould you get the shirt and jeans a size up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Brent.  He passes a bigger shirt and jeans over the door to you.  Ah.  These are better.  But, you think, if I\u2019m going to wear my jeans over my gut I\u2019ll need a belt.  You walk out into the shop to show off the new duds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool,\u201d said Stacey, \u201cthey look great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to start wearing your jeans over your gut?\u201d asks Brent.  \u201cBecause your old ones fit under your stomach, but they were so tight, it will take a while for your gut to adjust to the new larger size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam, meanwhile, is looking at the label on the jeans you\u2019d just tried on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cyou take the same size shirt as me.  But the jeans are bigger.  I need 46s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly remember that you have a couple of pairs of new 46s at home, that you\u2019ve hardly worn, and that certainly won\u2019t fit you know.

You'll have to have the gang over for supper, Pete, once we have the BBQ and patio set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete led Adam and Robbie upstairs, and dug in a bin for the too small 46s.  \"There you go, 'little guy',\" remarked Pete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam went to the washroom to try them on.  He came out wearing one pair. \"They fit great,\" he said.  Thanks, 'big guy' Pete.\" The three guys headed back down the stairs again, and out the front door, calling out to Pete's Dad as they went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going now?\" Pete asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just texted Bennett and he said they all went...\" Adam replied.</span></div></div>",

It stretches pretty close over your gut, but you\u2019re used to that.  You think, \u2018It won\u2019t come in bigger sizes.  I guess it fits ok.\u2019  You walk out of the changing room and Robbie says, \u201cWhoa, man, that\u2019s too tight.  I\u2019ll get a bigger one.  You should try on some board shorts, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoardshorts don\u2019t come in my size,\u201d you say without thinking, but Robbie\u2019s already gone. Maybe they\u2019ll have some jean shorts - sometimes you can squeeze into those, you think as you go back into the changing room and take off the 2XL t-shirt.  When you pop your head out the door, Robbie has reappeared with the same t-shirt in a visibly bigger cut, accompanied by a sales clerk - an enormous salesclerk, a black guy bigger than you are, and dressed in full surfer style.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother Robbie here says you need some larger sizes,\u201d the salesclerk began.  \u201cI\u2019m Zach, but my friends call me Sly - I own this place.

And some board shorts in 46, 48, and 50 waists.  If you need bigger, just ask - I take a 52 myself.  Oh, and try on this vest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you reply, and grin. \u201cThanks.  48 should do.\u201d  You take the t-shirt and board shorts and change into them.  \u2018Wow, this shirt fits great,\u2019 you think.  \u2018And the board shorts aren\u2019t bad,\u2019 you continue, as you relax your belly after pulling hard to do them up.  You step back out into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, looking phat, man,\u201d Robbie comments.  \u201cThat t-shirt really suits you, and those shorts are a lot better than jeans for the summer here.  Have you got swim trunks,\u201d he went on.  \u201c\u2018cause guys here go swimming a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you reply, disliking Robbie\u2019s use of the word \u2018phat\u2019 and feeling panicky at the idea of taking your shirt off at a pool.  \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, try on these surfer shorts then,\u201d said Robbie.  \u201cGotta do the pool - that\u2019s where all the girls hang out.  And guys too, if you prefer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d you reply,  nervous at the mere thought of what you\u2019d look like at the pool with your gut hanging out over a pair of surfer shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come out a minute later, though, Robbie and Sly both whistle.  \u201cMan, all you need is a tan,\u201d laughed Sly, \u201cthose doggies suit you fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pay the extremely reasonable prices for the clothes, and you and Robbie head back out into the mall.

Robbie seems to suggest things you\u2019d like just a moment before you think of them yourself - being out with him is fun!  Plus, he doesn\u2019t make jokes about your weight, or call you \u2018fat guy\u2019, like your so-called friends back in Chicago, and Robbie walks (struts, really, but with his body who can blame him) slowly enough that you can keep up without running out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you wander down the mall, and you notice that, in addition to Sly Dogg\u2019s, there\u2019s a Big \u2018n\u2019 Tall shop with some nice duds in the windows, and the Levi\u2019s shop has a sign to say they carry sizes up to 70 - and the big men\u2019s section of Target is right at the front entrance.  \u2018I wonder how many fat guys there are in this town,\u2019 you think to yourself.  You haven\u2019t spotted too many so far, but it was a weekday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the food court, you note the usual selection of burgers, fish, chicken, Mexican, Chinese, and Italian, but also a few surprises - something called \u201cFat Matt\u2019s Rib Shack\u201d, and \u201cGordo Gord\u2019s Tex-Mex\u201d .  The sign over Gordo Gord\u2019s featured an obese cowboy in a Stetson - the way you might look if you dressed western for a party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie leads you confidently towards Wendy\u2019s, where he orders a triple burger meal deal, supersized, with a large frosty.  You\u2019re surprised - yes, Robbie\u2019s muscular, but too many triple burgers and he\u2019d lose that that trim waistline.  You love Wendy\u2019s triple - it\u2019s one of the few burgers that even begins to fill you up - but you only order it when you\u2019re alone.  You wonder, but decide to play it safe, and order only the double burger meal deal with a medium frosty.  Your meals come, and you notice Robbie looking quizzically at your tray, then at you.  \u2018Oh no,\u2019 the fearful part of your brain says, \u2018here it comes, he\u2019s going to joke about me eating so much.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie clears his throat and asks, \u201cAre those shorts too tight? \u2018Cause I notice you\u2019re not ordering very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, they\u2019re okay,\u201d you reply.  Suddenly, though the shorts do feel tight - you\u2019re so accustomed to too-tight pants that you\u2019d asked for the 48s out of habit, but the more generous shirt feels so good...maybe you should have gone up a size in shorts.  Or two?  Didn\u2019t Sly himself say he wore a 52? And he looked good. It would be nice not to have waistband digging in all the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you\u2019re thinking, Robbie\u2019s hailing some friends across the food court.

Troy, Mike, this is Pete, he\u2019s just moved in next door to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, guys,\u201d you say, while trying not to stare too openly at Troy.  You may be fat, but you\u2019re certainly not as fat as Troy.  Troy\u2019s great fat gut lunges out over his beltline and bounces in front of him as he moves, below a set of fat man-boobs that bounce and roll down from wide, round shoulders.  Fat forearms poke out of a huge surfer\u2019s t-shirt, and one of Troy\u2019s thickly padded hands rested in Mike\u2019s thin hand.  Below, each of Troy\u2019s thick fat thighs appeared to be bigger around than Mike\u2019s slender waist, and fat calves bulged out of Troy\u2019s board shorts above fat feet.  Mike was about Pete's height and very thin - maybe 150 pounds, Pete thought, while Troy, who was shorter than Pete and Mike by a couple of inches, had to be well over the 400 pound mark.  \u201cGrabbing some lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Troy here is,\u201d said Mike.  \u201cI\u2019ll nibble something, but we have to keep Troy well fed - have to keep up his playing weight!\u201d  Mike smiled at his own joke, and looked lovingly at Troy.  Troy rubbed his stomach appreciatively, causing waves to ripple through its fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to eat every couple of hours,\u201d Troy said, in a deep voice that suited his huge frame.  \u201cThey say that having five or six meals a day is healthier, and I\u2019m living proof - six great meals a day keeps me the big healthy guy you see here.\u201d  He chuckled.  \u201cIs that a triple, Robbie?  And yet Pete, who\u2019s much bigger and healthier than you are, is not eating as much.  C\u2019mon, Pete, you\u2019d better have a second of those - or better, a triple yourself.\u201d  As Troy settles his massive frame on one of the food court\u2019s chairs, you\u2019re sure that the table attached to it sags slightly.  Mike looks at Troy expectantly.  \u201cLet\u2019s start with the usual,\u201d Troy rumbles, and Mike heads over to Wendy\u2019s as Troy turns to you and continues.  \u201cI see you\u2019ve discovered Sly\u2019s.  It\u2019s great.  But make sure you get your board shorts big enough - Sly can get whatever size you need.  He has shorts big enough for me, so he sure can fit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just thinking these might be a little small,\u201d you comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, take them back!\u201d responds Troy positively. \u201cSly\u2019s a big guy too - he\u2019ll exchange them for the right size.

Your face reddens with embarrassment, and you hang your head in shame. Troy lets out a deep chuckle, which moves his hefty belly up and down. He picks up a burger and hands it to you. He tells you, \u201cSound like you\u2019ve been starving yourself the entire day. You can\u2019t do that to yourself. Take one of my burgers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about to protest against Troy\u2019s act of kindness, but an even louder, and stronger growl comes from your stomach. It was almost like it was thanking Troy for you.  Despite the anticipation that your body feels from the food it is about to consume, you are still hesitant about taking some of Troy\u2019s meal. This problem quickly reaches its conclusion when Robbie rises from the table, and says, \u201cLook like we\u2019re going to need to get some more food. Mike, you think you can help me out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Mike as he rises up from his seat. \u201cAnything in particular, you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get as much as you can carry. Seems that we are both starving, right, Pete?\u201d states Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as chow down on the burger. You would\u2019ve let out an answer, but you\u2019re attention is currently focused on finishing your food. When you finish, the only people at the table are Troy and you, as Robbie and Mike haven't returned yet. Troy has also consumed all of his food, so you two start talking.

It\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019ll have to ask Sly to measure you and check what size shorts you need, but it would be even worse if Robbie found out just how big your gut really is.  You\u2019d gone with the 48s because they didn\u2019t sound too bad, and were at least bigger than the 46s you\u2019d been squeezing yourself into - but you knew you should have bought 50s, maybe 52s - you just don\u2019t want to admit to anybody, least of all a new friend, that you have a FIFTY inch gut!  You double don't want to admit that to somebody as fit and slim as Robbie.  \u2018I might admit my size to Troy,\u2019 you think to himself, \u2018he\u2019s bigger than I am, but to Robbie?

You know, we big guys can\u2019t get away with wearing clothes that don\u2019t fit, not if we\u2019re going to look good.  Now, what you need to do is drop those too tight doggies and let your stomach settle for a minute, then I\u2019ll measure you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the changing room and pop off the 48s, after a momentary struggle with the button. Your gut, released from imprisonment, drops gently down.  Boy, does this feel good, you think, as your stomach seems to settle and spread down and out. \u2018I guess that\u2019s what Sly meant by \u2018letting my stomach settle\u2019 - boy do I look fat,\u2019 you think to yourself, studying the outline of your hanging gut in the changing room mirror.  You call to Sly, then sit on the bench in the changing room.  A moment later, there\u2019s a rap on the door, and Sly pushes himself into the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady Pete?  Let\u2019s see here,\u201d Sly says as he steps into the changing room, soft cloth tape in hand, \u201cjust what size me boy Pete needs.

You really want to buy two pairs, they\u2019re so much more comfortable than the old ones, but you don\u2019t have enough money - especially as Carla brought over some mammoth 5XL t-shirts to match the jeans. You decided to take a dark blue one - though in 6XL, as the 5 XL was almost snug across your belly, and, well, no sense buying snug clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, I\u2019ll come back next week to buy another pair, and maybe a denim shirt,\u2019 you think.  \u201cI hope you\u2019re here the next time I come,\u201d you say to Carla as she rings up the purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your new board shorts back on and the new jeans safely in a shopping bag, you head back to the food court.  You practice your slow strut again, and by the time you get to the food court, you\u2019re really hungry.  As you look across the food court to where Troy had been, you see Troy and Robbie and Mike, and on the table beside Troy a pile of trays and empty food containers.  Troy himself is in the midst of 'engulfing' an extra large pizza.  You notice that neither Robbie nor Mike are eating, though it looks like Robbie finished off a banana split after his burger.  You rumble up to the table.  \u201cHey guys, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still here. Boy, Troy, have you got a big appetite,\u201d you add, motioning towards the pile of empty containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a little celebration,\u201d says Mike, as Troy slid another slice of pizza into his mouth. \u201cJoin us for a bite - or a feed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you reply, your gut gurgling gently inside the huge new shorts.  \u201cWhat are we celebrating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t tell you when we first met, but this is a special day for Troy, we\u2019re celebrating his latest corporeal enhancement - he\u2019s now as big around the gut as he is tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you reply, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Robbie.  \u201cIsn\u2019t it cool?  Troy\u2019s five foot eleven, that\u2019s 71 inches tall, and when Mike slapped the tape around his gut this morning it was 71 inches around, so they came down here to the food court to celebrate!  Mike is eating something from every restaurant here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA big something,\u201d agrees Troy, his deep voice rumbling.  \u201cLike this extra-large pizza.  You should join me, Pete - those bigger board shorts look much more comfortable - I\u2019m sure there\u2019s room in there for a bit of celebrating.  I was going to eat from Gordo Gord\u2019s next - you like Tex-Mex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d  The smell of the pizza is making you hungry, and your stomach, loose and comfortable in the bigger board shorts, gurgled its readiness to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Mike, I think we\u2019ll need four orders of Gordo Gord\u2019s super special, then,\u201d says Troy.  <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come help you carry them,\u201d says Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and Robbie come back with two trays simply heaping with food - quesadillas, tacos, enchiladas, refried beans, rice, sauces.  \u201cFour of Gordo\u2019s specials,\u201d says Mike, grinning.  \u201cWhen he heard you were sharing it with a friend, Troy, he threw on extra quesadillas, beans and rice.  It sure smells good.\u201d Mike puts his tray in front of Troy, and Robbie puts his in front of you.  \u201cEat up, guys,\u201d Mike said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t eat all this,\u201d you remark, looking at the huge mound of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, eat as much as you can.  What you can\u2019t eat, I will,\u201d says Troy. His stomach rumbles noisily as he picks up a quesadilla.  \u201cI love Gordo\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start in on the mound of food, the smell making you ravenous.  As you eat, you watch Troy tucking steadily into his pile - Troy attacks the food with such intensity, it's cool to watch, especially as you can see the enjoyment in his eyes.  Mike and Robbie make sure that both you and Troy have a full glass of Pepsi to hand, and you find that you\u2019re eating more than you expected - and, surprisingly, not feeling full - as you chow down on rich, spicy Tex- Mex.  As you start in on the last couple of tacos you look across at Troy, who is smacking his lips on the last crumbs. \u201cWow,\u201d you say, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve eaten all this.  It\u2019s good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Gordo\u2019s is good, and once you\u2019ve had one of his quesadillas, you just have to have more,\u201d replies Troy.  \u201cFeeling full yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, a little, but I could eat more,\u201d you reply, truthfully - but also not wanting to loose face in front of this fellow fat guy and one man eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the advantage of buying clothes that really fit - they leave room for food.  I was hoping you\u2019d still be hungry, \u2018cause there\u2019s still three restaurants I haven\u2019t eaten from, and I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll eat along with me.  Fat Matt\u2019s Ribs are next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, three restaurants?\u201d you reply.  \u201cI dunno if I have that much more room....\u201d  You rub your gut gently.  It felt larger, and harder, though the feeling isn\u2019t uncomfortable.  In your old 46s, your reflect, you were never able to eat this much.  A little thought crosses your mind, that if you eat so much more with Troy, your new shorts will get as tight as your old 46s were.  \u2018I\u2019ll get new ones,\u2019 you firmly tell yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Troy says, pushing.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of being a big guy if you haven\u2019t got a big guy appetite?  Maybe we should have a sweet break first - that way we\u2019ll stroke Baskin Robbins off the list.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds cool, guys, but I\u2019ve got to go,\u201d interrupts Robbie, standing up.  \u201cPete, do you want a lift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you home, Pete, if you want to stay and celebrate with us,\u201d Mike says.  \u201cI\u2019ve got a car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They look about your own age, and you see Mike and Robbie greet them familiarly.  Both are very good looking, in a stacked way - not skinny chicks at all.  The taller of the two gets to the table first, indicates you, and asks Robbie, \"So, is this your new boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou splutter for a moment as Robbie says smoothly, \"No, this is my new neighbour, Pete.

Rosita, Pete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" says Rosita, \"then I have a chance.

Of course, he is bigger than you are...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManfully, you steadily chomp, chew and finally engulf the entire tray of Chinese.

Troy then gets up - amazingly easily for someone so large, who's just eaten so much - and says, \"Off to the scales at Nutrition House.  500, here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up much more gingerly, and Rosita gives you a tummy rub.  Your gut aching, you follow Troy through the mall to the Nutrition House, who's scale is outfront.

Then he lets go and realises they're meant to be worn under his gut - he turns and looks in the mirrors and sees that they ride high over his massive butt, and dive down at the sides to slip under his gut.  Wow, real fat guy clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete comes out and says, \"I'll take the board shorts, the trunks, but not the rash guard.

Pete picked out a couple, and went to the cash with his new stack of clothes.  \"Shall we just give away the too-small ones?\" the clerk asked, and Pete said yes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete, in new board shorts and t, did his best to copy Robbie's slow strut as the two emerged from Sly's.  \"Now,\" asked Robbie, \"polo and cargos, or food court?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete replied, </span></div></div>",

He parks and you both get out and go over to the recreation centre in the park.  Daphne, looking tired, is just coming out the doors with two other girls.  \u201cDaphne, this is Pete, he\u2019s just moving in next door,\u201d Dan says. \u201cPete, this is Daphne, Georgie, and Ellen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Pete,\u201d Georgie and Ellen say together.  Pete\u2019s eye is immediately attracted to Georgie.  Not too tall, not too short, and very curvy, almost heavy, with a sweet smile.  Ellen is taller and thinner - not really your type - but Georgie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaphne invited us all back to her place to swim,\u201d Georgie says, looking straight at you.  \u201cWant to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you reply without thinking.  Oops, now you have to appear in swim trunks in front of her! Smooth move, Pete, you\u2019ve only just met her, you think.  Darn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five of you get into the Taurus, and Daphne and Ellen tell amusing stories about the antics of their campers that day.  You sit quietly worrying about stuffing your fat self into your swim trunks.  As you get out, Georgie comes up beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeeling ok?\u201d she asks quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you reply.  \u201cI just don\u2019t know if I should go swimming while Dad is still unloading boxes.  And I have to go home for swim trunks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d says Georgie. \u201cI have my bikini with me, so I\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitates - you really want to go home to avoid appearing in swim trunks in front of this beautiful girl.

'Good looking'.  You. All 375, no, probably 380 pounds or more now, of you. Georgie must really like fat guys, you think.  Question is, how big are you going to get if you keep eating second breakfasts, and big lunches, and 'snacks' with Georgie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr does any of that matter, if you like Georgie and she likes you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rumble along, hand in hand with Georgie, your fat gut swaying and bouncing with every step, you feel content.  Maybe it doesn't matter how big you get?  Maybe, just maybe, you're actually enjoying being big, for once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're certainly enjoying eating, your contentedly full stomach reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk goes on longer than yesterday's, long enough that you're starting to get thirsty, when you spot a another beachside snack stand.  Georgie, with her unerring ability to read your mood, or at least your appetite, is heading you towards it, and as you approach you smell corndogs and popcorn and your gut gives a little gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that,\" laughs Georgie.  \"Hungry again?  Or just thirsty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty,\" you reply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get drinks then,\" Georgie says, pulling you gently towards the counter.  There's nobody else waiting, it being too early for lunch, so you've got a Big Gulp sized Pepsi in your hand in no time.  Georgie watches you sucking down the calorific liquid for a moment, then says, \"We should catch the beach shuttle back to my car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, not 100 feet away, there's a bus stop, with a minibus waiting.</span></div></div>",

At last, all the 'moving in' stuff is done, desk and bed and chair and all furniture in place, even some posters on your walls.  Your laptop is on the desk - though Dad agreed that your gaming system could run on the new, big screen TV in the new family room. Even your wardrobe and closet are full of clothes - organized clothes - that actually fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKinda amazing, that last part, after years of clothes that were too-tight, that never fit, but you have Georgie to thank for helping you with your new, California wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's also been helping you with your new California waistline - you are the biggest you have ever been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n402.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n402 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weighed yourself this morning, after another of your Dad's big breakfasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped on the scale, and it rolled up to - more than 400 pounds.  402 pounds of - solid contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolid, but rather jiggly contentment.  You know it's jiggly because Georgie keeps grabbing and jiggling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you don't remind yourself that 402 pounds is a 27 pound gain since you met Georgie - a 27 pound gain in a week!  No, you just remind yourself that Georgie likes big guys.  Big guys who eat. And that with her around, you certainly are a big guy, and becoming an even bigger guy.  A big guy, who LOVES to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it's time to get your 402 pounds of bigness into the new swim trunks Georgie helped you purchase, as she's coming in 15 minutes to take you to Nancy's pool party.  You are really looking forward to the party - Jeremy, Nancy's big boyfriend will be there, and you want to become friends with another big guy.  And Georgie and Nancy have both dropped hints about some other big guys coming too... new potential friends, here in your new California home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the flower patterned new trunks up onto your stomach, then let them slide back down to under your gut before tying the waist cord.  Then you pull a new t-shirt, this one with a huge palm tree on it, from the selection of new t-shirts Georgie helped you pick out.  Your flip flops are by the door, downstairs, but you'd better take a towel and a dry pair of trunks, just in case. Sunglasses, 'cause the water is bright, too.  And downstairs you'll grab your contribution to the feast from the fridge - a whole trayful of appetisers that your dad helped you bake last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the steps creaks gently under your weight as you descend.  Quickly through the kitchen, then - yes, there's Georgie out front. She comes up the walk and takes the tray from you, then you follow her down out to her car, feeling hungry for her as her hips sway in front of you - almost as hungry for her as you are for the spread of food you know will be at the party!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, you are sauntering up to Nancy's house with Georgie. The front door is wide open, and you navigate through the house - past rows of dishes ready to serve - and out onto the pool deck, where Nancy and Jeremy get up to greet you. You look around and see...</span></div></div>",

You also see that Arin looks bigger than you - a LOT bigger than you!  <br>\r\nArin is wearing flippers on his hands and feet, and at the end of the pool he executes a surprisingly graceful turn to come back - rather like watching an elephant seal reversing.  You find your eyes following him as he surges back towards you.  Beside him, Beck seems like a pilot fish beside a whale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother length and he stops, then swims over to the steps.  He lifts his great body to the vertical, and starts to walk up out of the pool. As you watch he emerges like a great, fat water god, water streaming off his colossal, rotund body.  He takes off the flippers and hands them to Becky, then advances towards you and Georgie, swinging one colossal thigh past the other, huge calves and feet moving steadily as the great gut above bounces and sways from side to side, and above Arin's monstrously fat pecs shimmy.  His whole body seems to be in motion at once, shifting, bouncing, or just rippling.  Clearly he's very strong, as he's not really waddling, despite his size.  As he gets close, he sticks out a hand, and says, \"You must be the new guy Georgie's picked up. Welcome to the family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand is thickly padded, but the squeeze he gives you is strong - stronger than you can squeeze back. Up close, you realise he must be about six foot three?  He smiles and says, \"You're bigger than many of Georgie's old boyfriends!  Did you know that?  You're what, around 400 pounds maybe? How long has she been working her magic on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arin!\" says Becky almost as a riposte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK,\" you reply, \"I don't mind now.

She leaned in from the front, sinking into his avoirdupois, and he bent his cheek down to accept her kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgie then straightened up and came over to you and took your padded hand in her petite one.  \"Jeffery Charles, this is my new friend Pete, he just arrived in California a week ago. Pete, this is my big brother Jeffery Charles, but everybody just calls him J.C.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Pete,\" rumbled the mountain of flesh, coming close.  Pete decided to stand his ground, and stuck out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi J.C.,\" he said in return, projecting a confidence he didn't quite feel, in the face of this intimidating immensity of male bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prodigious big brother spoke again.  </span></div></div>",

They're so tight, they've given you an unnatural shape. I'm thinking you should get only shorts with stretch waists for now - no fixed waists, no belts, nothing to constrict your middle - you need to free your belly and let it go back to a natural shape.

Haven't you always been a big guy?  Don't you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've always been big, but 400?  That's huge!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete, it's only 10 pounds away from now.  Are you huge now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, no, I don't know.

Look, Jeremy and I need to introduce you around our friends, I think. In the meantime, eat up!  When you finish, we'll go do something fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by Georgie's enthusiasm, you pack away the rest of the paella, and all of Georgie's linguini, while she taps furiously at her phone.

Step into the fitting rooms here, and strip off those too tight things, and let's see what size you really need.\"  You follow Zach into the fitting room area, and you struggle to get the t-shirt over your head, and then with a sigh of relief drop your ridiculously tight jean cut-offs.  \"Those were insanely tight,\" says Zach forthrightly.  \"How could you eat?  Breathe deep, in and out a few times, to let your gut relax, so I can get an accurate measurement.\"  Zach put the tape around you, and you place a finger on it to keep it from slipping.  \"68 inches round the gut, 67 round the chest. Breathe in and out a few times for me....no, stop trying to hold your gut in!\"  Zach puts out a hand and bounces the lowest hanging part of your stomach, which makes it sag further.  \"Let's try 60 inches for the jeans.  Georgie, bring your boy some 60/30 jeans and a couple of 5XLT shirts?  I'll just go out and grab a few other thing for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Georgie passes some huge new clothes under the door for you, and soon Zach has brought a selection of other things into the changing room.  You find them all too loose at first - but as you keep trying on the generous garments, you realise they are the right sizes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a belt?\" you ask, thinking that these nice fitting jeans are likely to slip down if you laugh or cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, suspenders are better,\" Zach says.  \"Here's a pair, like the ones I've got.\"  You clip them on and find that Zach is right - and it's nice not to have any pressure on your belly, for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick out some more shirts and a second pair of jeans - it seems strange to have clothes that actually fit, that aren't screamingly tight - and add in couple of polos and two pairs of shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put all the purchases on the card your Dad gave you, and happily head out to Georgie's car with your purchases - all except the ones you're wearing!  Once they're in the trunk, Georgie takes you to an all you can eat breakfast buffet, where you throw back plate, after plate, after plate of food. After the heavy meal, you and Georgie go back to your place<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Georgie start to make out up in your room. While you're sitting on your bed, Georgie pulls your shirt off and runs her hand across your belly. Soon enough you're both down to your underwear. Ten minutes of heavy petting later, you try to sit up, but Georgie pushes you back on the bad and started to play with your belly again.  Then, with a nice push, she rolls you over for a minute and pulls down your boxers to start playing with your butt. Georgie stops abruptly and said that she was so sorry, but you reply, \"No, no, it's okay,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over and add, \"Keep playing with my belly, it feels good.\" Georgie smiled and said, \"Pete you're just the best!\" </span></div></div>",

Breathe deep, in and out a few times, to let your gut relax, so I can get an accurate measurement.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts the tape around you, and you place a finger on it to keep it from slipping. \"68 inches round the gut, 65 across the chest. Breathe in and out a few times for me....no, stop trying to hold your gut in!\" Edward puts out a hand and bounces the lowest hanging part of your stomach, which makes it sag further. \"Let's try 60 inches for the jeans. Georgie, bring your boy some 60/30 jeans and a couple of the 5XLT shirts he was eying? I'll just go out and grab a few other things for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Georgie passes some huge new clothes under the door for you, and soon Edward has brought a selection of other things into the changing room. At first, they all seem to loose, but as you keep trying on the generous garments, you realize they are the right sizes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a belt?\" you ask, thinking that these nice fitting jeans are likely to slip down if you laugh or cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, suspenders are better,\" Edward says, \"belts restrain your stomach too much, especially when you're eating - you can just let the pants slip down if you're really full. Here's a pair, like the ones I've got on.\" He helps you clip them on and you have to agree with him - and it is SO nice not to have a belt pressing on your belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick out some two button-downs, a pair of shorts - it seems strange to have clothes that actually fit, that aren't screamingly tight - and add in couple of polos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best not to buy too much right now, since your body may change shape now you're out of those deathly tight jeans,\" Edward declares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, he might grow a bit,\" Georgie says teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward just raises an eyebrow at this and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put all the purchases on the card your Dad gave you, and happily head out to Georgie's car with your purchases - all except the ones you're wearing! Once they're in the trunk, Georgie takes you to an all you can eat breakfast buffet, where it's like the new, well-fitting clothes just give you licence to unleash your appetite.  More and more food slides down into your liberated stomach, and indeed you find the jeans sliding down as you fill up.  Eventually, you're full - and you and Georgie go back to your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your room, you and Georgie start to make out. She undoes your new button-down and runs her hands across your belly. Soon enough you're both down to your underwear. Ten minutes of heavy petting later, you try to sit up, but Georgie pushes you back on the bad and started to play with your belly again. Then, with a nice push, she rolls you over for a minute and pulls down your boxers to start playing with your butt. Georgie stops abruptly and said that she was so sorry, but you reply, \"No, no, it's okay,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over and add, \"Keep playing with my belly, it feels good.\" Georgie smiles and says, \"Pete you're just the best!\" </span></div></div>",

Can you help with with this box???!\" dad yells from the porch, and you snap out of your state of bewilderment and take one last look before going to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in the kitchen and see your father dragging a huge box of something into the front door. You help him out and lift the other side up, carrying it to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this??\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some canned food, and anything else that wouldn\u2019t spoil on the trip. Money's going to be tight for a week, until I get my first paycheck, so I had to save all the food I could,\" he answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" is your only answer. Canned food is not your favourite - you'd rather have things fresh, preferably in big servings - so you can get full.  Dad looks at your face and sees your disappointed look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's alright.. don't worry. As soon as I settle in at the plant, I'll be bringing home the defects, same as before..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a daily event back in Chicago.  Dad would bring home some of the defects; food products with ripped boxes, broken caps, popped bags, or simply things that fell off the conveyor belt in the building. Eating all that was one of the main contributors to your weight gain. You'd be playing Nintendo or finishing homework and Dad would come home with a box of chips, cookies, chocolates, and sometimes up to a dozen pies in bent boxes. Of course, you would strive to empty the box, and Dad would bring home another one the next day.  While you started in on the defects, Dad would cook up steaks and mashed potatoes for supper, or pizza, but as soon as you\u2019d dispatched those you\u2019d return to the \u2018good stuff\u2019 - the endless supply of cookies, chips and pie.  You particularly remember one Saturday night two years ago when you and Dad rented some movies and the two of you completely pigged out all night on a huge pile of junk food that he had saved up. You wore your sweat pants to have more room for food, and by the end of the night you could hardly move, your belly was so hard and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile with the old memories and forget your disappointment with the canned food. The memories soon lead to hunger. After five minutes of helping dad, you feel like you haven\u2019t eaten in years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you bring in a box of clothes, you hear the doorbell ring. Dad answers the door and is greeted by two middle aged people. You watch from down the hall as they shake hands, and talk. They are obviously new neighbours, welcoming us to the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear dad say, \"Yeah, he should be down in his room... go and take a look if he's there...\" <br>\r\nYou duck your head into your room and quietly shut the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps coming and you get nervous, so at the last second, you hop into your open closet and hide around the corner, making yourself look busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and you hear a deep \"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peak your head out from around the corner and are stunned again by the jock type guy standing in your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm hey,\" you answer, beginning to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm Ted, your neighbor. I saw you in the window earlier,\" he responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe see what you\u2019re wearing (the heavy shirt, jeans, and fleece vest) and looks at you like an idiot.

Your body sways in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, take that vest off, it's not healthy, you'll get heat stroke.\" he says, stepping to your side and beginning to pull the vest off the wet shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are frozen with fear.

Ted walks up behind you and puts one hand on your tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks good doesn\u2019t it,\u201d he says, smacking his lips.  \u201cI bet the two of us could finish it off.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a good day, you think, you could finish it off yourself, but you\u2019re not quite ready to admit that to Ted.

He hasn\u2019t exactly got a very big gut - a six pack of muscle seems more likely under the t-shirt he hasn\u2019t yet taken off.  But, you have met skinny guys who could eat - one of the guys in your school in Chicago could eat almost as much as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the lasagna out of the fridge and scoop two big portions onto plates.  You stack them in the microwave and touch 'reheat'.  Ted, meantime, has put forks and knives on the table and is pouring out milk for both of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk's ok?\" he asks, as he comes over and grabs one of your love handles gently.  You used to hate people to touch you, but Ted's touch is different, somehow - it's not as exciting as eating, but it does make you feel good.  You turn and put your fat arms around Ted.  He grins.  \"I like this,\" he says, and hugs you, his muscled arms sinking deeply into your love handles as he squeezes.  \"Sometimes I wish I was bigger, just to see what it would be like to be two fat guys together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave beeps and you settle down to eat.

As he lifts your huge fat body a few inches, he says, \"Boy, what was that, Niagara Falls?  I haven't heard that much gurgling since my sister had laryngitis.\"  Ted starts laughing at his own joke, and relaxes his arms..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof,\" he says, as your great weight comes to rest on his chest again.  \"You really are a heavy dude.

C'mon, c'mon, let's go,\" he says, throwing the clothes to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate.  The yellow t-shirt fits you not too badly, but you hate the color - stretched over your fat gut it makes you look like some sort of obese yellow sun god.  And the denim shorts will be tighter than tight - you can get them on if you want to - flab flows - but your gut will hang out over them, making you look even fatter.

And I like fat guys and gals.  Fat is cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think fat is cool, why aren\u2019t you fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t gain weight.  It might have something to do with running every day and playing soccer and basketball, I suppose.  I like to eat, but I don\u2019t gain weight.  And nobody in my family is fat,\u201d Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you reply.  \u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t make fun of me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPete, I don't make fun of fat people - in fact, I once beat up a guy for making fun of some fat people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!  Well, stick around then.  I know that yellow shirt is pretty tight, and I\u2019m not sure I even fit in the cut-offs any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you do them up, if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off the vest and the warm shirt.  Boy, that feels better already, as the moving air from the ceiling fan above hits your suddenly naked back.  Ted looks at you admiringly, then asks, \u201cDo you need a hand unbuttoning those jeans?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you reply.  Reaching around your gut to get at the button of your jeans has been an increasing pain the last couple of year, and if this guy wants to do it... Ted moves in, and his big square hands are suddenly digging into your gut to release the button.  Instinctively, you try to suck in your belly, even though you know it doesn\u2019t make much difference.  Ted fumbles with the button for moment, then gets it free.  The weight of your belly, released, forces the zipper down.  \u201cSee, I told you I was fat.  I hardly fit in jeans anymore.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the jeans off, and Ted hands you the yellow t-shirt.  It is even tighter than you remembered, and when you\u2019ve got it on, it encases your fat chest and fatter gut like a second skin.

You\u2019ve got them up your thighs, but getting them over your butt is not going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.  They used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple of years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple of years ago!

You try to pull the waistband together to button it, but you can\u2019t quite, so Ted, shoulders bulging, helps you there too.  As soon as the waistband is done you pull up the zipper, and then start to get up, but the tightness of the cut-offs means you can\u2019t even bend enough to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ted, can you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, anything for a big guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of you, with lots of grunting, you\u2019re on your feet.  \u201cSorry about that,\u201d you say to Ted, \u201cbut at least the cut-offs are done up.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look  in the mirror and see that your gut now hangs over all the way round the top of the cut-offs.  Together with the yellow t-shirt you look more than ever like an obese golden sun.<br>\r\n\u201cCan you walk in those?\u201d asks Ted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you say, and start waddling with short footsteps towards the door.  \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle slowly to the front door, and the cut-offs really start to cut into your sides.

Most of your magnificent mass came from the food your Dad hauled home, not from public gorging.  In fact, you\u2019re not sure if you like buffets - sure, there\u2019s lots of good food, and people around you also chowing down, but you were never sure that people weren\u2019t staring at you too.  And, you hardly know this guy - what will he think of your appetite?  After all, it doesn\u2019t look like he eats very much....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was before I discovered there\u2019s some muscle under your flab,\u201d Ted replies.  \u201cI don\u2019t like guys who are just fat, but I like strong fat guys who like to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tummy rumbles again at the word \u2018eat\u2019, and your mouth waters.  Ted suggested the buffet, the hungry part of your brain says, take him up on it.  After all, now that you\u2019ve been on top of him, you know that he likes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd judging by that sound,\u201d Ted continues, pushing hard on your gut, which gurgles again, \u201cyou like to eat.  I like you a lot.  And I like to watch guys eat.  I like to eat along with guys who are eating lots.  Maybe some day going out with fat guys who eat will help me put on a little weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe,\u201d you reply, still a little suspicious.  You find Ted incredibly attractive - but in your experience, beautiful people like Ted only hang around fat guys in order to make fun of them.  Why should Ted be different?  Especially when he\u2019s already made a crack about how big you are.  Still, he was lying on top of you a minute ago, and obviously liking it.  \u201cWhere is this buffet, and what does it cost?\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a few minutes away, in the Clifton Heights Mall.  We can take my truck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a truck?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it used to be Dad\u2019s, I use it for everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, but first I have to find some clothes that fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t keep clothes around that don\u2019t fit,\u201d replies Ted.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big guy warehouse outlet near the buffet, if you need some new threads.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much money,\u201d you say, \u201cI haven\u2019t had a job in a while, and Dad\u2019s been between jobs for two months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poke around in the boxes for a bit, but you know there isn\u2019t much that really fits you anymore.  And you don\u2019t have the money to buy more clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have any money for clothes, maybe I can help,\u201d says Ted.  \u201cYou pick out some jeans and t\u2019s, and you can pay me back for them later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks,\u201d you reply.  You wonder why this handsome guy would offer to buy you clothes, but you do need the clothes...and maybe he honestly wants to be a friend.  \u201cI\u2019ll squeeze into something, and then let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull an old pair of khakis from a box, and a golf shirt.  Trying to get the khakis buttoned you realise you\u2019re going to need to lie down to do them up.  Ted watches you struggling, then says, \u201cYou want a hand?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to do these up without lying down,\u201d you reply.  Ted\u2019s strong hands grab the ends of the waistband and pull them together.  Usually you hate people to touch you, especially on your fat belly, but you find you hardly notice Ted\u2019s knuckles digging into your flesh.  Together, the two of you finally get the khakis done up and you pull the old red golf shirt over your head.  The materials stretches to skintight as you pull it down over your chest and broad belly. You try to do up the buttons at the chest but it\u2019s hopeless, the material is stretched so tautly across your soft pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d says Ted, \u201cthose are tighter than tight.  You really need new clothes, don\u2019t you?  I\u2019ll be glad to help you out with new jeans.\u201d  You start to head out and he follows at your side.  Going down the hallway his hand occasionally bumps your protuberant lovehandle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m going out with Ted for a while,\u201d you call down the hallway to the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK,\u201d your Dad shouts back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out the front door and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look down at your own bigger-than-average frame but then your gaze rises up to Marty, who is - by far - a larger man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks to be about 430-450 pounds, definitely larger than the average. His arms and legs are short but stocky - there definitely seems to be some muscle and strength in them - but he would need strength in his legs to hold up his thick, mountainous body. He looked less like a man than a balloon of flesh, really, with his belly jutting out heavily in front of him, tucked into the latest trend in pants. You wonder how he ever goes to the bathroom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a wide grin, showing off a pearly smile. His thick cheeks pull back happily as he walks from behind the counter. You see his belly is much larger than you assumed. It's actually quite round, not only is it very wide but it seems very deep too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his cheery smile approaches you, you can't help but step closer. He seems like a really friendly person, someone you'd want to get to know.</span></div></div>",

He quickly checks his hair in the reflection of the window and leaves the room. You try to sit up, but your belly gets in the way so you roll over to your side and get up on your knees, then grab your shirt and stand up. You pull your pants up, button them as quickly as your chubby fingers can go, and throw on your shirt, tugging it down over your belly as you head after Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the bottom of the stairs and see Ted leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice guy,\" your Dad says, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say, a little out of breath from racing down the stairs too fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be back later,\" Dad says. \"Now, are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I ever,\" you say, realising that you haven't eaten for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go clean up and we'll go for food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple weeks pass and you don't see Ted longer then five seconds as he moves from his house to his car. You dismiss your neurotic neighbour and look forward to your new life in California. As you explore the area more, you see that the neighborhood is full of adults and not many teens or even kids. Your Dad meets some neighbours and some friends at his new job, but they're all typical Californians, tall, skinny, tanned. The biggest people you see around the neighborhood are some large Latino men at the Taco Time. You hope summer hurries up and ends so you can get to college and meet some friends and do something. You pass your time on your computer and watch TV and play video games in your air conditioned house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother month of sitting inside doing nothing adds another 2 inches to your gut. You don't know your weight since your scale only goes to 350 and you were past that when you moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning when you're having breakfast with your Dad he asks, \"Can you mow the lawn today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you agree without looking up from your Super Sugar Puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best to do it before this afternoon,\" your Dad suggests, \"It's going to be a hot one today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm off,\" Dad says and gives you a quick hug and heads out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waddle your way back to your bedroom, still in your boxers, which are a bit tight on you with the couple more pounds you've gained. You hate to see what college is going to do to you with the freshman 15. You sit down at your computer and visit a game site and see an ad for an online comic book and begin reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slips away and soon you realize that it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon and you haven't mowed the lawn. You sigh and check the weather site and see that the temperature is 107F out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" you sigh to yourself. It was only 70F this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you better cut the lawn and you dig around and finally find some shorts that fit, but not well. You can't completely fasten up the Velcro waist strap and they're skin tight, but they're the best you got. You decide the wife beater you're wearing now is good enough so you head downstairs, grab a glass of cold water and head out into the hot afternoon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\ninstantly you feel your body sweat.  You sigh, walk over to the small shed, fish out the lawn mower and start it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot sun makes you hot and you feel your shirt quickly get moist from your sweat. The sweat drips down from your forehead and you curse yourself for not doing this sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just about done when you see a familiar face enter your backyard. You see that it's Ted, dressed in some black shorts and a blue t-shirt. You let go of the lawn mower and let it turn itself off and say, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little hot,\" Ted says walking closer, \"You look a little sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hotter then Hell out here and I'm a fat guy, what do you expect?\" you question and put your hands on your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed seems to loose his place for a sec and says, \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want something?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed doesn't answer, so you sigh and turn away.  You start the lawn mower again and begin pushing and after a few steps feel some skinny arms wrap around you and a tongue lick your ear.  You feel someone's weight on your back and you fall forward. The lawn mower stops itself again as you land on your gut with someone on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so hot,\" Ted's voice whispers into your ears as you feel his arms grab your rolls of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me you freak,\" you say angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fight it,\" Ted whispers and you feel him move one of his hands down to your waist and peels back your tight shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone will see us,\" you say and struggle to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Ted says, ripping your pants and underwear down, then lying down on your back. You feel something poke you.  \"I've been watching you.\"<br>\r\nYou feel Ted's dick slide in between your legs, you decide to play along and begin to moan as Ted begins to hump you. You feel afraid of being found lying on the freshly cut lawn with your attractive next door neighbour attempting to have sex with you. But you have to admit you're turned on that Ted is back and his skin is touching yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've grown fatter, pig,\" Ted moans as he gyrates against you and squeezes your rolls of flab even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you fake moan, \"I was bored so I kept eating and eating and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\"  Ted moans loudly and you feel something wet spray your upper thighs. Ted slowly comes to a rest on your back and lets go of your love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do now?</span></div></div>",

You continue digging and finally find a shirt that fit you well 6 months ago, but you've gained at least 10 pounds since then.<br>\r\nYou slip the shirt on and you find that the shirt is a bit tighter then you remembered. It's tight around the chest and you can feel air against the bottom of your belly.<br>\r\n\"Here comes another box,\" Ted announces as he walks in holding a box in his arms,\" Your Dad pointed a pile out.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" You say.<br>\r\n\"That shirt looks a little small for you,\" Ted says in a flirty voice,\" Are you trying to tease me?\"<br>\r\n\"It's the only thing I could find,\" you sigh,\" I've outgrown all my other clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll have to show me later,\" Ted says and pats your gut and tells you to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ted's help, the unpacking goes a bit faster then you imagined. He tells you how he lives with his folks next door and he works down at the mall at a store you didn't quite catch the name of. He says the house has been pretty quiet for awhile and he thinks it used to be a winter house for some Canadians, or something. After a couple of hours everything is unloaded and most of the boxes are in the right rooms and ready to be unpacked.<br>\r\n\"I'm beat,\" says your Dad wiping his brow and then fanning himself.<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" you agree and see your shirt is once again soaking wet from sweat.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you boys go out and grab some food,\" your Dad suggests,\" I'll start to unpack the kitchen supplies.\"<br>\r\n\"Aren't you hungry Sir?\" asks Ted.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I can wait for you boys to bring me a hamburger,\" your Dad says and takes out his wallet and hands you  a 20.<br>\r\n\"Com'on Pete, I'll drive,\" Ted tells you.<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you say,\" we'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\nYou walk to the door and follow Ted across the front lawn to his place and you see that Ted has a medium sized car.<br>\r\nTed unlocks the car from his keychain and you get in.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we're alone again,\" Ted says with a smile then asks,\" what do you feel like?\"</span></div></div>",

Old tapes of the teasing you took in Chicago start to play in your head.  Ted starts to look like all the good-looking, stuck-up guys in Chicago who had made your life hell as a tubby guy in junior high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, it\u2019s what my mum always says.  I think she means that fat guys sweat more in the heat.  But I sweat a lot when I get hot too, and I\u2019m not fat.  I couldn\u2019t be - my parents are diet freaks.  Everything in our house is low-fat, low-calorie.  They\u2019ve even got my 10 year old sister on a diet.  I\u2019d like to bulk up a bit for football, but I can\u2019t do it in our house.  I\u2019m 178, but I\u2019d like to be 200. I tried out, and I can run and throw, but coach says I\u2019d get crushed by all the bigger guys.  Those linebackers are all over 250! I need more heft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds really bad.  Can you stay and give us a hand with unloading?  Then we can make dinner, and I promise nothing will be low fat.  Dad might take us out to dinner, but I don\u2019t know - money\u2019ll be tight until he gets his first paycheque.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sounds good.  I came over with my parents to welcome you - they probably brought your dad some granola bread or something.  They won\u2019t mind if I stay to help.  But you should change that t-shirt - it\u2019s soaked through, you might not want to do the wet t-shirt thing the first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig into a box and find some clean t-shirts, and grab one with your old school logo on it.  Ted watches you - which makes you uncomfortable, so you turn away.  As you turn he asks you,<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going out for football?  You\u2019ve certainly got the heft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d you answer.  \u201cI didn\u2019t at my old high school in Chicago - you would have fit in there, the football coach wanted all skinny guys.\u201d  The t-shirt is really tight, but at least it\u2019s long, and you ease it on over your fat shoulders and heavy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, that shirt is pretty small,\u201d said Ted.  \u201cDo you have a bigger one - it\u2019ll be more comfortable outdoors in the heat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, they\u2019re mostly this size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there are a few shops in this town that stock cool clothes.  If you want somebody to go with you, I\u2019d be happy to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt they\u2019d have much in my size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised, I think.  The linebackers on the team shop there, and they\u2019re not small,\u201d says Ted, flexing his broad shoulders.  You are suddenly conscious that this hot guy really has no bodyfat visible under his tight t-shirt.  \u201cAnyway, I\u2019d like to stay and help, especially if there\u2019s a meal afterwards.  The only thing about living with my parents is that I\u2019m always hungry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018And you look it,\u2019 you think, \u2018I\u2019m sure I could count every muscle under that t-shirt.\u2019 Out loud you say, \u201cSure, let\u2019s go ask Dad what else needs done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ted spend the next couple of hours hauling boxes and furniture.

Ted does sweat, you notice, just as he said - not that a wet t-shirt is an eyesore on his body, no, exactly the opposite.  As the three of you are finishing up, and your dad says, \u201cLet\u2019s go for supper, I think we deserve it.  Ted, do you know any good places around here?  I think I remember a Chinese buffet on the way in from the highway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there is, but I\u2019ve never been there,\u201d said Ted.  \u201cMy parents don\u2019t believe in buffets - we don\u2019t eat out a lot,\u201d he went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you like Chinese, Ted?\u201d your dad replies.  \u201cI know Pete does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d replied Ted.  \u201cI\u2019ll just go home and tell my mum that I\u2019m having supper with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell her I insist on it as a thank-you,\u201d your Dad replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed runs off to his house, and you note that even for that short distance he runs - no wonder he complains he\u2019s too thin.  Ah, well, you love buffets, and you hope Ted will appreciate the chance to eat while not under his parent\u2019s watchful eye.  Maybe you can do this regularly with Ted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad, meanwhile, is backing the car off the dolly behind the truck that carried it from Chicago.  The car looks pretty dirty, but starts right up.  You hop into the front seat, feeling the car sag beneath you in its usual fashion, just as Ted returns.  He says, \u201cThey said yes,\u201d and he climbs in. The three of you zip off to \u201cGolden Key Chinese Buffet\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet\u2019s entrance is an impressive area carpeted in red and gold, filled with the heavenly smells of good Szechwan with a couple of benches to wait on and a very pert, very young waitress to greet you.  When your dad asks for a table for three, \u201cnon-smoking\u201d, she motions to another waiter to seat you.  \u201cWow, he\u2019s as big as me,\u201d you say under your breath, as a fat Chinese guy, who looks maybe 20, comes forward.  He smiles, and leads you to a table near the steam tables.  He casually whips one chair away from a table for four, \u201cto give you room,\u201d then motions you to the side with only one chair, looks you straight in the eye, winks, and rubs his protruding tummy with his free hand.  He then turns to your dad and Ted to ask them what they\u2019d like to drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you proceed to the buffet tables, where your dad starts with soup and a noodle salad, while you and Ted get straight down to business with the main dishes. Soon an array of delicious food is piled high on your plates, and you sit down to eat with relish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed matches bite for bite through two platefuls, then sits back and says, \u201cBoy, that was good, I wish I could eat more.  And there\u2019s dessert there - we never have dessert at home.\u201d  Your Dad has gone back to the steam tables for a bit more, so you lean forward to speak quietly to Ted.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to eat a bit more, then you have to drink a bit of the Chinese tea - it helps digestion - and rub your gut a bit,\u201d you say.  \u2018Not that Ted has any gut,\u2019 you think, \u2018 but that might change.\u2019  Ted looks a bit doubtful, but does as you suggest.  \u201cIn a circular motion,\u201d you add, and his face lights up as he massages his full tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, it feels like there\u2019s lots of space in there now,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201c Where\u2019d you learn that trick?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFrom my grandpa,\u201d you reply.  \u201cHe liked to eat too, but he was a skinny guy like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I eat like this a few times, I won\u2019t be so skinny,\u201d replied Ted, heading back to the steam tables.  \u201cI feel like I could eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have the following 2 choices: <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here's the money for the food.\" As he says this he hands you some cash. You notice there's more than enough to pay for the buffet - your dad knows you might want to eat more later.  \u201cSorry about this,\u201d he adds, as he heads towards the door.  \u201cGrab a cab if you can\u2019t find a bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Dad, don\u2019t worry about us,\u201d you say to his departing back.  It\u2019s not the first time your Dad has had to attend to an emergency at the plant - and this time, like before, you\u2019ll make up for it in food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you shove your swelling gut back from the table and follow Ted for more food - he may say he\u2019s feeling full, but you\u2019re nowhere near your capacity - the fat waiter comes by.  You motion him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy skinny friend is complaining he\u2019s full already,\u201d you say to the waiter.  His smile broadens as you go on.  \u201cDo you have some tea or something that would help him?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter breaks into a grin as he replies.  \u201cOh yes sir - a special tea that helps all guys have a bigger appetite.  I drink it regularly!\u201d  He pats his hefty tum and goes on.  \u201cJust make sure he drinks lots of it.\u201d  He bows and then positively zips off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head off to the steam tables, and when you return, you see a new, larger teapot sitting at the table.  You also notice that the waiter replaced the teacups, and filled them with the new tea - a fragrant, sweet-smelling pale green brew.  \u201cMake sure you have some tea, Ted,\u201d you suggest to him, as he chows down on his chow mein noodles with pork.  \u201cIt does help the digestion.\u201d To reinforce your idea, you lift your cup to your lips before digging in.  As you set it down, you feel hungrier than before.  \u201cGo on, have some, it\u2019s good,\u201d you say to Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheers!\u201d he says, as he empties the cup.  \u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d he says, and pours himself a second and then a third cup.  \u201cThis stuff is good,\u201d he adds, and returns to his plate with renewed vigour.  The fat waiter cruises by at that point, and winks at you over Ted\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ted both dig into your food.<br>\r\nAs you eat - the beef bourguignon is delicious, as were the onion rings and the lasagna before it - you cannot believe you're still hungry. What's more, you can't believe that Ted, who is far skinnier than you, is still hungry. You look across at Ted and notice that his once flat stomach is starting to pooch out over his belt. Of course, it isn't anything like your belly's massive swag - which is stretching out towards your knees - but on a lean guy it is surprising. Your jeans are getting uncomfortably tight, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ted, are you still hungry?\" you ask through a mouthful of Chicken Tetrazzini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed clears his mouth of the poached salmon he's been wolfing down, and replies, \"I can't believe, but I am. I'll get big if I keep eating like this. My jeans are getting tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start in on a plate of veal cordon bleu, the waiter reappears with another cartful of food. You suddenly notice that he looks fatter than he did a few minutes ago. Your jeans are unmercifully tight, so you decide to ask him for a favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I borrow a phone? I think I need to call home for different pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your pants have gotten too tight? Frankly, sir, they looked too tight when you arrived. No need for you to phone. If you look in the closet on the right, I think you'll find some jeans and shirts to fit you better. You too, sir,\" he continues, turning to Ted. \"No sense wearing tight clothes when you enjoying good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, and there's an ominous ripping sound from your jeans. Your belly flops out over the waistband and hangs out an enormous distance - you're used to not seeing your feet, but the size of your belly is now something else.

What's more, you can't believe that Ted, who is far skinnier than you, is still hungry. You look across at Ted and notice that his once flat stomach is starting to pooch out over his belt. Of course, it isn't anything like your belly's massive swag - which is stretching out towards your knees - but on a lean guy it is surprising. Your jeans are getting uncomfortably tight, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ted, are you still hungry?\" you ask through a mouthful of Chicken Tetrazzini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed clears his mouth of the poached salmon he's been wolfing down, and replies, \"I can't believe, but I am. I'll get big if I keep eating like this. My jeans are getting tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start in on a plate of veal cordon bleu, the waiter reappears with another cartful of food. You suddenly notice that he looks fatter than he did a few minutes ago. Your jeans are unmercifully tight, so you decide to ask him for a favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I borrow a phone? I think I need to call home for different pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your pants have gotten too tight? Frankly, sir, they looked too tight when you arrived. No need for you to phone. If you look in the closet on the right, I think you'll find some jeans and shirts to fit you better. You too, sir,\" he continues, turning to Ted. \"No sense wearing tight clothes when you enjoying good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, and there's an ominous ripping sound from your jeans. Your belly flops out over the waistband and hangs out an enormous distance - you're used to not seeing your feet, but the size of your belly is now something else. You waddle gently over to the closet - funny how you hadn't noticed it before - and open the door. Inside you find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have to yank pretty hard to do up the 54s; the 56s are better, but still too tight.  To your surprise (but secret pleasure) it\u2019s the 58s that fit - but they\u2019re still very snug. Perhaps you\u2019d better take some size 60s?  You look and see that there are even some size 62s!

Soon, though, he\u2019s slowing down.  \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel full,\u201d he complains, just as the fat waiter comes by.  You motion to the potbellied Chinese server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy skinny friend is complaining he\u2019s full already,\u201d you say to the waiter.  His smile broadens as you go on.  \u201cDo you have some tea or something that would help him?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter breaks into a grin as he replies.  \u201cOh yes sir - a special tea that will help you both to have a bigger appetite.  I drink it regularly!\u201d  He pats his huge, globular tum,  bows and then positively zips off, his huge body bouncing gently under his uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dig in to more Singapore noodles, and shortly the waiter returns, bearing a  large teapot.  \u201cHere it is,\u201d the waiter says, setting it down with a flourish. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit small - just make sure he drinks lots of it,\u201d he says, gesturing towards Ted.  The waiter heads off bearing two empty trays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fill the teacups with the new tea - a fragrant, sweet-smelling pale green brew.  \u201cHave some tea, Ted,\u201d you tell him, as he sits looking longing at a plate of beef with broccoli.  \u201cIt does help the digestion.\u201d  To reinforce your idea, you lift your cup to your lips and drain it before digging in.  As you set it down, you feel hungrier than before.  \u201cGo on, have some, it\u2019s good,\u201d you say to Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheers!\u201d he says, as he empties the cup.  \u201cHey, that\u2019s smooth.  I\u2019m thirsty,\u201d he adds, and pours himself a second and then a third cup.  \u201cThis stuff is good,\u201d he adds, and returns to his plate with renewed vigour.  The fat waiter come in with two new trays of food, and winks at you over Ted\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortified with the special tea, the two of you return to pigging out with a vigour.  Plate after plate of Chinese and Chinese-American foods vanishes into your two hungry bellies.  Amazingly, Ted not only keeps up with you, he actually seems to be putting away more food than you are - a reaction to the state of semi-starvation promoted by his parents, perhaps.  After a while, the little female server appears, towing a cart laden with desserts - sweet cakes in sauce, brownies, cheesecake, fruit flans, even small tubs of ice cream reposing on ice. \u201cPerhaps time for something sweet?\u201d she asks before she heads out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the time!\u201d says Ted, sitting back for a moment and massaging his bloated belly as you\u2019d taught him.  \u201cShould be getting going soon - but I\u2019m having dessert first.  We never have it at home.\u201d  He grabs a tub of \u2018Decadent Chocolate\u2019 ice cream and a spoon, and digs in.  You join him, but start with cheesecake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty-five minutes later, after finishing the tub of ice cream and a big selection of other desserts, Ted pushes back his chair and says,...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an old one that had a few stains on it, but what made it embarrassing was the fact that at least an inch of flab hung out in front below it. The shirt had been big enough - once - but Pete's gluttony had packed on enough pounds to outgrow the it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPete marched right outside and up to the small fence between the two houses, where his new neighbor was leaning. He noticed two things as he walked:  first, the neighbor boy was also wearing a shirt that looked a size too small, but his body made it look so appealing. The boy had a ripped torso with more muscle than anyone Pete's age back home. He looked like a model with his clothes so tight showing off his sculpted body. The second thing Pete noticed was that the bulge in the young man's pants was growing with each of Pete's blubber bouncing steps, as Pete lumbered over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete has his suspicions confirmed when he saw the guy's eyes dart all over his chunky body. This guy was just as turned by Pete's body as Pete was with this guy's. Pete wasn't sure how to handle having a guy turned on by his size, but this guy was too gorgeous not to try something! Pete wanted to say something besides 'hi' but that's all he could think of as he took his last step up to the fence. \"Hi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" was the only response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pete wasn't the only one nervous! However the other guy didn't have Pete's big stomach, that got noisy for the smallest things, and his current nervousness was all it took for Pete's stomach to gurgle and growl before either of the guys could say anything more. The noise was sudden and loud! There was no way Pete's neighbor didn't hear it; indeed, he smiled really big when he heard it and his eyes went straight to Pete's big belly. Pete's eyes noticed a twitch in the hot guy's bulge; it seemed to pulse after Pete's gut growled. It became clear to both guys that there was a strong sexual chemistry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the future of Pete's relationship with the hot neighbor? Do the guys develop a secret sexual affair, a fattening fledgling romance, or do they repress they sexual urges and channel that energy into an intense rivalry?</span></div></div>",

James, shirt off this time, was staring into his window. His heart raced again, his face flushed and he felt himself getting hard. He had a hot neighbor who was turned on by him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lay down in bed trying to think about how he'd get to know the guy tomorrow, but the excitement soon turned to familiar nervousness. A half-seen chub seen through sweatpants wasn't enough to undo years of self-consciousness. Pete began to question his own observations. Maybe he hadn't seen what he thought he'd seen. Pete tossed and turned, and didn't get to sleep for another hour and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unsurprising, then, that he didn't get up until 11 a.m. the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, where Pete blundered hungrily, was an apologetic note from his Dad and 40 bucks. \"There should be enough here for a cab to breakfast. I'll get groceries on the way home from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete's car in Chicago had been so old, they didn't think it would survive the trip. They decided to sell it to one of his friends, and they'd buy a new one here. A cab seemed like a waste of money, but he was starved. He took a quick shower and threw on some shorts. The shirt he'd worn yesterday stared at him from the same corner. But he ripped open another box and threw on an over-sized hoodie -- one of the many garments he was resigned to wearing to hide his body. It was 80 degrees outside, but he decided he'd bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out to the driveway when common sense hit. This isn't Chicago, it's a cul-de-sac. You can't just step outside and hail a cab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started to go back inside when he saw James in the neighboring driveway, washing his truck. Well, he had the hose on it. What he was actually doing was staring again. They made eye contact for a second but the confidence that made Pete step forward yesterday had deserted him. He turned to go back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete heard the water shut off, and steps behind him. When he turned around he saw James had already closed half the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete wasn't sure what to say, so he threw out: \"Do you know a good number for a cab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Dad left cash for a cab ride to get breakfast somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause while both boys tried to figure out how the third sentence spoken between them was about something so random. Pete tried to fill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any food in the house yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nobody out here takes cabs. You'd be waiting an hour for them to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give you a ride, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated the truck he'd been washing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was nervous again. Was this further forwardness? Was the chub he'd been so sure of yesterday real? Was this guy just being nice? At the moment, the only thing he was sure of was his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames races back to his truck and opens both doors, while Pete hurries gently behind him.  As Pete approaches the truck door, he sees James staring at him again, but James breaks it off as Pete climbs in.  As Pete grabs the long seat belt and appreciates the wide, generous seat, James starts to drive off.</span></div></div>",

Pete wasn't familiar with the menu, but James ordered expertly. Pete was kind of in awe of what James had ordered, and wondered if the $40 he got would cover the whole bill.

I mean if you're ok with, or don't mind if, that, um...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James fumbled and mumbled his explanation, Pete was putting two and two together. He was certain now about everything! He could hardly believe it, but this hot, sculpted, muscle jock was into Pete, not in spite of his heft, but because of it. With a surge in confidence, Pete decided he was going to see where this could take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want me to eat all of this junk. I'm already pretty chunky, eating like that could make me fat.\" Pete rubbed his gut as he spoke - and the effect on James was almost instant. Pete could see the bulge in James' jeans grow, and James sighed, heavily. Pete knew that what he was doing was turning James on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would find me attractive if I eat like a pig, and get big and fat?\" Pete paused seeing if James would jump in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he did, though meekly. \"I would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess a few couldn't hurt,\" Pete said and began to pull some of the food out of the bag. \"Oh yeah, you could have a few, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete began to eat, making as much noise as possible, moaning and saying, \"it's so good,\" pausing and leaving space for James to softly encourage Pete to \"have another\" or \"eat a bit more\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete coyly replied, \"I shouldn't\", only to change his mind and \"have just a little bit more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour the bags were empty, and Pete was genuinely stuffed. Even for him, it was a lot of food. The guys drove back, and sat in James' driveway. Pete was amazed, but confused. Here was this amazingly hot guy, who was turned on by Pete, who he just had an incredibly erotic experience with, yet neither one had touched the other or themselves. The silence was getting unbearably awkward, and Pete decided he was just going to go into his house and figure this out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went to get out of the car he heard James say, \"We should do this again sometime!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I keep eating like that, I'll get too fat!\" Pete joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No such thing,\" James retorted, looking most confident. Pete could only look at the handsome and trim young man and smile. He walked, slowly and heavily into his house, wondering how often he would get to meet up with his new neighbor, and how much weight he would gain if he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow often does James drop by to take Pete out to eat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So James would drive Pete to a fast food place, order a whole slew of fattening junk, and Pete would eat it as they whispered to each other about how eating like that would make Pete fat. There was even some touching after the first few sessions. It started with belly rubs and such, but there was some kissing and making out after Pete ate his fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth guys found the experience incredibly arousing, and soon found that mere thoughts and memories paled in comparison. The guys were soon meeting up everyday, sometime twice a day. James loved to watch Pete eat; the more the better. Pete was a big eater but what James wanted was a lot for him, at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks, Pete was able to pack away half the menus at the fast food places. It wasn't just with James anymore, that Pete was eating big. He was getting used to stuffing himself; he really enjoyed being full. Pete never noticed himself eating larger portions at every meal. It just became second nature to keep eating till he was full. Pete also didn't notice his clothes getting just a bit tighter each week, it was James that noticed, he was keeping a close eye on Pete's body, relishing every new curve or bulge, or growth Pete showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete may have been oblivious to his growth but James was not. Which is why Pete was surprised when James asked him flat out if he was ever going to buy bigger pants, or if he was just going to wear the ones he had till they literally burst off of his fat ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPete was taken aback. James had never been so firm or blunt with him before. He looked in the mirror, and realized James was right. His jeans looked painted on. That's when Pete realized how much he had grown, since meeting James, who was right, Pete was growing a pretty fat ass. The two had a good laugh and went off to the mall, to buy some new clothes. The whole time James is making Pete try on all kinds of clothes, showing how everything clings and shows off Pete's new girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was bringing so many pants and shorts for Pete to try on, it dawned on Pete that James must like big butts! Pete thanked his lucky stars, because the weight he gained had found a new home in his lower body. The guys enjoyed their little shopping trip. In the end they decided that Pete needed pants with room to grow. They planned on continuing their daily meet ups/feeding sessions, and figured Pete would only get bigger, so might as well plan ahead. Well, James thought that and Pete agreed. Their routine continued, until?</span></div></div>",

Pete, forgetting for the moment that he's taken off his sweater and is supposed to be helping his dad unload the truck, turns toward the coolly-dressed fat guy and heads towards him, jello-belly bouncing free in the sunshine.  The fat boarder dude comes towards Pete, and as get close he says, \"Hi!  That was cool, how you saw off that jerk Jake!  I don't think any of us fat boys has ever whipped off a shirt to him before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked Pete.  \"Does he go around insulting fat guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's about it.  He's a genetic freak - don't let all his talk about working out in the gym get to you, he doesn't work out for more than five minutes at a time, he's just genetically lucky.  I'm Luca,\" the hefty guy continues, holding out a broad, fat hand.  \"Glad to meet you - welcome to our neighborhood.  Glad to have another fat boy on board - if you don't mind me saying so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't,\" Pete says, still feeling a bit fired up from his confrontation with Jake, and now from Luca's praise.  \"I'm fat, and that's that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good stuff!  That's how I feel.  Just arrived?  Need a hand?\"  Luca put down his skateboard - which seemed to have particularly large wheels - and as he did Pete noticed that Luca 's arms seemed to have a fair bit of muscle under padding.  His arms are huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuca noticed Pete noticing.  \"Yeah, I DO work out,\" he said before Pete could ask.  \"Can nearly benchpress my weight - which is a not-inconsiderable feat,\" he continued, relaxed and confident as he bounced a hand off his not-inconsiderable gut.  \"I can certainly outlift ole' Jake.  You'll have to come to the gym with me!\" said Luca with certainty.  The two of them walked up into the back of the truck, and Luca grabbed a couple of large, heavy boxes.  Balancing them partly on the top of his gut, he asked, \"Where do these two go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all labelled,\" Pete blurted out, a bit taken aback by Luca's 'fat-boy' confidence.  \"Those two go to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great stuff!\" said Luca as he headed down the ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Luca's help, the truck was soon empty.  The three of them even got all the furniture in the right rooms, and a sofa unpacked so they could sit on it.  Pete's dad then said, \"Hungry boys?

At least he seems friendly, unlike the \u201cmuscle bods\u201d you knew back in Chicago.  Your daydream of how he\u2019d look fatter pops up as you start to follow him, but you banish it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or two of hard labor, with Simon\u2019s willing help, and the truck is empty - though the house is full of boxes.  You\u2019re feeling bushed, and your Dad is distinctly drooping, though Simon seems to be hardly affected - of course, he\u2019s carrying around a lot less weight than you are.

Following him in, you've realised that he's even bigger than you thought - as the generous polo and shorts illustrated.  A waiter, a substantial guy - though not quite yours or Perry's size - is at the table instantly, and Perry orders a 'double cheeseburger basket, and a chocolate shake.'  You follow suit, feeling relaxed and deciding to indulge your appetite for once.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you wait, Perry uses the jukebox controls at the table to put on some music, then asks you about coming to California.

He looks at you and says, \"Do you want bigger trunks?  There's a spare set in the cabana that should fit you!\"  You head back in and yes, hanging up is another huge pair of Hawaiian trunks, these ones in blue with palm fronds on them.  You pull them on and, wonder of wonders, you have to pull on the drawstring to get them tight enough!  Is Perry that much bigger than you are?  You hear voices and come out to see several people around the pool - one looks like Perry, only older, and...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
