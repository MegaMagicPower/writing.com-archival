Once the women heard him speak however something clicked within their heads as they now not only thought Tails was the most attractive thing ever but some even started to drool. \u201cOh nothing is as important as you...\u201d Since she was being addressed to the princess couldn\u2019t help but answer. \u201cGreat can one of you come over to my place in the Mystic Ruins? Thanks!\u201d With that said Tails signed off leaving the women ticked, \u201cWow how rude can that brat act? Thinking he can speak to any of us like that just because he\u2019s handsome!\u201d Rouge scoffed as Vanilla continued with the topic she spoke of earlier, \u201cThis is what I was trying to say earlier he\u2019s starting to become quite naughty as of late...\u201d The word \u2018naughty\u2019 hung up with all the women as they all came to the conclusion that they needed to teach him a lesson but in a way that would meet their current perversion as each formulated their own plan as they came together to decide which girl would accept Tails\u2019 \u2018request\u2019.</span></div></div>",

Rouge looks at her with a pissed off look. \"Of course i am! Im gonna teach that brat of a fox a lesson for talking to us like that\"She said. \"Good luck Rouge\"Vanilla said in her calm yet worrying tone. Rouge scoffs \"I dont need luck\"she said before flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tails was preparing his place for the female that decided to arrive. He had a smug grin as he did so. \"Finally i will have some action\"he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge eventually reached his place and banging on the door* \"Tails open up!\"Rouge said. She was tapping her shoe on the ground until the door opened revealing tails. \"Rouge what a surprise!\"Tails said amazed. Rouge slightly flinched as his voice felt rather smooth and rather made him be more handsome. However she shook off the feeling as best she could and needed an excuse on how to make him believe that he was in control of the situation</span></div></div>",
