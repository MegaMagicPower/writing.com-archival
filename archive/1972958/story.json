But I love money and tangerines!\" yelled Nami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This guy's a stupid, worthless pirate. He doesn't seem to have anything worth stealing, but maybe he could still be of use to me.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about it? Do you want to be my navigator?\" asked Luffy, ignoring Nami's outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said NO\u201d yelled Nami as she threw a punch at Luffy, knocking him to the ground and causing a bump to appear on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was seething at Luffy until she realized how effective it was. Nami then got a huge smile on her face as she walked towards Luffy. As Luffy was about to try to get off the floor, Nami slammed the heel of her right foot into the middle of Luffy\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! What was that for?\u201d demanded Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. You may be strong, but you\u2019re weak against me, pirate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not weak! And my name is Luffy\u201d replied Luffy as he was trying to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t\u201d stated Nami as then quickly grabbed the rope on the table right next to her and tied up Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s the weak one, Luffy? I just beat you with no effort at all. How does that make you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy just stared at her in shock. Nami completely overpowered him; her punch was so strong even though he was made of rubber and then she pinned him to the ground before tying him up. He was completely at her mercy and he could not believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow the question remains as to what to do with you, Luffy.\u201d She pulled out a small dagger from her pocket and knelt on the ground so that she could get close to Luffy\u2019s face. Although she had no intentions to kill Luffy and stoop to a pirate\u2019s level, Luffy didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cI can kill you now or, if you swear to become my pirate thief subordinate, I\u2019ll untie you. Those are your options. Either way, your life as a pirate ends now.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And yet, as he said the next few words that would seal his fate, it was not because he was afraid of death; he was afraid of Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll join you, Nami. I\u2019ll give up being a pirate and become a pirate thief\u201d said Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well\u201d responded Nami with a smirk as she took her dagger and cut the rope to free Luffy. She then sat on a chair and kicked off her shoes in Luffy\u2019s direction, which Luffy was able to dodge in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that for, Nami?\u201d asked Luffy, wondering why she took off her shoes and kicked them at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re used to doing whatever you want and being your own boss. But that\u2019s no longer true as I am now your boss. I need to train you to obey my orders, no matter how small, so that whenever our lives are in danger, you\u2019ll obey me in those situations as well. And to start, I order you to rub my feet until I tell you to stop. I want you to familiarize yourself with my feet and feel lucky that you get to have this honor of massaging my feet. But more importantly, I want you to learn that I am indeed your boss. And since I am your boss, you will not call me just Nami anymore. You will either call me Boss or Nami-san. Perhaps in time, you\u2019ll even refer to me as Nami-sama. Now get to it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen here, Nami, I will not rub \u2013\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was interrupted as Nami punched him in the face, sending him to the ground, and then put her bare right foot on Luffy\u2019s face. \u201cThis is precisely why I am ordering you to do this. And this is just the beginning. I need to break this insubordinate behavior out of you right away. Now get to work on my feet\u201d concluded Nami as she sat back down again with a huge smirk and Luffy confused and scared at how strong Nami\u2019s attacks were against him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll massage your feet.\u201d Luffy then stepped closer to Nami and then got on his knees as he picked up Nami\u2019s right foot to massage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Luffy? Life won\u2019t be so bad being my underling. Many would kill to be in your situation now, serving a beautiful woman like me. But first\u2026\u201d said Nami as she pressed her foot into Luffy\u2019s face. \u201cI want you to get real close to my feet so that you start to smell like my feet. By smelling like my feet, it will help engrain into your mind that you now live to obey me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy\u2019s thoughts were going fast in his mind as he was trying to comprehend the situation he was now in. Apparently being Nami\u2019s subordinate required him to do a lot more things than he thought. But he couldn\u2019t dwell on that as he knew if he displeased Nami, she would be angry and Luffy was starting to be scared of Nami-san when she was angry. Luffy was massaging Nami\u2019s feet while periodically rubbing her feet in his face so as to acquire the smell of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Nami leaned down and sniffed Luffy. \u201cYou now smell like my right foot. Congratulations.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami\u2019s words of congratulations struck Luffy hard. Not an hour ago, he was a pirate, wanting to be Pirate King. Now he was a pirate thief, a subordinate to Nami, and massaging her feet. Luffy realized the importance of his next words. If he rebelled, then at least Nami might ease up and treat him with respect. If he continued to run her feet after the remark she just made, then there would be no turning back; this would be his new life from now on.</span></div></div>",

Even though he was rubber, her punches hurt very badly. It was because of this fear that he did not rebel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Nami-san. I hope you are enjoying this massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Perfect. Luffy\u2019s will is crumbling. Although he obeys me out of fear, he still has a ways to go before he genuinely enjoys serving me and degrading himself for me. But that will come in time.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose for your first time, it wasn\u2019t half bad, but it could use some work, Luffy\u201d responded Nami. In actuality, Nami thought he did a wonderful job, but she needed to make Luffy think he did bad so that he would fear her retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, Luffy panicked and was trying to think of ways to improve his massage. He then looked closer at Nami\u2019s foot and saw dirt in between her toes and on her foot. Without another thought, Luffy began licking her right foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was caught off guard by this action as she was not expecting this at all. \u201cWhat are you doing, Luffy?! I never gave you permission to lick my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy shuddered at her yell. \u201cI was trying to improve the massage, Nami-san, and I noticed your feet were dirty. Please forgive me as I was just trying to make you more comfortable\u201d said Luffy as he looked at Nami to see her response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As these thoughts run through Luffy's mind Nami gets angry at him for not following her orders so she kicks at him again, but this time Luffy is ready for it and dodges the kick smiling thinking he has shown he was not weak only for Nami's other foot to fly out and kick the under side of his chin making him fly into the air.  As he approaches the ground Nami kicks a foot out so that she kicks him in the crotch.  Luffy immediately curls up into an actual ball form whimpering in pain as Nami laughs.  \"You really should have given me a massage,\" Nami said as she got up and reaches down and seeing an ear pinches it before pulling it and Luffy's head away from his body.  It was almost comical seeing the rubber boy with a normal head with a stretched out neck leading to a ball that was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I could defiantly have some fun with him,\" Nami thought to herself before she...</span></div></div>",

Nami smiled as she hear the fear from the tussled up pirate.  While she did not like pirates she was unwilling to kill one but with Luffy's rubber body it gave her an idea.<br>\r\n\"Fine I guess I can't fault even a stupid pirate from following his dreams, so I won't kill you but I am not letting you become a pirate either,\" Nami said as Luffy looked relived as she puts away her knife.  \"Your rubber body could work perfectly after I get you trained a little,\" Nami said as she pulls a table cloth off a table and lays it on the floor next to Luffy.  Luffy can't figure out what she is doing as she slowly unties the ropes binding him.  As he stats to get up Nami forces him back down with a foot and holds him there.  Knowing it was pointless to struggle Luffy watches as Nami bends down and starts to bend his amrs and legs looking at how much of a rubber man he is and seeing her plan would work.  Smiling Nami than begins to tie Luffy up with his own arms and legs until Luffy is a human ball she than rolls him onto the table cloth and makes it into a bag with Luffy trapped inside.  Nami easily lifts him up after all what does he way compared to giant bags of money and jewels she is used to carrying.  Luffy had never felt so vulnerable here he was wrapped up in a giant knot off his own body and now tied in a sack being carried by a pirate hater who fall all he knew was going to throw him into the ocean but he was too afraid to speak in order to find out.  Nami whistled to herslef as she carried the bag and went to her small ship walking past with no comment the man she had seen with Luffy before.  Getting to her ship she tosses Luffy into in and is satisfied to hear a groan of pain.  Nami than takes off and heads...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about twenty hours of sailing, Nami came upon the deserted island that she had found about a year ago. Since then, it had become the place where she hid all her treasure since she did not trust Arlong to not snoop on her home to locate her treasure. Since it was deserted, she also figured it was a good place to begin Luffy's new training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter docking her ship, she picked up the Luffy bag and went inside the island to where there was nothing but trees, fruits, grass, and other forest life. However, what was missing was no animal life, save for bugs. She then untied the bag and heard Luffy groan as she also slowly freed Luffy from the ball that she forced his body to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy slowly got up and started doing some stretches to get rid of the cramps that he had and then he saw that Nami was looking at him. After he saw that she wasn't attacking him, Luffy asked \"Where are we? What are we doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on a deserted island so I can train you to help me steal from pirates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we eat first? I haven't eaten since you fed me at that house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" sighed Nami. She looked around and said \"You see that tree over there with apples on it? Get as many as you can using your rubber powers. This can also serve as your first lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why that? I was thinking more like meat. Meat is my favorite food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did he just really tell me what his favorite food was so easily?' thought Nami as she pulled out her bo staff. \"Well, unfortunately for you, there are only bugs on this island, no animals. So you'll have to get by without meat while we're here. And now that I know that meat is your favorite food, I'll deny you meat ehenever you disobey me. And that right there has earned you no meat for one week <i>after </i> we have left here. Now get to it!\" finished Nami as she wacked him in the head with her staff, sending Luffy to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Luffy got off the ground with a bump on his head. He looked at Nami in fear because of how strong her attacks were on him, and yelled out \"Gomu Gomu no Rocket!\" as he launched himself at the tree that was far away and after grabbing a dozen, launched himself back. When he did, Nami once again whacked him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought. You're too loud when using your powers. While what you did was impressive, if there were pirates around and you were stealing their treasure, they'd know where you were immediately. Next time, do it quietly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about when I'm fighting?\" asked Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that is fine, but the primary objection is to steal from pirates without having to fight needless fights. Sometimes, it is inevitable, but it's about being smart. You may have defeated entire crews by yourself, but there are many, many more that would defeat you if you were to fight them all by yourself.\" In her mind, the Arlong Pirates came to mind. \"This training is to get you accustomed to my style of stealing from pirates. Otherwise, your recklessness will just get us killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami then dug into an apple and started eating with Luffy following suit. While Luffy didn't really agree with what Nami was saying since he preferred to fight his enemies head on, but he was too afraid of her to say anything back.</span></div></div>",

Luffy runs as fast as he could away from the dominant girl as she laughs knowing he would be back.  As soon as she let him go Luffy planned to escape but he found Nami had told him the truth that they were the only people on the island.  He had found her boat but saw that she had locked it up tight so he could not get it.  Feeling trapped Luffy headed back to where he had left Nami thinking the quicker he got over this the quicker they could leave.  When he got to the spot he had left Nami, however, the girl was gone and a piece of paper was left on a near by tree.  Luffy got the paper and stared at it blankly as he tried to understand the map Nami had left.  The one reason he had wanted Nami was he was unable to read even the most simplest of maps such as one that showed a store on the other side of the street from him.<br>\r\nLuffy checked the map's other side to find a singe message, \"You have until sundown to find me or you will be punished- Nami.\"  Luffy gulped knowing the only way he would be able to find Nami would be by accident so he took off in search of her not wanting to find out what her punishment would be.  On the other side of the tree where the map was left Nami relaxed in a hammock thinking about her little joke on Luffy knowing as soon as he got back he would find her.  But as she hear him tear down the map and head off in the opposite direction she just laughed at how stupid the boy was.  As sundown approached and Luffy was not anywhere Nami got out of her hammock and went to look for the idiot.  She found him...</span></div></div>",

He was afraid of what her punishment would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami walked slowly towards Luffy giving the impression of a hunter cornering their prey. \"Please, Nami, forgive me\" begged Luffy. Nami didn't say a word as she got up close to Luffy and punched hard, sending him to the ground. As Luffy was groaning on the ground, Nami walked up to him and placed her foot hard on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that there is a lot more I have to teach you Luffy before you can leave this island.\" Nami then pulled out some rope and and made something similar to a girdle. She bent down to so that a piece of the rope was in front of Luffy's mouth and told him to \"Get on all fours and bite on the rope.\" As Luffy did so, Nami then grabbed on the other part of the rope and climbed on Luffy's back and rode him like a horse. Nami then began leading Luffy around the island the hard way as she would kick him in the ribs whenever he started to travel in a direction that she didn't order him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Luffy, you make an excellent horse\" said Nami after an hour. \"You'll know the island by the back of your hand in no time at this rate.

Nami sighs as she climbs into her living hammock as Luffy groans.  \"I guess you are some use after all,\" Nami said as she gets comfortable.  As she tries to go to sleep she get's annoyed by his groaning.  Getting up Nami bends down and takes off one of her socks and stuffs into Luffy's mouth before using the othe sock to warp around his face to make sure he did not spit it out.  Smiling to herself Nami gets back on and begins to rock her hammock to fall to sleep.  As she was laying with her feet in Luffy's face Naim drifted off to sleep.  Luffy of course could not sleep as his body was used as a hammock gave him time to think. The one thought that stayed with him is that he had picked a different navigator.  When it was morning Nami woke up and stretched  before climbing off her hammock.  \"Wow that was the best sleep I've had in a long time how about you,\" Nami said taking the socks out of Luffy's mouth so he could answer.<br>\r\n\"Do you even need to ask I could not sleep a single wink,\" Luffy complained.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you need to learn to relax more,\" Nami said....</span></div></div>",

Mikan had a hard time to relax as she looked over her new stuff Queen Nami had gotten him as he modeled some of them in the mirror in the large bathroom that had a tub so large both Queen Nami and Mikan could both comfortably fit in it.  As Mikan was looking at himself in his new Pink straw hat he was shocked to realized that he had even stopped calling himself by his real name in his own head and had come to accept his new name of Mikan.  As he finished modeling in the mirror he got tired and went to lie down, knowing the bed was Nami's he curled up on the couch and fell asleep.  <br>\r\nMikan woke up latter as Queen Nami walked in carrying a bag from the store they had just left but also two trays of food one steak and a salad.

The pair sat down to eat as Nami ate the steak and Mikan used small bites to finish off the salad he was distracted during the meal as Nami keep running her foot up and down his legs.  \"What is in the bag Queen Nami,\" Mikan asked after the meal was done and he had cleaned away the dishes.

She then grabs Mikan's wrists with one head and holds them above Mikan's head and onto the pillows. Nami then proceeds to kick off her shoes before she finishes undressing herself and Mikan; the only exception being that she leaves Mikan's underwear on while she works on Mikan's front side.  She began kissing all over Mikan's front and paid special attention to the beli tattoo on Miikan's shoulder. All the while, Mikan was moaning in pleasure and Mikan's underwear got damp.

Even during sex, my enjoyment and satisfaction are what's most important. You'd do well to remember that, Mikan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were heading towards town, they heard a loud commotion coming from the main part of town.

After seeing that display of power, everyone (except Nami and Mikan, who were in the background) started giving Alvida their treasure and a ship. After that, Alvida went to a bar to get free drinks and food while everyone else was either too afraid or infatuated with the beautiful Alvida to atempt to steal from the ship that obviously had no guards while Alvida was in the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami turned toward Mikan and said \"An old enemy huh?

Alvida than walks towards Mikan who seeing as Mikan began to lick his lips as Alvida stood over him in a stance of pure dominance.  \"Well unless you want this mace to break you apart you better get it nice and wet Luffy,\" Alvida said and was not shocked as Mikan had already started to suck on the end of the mace to lube it up.  Alvida smiled over at the other prisoner to see the thief doing every thing she can not to watch well the girl would learn of what awaited for her if she joined the crew or punishment if she got on her bad side.  After Luffy had got it lube up enough in Alvida's opinion she quickly tore off the his clothes and flipped him over on his bunk.  Alvida than to enter Lufy's ass which thank to the shot from Doctor Ann had a virgin ass and the mace strap-on stretched him that the only way he could handle it was due to his rubber body other wise he would have died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Alvida rode him rough in pay back for how he had beaten him before taking no notice of the sissy former pirate's screams in pain ash she stretched Luffy's ass more than anyone else had.  Alvida than lifted Luffy up and fucked him into the wall enjoying the screams coming out of Luffy's mouth which was a better reward than getting her treasure back from the thief.  Thinking of the thief she turns to look over at the girl and see a look of horror in the young girl's eyes as she saw Captain Alvida fucked him hard.  What Alvida did not know was that Nami was actually worried as she saw her sissy used so violently.</span></div></div>",

They leave for a few moments and Luffy says something like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Nami. I really don\u2019t know what to say about this\u201d, said Usopp. \u201cBut maybe after what Luffy just did to Big Mom, this won\u2019t be so bad. You are more level headed than Luffy after all.\u201d Chopper, Brook, and Franky nodded their heads in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I joined the crew, it was to follow Luffy\u201d said Zoro. \u201cBut I guess if Luffy allowed you to take over command of the crew, even temporary, then I wonder if he\u2019s fit to be the Captain anyway. Depending on how you lead the crew will determine how much longer I remain in the crew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough, Zoro. But I do hope you stay with the crew, regardless of who is Captain. I don\u2019t want anyone leaving the crew again\u201d responded Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will follow your every command, Captain Nami-swan\u201d yelled Sanji with hearts it his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is certainly interesting news, Nami. I wonder just how much the crew will change over this week\u201d said Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I understand this shocks you all, but I promise I will do my best to be the Captain that we all should have had from Luffy from the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew nodded in understanding of what Nami meant in the ways that Luffy didn\u2019t act like a Captain most of the time.

Why am I the only who has to, Nami?\u201d demanded Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Luffy, this is your punishment, not theirs. And you did not respond to me the way you are supposed to Luffy. Perhaps you need a more physical reminder to remind yourself of the situation you are in.\u201d Nami grabbed his left elbow and stared at his shoulder. \u201cYes, I know just what to do to you so that you don\u2019t forget who\u2019s in charge\u201d finished Nami with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us everyone, Luffy and I need some time together alone on the ship.

As she was responding to the thanks, she again puzzled over Luffy\u2019s (and Zoro\u2019s for that matter) definition of a hero. Luffy wasted so much time arguing with Jinbe, it was ridiculous. Just listen to Jinbe\u2019s plan of becoming a hero and then kick some ass. But Luffy had to be Luffy and waste time arguing. She\u2019ll have to punish him about that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for your praises, everyone. But if you\u2019ll excuse us, we have something to do on the ship\u201d, bid Nami farewell after a few minutes of listening to the fishmen and mermen thank her and Luffy. After a while, she made it back to the Thousand Sunny with a huge smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready for your next punishment, Luffy? I sure am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Captain Nami. Whatever you are going to do, please don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry\u201d responded Luffy as he was thinking of Nami beating him up again since she was always able to inflict so much damage to him. He wasn\u2019t thinking of a different way that Nami would punish him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, Luffy. It\u2019s too late for that. The stuff I\u2019ll need is probably in Chopper\u2019s medical room.\u201d Nami then went into the ship and found the medical room. She finally let go of Luffy and pointed to a bed and said \u201cLie there on your stomach, take off your shirt, and don\u2019t move. It\u2019ll be very bad for you if you make me mess up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy had no idea what she was talking about but did as he was told. After a while of Nami gathering some supplies, she turned to Luffy and started walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing with that stuff, Nami?\u201d asked Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m giving you a tattoo, Luffy. The exact same tattoo as the one on my left shoulder here and it\u2019ll go on your left shoulder as well. And as a result of this, you need to go back to wearing your old vests so that you proudly showcase your new tattoo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Nami, for a pirate to take a tattoo of someone\u2019s mark, that means they are swearing loyalty to that person. Just like Arlong had you wear his tattoo and Ace received old man Whitebeard\u2019s tattoo when he joined his crew. For me to wear your tattoo permanently, it means that I swear loyalty to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told you Luffy that I intend to have you respect me even after you take over as Captain. Once again, you didn\u2019t properly address me like I told you. And you are swearing loyalty to me, whether I am Captain or not. Now don\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy stayed still with eyes full of fear as Nami began working on his left shoulder. Luffy was thinking back to Zoro\u2019s words about Luffy perhaps not being fit to be Captain if he was willing to step down, even temporarily. Unbeknownst to Luffy, Nami was also thinking of Zoro\u2019s words and was wondering about becoming the Captain permanently. She honestly had no intentions of becoming the Captain permanently when she first took over or when she thought about giving Luffy her tattoo, but Zoro\u2019s words about questioning Luffy being Captain and Luffy\u2019s words just know about the meaning of Luffy wearing her tattoo started making her think about how events were falling into her place even when she didn\u2019t think about it. After a while, Nami finished with Luffy\u2019s new tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, Luffy. Be sure to wear my tattoo with pride and serve me faithfully. Now I want you to thank me for giving you my tattoo, Luffy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy stared at his tattoo with eyes of shock as he was thinking of how the crew would react to this change. Would they want Nami to remain as Captain? What about his dream of becoming Pirate King? But he heard Nami\u2019s words clearly and so he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Captain Nami, for giving me your tattoo\u201d said Luffy even though they both knew he didn\u2019t mean it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she was telling the truth, her true intentions were different than what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami had done a lot of thinking over the past two years over Luffy's qualities as a Captain and the more she thought about it, she felt he wasn't suited for the position. Sure he was the most powerful in a fight, but at what cost? His Gears had bad side effects and if he had developed more Gears, what would those side effects be? In her opinion, Luffy was too reckless, both with his body and in his thought process. After all, it's not always the most powerful person that can win a fight and Luffy was a very gullible person and quick to abandon any strategies that were pre-planned. And also, when they were on the ships, she gave more orders to the crew than Luffy anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her greedy side also thought to when he blew money away, such as blowing away the remaining money after the Enies Lobby incident or when he left the money behind after leaving the island where they fought with Buggy the first time. She had a bad feeling that this habit could happen in the future and she wanted to be very rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for these reasons that Nami had decided to overthrow Luffy as the new Captain of their crew. She knew it would be easy as Luffy was very susceptible to her attacks and thus easy to control him. If the crew was to survive in the New World, they needed a smarter Captain in Nami's opinion and she felt she was suitable for it. She would do her best to avoid trouble to protect the crew and when they did have huge battles, Luffy would still be there to fight and help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts brought her back to the present as she saw someone with a huge coat and a backpack with two people that looked like bad imitations of Sanji and Zoro. She had her suspicions that this was Luffy and if it was, he was about to walk right into the huge mess with the Marines that would inevitably happen with the impostor crew advertising where they would be. Sighing to herself, she summoned up a thunder cloud to electrocute the 2 fakes. The cries of \"Zoro! Sanji!\" in the familiar voice of Luffy confirmed her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Typical Luffy. It's this behavior of his that makes him unsuitabe to be Captain anymore.' Nami then replied out, \"Those two were fakes, Luffy. Those are not the real Zoro and Sanji-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy turned around and said \"Nami!\" as he waked over to her with a huge grin. \"How have you been? It's been so long. Wait, those 2 were fakes? Those weren't the real Zoro and Sanji?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Luffy. There's a whole crew of them impersonating us, except for Brook. Apart from that, I've been great. I learned a lot these past two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I learned a lot these past two years too. So are you heading back to the Thousand Sunny? I'm sure most of the crew is there or on their way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, Luffy. I want to discuss some things with you first. Between Navigator and Captain\" said Nami with a smile as she thought 'future Captain and soon-to-be former Captain' in her mind instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, Nami. Lead the way\", said Luffy, unaware of the changes that were about to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nami was walking away with Luffy to her destination, she had the feeling of deja vu from when they first met and she was leading him to Buggy before tying him with rope...  </span></div></div>",

I've been doing some thinking and I think that this crew would be better off without a Captain who doesn't read the newspapers for information, doesn't think, and constantly does reckless things regardless of the circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm the strongest in the crew\" argued Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but so what? Just because someone's strong doesn't mean they are suited to lead. Someone very smart, but not the strongest, can be a leader too. Besides, even if we go with your argument, you're weak against me.

As for your old dream, you can forget about it. You should concentrate instead on doing what you can to make me the Pirate Queen. Although my primary goal is still draw a world map, I would be lying if I said being the Pirate Queen didn't appeal to me as well. Now, do you agree to me being the new Captain, Luffy, or will I have to take the position from you by force?\" finished Nami as she pulled out her new Clima Tact, prepared to fight.</span></div></div>",

He specifically remembered doubting if he had what it took to become the Pirate King. Hearing Nami of all people doubt his qualities as Captain into place brought those old self-doubts back.

That's why we're here? Please no..\" at this Luffy stopped as he saw Nami give him a col glare. \"I mean, I'd love to have your tattoo, Captain Nami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain?

I have a lot to tell everyone else too and I'm sure they do too. Come along, Luffy. It's time to start our journey again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was strangely quiet as he got on the bird with Nami. He didn't know how to react around the rest of the crew anymore now that he wasn't the Captain. What would they think? How would they be told? Would anyone want to leave the crew with Nami as Captain? A thousand thoughts that hadn't surfaced when it was just Nami and himself started taking over when he saw Chopper again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was enjoying herself as she could tell the inner turmoil Luffy was going through.She herself wasn't sure how the rest of the crew would react (except for Sanji), she had faith that it would work out. She would allow Luffy's silence from not responding to her by one of the ways that she told him to respond to her until the crew was informed. Afterwards, however, she would make sure Luffy verbally responded to every order she gave him with the proper respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Luffy, Nami? He's not another imposter is he?\" asked Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he is the real Luffy. He's probably thinking about how to tell the rest of the crew about something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something important? Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy will tell everyone when everyone together again.\" Nami glanced at Luffy indicating that it was a subtle order that he, and not she, would inform the crew about who the new Captain is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" said Chopper worriedly as he glanced at Luffy. Soon enough (although it felt like forever to Luffy), the trio and the bird made it to the Thousand Sunny with the rest of the crew cheering and calling out their names. </span></div></div>",

Aren't you going to eat?\" asked Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry,\" replied Luffy to the happiness of Nami and the shock of everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, suit yourself. But sice you're not eating, get off the deck and do something productive. Go be on lookout for any problems that may occur,\" ordered Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Captain Nami,\" answered Luffy as he got off the deck and got to the lookout area. The crew had a good laugh at seeing Luffy walking around in Nami's old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, what you did to Luffy was funny and liberating. You saved us from going to the New World with him as our Captain,\" said Usopp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was disappointed at first, but now I see that it was for the best. We all spent the last 2 years training for this moment and Luffy seems to have regressed,\" added Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really pathetic that we're all out trying to fulfill our own dreams and now Luffy's dream is over,\" said Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's nothing like his father. Dragon-san is a great leader that everyone in the Revolutionary Army respects. Luffy, on the hand, lost the respect of our crew and his position as Captain,\" added Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this is an indication that his appetite will go down. I was always angry that Luffy would always sneak in the middle of the night, trying to raid the fridge,\" said Sanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention, we would always overspend on food just to satisfy one day's worth of food for him,\" added Nami. \"We're not doing that again. I say that from now on, when he eats with us, we all steal his food. That'll teach him a lesson and he'll eat less too. We'll also be able to save more money, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" said everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way that Luffy has fallen is certainly not super!\" said Franky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't in the crew for very long when we were all separated, but her's to Captain Nami's reign being much, much longer than Luffy's!\" added Brook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, here. Cheers!\" added everyone except Nami, while she just thanked them for their support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami then looked in the directionthat Luffy was before she ordered him to be on lookout duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check up on Luffy. It's been quiet and I don't trust him to do a good job,\" said Nami as she got from the table and left, looking for Luffy.</span></div></div>",

You went against those disgusting World Nobles, just like our hero, Fisher Tiger, did so long ago. So, what will it be? Will you all join under our New Fishman Pirates or reject us? Will you live or we will you sink you to your deaths right here and now?\" asked the fishman Hammond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami saw the old Arlong tattoo on his body, so she knew instantly what his opinions of humans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, your information is outdated,\" started Nami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outdated?\" asked Hammond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pirate known as Monkey D.

You were one of Arlong's top people annd was his map maker when he was trying to conquer East Blue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My whole \"association\" with Arlong was just a negotiation to get my freedom back.

Nami chuckled a bit, finding this rather cute. Luffy could only squirm in embarrassment as he stood back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do we have to-EEEK!\" Luffy squealed when the Mermaid Quintuplets spun around Luffy's body and began taking the current clothes he was wearing off. Luffy spun around and stopped, standing in just the orange panties... before those two were taken away, leaving him butt naked. Luffy blushed and grinned nervously, covering himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the first outfit.\" Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little mermaids spun Luffy around again and dressed him up in the outfit Nami wore on Enies Lobby. The blue jacket and the short mini-skirt with a new pair of panties underneath. Luffy tugged the mini-skirt down as they took pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no...!\" Luffy whined before they flew around him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Luffy ended up in the Water Seven outfit. The blue shirt with the tie and skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!\" Luffy whined and blushed, still trying to cover himself. Nami slapped Luffy across the face and made him wobble about in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still. Don't cover yourself anymore.\" Nami demanded. Luffy whimpered and did as she was told, He might as well be referred to as a she since she was a cabin girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Quintuplets flew around him again and Luffy ended up in a tiny short dress that Nami wore as a kid. This one was extra hilarious since it was so small it ended up showing off Luffy's panties in full. Luffy wanted to cover up but found himself blushing, closing his eyes, and putting his hands embarrassingly behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your eyes.\" Nami ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy did and looked to the side, like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all began laughing. The mermaids couldn't help flying around him and spanking his butt for fun. Luffy yelped with each hit, and was spewing tears by the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Captain you have to. And if you don't, then you don't deserve to be captain anymore.\" Nami said to his face. Chopper and Zoro overheard this as they were on their way back to the room at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nami, you're being stupid. What's there to fix? Usopp challenged my authority as captain and I took care of him!\" Luffy shouted at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only reason Usopp quit was because you not only fought back but you almost told him to leave yourself before Sanji had to kick you across the room. Do you have any idea how horrible and childish that is? And now Robin's missing and you're not doing anything! How would you like it if you got kicked out. Then what?\" Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get kicked out. I'm the captain!\" Luffy snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then fight me and we'll see if that's true or not. How's about another duel!\" Nami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Luffy was shocked. \"B-But-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crew is falling apart. Two people have challenged your authority and another straight up went missing. You're unable to do anything about it. Shows how much of a captain you are.\" Nami said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It all started out good when he was able to get off that last island even if it was in a barrel.  As he broke out he managed to defeat so rival pirates only to face off against a stronger opponent who took his treasure and threw it into the ocean.  As he had watched his treasure sink below the waves he was informed that he was no longer a pirate but would be a pirate thief underling to the girl who just beat the shit out of him and toss out his treasure.

The girl fearing discovery placed a hand over his mouth to gag him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem with that, however, is she was not looking when she had done so that instead of just blocking his mouth her small hand was also covering up his nose as well cutting off his air supply.  He had tried to move her hand but she seemed not to notice his efforts as she look through the cracks in the door.  He could not believe this was how it was going to end suffocated by a young girl who had blocked his airways with her small hand and he was powerless to move away from.  Just as he was about to pass out the girl opens the closet and steps out of it taking her hand away at last.  However, in the confines on the closet he had been leaning on her so that when she stepped out he fell to the floor in a heap at her feet making her giggle.

The most alarming thing she had to accept was her Captain's leadership, or lack thereof most of the time, wouldn't be fixed by Rayleigh in his training. Nami came to the hard realization that Luffy getting stronger could only increase his recklessness and put the crew into situations they weren't ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these thoughts in mind, Nami poured even more into her training at Weatheria and after just 18 of the 24 months she originally planned, she felt she had learned everything she needed. She wasn't sure how she would get Rayleigh to agree with what she planned to do, but luckily for her, Rayleigh had just left Luffy to train by himself for the last 6 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thinking of where Luffy would be, Nami figured the last place the World Government would expect to find Luffy would be in the Calm Belt, so after securing a boat from Weatheria, she used her navigation skills and new weather skills to sail in the Calm Belr that would normally be very dificult to sail bcause of there being no wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, she came across an island and wondered if Luffy was there. She docked on the island and took some bags that she would need to complete his \"training\", she went off in search of him.</span></div></div>",

Nami internally screamed as this as she then heard about the lucky lightning strike that saved Luffy's life at the last second and then the crazy wind that allowed all of them to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing the full story, Nami walked up to Luffy and just punched him hard, sending him to the ground, causing Zoro, Sanji, and Usopp to be surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! When will you start acting like a proper Captain? every single place we go to there comes a point where you just show you're not ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy shook off the punch and stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Nami? Of course I'm ready. I trained for 10 years in preparation to become a pirate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where has that stopped you from putting yourself or the crew in worse positions that it needs to? When we first met aand I didn't like pirates, you let your guard down and allowed me to tie you up with rope and you were eventually put into a cage by Buggy. During the battle against Kuro's crew, you allowed yourself to get hypnotizrf by that hypnotist. Or how about the Baratie? If it wasn't for Don Krieg, you would've ended up being their chore bot for a whole year. And I heard about how Arlong was able to nearly drown you to begin with. You got your feet trapped by one of your own attacks and needed a lot of help to get out of that mess. And now this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But everything worked out well in the end, so what does it matter?\" asked Luffy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it matter?\" repeated Nami as Zoro, Sanji, and Usopp also flinched in annoyance at Luffy's nonchalant response. \"We are about to enter the Grand Line. How much longer are you just going to rely on dumb luck to fix your mistakes that you cause us? Perhaps this crew woud be better off with a new Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy's eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious, Nami. You don't mean that, that you want me to not be the Captain anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very serious, Luffy. I hereby challenge you to a duel to decide who will be the Captain from here on out: me or you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it has come to this.

Her snake weapon/partner Salome was beside the throne watching her as she thought silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to Hancock, maybe she should be more forceful and direct towards him.

Vivi while a peaceful person was at her limit as she threw a punch into Luffy's stomach who was so arrogant he did not even try to get out of the way.  A moment latter the Straw Hats goggled as Luffy's body folded around Vivi's punch before she grabs a hank of his hair and tosses him to the ground.  When Luffy got back to his feet Vivi did a simple leg sweep forcing him back down the rest of the Straw Hats had backed up a little and even began to place bets on the outcome of the match.  Luffy began to get angry as he lept to his feet and threw a Gomu Gomu no Pistol only to have Vivi doge it and get under his guard throwing a hand full of jabs at him sending him backwards.  As he flew backwards his stretched out hands grabbed Vivi who went along with them making her own body into a impromptu rocket aimed right at Luffy's gut.  As she hit Luffy thanks to his own lack of planing all the air rushes out of him; while he is distracted Vivi grabs his arms and began to tie them together in a knot that he would not be able to do without help.  Finding his arms out of commission Luffy hopped on one foot sending out the other, but instead of getting hit or even dodging it Vivi grabbed his foot and snapped it back sending Luffy into the tree.  Vivi could have sworn she heard at least one person laugh from the Straw Hats as she walked over to a dazed Luffy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know there is one thing I have always wanted to find out,\" Vivi said as she took a hold of Luffy's head and stretched out his neck until Luffy's was sitting on his own head.

It brought him back to when he first met Ace and Sabo and he was having trouble throwing a single punch due to his rubber body being a fairly new thing at the time. As he started thinking about the past, he thought about the day that he and Ace were told that Sabo had been killed as he was leaving the island. It was at that point that he finally was thinking about Vivi's point of view and he calmed himself down and so he had no problem with feiting to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forfeit, Vivi,\" said Luffy. He had momentarily forgotten that he was in the middle of a wager with Vivi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Vivi as she had expected Luffy to be more stubborn. \"Well since you lost, I'll tell you what the rest of the bet was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely forgot about that!\" yelled Luffy from his position on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt! As I was saying, since you have lost, as long as you are in Alabasta, you will be obey everything that I, the princess, says.\" The Straw Hats behind her just raised their eyebrows at their friend using her princess title for selfish reasons; this was the first time she had done something like this since they have met her. In fact, up until this moment, she never asked for any type of special treatment due to her status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" said Luffy, thinking that she would just order them to stop the Rebel and Royal Armies from fighting. 'We're friends. It's not like she'll do anything that bad. Right?' thought Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivi could tell that Luffy figured she would be merciful on him just because of their friendship, but she had other plans in store.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The rest of the Star Hats watched as their normally impulsive captain acted so meekly to Vivi when she stopped pacing and had a member of the crew grab each one of Luffy's extremities.  \"Now let's see how far your body can actually stretch,\" Vivi said as she took a hold of Luffy's head and each member began to walk away holding on to their piece of Luffy's body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy felt weird as he had never his body stretched out by other's at the same time.  Vivi smiled as Luffy did not feel any discomfort from his former crew begin to stretch his body out and soon all were out of sight.  \"You know if being a pirate does not work out you would make a great living as either a trampoline for parties or you could hold provisions for a full army all by your self but with your appetite you would most likely need to gag you so you don't eat their food,\" Vivi said with a laugh as Luffy threw her a hurt look.  Seeing how far Luffy could stretch, Vivi thought he could do great things for Alabasta and based on their wager as long as he was in Alabasta Luffy would follow her commands and she had purposely left out if it would end when Alabaster was free.  Vivi could see it know the Straw Hats becoming members of her personal guard, while their former captain would find a place in her court as a novelty or for entertainment purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Luffy's surprise at the same time every part of his body were let go and his body snapped back together.

Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAOOOUUUH!\" Sadie-Chan gasped. \"I love the sound of your screams. Oh~! And you scream just like a little girl too! I bet you moan like one as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy actually blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot many people could embarrass Luffy but there was definitely a way to do it. Treat him like a child, a baby, a girl, and expose his shame and you'd hit the mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie-Chan noticed the blush on his face and smirked. \"I think I may have found your weakness already. You and me are going to get along great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Is this a joke? I'm not gonna come back here two years later to be broken by your subordinate. I'm stronger! I can beat YOU now Poison man!\" Luffy snapped back at Magellan, who was already leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's me Rubber man. I'M going to break you. I can already tell, you'll be moaning in heat, begging for the dominant Sadie to let you orgasm or even so much as be allowed to use the bathroom. You're mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy's face scrunched up with confusion. Then anger. \"I don't know what you're talking about but go ahead and try it!\"</span></div></div>",

Is that a challenge?\" Sadie-Chan grinned. \"I'm sure you pretend you don't care but if someone points out the size of your wee wee or the embarrassing undies you wear... you get flustered.

You value being a manly man more than anyone else because you're not one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Luffy snapped and charged at her, only for Sadie-Chan to whip around his legs and yank on them.

He had no intentions of staying here forever, but Luffy decided to not fight Shirahoshi for now. He would give her some time to have the feeling of having friends, but he would eventually tell her that he was leaving. After she took him out her hug, Luffy started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay with you for now, Weak-Hoshi, but at some point, I will leave. I have to become Pirate King.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Shirahoshi, Luffy.\" replied Shirahoshi. Luffy noticed that this was the second time now that she said his name without the \"sama\" honorific, but didn't comment about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still a crybaby. Once you stop that habit, I'll call you by your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you hate crybabies so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy squirmed a bit and then said \"I'd rather not say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirahoshi glared at Luffy before yelling \"Tell me!\" and causing a few tears to escape her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was caught off guard by Shirahoshi's sudden outburst and replied \"Because I used to be a weak crybaby when I was a kid. It was thanks to my brother Ace that I broke out of it.\" Luffy's eyes widened at his words and he clamped his mouth shut, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirahoshi looked at him in surprise before saying \"But you're so strong. Don't worry Luffy. I'll keep your secret, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy sighed and said \"Thank you. I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Luffy, however, Shirahoshi had ulterior motives. Hearing from Luffy that he used to be a crybaby gave her an idea that she could use to keep Luffy here with her forever. She was already working towards not being a crybaby anymore herself, but if she could revert Luffy to being a crybaby again (and made sure he stayed that way forever) before he attempts to leave the island again, then he'd be too weak for the New World, correct? He'd have no choice but to stay with her until he stopped being a crybaby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

After an hour had passed, he had had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shirahoshi was about to put him back in again, Luffy said \"Please stop, Shirahoshi.\" Shirahoshi smiled at Luffy calling her by her name.

Silently, Shirahoshi was proud of herself for weakening Luffy's will.

Luffy blushed and giggled nervously as his eyes shifted back and forth between them all. \"Uh. My name's Lucy and I'm here to say, Rebecca winning this is A-Okay! With the Flare Flare Fruit, Mingo's plan is grass. She didn't even need it to kick MY ass! Goooo Rebecca!\" Luffy's made up cheer was positively embarassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all the more humiliating due to how the armor barely fit on him. The bikini armor sagged a lot and showed off the Princess panties he had been forced to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed and pointed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to die at that moment.</span></div></div>",

Whether it was from the cheers or the crowd mocking him, Luffy wasn't sure. The importsnt thing was to cheer hard for Rebecca as she instructed him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Rebecca! Go Rebecca! You're the strongest in the tournament! Show Block D the might of the \"Undefeated Woman\"! Go Rebecca!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy was saying this, he was shaking his body around, and at first, the bra came off, leaving the bottom half of the bikini and his panties as well as the boots and armor. When that happened, the crowd turned at him and starting mocking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the same Lucy that won Block C? Why is he cheering for that despicable granddaughter of King Riku of all people to win?\" said a random person in the stands, with no one knowing the answer as they just mocked the person they were cheering on just moments ago when he was doing well in Block C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, you suck!\" said another random pereson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy ignored the insults the best he could while he continued to cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Win Rebecca! Win Rebecca! Block D has nothing on you! Your fighting style is better than mine and you're the most beautiful person in Dressrosa! Go Rebecca!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Luffy's dance caused the bottom half of the bikini to come off as well as his helmet, leaving just his princess panties and his armored boots on. Luffy was burning with embarrassment, but saw that Rebecca was doing very well at leading people to fall out of bounds. Luffy gulped at the thought of fighting Rebecca in the arena. Considering how she beat him easily before, he knew that he would no doubt be drowning because of her. It gave him an idea for a cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flee for your life, Devil Fruit users. Rebecca will be the one causing you all to drown in this arena. She would surely cause me to drown if I fought her serioudly in this arena!\"Luffy jumped in the air at the end of that cheer and as he landed, even the boots came apart, leaving him completely naked, save for the princess underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a result, after you help me win the tournament and I eat the Mera Mera no Mi, I will give you a great reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy stared at Rebecca's smile, he got a shiver down his back as he felt that the reward would only be great feom her perpective and not his. To put on a good face, however, Luffy replied, \"Thank you so much, Rebecca! I look forward to helping you get the Mera Mera no Mi and receiving your reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded her head at his words and smirked in her mind at the trap she just set in order to enslave him.

I-It was my pleasure...\" Luffy blushed as he was pointed and laughed at by all the gladiators as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he the one that one-shotted Spartan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won Block C right? Wow. Who knew he was such a wimp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks familiar though. Kind of like Straw Hat Luffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. That wimp is too girly to be him. Besides, his name is Lucy.

He could even feel himself squirm like he had to use the bathroom from the embarrassment catching up with his bladder. However, he saw someone approaching that almost made him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Lucy?\" Rebecca noticed his face before the figure stood in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss but I'm afraid I can't let you interfere with our chances of getting the Flame Flame Fruit.\" Said the teen. \"My little brother doesn't seem to be in the best shape either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little... Brother...?\" Luffy stared at him before it sunk in. He teared up and charged at the figure, jumping into his upper body and hugging him while crying. \"I knew it! It WAS you! SABOOOOOO~! But how? Why? I THOUGHT YOU DIED! WAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's crying like a baby.\" Another gladiator chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabo just smiled. \"Sorry Luffy. You must be mad at me but now'a not the time. You seem to be in trouble. Do you mind if I eat the Flame Flame Fruit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh! But Ms. Rebecca wants it too! I-If you beat her up then you can take it for sure!\" Luffy said with a teary eyed, blushing, and angry face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy turned to face Rebecca while still hugging Sabo's upper body and pouted at her. \"I don't want her to have it. She's a big meanie face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big meanie face?\" Sabo was surprised by Luffy's language but then turned and spotted Rebecca's annoyed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to end up punished severely for saying that Luffy.\" Rebecca shot Luffy a look. Luffy shivered and froze up, feeling his bladder dribble a scared shot of pee that stained the front of his panties. Sabo saw this and looked at her intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my little brother alone.\" Sabo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M getting the Flame Flame Fruit. You can say you want it all you want but in order to obtain it you have to beat me. And I'm afraid Lucy's the one in the finals, not you.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take Lucy's place and then fight you for it then.\" Sabo smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Think you can beat me? Lucy didn't stand much of a chance.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle you.\" Sabo said with a confident smirk as he grabbed Luffy by his armpits and held him up like a baby. \"Don't worry.

First she had to get rid of his current disguise as she used the scissors to cut the newly \"bought\" Navy Cabin Boy costume to shreds and quickly put away the scissors and planned on telling him she ripped the clothing apart with her bare hands.

Not to mention, his glasses and beard were gone, revealing Sabo's drooling, eyes-rolling, star gazing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma? Are we at Dairy Queen yet?\" Sabo asked in a dumb babyish voice. Rebecca merely slammed Sabo onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabo laid there with his butt sticking straight up. He then wobbled to his feet and teetered around the ring looking dazed. \"Duuhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... huh?\" Jesus Burgess was looking a bit perplexed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told it was Straw Hat...\" Diamante said with a snarl. \"But he looks like... the 2nd in command of the Revoluntionary Army...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite the weird entrance,\" Gatz continued. \"All the players are here! It's time to begin! We've strapped the Flame Flame Fruit to one of the Fighting Fish! All you need to do is nab it from the right one and eat it to win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabo tried to regain his bearing but was having trouble. Rebecca had kicked his ass something fierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gotta... gotta win!\" Sabo stammered.</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, he was somehow able to convince their Empress Hancock to turn them back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaruerite felt very grateful to Luffy helping them out (even if it was just him returning the favor), so when she heard that he had been summoned to Kuja Castle, she was worried that Boa Hancock would try to take him out right then and there. Marguerite snuck into Kuja Castle and when she got to where Hancock and Luffy were, she got the shock of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in shock as Hancock revealed her back to Luffy and Marguerite saw that there was no Gorgon's Eye, but some strange  symbol. She then learned that it was a slave symbol that the World Nobles burn into their slaves. Boa Hancock and her sisters hadn't defeated a Gorgon, they were actually slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Marguerite was angry was an understatement. Everything the Kujas thought they knew about the \"heroic\" Gorgon Sisters was all a lie. Even Elder Nyon knew the truth and helped her in the past apparently and yet the Snake Princess still treated her horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite stared at Hancock with eyes of anger and betrayal and vowed to take down the mighty Empress.  </span></div></div>",
