It was directed at another boy, similarly aged. That boy turned around, sheepishly smiling as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man. Guess I let my daydreaming get the best of me\" said the boy, chuckling as he did, getting a sigh from the other boy. A girl that was also with the two of them gently giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously James! You're always such a daydreamer!\" said Nate Wilson. He always had to wake up his childhood friend, James Walker, from his constant daydreaming. While it annoyed him somewhat, Erin Wilson, Nate's twin who was the girl of the group, found it to be one of James' best qualities. The sky was the limit for James. That's what she always thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Walker, the man in question, had always been obsessed with dreams of flying. As a young boy, he always watched birds and how they were free to soar through the skies and explore to their hearts' content. He also saw pilots go up in planes, jets, and all kinds of other aircrafts. He could only imagine the joy that came with flying through the air. To him, it felt like freedom. Freedom to go anywhere he wanted and explore new places. It was to that end that he was attending college and would probably soon begin a pilot's class nearby. It would likely start the next semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If only I had wings'</i> thought James. He chuckled at the thought, as he saw the naivety of it all. That could never happen so he had to settle for learning to be a pilot. Anyway, it was close to the end of another springsday for the trio of friends. The sun was beginning to set and they had to head for their separate homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't sleep in tomorrow! We're getting to the beach bright and early, right?\" said Nate, his usual enthusiasm showing itself, earning a laugh from the other members of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing buddy. You both take care now\" said James as he gave Nate their usual hand shake. Erin hugged him as they went their separate ways. As James watched his two friends leave, he couldn't help but feel that he might not see them again for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be my imagination\" muttered James as he began to walk in the direction of his house. For a while, it was a peaceful walk. Not many people out, and things were pretty quiet. James liked the quiet. However, it was interrupted when he started hearing metal clashing in a nearby alley. It sounded like trash cans being tossed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" asked James as he slowly walked towards the alley and reeped along the edge, trying to get a good look at the situation. However, nothing could have prepared him for what he saw once he slowly looked around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four people there: three guys and a girl. There was something off and creepy about the guys, as they walked and swayed like men posessed. However, that wasn't the surprising part. It was the girl. She had dark hair which almost had traces of indigo in the feint light. She wore what looked like a loose-fitting navy tank top with what looked like a matching, feathered skort. She also wore a red sash around her waist. On her feet looked to be simple brown boots that covered her feet and calves. However, despite the beauty that seemed to radiate from the girl, it was something else that grabbed James' attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why? On her back, shining radiantly through the emerging darkness of the evening, was a glowing pair of wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRadiant and bird-like in shape, her wings gave a soft glow that seemed to warm James even from this distance from her. Primarily, they were a combination of white and lavender colors, emiting an otherworldly presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Who, or what, is she?'</i> James thought in his mind. At first, he must have thought that he was dreaming, or that he finally jumped off the deep end. However, after even pinching himself to try and 'wake up', the girl and guys were still there. However, once James was able to come to terms that they were real, he paied attention to what they were doing. The guys seemed to be gathered around the girl, and James didn't like the look in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, a pretty one tonight. I figure those wings of yours may make a good meal\" chuckled one man. The other two guys laughed as well as the girl seemed to buckle under their gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not afraid of you. Release those humans at once!\" said the girl, stuttering a bit as she did. James had no idea what she meant by her words but he could tell that she was scared. The men didn't believe her words and laughed more. Regardless of how odd James found the girl, he didn't like the thought of guys ganging on a poor girl. He had to take action!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bozos! Pick on somebody your own size!\" said James as he rushed in and knocked one man into a nearby trash can. One of the other guys tried to tackle James but he dodged him and twisted his arms behind his back, making the man yell in pain. He then threw the man onto the one who was allready knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, all bark and no bite\" said James. However, he was in for a shock as a black shadow started to emerge from the men's mouths, hissing at James as they did. He suddently felt very uncomfortable as he was dealing with things beyond his comprehension. He had to get the girl, who was watching the whole thing in shock, and get away from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" he yelled, gesturing to the fear-striken girl. \"Come with m..\" he said before a cold and painful feeling feeling came from his chest. Looking to the side, he had forgotten about the third man, who had just shot him. In a second, James collasped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Guess I...got in..over my...head'</i> thought James as he felt his life bleeding away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!\" yelled the girl who watched her fallen hero hit the ground, barely alive for now. His heart and lungs were untouched but the massive wound would surely cause him to bleed to death. His eyesight already blurring as he felt his life start to bleed away. Then, he heard a loud and commanding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack! Restrain those men!' yelled the voice, which sounded female. It was hard to tell for James due to his blurring eyesight, but two figures suddenly showed up and took down the remaining man and retrieved the other two. There was a burst of light and the shadows seemed to fully burst out of the mean and dissappear. The bodies collasped, unconscious but finally free of the shadows that haunted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Who......are......they?'</i> thought James as he laid there, finally passing out due to blood loss.</span></div></div>",

A light moan escaped his lips, feeling  a bit weak and dizzy but otherwise well. Slowly, his memory returned to him and he recalled being shot, trying to save a winged girl from three men who were attacking her. James shed a single tear, thinking about the young girl and wondered if she was safe. As his eyes became accustomed to the light, he looked up to see a strange vaulted ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" he weakly asked, aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.freefoto.com/images/46/01/46_01_46---Clouds_web.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.freefoto.com/images/46/01/46_...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried to move but his body was slow to respond. A hand gently touched his shoulder and guided him to a position where he looked down and gasped, becoming fully awake. \"What!?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/75/42/c3/high-view-from-some-beachs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pushed himself back, away from the edge of the bed he was sitting on, panic clear on his face until he heard a a giggle, followed by a familiar feminine voice. \"Be at peace, young Misterian.\" she said. \"Although you can see down to the Earth, I assure you that there is a solid floor between you and the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, still alarmed, looked up to see the young winged girl he had tried to rescue, standing on what seemed to be a thick glass surface. Seeing his reluctance, the girl smiled kindly at him before urging him to stand. He did so, hesitantly and was relieved that there was indeed a floor holding him up. \"Misterian?\" you asked confused. \"Am I dead, is this heaven or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl laughed, it was sweet and melodious. \"No, you are not dead and this is not what you call heaven.\" she replied. \"My name is Myrrh, crown princess to the kingdom of Skyaira.\" she blushed slightly. \"Thank you for coming to my rescue, my mother and I are most grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" replied James, still in a bit of shock. \"I... seem to recall being shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"You were bleeding very badly.\" she replied. \"There was little time, you were very close to death, my mother performed an induction ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh sighed. \"It's complicated but, basically, she used a part of her own life force to rebuild or reshape your body.\" she explained. \"You are now one of us, a young Misterian.\" she then winced. \"Only, there is a certain randomness involved in which mom had no control over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randomness?\" asked James, his head beginning to spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded and motioned to a reflective portion of the wall. \"You may want to prepare yourself.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, James looked into the mirror and screamed as he saw that he was now...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The person in the mirror definitely wasn't him!  The <i>other</i> young man which stood before him carried zero resemblance to him.  He was... gorgeous.  That was the best word to describe it.  His fair complexion was flawless, his body shape was desirably slim and tall, his features were sharp and... superior in some way.  James thought back about the vampires, the beautiful ones from Twilight, and wondered if this guy was a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen James noticed the <i>other</i> young man's pair of silver wings, and all thoughts of vampirism fled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" James greeted the amazing young man.  \"What's.. your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh hesitated before putting a hand on him sympathetically.  She understood the shock involved.  \"That is you, young Misterian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...?\" James stammered in disbelief.  \"That can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he was told, staring back at his reflection in silent wonderment.  And after close inspection, James realized that what was  similar between this model of a young man and himself was their distinct eye and hair colour - both of which had been James pride and joy.  The model's eyes were filled with intense sea blue colour, and his hair painted bright strawberry blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames waved at the model in the mirror, only to have the model wave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Myrrh said, as though having read his mind.  \"The result of the induction ritual wasn't so bad after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled weakly.  \"Yeah, at least I'm still somewhat guy.  Could've come out female, right?\"  He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" Myrrh replied seriously.  \"My mother, she...  She is not very good at the Induction ritual.  And unlike other Misterians, she has little control over the gender of a person.  We had to take the chance though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames breathed a sigh of relief as he stole another glance at his reflection.  He didn't want Myrrh to think him vain or anything, but the image of himself was truly breathtaking.  Despite being slightly feminine, he still was recognizably a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle tap on his shoulder jolted him from his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a young Misterian now,\" Myrrh said quietly.  \"Welcome to the <i>Kingdom of Skyaira</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" James blinked.  \"That's cool.  Thanks... But, how about Earth?  How about my family and friends there...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh suddenly looked sad, her beautiful eyes downcast as she spoke softly.  \"Sorry, but we don't go down to the Earth just for pleasant trips. I believe you should just leave that world behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" James asked in shock.  \"Can I at least say bye to them? I mean... I just disappeared like that...  They'd miss me you see...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the tears now, welling up in his eyes, and streaming down his face.  He realized then how much he missed them.  He remembered his mother and father, how on the morning on the day of his disappearance, had handmade his favourite blueberry pancake for breakfast. And his best friend, Nate. Below all that badass personality, truly cared for James. He would be the one that definitely cried buckets if James wasn't found.  And then Erin. The frequent side way looks which she casted at him when he wasn't looking showed her care in him.  She wouldn't be too happy if he disappeared too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is... a way.\"  Myrrh was apparently deep in thought now, trying to help James out after seeing that display of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked to her excitedly.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two, actually. One through Quests, and the other through... a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just fly down to Earth whenever we want to?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh laughed at this, the sound of her laughter resembling the chimes of a church bell.  She shook her head.  \"Young Misterian, you have much to learn,\" she laughed again.  \"We have to control the influx.  If millions of winged people flew down to Earth at one go, the humans will freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spirits fell.  So what was it again? Quests or Tests?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quests are definitely out,\" Myrrh suggested helpfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New Misterians are not applicable for it...  You have to be a hundred years of age at the very least.\" She trailed off.  \"I was on a quest that day you saved me,\" she flushed.  \"I... failed it miserably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames found himself reaching for her hand to comfort her unconsciously.  \"It's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but it is a disgrace to fail one,\" Myrrh sighed.  \"Anyway, back on track, you may have to enter the Tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tests?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded, looking solemn once more. \"Every year, new Misterians arrive on Skyaira.  Since only a few can return to Earth at one go, including those on Quests, we have implemented a series of Tests for those New Earth-Born Misterians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, this Misterian infested place called Skyaira was getting more complicated by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Earth-Born?\" James couldn't help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh shook her head.  \"No,\" she replied.  \"Born and bred on Skyaira like many of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh continued with the explaining.  \"The handful of Earth-Born Misterians who win the Tests, are allowed a day to visit Earth.  Either to recall old times, visit loved ones, anything.  Just one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames perked up immediately, feeling an adrenalin rush through him.  \"I'm gonna win it, Myrrh! I have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, but this time, the smile didn't reach her eyes. \"I hope so,\" she said, before hesitating.  \"But... it will not be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the Tests all about?\" James asked with curiosity.  He had to win it.  He had to win a ticket to Earth.  Maybe it wouldn't be easy, but he was born for flight even as a mortal.  And don't forget, he had a pair of lovely wings now.  He could conquer anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh suddenly grew very uncomfortable.  \"It is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Myrrh never finished her sentence.  Whatever the terrible test consisted of, James would never know.  Maybe it was a slaying a fire breathing dragon, or flying to the blazing sun, or fighting a million Earth-Born Misterians, but it was interrupted by an elegant lady Mysterian by the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter!\" The lady snapped.  \"It is forbidden to speak of!  You know that yourself!  It would be injustice for one Earth-Born to know of it when a hundred others remain ignorant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother,\" Myrrh swept herself into a humble curtsy.  \"You misjudge me, I would never dare to speak of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aristocratic lady pursed her lips thoughtfully, then dismissing it, she turned to James instead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, brave young Misterian, we will always be in debt to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to James, that if this lady was Princess Myrrh's mother, then she had to be the Queen of Skyaira!  And he was in their 'palace'!  He could feel the aura of her raw power radiating from her where he was standing, petrified with reverence.  Really, he wanted to bow, but his legs were too stiff with anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd an amazing thing happened!  The Great Queen knelt before James, earning a stifled gasp from Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!\" Myrrh exclaimed in pure shock.  \"You bow before an Earth-born?  The other pure Misterians will not be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ought to bow too, my daughter,\" the lady merely replied stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a second, Myrrh was on her knees too.  James honestly didn't know what to do.  At the moment, he currently had the Great Queen and Princess of Skyaira, bowing before him, claiming that they were in his debt.  He flushed with embarrassment.  He hadn't even done that much, just knocked out two men and got shot by the third, that's all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do that much,\" James muttered lamely.  \"I don't... deserve this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen, sensing his discomfort, laughed and rose to her feet.  \"It was brave of you to risk yourself to protect my daughter.  We are forever in your debt. Ask, and it will be granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, only happened in fairytales.  James stared at her dumbfounded, before the reality of that statement hit him like a ton of bricks.  And immediately, he already knew what he truly wanted.  He was sure of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anything cliche.  Not gold, or silver, or bronze. \"I want to go to Earth,\" he said without hesitation. \"I want to say farewell to all my loved ones there for the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...\" the Queen trailed off and shared an uncertain look with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to understand,\" Myrrh said.  \"We Misterians live by very strict laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Queen nodded sadly.  \"Earth... is not desirable to us, Misterians.  There are only two rigid ways one can gain access there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quests or Tests,\" James remembered, echoing Myrrh's words.  \"I understand.  And I would like to participate in a Test then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.  From the looks on his companions faces, it seemed as though James had just requested for a death sentence.  Myrrh had buried her face into her hands in complete dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your determination,\" the Queen finally whispered.  \"Very well then.  As Misterians, we value honour.  We do not take to unfulfilled debts.  So in return, I shall ensure that you are well trained for it at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, My Queen,\" James smiled, hope spreading throughout him like wildfire.  \"It means more to me... than anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not thank me, brave one.\" The Queen looked to her daughter.  \"Myrrh,\" she said, and Myrrh seemed to understand what she wanted.  The girl grinned at her mother before nodding a curt nod towards him.  Uh oh, that was the sort of look Nate had when he had just finished pranking some poor first year by the lockers.  Not good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Myrrh had grabbed James by the hand roughly, and was running.  Running so fast that the world passed by in a blur.  James screamed and squeezed his eyes shut.  And despite the blindness, he felt the sensation of a soaring jump, and the realization that he was amid the freedom of the air.  He was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened his eyes to find himself off the so called the invisible supposed 'solid floor' by like... <i>a few hundred kilometres</i>.  It was freaky.  Yes, he had dreamt of flying many times, but when he said 'flying', he meant flying in a <i>vehicle</i> like an aeroplane or something, not being dragged by some crazy girl with wings through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?\" James yelled over the raging winds.  \"PUT ME DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell?\" Myrrh asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST <i>BLOODY</i> PUT ME DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealization dawned on Myrrh.  And she giggled.  \"As a Misterian, you have to get used to this sensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE-\" a gust of wind cut the curse off in mid sentence.  \"I wish I were human then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames must have said the wrong thing, for Myrrh's cheerful demeanor deteriorated fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which reminds me,\" Myrrh's face darkened.  \"I eluded it earlier...  You may not like it... but I decided I must share this with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CAN TELL ME <i>AFTER</i> YOU PUT ME DOWN!\" James screeched as Myrrh narrowly missed a couple of floating objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh ignored him.  \"Earth-borns... are mostly discriminated here...\" she said quietly.  \"That is why your outright request to return to Earth just now...  just do not do it in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discriminated?\" James panted, interested.  So the Misterians weren't just a whole race of brainless flying creatures.  They operated like humans and had the ability to dislike.  And they seemed to really really hate humans for some reason.  That was news.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. <i>Humans</i> are pitiful creatures that have so much to learn. Honestly, I used to think that they were <i>flightless</i> demons themselves, only capable of destruction to themselves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy-\" James breathed, suddenly forgetting about his fear of falling or crashing.  \"Do you... do you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Myrrh said.  \"After you rescued me, -it was an even greater disgrace- but I shall never feel the same about humans again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, after hearing about an entire race of pure Misterians who hated him to the core, James just felt better hearing that.  \"Good,\" he said gently. \"That's all that matters you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled, but the smile faded fast.  \"Just... watch yourself.  Besides being young and inexperienced, Mortal-born Misterians are believed to still have retained a fragment of so called 'earth-weakness' within them.  They-...  Well, you understand.  Careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gulped, the hopes of visiting his loved ones (humans) on Earth was quickly fading.  If they really hated humans that much, would they really allow him to trawl through a human infested area while not on an actual quest?  Oh yes, that explained the Tests.  They only allowed a small group to go...  But even that was pretty lenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suspected with a sinking feeling that the Tests probably were far from easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't matter.  He would do anything to see his family and friends one last time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't given time to speculate any further, as Myrrh had swept him upwards, high above the clouds, sending him screaming bloody murder as she spiraled gracefully through the skies, lugging him after her.  It was only after a moment or so that James realized that despite his denials, he was actually thoroughly enjoying it.  Not only that, but he actually wanted to try out flying with his own pair of wings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must learn how to fly,\" Myrrh was saying in the background.  \"Misterians look down on those who cannot fly as well and respect those who can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, let me bring you somewhere,\" Myrrh abruptly said in mid flight, severing his train of thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered where to now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My Princess,\" the young man across him bowed gracefully.  \"It is an honour to receive you.  And-\"  He rose once more and coldly studied James.  \"This is the <i>Earth-Born</i> who rescued you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pursed his lips.  For some reason, that man seemed so eager to make an enemy out of him. Yes, yes, he was a- the <i>Earth-born</i>.  But not like he asked to be one.  In fact, it was ironic, because the only reason he was one was because he sacrificed his life for someone, and left everything else he loved behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo this was where bravery got you.  <i>Great</i>.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one and only,\" James muttered with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the man across heard it, he made no sign.  \"Doesn't look like much,\" he commented indifferently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Respect him,\" Myrrh commanded coldly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Misterian only bowed curtly once more.  \"To the best of my ability, Your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will train him,\" Myrrh said shortly.  \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the best of my ability,\" the Full-born Misterian repeated reluctantly.  \"The Queen informed me that he intends to participate in the Tests?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" James said firmly, earning a sneer from the man.  He ignored the Misterian, before side-glancing Myrrh and mouthing.  \"So he's my trainer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very best,\" Myrrh mouthed back, sighing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh happy day</i>,\" James muttered sarcastically.  He had a feeling he wasn't going to enjoy training one bit.  Why couldn't Myrrh have trained him?  Then he remembered the Queen's words: 'I shall ensure that you are well trained for it at the very least', and it struck him that this young-winged-man must be pretty professional then.  Besides being a stuck-up git, he must be quite good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sized his trainer up.  He was attractive- well to be precise, all of them were.  He would have been extremely handsome (even for a Misterian) if only his eyes weren't staring at James in such a condescending manner.  The Bastard.  Seems like that were both Earth and Angelic Bastards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" James challenged, his previous human self kicking back in.  \"Bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am assuming you know <i>nothing</i> about flight,\" his trainer said.  And it dawned upon James that it was meant as an insult.  He remembered what Myrrh said about the Misterians looking down on those unable to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong again,\" James snapped.  \"I fly as well as an... eagle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis trainer smirked - not a good one.  \"Eagles do not fly well,\" He pointed out.  \"But go on, let us see if you can even fly as well as a <i>paralyzed</i> eagle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames bit his lip. Mistake. He liked flying, but couldn't actually fly with his own wings, he realized.  Uh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fool\" His trainer remarked coldly before shoving him forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor of the arena underneath him shifted and retracted to the sides, to reveal an an even bigger arena, the floor a thousand feet below him.  If you were thinking of some sort of platform, there was none.  It wasn't any ordinary arena.  But an 'airborne' one; an area soley meant for flight.  If one fell from the air, only a thin layer of...<i> CLOUD???</i> all the way at the very bottom was to catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the arena was pretty crowded with Misterians.  If he fell, he would probably crush one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was sent falling, falling, falling.  It took a second or two for him to regain his senses.  And another second to spread open his wings.  And by the time he managed to actually 'titter' upwards weakly, he was about five feet from hitting the ground head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have killed me!\" James yelled.  \"What the bloody-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recall someone boasting about their flying skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" James muttered. \"But I didn't expect you to push me off-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a fool,\" His trainer interrupted.  \"Such cowardice. Truly pitiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt extremely inclined to give him the finger, but it occurred to him that his trainer's little push had been a blessing disguise.  For he was airborne!  Airborne and free as the wind!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was, is, and always would be The King of the Skies.  Even a Mysterian couldn't beat him if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did the only thing he could think off.  \"Catch me,\" James challenged.  \"If you can!\"  And with that, he zipped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps his trainer hadn't bothered to give him the chase, because he probably thought it wasn't worth it.  But it didn't matter, James was thoroughly enjoying it.  That sensation... of the wind against your face; That sensation... of freedom in its purest form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shape swooped down after him at high speed, and it occurred to James that his trainer had taken up the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smirked.  He would make that man swallow his insults no matter what.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape zoomed to James left, and James ducked and swerved underneath it, narrowly missing a Celestial Pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't ever catch me!\" James laughed triumphantly.  \"Tell you what: I'll catch you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he changed direction without warning, in pursuit of the blur shape before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pushed himself forward.... Nearly, nearly there.... So close that he could picture the man's narrowed eyes, and his look of sheer awe.  James smiled, and reached out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man dodged, and executed a beautiful, dazzling, amazing ninety-degree plunge in mid-flight.  In normal situations, for normal people, they would hesitate, before turning the other way.  But for James, he was different.  He was the <i>King of the Skies</i>.  Without a word, he followed, trying his best to keep control of his wings against the raging wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in this manner, James Walker became the first New Earth-Born in history to complete a Ninety-Degree plunge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stopped training in the arena and turned to watch, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the 'cloud-lined' ground drew near, James fought to maintain his balance as he changed direction, gliding forward instead of downwards.  The plunge wasn't perfect.  His wings felt sore from the pressure, and his thighs from scraping the 'floor', but nonetheless, he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least he thought he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames paused to catch his breath, and his instructor landed before him soundlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... alright?\" His instructor whispered in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenalin left James completely.  \"I... Yes,\" He replied, before grinning.  \"Better than ever.  Want to try again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis instructor just gaped, before holding out his hand.  \"I am Shadorn, known as Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you bothered to introduce yourself,\" James muttered, refusing to take his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor merely shrugged uncaringly.  \"You have earned a tiny portion of my respect, Young Earth-born.  It is your decision to accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a portion?\" James asked.  \"Where's the rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a portion,\" the instructor agreed firmly, his hand still hanging out loosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hell</i>, James thought.  <i>What was with the Misterian's honour, respect, virtues, all that rubbish?</i>  Look, he risked his life to perform a <i>ninety degree</i> plunge, and what? He only won <i>a portion</i> of his respect? Who cared for his respect anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructor put down his hand.  \"Alright,\" James finally decided.  \"I'll shake your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late,\" the man replied tautly, before spreading his wings and taking off from the arena.  James stared after him smugly before taking off after him, wondering where the instructor would lead him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?!?!\" James yelled after his instructor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never speak while in flight,\" the instructor scowled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes.  Myrrh never said so.  And she was princess.  \"Tell me where we're going!\" James insisted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little fo-\" The instructor changed the subject realizing that it was no longer applicable.  \"Little weakling, we are heading to the Weaponry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no longer a need to learn to fly,\" the full born Misterian forced out, his 'honour' apparently hurt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we are moving on to choose your weapon for <i>The Tests</i>,\" the man snarled back.  \"Now, shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Tests...</i> James shivered at that thought.  Oh yes, he had yet to sit through that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the weapon he were to pick would play an important role.  It would determine his win or his loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what weapon would be suitable for someone like him.</span></div></div>",

When they landed,  James wanted to ask a question. But one look at the his instructor's face,  and James knew that he was not in the mood for questions - as usual. So wordlessly, they went on inside. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Here,  Choose your weapons. I don't have much time,\" He said, checking his little odd winged watch. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJames immediately got down to work and went to search for an weapon. He knew this was important. If he did choose a weapon which he was unable to wield, he would most probably fail the Tests. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe first weapon he came across was a javelin. He knew that throwing was his weakness - he hadn't a single muscle under that shirt of his. So, he simply walked away from it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe'd started to size up some Misterian-made swords, when he heard the irritating voice of his instructor. \" Hurry up! I don't have all day!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'ARG.' James thought. ' Can his instructor just stop bugging him?'<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" The instructor yelled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes, but when his Instructor began to stalk off out of impatience - James realized he was serious.  James quickly snatched the nearest figthing piece of stick before him before racing after Shadow.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis instructor finally decided to turn.  He scoffed for a moment or two, before inspecting the piece of stick that James held in his hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I see,\" he said solemnly.  \"A Misterian-made sword?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJames gawked at the stick in his hand.  \"This is a sword?  It doesn't even look like one!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShadow scowled.  \"That, little fool, is one of the greatest Misterian-made swords ever created!  I dare say you've just insulted our entire race!\" He accused furiously.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJames opened his mouth, before closing it without another word.  Fine by him.  He lifted the 'sword' to inspect it once more.  You really couldn't blame him for mistaking it for a stick, because it really did resemble one from all four aspects.  James began to wonder if winning was even possible with this thing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Follow me,\"  Shadow suddenly commanded coldly. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n'What now?' James thought. ' Where are we going?' <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His instructor had warned him not to speak while in flight, but James couldn't care less at the moment.  So defiantly, he arched forward and shouted, \"Hey! Where are we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow scowled at this. At first he refused to answer,  but then, after constant bugging, he literally exploded. \" You are not supposed talk when you are flying! How many times must I tell you that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames, ignored him - repeating, \"Where are we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked as if he was about to strangle him there and then, but decided against it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to 'The Sharpening'!  Now,  for the hundredth time, will you shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long time to reach 'The Sharpening'.  But it soon appeared before them.  Not as big as the Weaponry of course.  But its tip - as though to match its name was carved particularly sharp to resemble a Blade.  With one impatient gesture from Shadow, they landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to sharpen your own sword,\" he commanded as though it was the most known thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even sharpen a sword?\" James asked.  It sounded ridiculous.  Weren't swords supposed to be sharp in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked insulted at this.  \"Hand me your Misterian Sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames did as he was told, pushing the piece of stick into Shadow's hands.   Frankly speaking, he still couldn't believe that was a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow inspected it, twirling it around for eternity, before turning back to face James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a Sharpener.  One of those from the back.  And Sharpen it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames groaned, he didn't like the sound of this.  \"Help me... please?\" He suggested hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat hope.  Shadow positively glowered at that request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a Misterian Practice so I suggest you don't skive of this,\" Shadow snapped.  \"A Sword is forever our life-long <i>companion</i>!  So upon receiving one, we sharpen it.  We shape it to our liking.  Its believed that we're shaping our own <i>destiny</i> through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing James could think of was, \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow glared at him.  \"Would you like <i>me</i> to shape <i>your destiny</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wanted to say \"I couldn't care less\" but he didn't dare to.  So instead, he just meekly shook his head in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\"Shadow said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went behind and he found lots of ridiculous looking equipment.  All of them had different shape and sizes.  Most had jagged diamond edges, metallic gears and blades, and others were stuck with pieces of crystal shards.  They did not look like sharpeners one bit,  but as Shadow mentioned, they had to be.  Some looked like broken pencils while others looked like apple slicers.  James guessed that the more bizarre The 'Sharpeners' structure, the more extraordinary the result of the 'sword' blade would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that he'd go for the coolest looking one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames went to a corner and picked one up....</span></div></div>",

Only that it was larger, taller, and more beautiful. Once again, it was constructed from silver and glass (possibly the Misterian's favorite materials), but this time, also adorned with Earthly jewels. It seemed that the Misterians certainly had a thing with Human Jewelry.  Wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, but either way, there was no door. Only opened paned windows thousands of feet off the 'ground'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd we... going to get up there?\" James asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow stared at him as though James had gone nuts. \"Have you forgotten your heritage, young Misterian?\" he accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" James mumbled, feeling sheepish. \"<i>Geez</i>, I was only asking a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they flew in.  And the moment they landed into its interior, James gasped in shock.  For lining the entire level, was just... weapons.  Rows and rows of them; shelves after shelves filled with them.  Amazing!   He had never seen so many weapons in his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only one level,\" Shadow explained arrogantly.  \"Skyaira is famous for its Weaponry, just as Pandora is known for its Arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a winged woman appeared. She was middle-aged, with strangely... wise and ancient green eyes.  <i>Creepy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my apprentice,\" She greeted Shadow, before turning to James.  \"Now... Oh! Isn't this the New Earth-Born who performed a ninety-degree plunge in mid-flight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Shadow forced out reluctantly.  \"Nothing great really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense Shadow!\" The woman chided him. \"He made history!\"  Then she smiled towards James and James decided that he rather liked her.  \"What is your name, Great One?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James Walker,\" He replied, before asking. \"How did you know that I did the plunge...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, James,\" the woman said seriously.  \"I, Pandora, know many things-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rubbish,\" Shadow cut in dryly.  \"I am guessing some nosy parker flew in here to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the activities going on, and when Shadow and Pandora arguing merrily with each other, James found it rather difficult to digest all they said.  So, the woman's name was Pandora, named after one of the Misterian cities?  And Shadow was her apprentice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Pandora?\" James couldn't help but blurt.  \"Named after one of the Mysterian cities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Shadow and Pandora looked to each other and laughed.  It was the first time James had seen Shadow laugh like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the Misterian cities was named after me,\" Pandora corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is an old hag for a Misterian,\" Shadow pointed out critically. Then he turned to Pandora. \"I'm guessing next week you're hitting 2900 years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" James gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manners, my apprentice,\" Pandora chided.  \"Well yes, I am that old.  And in my lifetime, I dare say I have completed many things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was from Pandora,\" Shadow added unhelpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Previously,\" Pandora agreed.  \"I was the greatest Quester of all time. Understand why my city - whom prides itself in fighting- was renamed in my honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames felt himself filling up with respect for her upon hearing this. \"Wow,\"  he whistled in awe. \"You-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back on track!\" Shadow scowled.  \"My apprentice here-\" he gestured to James. \"Needs a weapon for The Tests. We better hurry up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded with agreement before leading them down the aisles and aisles of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort do you fancy?\" She asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weapon of choice,\" The woman explained.  \"Swords?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" James decided against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spears?\" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pictured his wimpy self lugging a spear behind him, before shaking it off.  \"I'll pass, Madam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grew impatient. \"Tell me,\" he demanded. \"What do you consider yourself skilled at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried to think of something.  He was an awesome computer gamer... An awfully sociable person.... Oh yes! And he was great in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, for example, are you... hard to catch? Hard to find? Slippery?  Or strong?\"  Shadow explained exasperatedly.  \"Or are you completely useless?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora kneed her apprentice in the stomach, scowling.  \"You better leave the talking to me, Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing a tantrum, Shadow stalked off from his mentor and his apprentice, in search of something better to do.  James stared distastefully after him.  So that guy had a temper too?  He was so unlikable to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though reading his thoughts, Pandora patted his shoulder gently.  \"You are truly lucky, James, to have him as your mentor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bad joke,\" James snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, young one, I am serious.\" Pandora laughed and continued to lead James down the aisles.  \"Your mentor is young, yes, but very capable. In fact, I believe you stand a chance of winning the Tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Really?\"  That was a great compliment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just listen to him,\" Pandora advised.  \"Block out all the insults, and you will not go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know what to say.  He didn't agree with her one bit though.  \"Well.. oh, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Pandora broke into a grin.  After all that serious advice, that was unusual.  \"Has he shaken your hand yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? He offered...\" James grinned back.  \"But I didn't take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Pandora burst out laughing.  \"Even as his mentor, it took me one century to get that handshake!  And you rejected it!  Oh, oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged modestly.  \"He said I'd only won a tiny portion of his respect. Well, not like I care or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora laughed it off.  \"Winning his entire respect took me another four centuries!  You have a lot of time to impress him,  young one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was about to reply when Pandora stopped walking abruptly and entered another small aisle.  She reached its end, before pulling out something that resembled two tiny daggers.  One black, one white.  Something about it was... unsettling.  And within the dark aisle, the white one seemed to glow - not a very bright glow, but one of great potential...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twin blades,\" Pandora smiled.  \"I heard of your dive.  True, I have yet to see you fly, but I am guessing it is much beyond average.  I think this belongs to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...?\" James asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora nodded.  \"In my early age, I used to adore it. Every time it came to equipping for a Quest, I always used these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be ancient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" Pandora agreed solemnly.  \"Most Misterians prefer spears and bows and arrows.  But spears are conspicuous.  You are deft in the air.  Remain unseen, and strike from the back with these. That, should be your tactic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora seemed to be skilled with tactics.  But then and again, she had a city renamed after her.  She must be amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you stop <i>Questing</i>?\" James was inclined to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPandora smiled, before gesturing around her.  \"See this Weaponry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.  Why?\"  Pandora hadn't answered his question yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's huge isn't it?\"  James merely nodded, befuddled. \"I have lived a long time,\" Pandora finally explained.  \"I am one of the few Misterians who know this place inside out.  Therefore, is it not befitting for me to be the guide here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames blinked.  It did make some sense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you are done with the equipping procedure,\" Pandora handed the blades gingerly to James.  She then turned before calling out, \"Shadow!  We are finished!\"  Before returning her attention to James.  \"Do me proud, Young One, Apprentice of my Apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it sound like she was his grandmother or something, but James didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what his Mentor had in mind for him next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow had taken one look at the daggers in James hand and nodded in a approval.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pandora's Twin Blades,\" he breathed in awe.  \"Not a bad choice, <i>Earth-Born</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? So Shadow was complimenting him and insulting him at the same time?  Truly a remarkable feat.  \"Pandora suggested it,\" James replied shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow raised his eyebrows.  \"She... gave it up to you?\" he frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a problem?\" James questioned defiantly.  What was wrong with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shrugged.  \"Just... unbelievable.\"  Then he looked away, uninterested in the conversation.  \"Those blades slayed a hundred Demons.  Use it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Shadow had suggested they head for the Misterian City, Pandora.  Remembering Myrrh, James had argued over that decision, but Shadow wasn't hearing anything but his own voice.  As far as his Mentor was concerned, his mind was set.  He wasn't listening to any Earth-Born's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" James snarled.  \"You go yourself!  I'm staying in Skyaria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be seeing your Date again if that is what you are concerned of!\" Shadow fought back icily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" James asked, aghast.  \"My Date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Princess,\" snapped Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Myrrh?\" James could feel his wing tips heat up with embarrassment.  He didn't bother to argue that he wasn't thinking of her.  Because, yes, he was.  \"Well... Err, no, she isn't... my date.  Not like that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stop your nonsense!\" Shadow bit back.  \"The Tests are always carried out in Pandora's Arena for it is the grandest of all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Foolish One,\" Shadow criticized mercilessly.  \"You need to familiarize yourself with its layout before <i>The Test</i>, which is next week, on the Eve of the Winter Solstice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next... week...\" James lips felt parched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shook his head and sighed for the first time.  \"You are one of the newest Earth-borns to take the Test.  Already a great disadvantage.  So we must go, <i>now</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the next thing that happened was so unexpected, that James wondered if it was fated.  It was too coincidental!  For a voice, a most familiar voice which James was overly glad to hear, had called out cheekily from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not thinking of leaving without me, were you?\" Myrrh giggled, before landing gracefully beside James.  And in her hands, held a tiny sling bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Princess?\" Shadow asked incredulously.  \"Why...? How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned at Myrrh, more than happy to have her back.  \"Got the <i>Great Shadow</i> tongue tied, haven't you Myrrh?  Amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh laughed joyously before glancing at the two in a weird manner.  \"You two are on nickname basis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just me!\" exclaimed James cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled a stunning smile of amazement at James, and James felt his wingtips reddening again.  \"Earned his respect, did you not?  That is.. amazing.  Truthfully speaking, I, even as Princess, haven't.  Few have.  But I am going to call him Shadow anyway, so too bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Shadow lashed out, changing the subject.  \"Your Highness, how did you know that we are leaving for Pandora earlier...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to Pandora when equipping for a Quest, <i>Shadow</i>,\" Myrrh explained. \"You know Pandora- knows her Apprentice inside out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not recall telling Pandora anything!\" Shadow said angrily, not liking to be read 'inside out'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh shrugged.  \"That is Pandora for you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're coming along?\" James asked Myrrh happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded firmly.  \"Definitely.  I am in debt to you, and I <i>will</i> go and aid you in whatever way I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are basically telling me, My Princess,\" Shadow demanded.  \"That you intend to <i>skive off</i> your current Quest, and <i>leave</i> the city of your birth like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Myrrh replied stubbornly, chin out.  \"Why not?  I <i>am</i> going.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow muttered something about dishonour.  But no one took any notice of that douche bag.  James just stood there in disbelief, thanking the stars for his awesome luck.  So Myrrh was going along!  Yes!  Her presence made it seem like a holiday, especially since James had spent the last few hours pathetically, with.... Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how the unlikely trio came to walk the streets of Pandora half a day later.  It turned out that Myrrh's tiny sling bag was 'magic induced', and its interior could store a tremendous amount of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful for travel,\" Myrrh had explained.  And James had to agree that it was pretty handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shadow wasn't sitting around for idle talk.  The moment they had touched down in Pandora, he had 'ordered' the <i>Princess</i> Myrrh to reserve a place in the 'Test's Participant's Living Quarters', before dragging James right into Pandora's Arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arena was as Majestic as Skyaira's Weaponry.  Just that it was an Arena.  A well maintained one, that was.  However, unlike Skyaira's Arena, in Pandora's Arena, there were platforms.  Just a couple of them, and floating too.  Also, instead of being cylindrical in shape, it was hexagonal in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unusual sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" A winged guard stepped right in their path.  \"The Training Arena has been closed for preparations for the Tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow rolled his eyes impatiently, before pointing to James.  \"He is a participant.  We are here to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Participant.  Oh, I see.  An Earth-Born,\" and James became an object of close inspection for the guard.  The guard seemed to want to make a critical remark about Earth-Borns but decided against it.  \"So...\" He changed the subject.  \"Where are you two from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyaira,\" James replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyaira!\" The guard whistled with amazement.  \"Send my regards to the Queen and the Princess!  Say its from Dorinan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded amiably.  \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Young One!\" The guard said gratefully. \"You are the first competitor- well, besides our own- to arrive.  Wait...- Oh my-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Guard took a long look at Shadow.  And a look of respect crossed his features.  \"Shadorn!\" He exclaimed.  \"Youngest <i>Quest Master</i> in history?  No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shrugged humbly, before turning away. So maybe that guy did have a streak of humility in him.  James really did wonder what Quest Master was.  Obviously,  a 'Quester' was someone who participated in Quests.  But he had yet to learn the other terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to let us in?\" Shadow asked tautly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard, bowed politely, before showing them the way in.  \"Yes sir.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment James and Shadow stepped into the Arena, all parrying and thrusting ceased.  Misterians gliding above landed on the glass floor immediately.  It occurred to James that the Pandorians didn't receive many visitors, hence did not know how to react.  Or alternatively, they were surprised that their competitors had arrived this early.  It was really hard to tell, because the looks on their faces differed entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where're you guys from?\" A young boy asked curiously as he landed beside James. It then dawned upon James that this kid's accent was similar to his own.  That kid was Earth-Born, and from his region too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyaira,\" Shadow replied tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyaira?!?!\" The kid exclaimed.  \"NO WAY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wondered what was there to be excited about.  \"Yep, we are.  Traveled here for The Tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy instantly swiveled around to face a winged man behind him - his instructor-.  \"Gorion!\" He yelled excitedly.  \"That's where the <i>Questers</i> go right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the man replied calmly.  \"That is the capital city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" The boy laughed.  \"Whoa, you guys are cool!  The Queen and Princess lives there!  Pandora lives there too, eh? So does Shadorn!  Awesome Questers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the boy mentioned Shadorn's name, James looked to Shadow in another bout of shock.  Shadow looked indifferent as always.  But.... Again? Another mention of the <i>Great Shadow</i>!  Was he an amazing Quester like his former Mentor, <i>Pandora</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment James thought about the elderly Misterian, he began to notice something he hadn't noticed earlier.  In the corner of the Arena, stood a colossal statue of a woman with ancient but wise green eyes.  Jame's eyes lit up at once.  PANDORA!  Wasn't that her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to ask, because a winged woman noticed his wide-eyed staring.  \"That is <i>Pandora</i>,\" she smiled at him.  \"The Great Quester in which our city was renamed after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" James breathed in awe.  \"She's... amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" The woman raised her eyebrows.  \"You have met her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the <i>Skyairan</i> Weaponry,\" he agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to take that as an insult.  \"Pandora will always be a Pandorian at heart!\" She declared firmly.  \"<i>Always</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow rolled his eyes.  \"Rubbish,\" he countered.  \"She has dwelled in Skyaira for many years, and will be there for many years to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't understand why Shadow had to make enemies with every single person he met.  Honestly, could Shadow even put a nice word and a person's name in one sentence?  Perhaps not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman glared at Shadow, before recognition and awe crossed her features.  \"Shadorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow merely scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy jumped upon hearing that.  \"SHADORN?\" He hollered.  \"QUEST MASTER?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show some respect, Max,\" The boy's Mentor told him quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the boy wasn't listening.  Instead, he did the opposite thing.  Max scuttled towards Shadow quickly, before practically springing into him, trying to pin Shadow to the floor.  Well of course, he failed.  Shadow merely flailed for a minute, before throwing him off effortlessly.  The only thing the boy succeeded in doing was making him really annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amusing.  James grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shadow snarled, unamused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want your respect!\" The boy proclaimed.  And James remembered Shadow offering him his hand - and respect- on the <i>first</i> day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow turned to his Mentor exasperatedly.  \"Your Charge is insane!  I give no respect to Earth-Borns!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man merely grinned back at Shadow slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy darted in front of Shadow once more.  \"They say you give your respect to the very Best!  Shake my hand!\" He commanded epically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winged woman just shook her head and laughed.  James couldn't stop himself any longer.  Maybe he'd get it from Shadow later, but for now, he was going to enjoy himself.  So he joined in the hearty laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tackled Shadow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Shadow gasped, apparently not used to this treatment.  He side glanced Max's Mentor urgently.  \"Tell him to get off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's grin broadened.  \"He will not,\" he shrugged.  \"You have to do as he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was really persistent.  He wasn't even close to as good as Shadow was in combating.  But he kept on jumping on Shadow.  Being as short tempered as Shadow was, he gave in rather quickly.  He finally reluctantly decided on offering Max a miserable pinky.  Max took it happily anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day!\" Max declared.  \"I will have all your respect!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was about to tell Max that that would take at least four centuries, but before he could reply, someone slammed a blunt end of a spear into his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-?\" James never finished his sentence as the very same spear flew at him again.  He cursed, before dodging in time, the spear millimeters from his head.  He didn't think, but just acted instinctively by pulling out the twin blades Pandora had entrusted him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spear hesitated above him.  \"<i>Pandora's</i> blades?\" someone gasped from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finally grasped the opportunity to look at his attacker.  It was the same woman who'd pointed Shadow out.  What the?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he panted in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been... capable to earn it,\" she nodded in approval.  \"Prove it to me.\"  Then she sent her spear flying at his rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames dodged, barely missing it once more.  \"<i>Hell</i>!\" He yelled breathlessly.  \"I don't wanna fight you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earn <i>my</i> respect,\" the woman smiled craftily.  \"This is the way of the <i>Pandorians</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hell</i>, James couldn't care less about the way of the <i>Pandorians</i>.  But he didn't tell her that.  She seemed insulted enough when he'd mentioned Pandoria being in Skyaira. <i> Sensitive</i>.  So he just tried to recall Pandoria's wise words as he dodged another thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, he had the advantage in the air.  The power scale would tip there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a triumphant smirk form on his features.  James spread his silver wings before spiraling up the arena.  Unaware of her disadvantage, the woman took off after him confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree.  Adrenalin rushed through his veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earn <i>my</i> respect!\" James echoed back teasingly.  \"I'll tell you my name!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow was craftier than he looked.  James bet he had plotted this entirely before they left for Pandora.  Because the moment you stepped into Pandora, there was no backing out from challenges.  If you a person who couldn't take a fight, best you stay a thousand kilometers away from it.  James guessed that it had either something to do with the atmosphere, or Pandora's culture, or the Pandorians nature and belief of respect.  You couldn't walk down the road ten meters without getting yourself into a duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo James never caught an opportunity to rest.  Whenever he secretly snuck out of the Arena to go to the loo or something, some random winged dude would step up to him and request a duel. He just had to hold his bladder.  Here, rejecting a duel request was almost as disgracing as failing a Quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday, it was just fights after fights after fights.  Training, training, training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was where Myrrh came in.  She helped loads with his cuts and bruises.  She was an awesome Healer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I inherited at least one great trait from my Father,\" Myrrh shrugged.  \"Healing, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father?  The King?\" James blurted curiously.  He hadn't heard a thing of the King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Father, he...  He died an unfortunate death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't know how to react.  He just nodded seriously, before reaching forward and resting a single hand on Myrrh's own.  \"I'm sorry,\" he said gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright.\" Myrrh smiled wearily.  \"He is- <i>was</i> not... <i>Quester</i> material - like me.  So... He perished on a <i>Quest</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did? Then how come no one spoke of the King?  There seemed to be no honoury monuments built to commemorate the King!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you are thinking,\" she said softly.  \"He failed a Quest.  It is a disgrace.  And... he... well, <i>adored</i> humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the better of James.  \"Who- I mean, <i>what</i>, killed him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demons.\"  Myrrh's eyes immediately turned as frosty as the winter ice.  \"Flightless, honourless Demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh's scathing remark hung in the air, cutting out the following silence.  No words were spoken afterwards.  James sensed that Myrrh valued this space and gave her all she needed.  Both of them sat in silence as Jame's bruises and cuts smoothed over and regained its healthy colour.  As for the deeper ones, Myrrh improved its situation with a little with magic, before patching up the unhealed areas with a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good as new,\" Myrrh beamed.  \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" James laughed before standing to his feet, testing out his seemingly new pair of limbs.  \"Myrrh! Oh Gosh!  Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kill</i> the Demons for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stared back at him and smiled.  James just stood there, fighting the urge to give her one big comforting hug.  But when her thoughtful gaze grew pretty awkward, he headed on outside instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax tackled James as soon as he re-entered the Pandorian Arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" James groaned.  \"Get off me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax flipped over and somersaulted coolly to his feet.  \"Hey,\" he greeted finally.  \"Haven't earned your respect, have I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" James snapped.  \"You have my respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's eyes bulged out from their sockets.  And suddenly, James was worried it was a symptom of an upcoming seizure or something.  It was only when five seconds later, Max still hadn't got into a fit yet, and was still staring gapingly at James, did James realize that it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" James demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do that!\"  Max screeched, prodding James with the blunt edge of his sword.  \"FIGHT!  You've to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled his eyes.  \"Who says?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say!\" Max chortled proudly.  \"Everyone says! So-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow stepped in before Max completed his sentence.  He pointed rudely towards James.  \"You,\" he demanded.  \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i>, have a name,\" James scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow cocked his head.  \"<i>Really</i>? Do prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames bit his lip.  From the amused expression Shadow was giving him, James understood what he was getting at.  Though unsaid, he was pressing for another bout of intense torture training, making use of the <i>Pandorian Honour</i> to do it.  That <i>sly</i> bastard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside Shadow, Max was busy considering whether to pounce on the <i>Great Shadorn</i> once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Max said thoughtfully.  \"Prove to me you can beat Shadorn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked for your opinion, <i>Earth-Born</i>,\" Shadow sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax glared at Shadorn.  \"You know what dude?\" he addressed James.  \"I'm <i>definitely</i> rooting for you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned at this.  So he had a supporter now.  Awesome.  \"I betcha you won't be disappointed.\"  And with his twin blades at hand, James took off into the air merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other competitors started streaming in at about noon time.  Max was still hanging around James of course, bugging the hell out of him about respect.  So what?  He had done some major damage to Shadow during the duel, but not like he'd won or anything.  No biggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn fast!\"  Max was exclaiming. \"D' you have wings on your feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" James replied sarcastically.  \"But I've toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I heard you beat Karie too!  Damn good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames thought back about the first challenge he'd taken up- I mean, had been <i>forced</i> to take up in Pandoria.  He recalled with a certain nostalgia the tough woman who'd been so intent with spearing him through with a spear on his first day.  Oh yes, that was Karie.  Sure brought back <i>fond</i> memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know you're damn fast?\" Max was repeating again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shrugged modestly.  \"But I ain't as good with the weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch and wait,\" Max warned, a silly lopsided grin forming on his features.  \"I'M EARNING YOUR RESPECT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax frowned, unsure.  \"No!\" He proclaimed insanely.  \"One day! I'm so gonna beat you!  Watch your back!\"  Pandorians were downright <i>weird</i>.  They pounced on you to get your respect, and when you gave it to them, they didn't want it.  <i>Wow</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last challenge hanging in the air unaccepted, Max disappeared to go and check out the new arrivals.  James decided to follow suit.  After all, they were the ones who controlled his chances of winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new arrivals were well-trained in general.  Definitely.  Well, there were a handful which needed brushing up - and some were pretty sucky.  But on a whole, James was in deep deep trouble.  He'd seen the big guy with the massive trident spearing ten dummies through at one go; he'd seen the girl with the sword sparring deftly with Karie; he <i>hadn't</i> seen the kid with the dark wings camouflaging himself.  O_Olll.  Uh-oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" Shadow said grimly.  \"- which is two days before The Tests.  The challenge will be revealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shivered.  \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shook him violently.  \"Have more confidence James!\" -he had used his name!- \"You are acting like a complete <i>Earth-Born</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" He growled at Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow rolled his eyes.  \"You,\" he forced out stiffly.  \"Are the <i>fastest</i> Misterian I have ever seen.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A compliment!?!</i>  - What was more shocking was that it was- From <i>Shadow</i>?  NO WAY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames grinned.  \"Oh, you admit it at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow bit his lip, his pride apparently <i>very</i> hurt.  \"Do not get overly proud yet,\" He snapped back.  \"Win the Tests, and I <i>may</i> offer the <i>undeserving</i> you, another half of my respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wanted to point out sharply that he couldn't care less, but his thoughts had drifted off to somewhere else.  Shadow had mentioned that tomorrow, they were revealing the challenge for The Tests.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would it be?</span></div></div>",

Most of the Earth-Borns and their Mentors had turned so white that they'd put paper to shame.  Yes, Demons <i>equaled</i> bad.  James knew that.  Myrrh had nearly <i>died</i> in combat with a wingless Demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, they were giving the Demon wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>One</i> Demon against <i>Two</i> Earth Borns,\" The next Quest Master spoke.  If that was supposed to be an inspirational speech, it <i>failed</i> because no one felt relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, leaving the participants convulsing in fear-like fits, the dozen of Quest Masters/Mistresses stalked off the platform emotionlessly - leaving the Mentors to clean up the spilt milk they'd left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was supposed to be a day of planning strategies for The Tests.  Not worrying your butt off- which everyone appeared to be doing at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Demons</i>?\" Myrrh's eyes widened.  \"How can they- They can't-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked <i></i>grim.  He <i>always</i> was grim.  But now, he was <i>grimmer</i> than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad?\" James asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Father was killed by a Demon!\" Myrrh snapped.  \"I nearly died by the hands of one!  And now you? NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a two against one, Myrrh,\" James tried to console.  \"Look on the bright side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shut both of them up with a single '<i>stop-your-bloody-nonsense</i>' glare before pointing abruptly to James.  \"Tell me, James, what <i>exactly</i> are demons?\" he demanded as he usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had no clue.  \"Err... Evil creatures of the Below which possess humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow cast him a withering glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" protested James indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh sighed.  Realizing that Shadow had relapsed into his temper tantrums once more, it was her turn to take the wheel.  \"Demons are- I mean, <i>were</i>...  Misterians-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Myrrh agreed.  \"A few hundred years ago.  A great deal of Misterians from the city Arcadia rebelled and turned against the King...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rebellion?\" James asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow nudged him roughly.  \"<i>Shut up</i> and listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh just ignored Shadow and nodded sadly to James question.  \"Misterian guards and soldiers equipped with the best weapons were sent to the contain the situation...  And the rebels made their last stand in the city Arcadia.  Many died, James.  That's why Arcadia is... inhabited.  Its is a graveyard for the fallen rebels, and a painful reminder to the rest of us to <i>conform</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the point is..?\" Shadow prompted Myrrh impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Myrrh glared at Shadow.  \"The remaining survivors were stripped of their wings and banished to Earth for all eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Shadow scowled.  \"Go on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was mistake,\" Myrrh whispered.  \"Misterians do not take to having their wings torn off.  Those survivors, called 'Fallen Angels' were- <i>are</i> bitter.  Most of them are insane.  And don't forget, they seek revenge on <i>us</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow was about to yell at her to get on, but Myrrh did anyway.  \"And don't forget, though wingless, their Magic is still <i>intact</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they will die off soon, right?\" James asked, frightened now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Myrrh shrugged.  \"But they have bred with humans and other races like the <i>Gaians</i>, and the Aquarians.  And the new breed detests us equally, mind you. These are what we call <i>'Demons</i>'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn't dare ask what the 'Gaians' and 'Aquarians' were.  Myrrh spoke of the 'Gaians' as if they were some sort of dirt on her shoe.  She had pointed the Aquarians out indifferently as well.  He had a feeling she didn't really like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shivered, standing there, rock still.  <i>Demons</i>- the word drilled itself into his head like a nail.  He wondered how anyone could be so bitter as to pass it on generation after generation.  But then he remembered the Misterian's strange concept of honour and realized that they never would never stop hating till they tasted revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd James was up against one of them.  The <i>Demon</i> would probably party if he managed to kill James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we got that sorted out,\" Shadow told James.  \"Now for the strategy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strategy?\" James gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow nodded impatiently.  \"It would be better if we knew your <i>teammate</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teammate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear the Quest Master!\" Shadow growled.  \"Yes, you have a fellow Earth-Born companion to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yes</i>, James thought.  <i>Not that helped.  It just meant another Misterian was gonna die with him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then,\" Myrrh severed his thoughts.  \"Let's have a look at <i>The Lists</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

He'd been throwing a fit ever since the news of the Princess's disappearance had spread all the way to Pandora.  It turned out that Myrrh hadn't leaked out a thing out to her Mother, the Queen.  And Skyaira was currently in upheaval.  As rumours went, Myrrh had been kidnapped by the Gaians during her Quest - or something equally stupid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow had stomped around, cursed the skies and the ground, before cursing the Princess in every <i>decent</i> way he could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent fool!\" He had snarled.  \"Of all things- ARG!  What if the Queen declares war on the Gaians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh flushed apologetically.  \"Well...-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be <i>your</i> fault!\" Shadow accused defiantly.  \"I say you pick up your wings and fly back this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Myrrh side-glanced James - as though begging for permission to stay.  \"I...\" she choked.  \"I want to stay with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow scowled exasperatedly.  \"At least inform the Queen-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" Myrrh burst out.  \"She'll send for me to return immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm staying - by the order of your Princess, I'm to stay!\"  Myrrh declared stubbornly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames honestly didn't know who to side.  Shadow was right for one thing - Myrrh shouldn't have run off like that, but yet, James hadn't dared admit that he did want Myrrh to stay to support him.  He truly felt safe around Myrrh.  But he wasn't going to let Shadow in on this secret, especially since his mentor already had the wrong idea about them being 'Dates'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut James couldn't help himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow...\"  James said hesitantly.  \"Just one last day- let her stay.  It'll barely make a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow had been most upset by that idea, but to their greatest surprise, he had caved in much later on.  (By that time, they'd wasted half a day.)  And not to forget, Shadow still refused to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James.. And ah... the Famous Shadorn?  And...\" The unknown woman turned to Myrrh.  \"Who's this, may I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aryn,\" Myrrh quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I assume you know Karie?\" The unknown woman gestured to the other woman beside her.  \"My apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris tilted her head forward in acknowledgement before casting James a secret wink - which <i>could be</i> considered as flirtatious.  Myrrh saw that - and oh boy- she positively glared back at Karie coldly.  James was taken aback.  Did Myrrh and Karie know each other before hand?  The chances were slim, but it did seem that Myrrh didn't like her very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" James agreed.  \"I dueled with Karie before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled at that news.  \"That's great, as - as you probably already know,\" She reasoned.  \"You're paired with her for The Tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarie nodded solemnly.  \"We'll need a great deal of teamwork to bring down that flying <i>Demon</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Myrrh said something which caused James to gawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should not be hard for you,\" Myrrh seethed abruptly.  \"Since you <i>are</i> one yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really surprised James.  Karie was a Misterian apparently - with wings and all - so how could Myrrh accuse her of being a Demon!  Myrrh was stubborn at times, but never was she unreasonable!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stinging remark directed at Karie hung in the air, cutting out the silence which followed afterwards.  James expected Karie to deny that accusation, or even launch herself at the Princess, but she didn't.  In fact, she did the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you?\" Karie asked coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our heroine?\" Karie asked quietly.  \"What would she know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough to know that it was your <i>Demonic</i> father who slayed My F- <i>Our King</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames couldn't believe what he was hearing, it just didn't make sense.  How could her 'Demonic' father have killed the King, Myrrh's Father?  If Karie's Father was a Demon, then shouldn't she be one too?  This puzzled him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow was eavesdropping on the conversation (rather obviously) but he hadn't made any move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" James inquired curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarie's eyes narrowed dangerously.  \"Precisely, Aryn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That famous Demon who took down Our King,\" Myrrh whispered bitterly.  \"Oh - he is powerful, yes.  We have not managed to lay our hands on him, but we have been tracking him for centuries.  So don't you lie Karie, you <i>are</i> his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarie paled upon hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is true?\" Myrrh asked audaciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Shadow rose to his feet, before pointing an accusing finger at Myrrh.  Perhaps he was still mad at her.  \"Enough,\" Shadow commanded. \"Really, what is past, is past.  The point is, she is a Mysterian now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked James even more.  Oh gosh!  So he knew too?  <i>Great</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about this?\" James frowned towards Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow raised his eyebrows challengingly.  \"So?  Why shouldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a Quest Master,\" The Unknown Woman said with a sigh.  \"He leads Quests - of course he knows.\"  When Myrrh was about to open her mouth indignantly to retort, the woman just waved her aside.  \"As Shadorn said: What is past, is past.  Let us not dwell on it.  I feel we should start planning for tomorrow's Test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded slowly, reluctantly. James snuck a peak at her.  <i>Myrrh didn't look angry,</i> he began to realize.  <i>She looked more shocked and confused.</i>  So he did what sixth sense told him to do - he did that a lot as a human-.  He reached down, and pulled Myrrh into an endearing embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ultimately broke the tension. The unknown woman smiled. Karie chortled.  And Shadow grinned wickedly.  <i>Uh-oh, not good</i>.  But James didn't care there and then- maybe he would have to face Shadow's teasing after this, but now, he was enjoying every bit of the hug.</span></div></div>",

He quietly uttered, \"Follow me.\" and took off swiftly.  James tried to keep up with great difficulty.  His knees were scraped badly and his wings were tired and sore. It seemed like great weights were tied to them and he was gradually being dragged down by it. Moreover, his ears were hurting from the blast of wind screaming into them as he soared in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, they finally slowed down and landed in front of a row of grand houses that looked so majestic. It was as though they were taken out of a fairy tale.  From afar, they looked like hundreds of rooms connected together.  Only when they drew near, did they appreciate the true splendor of the place.  It was actually a very large house, with smaller ones annexed to it. The brilliant colors painted on the walls of every individual building were resplendent, dazzling sunlight was bouncing of the pristine glass planes of windows. The place looked magnificent and well maintained. By now, James was exhausted.  His legs were like jellyO, he could barely stand.  He was aching badly and needed a rest.  Karie smiled kindly.  \"Why don't you have a good rest and sleep?  You do look tired.\"  She gestured towards the 'House'.  That is the humongous one in the middle that stood out among the rest. He hoped somewhere in there, a comfortable bed awaits although in his state right now, he could fall asleep anywhere. Yes, even standing where he was.  With a faint okay, he dragged himself towards the 'House'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were walking towards the house, Mrryh told James, \" This is the Living Quarters, also known as Slaba.  It is practically lots of dormitories connected together.  Shadow will show you the way.\"  'Oh-no, not that stupid, show-off misterian again' James thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Shadow, show him the way to his dormitory.\" Mrryh said to him.  \"James, follow him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stepped into the \"House\", Shadow instructed James, \"Follow me closely.  Many misterians had been lost in this place before.\" \"I'm not surprised,\" James muttered.  Shadow did not seem to notice him talking.  After a lot of twists, turns and endless flightless of stairs, they finally reached his dormitory.  They stood in front of a cherry wood door.  On the surface of the door, there was intricate carvings of creatures which James have never seen before. There were also strange characters engraved right above door frame. \"Here. This is your dormitory.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened the door, walked to his bed and sat down.  It was extremely comfortable.  Without even realising, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

Not because he was uncomfortable, but because someone dumped a bucket of water-not just water it was a bucket of icy water.  \"What the bloody-\" James sputtered.  \"James!  GET UP!\" Shadow yelled.  \"Dude!  Was that necessary?\"James sputtered. \"No,\" Shadow admitted.  \"But I did everything I could to wake you up.\"  James felt like strangling Shadow and stuffing the bucket of water that he just poured on him down his irritating throat except that he was cold, shivering and very wet.  He promised himself that he would get revenge on that.  Shadow handed him a towel and some fresh clothes, and said \"Today is the day of the tests.  Follow me.\" James nodded his head nervously.  He wasn't trained or anything yet.  And he knew that he would most probably fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames followed Shadow out of the room.  When he reached out of Slaba, he saw Karie and Mrryh waiting for him.  Karie said \"Today is the day of the-\" \"Test.   Yes, I have heard that before.\" James finished.  Karie nodded her head.  \"Are you ready?\" James nodded his head.  \"Good.  Let's go.\"  With that, she flew away.  James followed her swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed down.  James marveled at awe at how majestic the place looked like.  It was gigantic and James could tell that it was used for battling.  Mighty pillars surrounded the arena and he hoped that it was used to stop pandemonium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were then lead to the arena.  Large crowds of misterians gathered around the arena.  James then realised that he wasn't the only ones who was peeing in his pants.  Other people had came to battle, and James could tell that they were much more frightened than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarie told him \"We are one of the first.  We must not fail.\" James gulped and asked \"Wha-What h-happens to us we fail?\" \"This isn't a pass or fail test.  It is whether you pass or die.\"</span></div></div>",

One second ago, Max was attempting to tackle his Mentor, Gorian, and the next, he had raced all the way here and switched to taking down James instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was one <i>crazy</i> little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OFF ME!\" James recited the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy,\" Max sang cheerfully.  \"I got <i>Speedo</i> as my Teammate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was flattered that Max was referring to him as <i>Speedo</i>, but that didn't stop him from flinging Max to the ground with a thud.  His wrestling skills had improved a great deal, really.  Must be because Max had been constantly training him unconsciously while pouncing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won again,\" Max acknowledged as a matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head modestly.  \"You're good Max, but just a bit small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt these words, Max suddenly went all solemn like a judge handing out a death sentence.  It was very comical - for the serious look really didn't suit Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can still beat the Demons?\" Max asked earnestly.  He truly wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded vigorously.  \"I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, but do you think <i>I'll</i> get <i>chosen</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was confused at this.  Why did Max want so badly to win?  Definitely to go the Earth - just like him.  But did Max have a family he loved like mad?  Perhaps.  If that was the case, James felt inclined to help him for some unknown reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will,\" James declared firmly.  \"I will make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it?\" Max questioned.  And James realized that he'd made an unbreakable promise unknowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames patted Max's head.  \"Yeah, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax demeanor changed <i>entirely</i>.  He completely switched from prim and proper judge-like Max to Max!  James preferred the true Max personality of Max.  The serious Max just seemed to contradict all laws of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid did a triple punch in the air.  \"YEAH!  Awesome!  Cos you know, I was wondering how my sis is doing down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Max agreed with a sigh.  \"You know, I usually bring her around the city to search for scraps of food - but I ain't around.  So I wonder if she's hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames hadn't the heart to tell Max that there was no way that any human being could survive without food for... more than two weeks.  So he had a sister he wanted to visit...  And wait, what did he mean to 'search for scraps of food'?  Were they... scavengers?  One of those homeless children?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pitied Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax was staring thoughtfully at James.  \"You know,\"  he finally spoke.  \"Even if I get down to Earth, I wonder where to find her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a place you often frequent with her last time?\" James prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax nodded sadly.  \"But it's too cold to visit during Winter.  She won't be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames bit his lip.  He wanted to reassure Max that all would be fine, but nothing seemed to be fine at this moment.  Besides, lying to kids was a no-no.  But he felt he had to, for this kid's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna win the Tests,\" James proclaimed surely.  \"And I'll travel down to Earth with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Max's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed at his surprise.  \"Yep,\" he promised.  \"We're gonna search every city aisle for your sister.  And I swear we'll find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" Max blurted.  \"Then how about your family...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll visit them afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had to be insane to promise all this - especially to some kid.  Honestly, he was even postponing his visit to his family by doing so!  To believe he did!  After all, the only reason why he endured all that training and decided to fight some flying Demons - was to earn a trip to Earth to see his family!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, he'd forgoed his chance like it was nobody's business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, though sounding cliche, James did feel happy.  Just a teeny weeny bit.  But enough.</span></div></div>",

They would have beat you within a speck of your life.\u201d James is taken aback by that and rubs his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee\u2026 thanks for telling.\u201d He says halfheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, there is plenty of discrimination here. Be careful\u2026 Even the guards can get lax at Earthborn care\u2026\u201d Soon the two Misterians wander the halls and enter upon a lavish bedroom with a great bed. The walls were a hearty pinkish gold and were 4 meters high. A glass looking wall that seemingly overlooked another plaza with a pool. A full walk-in closet and bathroom were enclosed in their own respective walls. \u201cThis is my room,\u201d Myrrh says. \u201cFor now, you\u2019ll rest. It\u2026 must have been hard to wake up and be a Misterian and\u2026 be thrown around like that. I\u2019ll leave you be and let you compose yourself. I\u2019ll be back soon then we can start your lessons on how to fly. If there is anything you need, I will be just outside in the living space.\u201d James nods and Myrrh leaves. James sighs as the doors close. He walks over to the bed and sits down and rubs his face. Now that he had time to think it truly was alarming just how much had changed in such a short time. One minute he was alive and next, he was part of a mythical race of beings that could fly! He would have to face some test to just be able to give his family some closure. James lays back and sighs. This was going to be a challenge. Certainly. He closes his eyes and falls asleep</span></div></div>",

He just had a dream where he was talking with his girlfriend, but his body felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs and rubs his face but feels something is off\u2026 James gets up and walks to the bathroom and finds a tub and shower. He shrugs and decides to wash himself up. He turns on the strange shower and gets the water running. As soon as he steps in he feels his body relax as if the water was melting away all his worries. He figures its just another perk of a Misterian lifestyle. A little while after he steps out and finds a towel to dry himself. As he does he thinks of his girlfriend and sighs. He really missed her and his family. All of it was taken in less than an instant in something he figured would be a good idea. Soon James wipes his face and looks in the mirror. \u2026 oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAAAAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh hears James yell then rushes into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames?! Are you okay? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d She sees the steam from the restroom and enters to find a half-naked James\u2026 with a female face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m a girl! I-I thought I was a guy a second ago! I thought you said I was fine.\u201d Myrrh gets a bit worried as well but she sees James\u2019 face snap back into his original shape. She lifts her head in acknowledgment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, you\u2019re fine. It\u2019s one of the side effects of the ritual. Look back in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Confused, James looks back and sees his face. He gasps and strokes his face, \u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d He laughs and smiles, turning back to Myrrh who is now blushing. He looks down and realizes he\u2019s half-naked from the waist up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll let you\u2026 finish cleaning yourself. I can explain it later.\u201d Myrrh backs out of the room and closes the door behind her. James blushes and sighs looking down at his body, his skin red and warm from embarrassment. Soon he gets his clothes and puts them on. He goes to the door and opens it to see Myrrh looking into the mansion\u2019s hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh \u2026 hey, sorry about that. F-figured I\u2019d take a shower and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine. You\u2019ve been through a lot. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t expect you to be a shifter.\u201d Myrrh cuts him off and enters her room, lightly pushing past James. \u201cCome inside and close the door. It\u2019s easier with fewer distractions.\u201d James is confused but nods, closing the door and following Myrrh to the center of the room. She sits on her bed and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a shifting ability, most Misterians have it, fewer find a good use for it other than causing mischief.\u201d She grumbles slightly but composes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to the disguises we use on our quests and tests on earth. Allow me to demonstrate.\u201d Myrrh closes her eyes then James sees her body changing before him. Myrrh\u2019s pale composure turns a light bronze with pale beauty marks around her eyes and on her left shoulder, their shapes spotty and organic. Her hair lightens into a deep shade of blonde, more akin to gold. She wears a long red wavy dress \u201cThis was one of my disguises. When those\u2026 things cornered me I reverted to my natural form.\u201d Myrrh puts a hand on her hip and plays with her hair which was done up in a short ponytail, which showed off her unique ball earrings. \u201c Misterians can only change their appearance of things on Earth and in preparation for tests and quests, but as I said a most can change their appearance here on a whim. It can lead to some issues if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d Myrrh crosses her legs and sighs \u201cWell since we\u2019re here we might as well test it out. Shapeshifting requires concentration. You have to be thinking of a certain\u2026 thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA certain thi- wait wait wait, you want me to change my face?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I want you to change your body,\u201d Myrrh says sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy body?! But I just got it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body is like \u2026 like your clay. You can change it however you want. You will always revert into the form you truly desire\u201d James is stunned but looks over himself. He starts thinking, attempting to concentrate on a form he wants to try. The image in his mind came to him. Pale complexion with short strawberry auburn hair. He focused harder and harder until the image became clear in his mind and felt more comfortable. \u201cYes.. exactly like that.\u201d James could feel his body changing, his chest expanding, his sides shrinking, and his hips widening. James slowly opens his eyes and looks down and finds himself in the body he imagined. He smiled and went back into the bathroom and saw that he looked exactly the same as the image in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome? I know not that exclamation. If you mean it is awe-inspiring I suppose it would be for an Earthborn\u2026\u201d James looks to Myrrh and rolls his eyes. He looks at her and feels a tingle in his body. While the rest of his body had changed, it certainly didn\u2019t change what was in his pants. James blushes and looks back to the mirror, he certainly did admire Myrrh\u2019s new body\u2026 a lot. He then remembers Myrrh\u2019s earrings. He wondered if they could be added to his new body too. He tries again not closing his eyes this time, wanting to see the earrings come about. Indeed as the image comes to his head he sees the earrings form! Medium-sized hooped earrings grow from nothing and hook onto his ears. James blushes but smiles at his new body and creation, enjoying his new feminine features. He concentrates and focuses on his face again, making his chin longer and more narrow and his jaw more smooth and soft while making his eyelashes longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, you\u2019re already getting the hang of it~\u201d Myrrh teases. \u201cYou can change everything about yourself as a shifter. Your clothes for example.\u201d James looks at Myrrh and sees that her dress sinks into her body then changes into an all-white two-piece swimsuit that supports her now large chest. James blushes more and leans into the sink to hide his arousal. \u201cNow you try~\u201d James looks back at Myrrh and then back to the mirror. James shrugs and thinks of one of mimicking Myrrh. As he concentrates he sees his shirt and jeans merging into his frame then sees a black one-piece swimsuit emerging from within. He laughs and smiles as he stands in his new swimsuit-clad body. Myrrh smirks and chuckles and stands up and reverts her form. \u201cWell now that that\u2019s sorted, we can discuss other business, head out to the living space and we can discuss how you will do your test. James\u2019 blush disappears as he remembers what he\u2019s supposed to be doing. He nods and he feels his form snap back into his Misterian form. He groans as the feeling felt like his entire body was smacked by a rubber band. Myrrh sees this and sighs. \u201cOh yes, be careful changing back too quickly, you could hurt yourself if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, thanks for warning me.\u201d Myrrh rolls her eyes and blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence. I will wait for you outside.\u201d With that Myrrh leaves and closes the door behind her. James sighs and looks back in the mirror. His family and friends\u2026 he had to think about his family and friends. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh, how he wanted to see her again\u2026 Wait a second. He looks himself over and starts thinking. He closes his eyes and tries to think of the best mental picture he can of his girlfriend. Her long purple hair, her angular chin, her soft cheeks. James can feel his face changing to match his girlfriend\u2019s physique. He remembers how big her chest looked in her violet bikini. He blushes and feels his chest and crotch growing. James realizes how awkward it is to have a bone while wearing panties so he decides to test something, still turned on by the thought of what he was doing. He shifts his penis into a simple vagina, the feeling tingling in his groin. He can feel his midriff shrinking and hips widening more than before. He feels himself growing slightly taller and her favorite star earrings appearing on his person. He opens his eyes and blushes brightly. James\u2019 girlfriend, as close as he could get to her anyway. James smiles and gently plays with the earrings, enjoying how they looked on her, or rather on him. He chuckles and smirks, toying with them lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice~\u201d Suddenly he yelps, hearing her voice. \u201cIs.. that\u2026 her voice? I\u2019m\u2026 using her voice?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short jaunt through the city later the pair arrived at a curious looking house. It was the middle of the day, yet all the curtains were still closed. Unfazed by this, Myrrh simply walked in. James wondered if Misterians had a use for locks and keys. They might proclaim to be all morally superior to humans, but this still just seemed rude to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy! You home?\" She yelled, and from a distant room a response came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myrrh, it's been so long. I'm in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a spring in her step the princess walked towards the voice. James followed her, unaware of what he was about to wander into. The large, circular room was outfitted into a lavish art studio. Easels with paintings in various states of completion stood next to the wall and in the center, sat atop a pile of pillows, was the artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly popped his eyes out of his skull when he saw her. Myrrh had clearly failed to mention that this artist was no Misterian like herself. She was a medusa. Her legs were replaced with scaly, serpentine coils and her hair was snakes, writhing and hissing at the intruder. He remembered little about ancient mythology, but he knew that meeting her gaze would spell his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, meet Catheryn. She knows more about shapeshifting than anyone I've met. Cathy, this is James, he's an Earth-born and my friend and we need your help preparing him for his Test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medusa reached out a hand. \"Jamesss... good to meet you. Any of Myrrh's friends are welcome here. Don't be afraid, my gaze is harmlesss to Misterians. Even Earth-born like you ssshould not fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitantly shook hands with the monster, shuddering a little as her snake-hair stared him down. He wasn't a fan of snakes at the best of times, and this creature really didn't ease him into accepting them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just us Misterians up here. Tons of creatures you humans believe are mere myth live with us. And Catheryn is one of the greatest shapeshifters among them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medusa smiled at her friend, but she could see the human was still very clearly unnerved by her. She took a deep breath and began to reshape herself before him. Both to put him at ease and to demonstrate what she could do. Her long, serpentine tail began to shrink, the scales shifting to a blueish hue. The rough surface of her coils turned smooth, closer to a fish than a snake. James' jaw fell open when the twisting serpents fell down as locks of red hair, draped along a pair of shapely shoulders. A revealing bra covered a large set of breasts. When she was done, Catheryn had turned into a mermaid, beckoning him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... now you're not the only fish out of water.\" She joked, putting a smile on James' face. \"Once you realize how few limits there are on shape-shifting you'll be able to create pure art with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" The man replied, awestruck by the display. Not just the act of transformation, but also the beautiful woman she had turned into. His enamored gaze had not gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to be a medusa to leave men rock-hard.\" She said with a laugh, prompting a chuckle from Myrrh as well. James was too distracted to pay attention, staring lovingly at the mermaid. \"Now, shall we work on your training, or did you have something else in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a few errands I need to run first.\" Myrrh piped up. \"How about you two get started and I'll meet up with you in a few hours.\"</span></div></div>",

A chorus of wailing tears filled the room as the two sisters shared a moment of mourning and loss....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyra was still shaken by that had just happened. She had experienced some type of psychic link with Myrrh, allowing her experience the fear of being attacked by three possessed men, seeing a man trying to help her, only to be mortally wounded by a gun shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand now, Tyra?\" asked Myrrh, softly. \"It's best to allow your family and friends to believe that James Walker is dead, at least for now. They will grieve your passing but deep down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...deep down, they'll know I'm still alive.\" said James. \"They just won't know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"You will eventually be able to tell your family the truth, when you learn to control your magic.\" she said. \"This is so you will be able to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ensure they keep the truth hidden from the rest of the world.\" you finished. \"I understand now, but... what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled. \"It's time to see your new home.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she spread her wings then, with her fingers, counted down from three. Not knowing what to expect, Tyra spread her own wings then gave a surprised scream as the floor beneath her vanished and they both fell, the floor reappearing above them. \"You're crazy!\" you screamed. \"We'll be splattered all over the ground!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh laughed, her wings turning a shade of white and yellow. \"Use your wings, sis.\" she said. \"Come on, give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra flapped her arms, desperate, causing Myrrh to laugh. Unknown to Tyra, her wings were turning a shade of indigo, as she had seen Myrrh's wings change when 'James' first met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never had wings before!\" protested Tyra, crying. \"Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh, realizing that Tyra was having trouble, quickly dove close enough to touch Tyra's head, giving her the knowledge and she immediately slowed her decent and flew back up with Myrrh following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have died... again!\" said Tyra, annoyed, not knowing her wings were turning a color of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh blushed. \"Sorry... sis.\" she said, her wings changing a shade of pink. \"I would have caught you if you had failed, this is how we teach our children to fly, much like birds teach their young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaffled by the color changes, Tyra calmed down slightly. \"I guess that makes sense.\" she said. \"What's with the color changes, do they reflect your... err... our mood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled, her wings returning to a white color. \"Yes, that's exactly what they do.\" she said. \"Good deduction, Tyra. White is happiness, black is anger, Indigo is fear, pink is embarrassment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it.\" said Tyra, floating above the ground. she turned and let out a low gasp as she saw where she had come, a large piece of land, floating above the clouds! \"Woah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fossli-hotel.com/Fossli.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fossli-hotel.com/Fossli.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That small building there, that's were we were?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"That is the hospital, separate from the mainland.\" she said. \"Come, fly higher with me and see it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager, Tyra flew higher and gazed in wonder as she set eyes upon the main continent before her. It looked like an islands in the ocean yet, they were thousands of feet above the Earth. \"This is unreal.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled. \"Tyra, my sister...\" she said, \"Welcome to Skyaira, your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://arjanshahani.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/aerial_view_of_moorea_island__french_polynesia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://arjanshahani.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tyra was completely blown away by what she has seen thus far, she heard what Myrrh called her and threw her a confused look. Catching on, Myrrh smiled. \"My mom used a piece of her essence, or life force, to rebuild you, remember?\" she asked. \"That makes you her daughter, my sister. If I had donated a piece of my essence, you would have likely become much younger, and my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all a bit confusing.\" said Tyra, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"As I said, its complicated.\" she replied. \"Basically, you were magically reborn through a different mother, hence you became a different person, a Misterian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra nodded, not wanting to get too deep into everything just yet and allowed Myrrh to continue the tour. She led her new sister further inland until she pointed down. \"That's the common areas.\" she said. \"Its where we shop, trade, mingle, work, and so on. It's still early so, no one is out yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2456/3684594548_c5a408a361.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2456/3684...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are there no roofs?\" asked Tyra, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we can all simply 'fly in'... of course.\" replied Myrrh with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra giggled back, thought nervously, her wings turning slightly pink. \"Um... yeah, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to fly inland, Tyra noticed that there was a lot of trees with little signs of 'civilization'. Again, picking up her thoughts, Myrrh giggled. \"We are a telepathic race, Tyra.\" she explained. \"We don't pry into other's minds but we can hear each other's questions and concerns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't I see any major city down there?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Misterians like to share our world with nature.\" replied Myrrh. \"We don't fight it as humans do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3497/3311058496_637be28754_o.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3497/3311...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Myrrh took my hand and gestured me to stop and land on a wide but even path before pointing ahead. \"That is the main palace.\" she said. \"It may look ancient on the outside but it is quite modern and comfortable within.\" she smiled. \"We keep it looking that way to honor our ancestors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-cambodia-ancora.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bible.ca/tracks/tracks-cambod...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's incredible!\" said Tyra, her eyes wide with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's home.\" said Myrrh. \"Our mother is queen Minerva, the ruler of Skyaira. Would you like to meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tyra say?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which means, yes, you still need to learn how to fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra sighed then turned to see a floating island in the distance. \"What is that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2413/1674737265_ecbb38a6f3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2413/1674...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh looked and giggled. \"Oh, that, its the smallest island of Skyaira.\" she said. \"no one really knows what to do with it yet so, right now, its a park.\" she gestured me to follow. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra followed Myrrh into the long open entrance of the palace and shivered as she saw a number of lifelike statues standing on the sides of the hall. On one side were women in strange armor, their wings folded down with a almost gray color to them while, on the other side, were men in similar armor At least she thought they were men as they had shorter  hair yet they had the same bus as the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the Valkyrie and Archangels.\" whispered Myrrh. \"They are not permitted to move or speak unless they are relieved by another guard or they must act to protect the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra nodded, understanding then continued to follow her sister into the palace. The interior was far more modern looking with smooth stone walls that, to her surprise, changed to show an image of her saving Myrrh. Confused by this, she turned to her sister who blushed. \"the walls here react to each visitor, showing their personality and past deeds so the guards further in can see their true intentions.\" she explained. \"The walls here portrayed you as a human hero.\" she pointed at the walls as they changed to a scene with Tyra and Myrrh holding hands. \"Now, it shows you are one of the royal family, which is why you are not being questioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing.\" breathed Tyra. \"I could get to like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled. \"There is a lot for you to learn, my little sister.\" she said. \"I'll show you it all.. after my punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punishment?\" asked Tyra, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"I went to the surface to gather a rare herb that does not grow here in Skyaira.\" she said. \"That's when I was approached by the possessed men.\" she sighed. \"You call this rare herb marijuana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra struggled not to giggle as she knew from her previous life that marijuana had healing properties, when used in small amounts but she never suspected it would be used by Misterians.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These were made of stone and decorated with multi colored stones that seemed to randomly change color. As Tyra and Myrrh approached, they saw the image of a frightened little Misterian girl standing next to a nervous Misterian teenager. \"What!?\" asked Tyra, surprised by what she saw. \"Who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us.\" blushing, Myrrh replied. \"The doors show a reflection of how the person feels as they approach the chambers of our queen, our mother, Minerva.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little disturbing.\" unnerved, Tyra said. she made a face, seeing the reflection change from a teenager to a small, annoyed girl. \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA womanly giggle was heard and the doors opened with a low rumble to reveal a tall slender woman who was a near mirror image of Myrrh and Tyra. She wore an elegant crown on her head and a long flowing dress with a long royal looking robe over it, she was quite beautiful. \"Welcome, my daughters.\" she said with a rueful smile. \"Please, enter so we may speak in private surroundings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded, though she seemed to feel like the child in the image. Tyra felt like an annoyed child, being talked to like one by her new mother. Upon entering Minerva's chambers, she waved her hand, causing the doors to close, shutting out the sounds from the hall and beyond. Now in the privacy of the silent room, Minerva first addressed Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human who is possessed by a demon becomes twice as strong.\" explaining, she said. \"You would have defeated three of them with only your strength and skills if the one had not possessed a hand gun.\" she then smiled. \"That was an impressive sight to behold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-you saw that?\" asked Tyra, feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. \"You see, although I trust Myrrh, she is my only daughter.\" she told Tyra. \"I was about to intervene when you jumped in from nowhere and took on the possessed men alone. \"You seemed to have been winning until...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" said Tyra, shedding a tear. \"I got shot and woke up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. \"We were in your debt for saving my daughter's life, saving your life, making you my second daughter, was all I could to to repay that debt.\" sadly, she said. \"Believe me when I tell you that Myrrh got the lecture of a lifetime while you slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now... mom?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. \"No, Myrrh must repay her debt to you by helping you cope with and adjust to your new life as princess Tyra of Skyaira.\" she replied. \"Myrrh is older so she is next in line for the throne, if she fails to prove herself worthy, the crown will be passed onto you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Myrrh and Tyra winced. <i>\"Great.\"</i> they both thought, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have years to worry about that though.\" motioning to some love seat type chairs. \"I want to hear about your former life, Tyra. What your family is like, who your friends were, and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Tyra, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Minerva smiled. \"All that you were is also in who you are now.\" she explained. \"Your past experiences as a human will only enhance your new life here. James is not dead, he just... changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tyra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This chance meeting changed your life as an act of heroism on your part brought you out of one life and into ours, living among Misterians, what you would call a race of angels.\" said Myrrh. \"Now, in a new form, you will adapt to this new life, while freely embracing the freedom of flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra smiled sadly, knowing Myrrh was trying to help. \"I have two younger siblings, Nicole and Trevor.\" she said, trying not to cry. \"Nicole has the same dream of flight as I do, forming a strong bond between us. Trevor is more down to Earth, so to speak, but he too likes watching the skies.\" she giggled. \"I have an older sister, Ellen. She's a bit protective of me, though I'm the one usually standing up for her. My mom and dad run the Robotics Corporation, they build robots used for deep sea exploration, fire fighting, and other places too dangerous for humans to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting.\" said Minerva. \"Then you have a knowledge of machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know more than the average Joe.\" said Tyra, blushing slightly. \"Only, I'm not what you would call an expert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva nodded. \"Any close friends?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two best friends.\" replied Tyra, nodding. \"Nate and Erin Wilson. I think Erin had a bit of a crush on me.\" your voice sudden;y became lower as her tone changed. \"I guess she won't have the chance to confess now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva then gave her a warm hug to help. \"You are not the first to endure this transition.\" she said, gently. \"It is always hard to let go of one life and start another, it will take time and the pain will not go away but it will get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra then hugged Minerva back gently as she wrapped her wings around her new daughter. \"It's all right, Tyra.\" she whispered. \"You may be able to begin looking towards moving on sooner rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" said Tyra as she let go from Minerva, feeling a bit better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. \"This is a lot to take in.\" she said. She then turned to a chiming noise deeper within her chambers. \"It was a pleasure to talk to you, Tyra. Please allow Myrrh to show you the wonders of our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she escorted us to the door and motioned the doors to open. As Minerva's chamber doors closed behind us, Tyra turned to Myrrh, confused. \"What was that all about?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled. \"She is the queen, sis.\" she replied. \"She has other duties besides talking to her daughters.\" she paused, thinking then asked, \"Where would you like to go first?

James didn't see a young 21-year old man in the mirror. Instead, what he saw was a petite young girl who looked around 10 years old. His/her hair was dark like Myrrh's, looking almost like a dark violet or something close to that. It was also now down to just past her shoulder blades in straight long locks. Her build was small and delicate with fair skin. Her face was youthful and cute for her age, if not a bit similar to Myrrh herself. She also saw that she was wearing an orange skirt with similar colored panties (or whatever they're called) underneath. On her back, pure white wings pertruded from her body, shimmering in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one fact stood out to her: She was topless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" yelled James as she crossed her arms in front of her to try and cover her half-naked body. She must not be experiencing puberty yet as she was completely flat with no signs of adulthood on the horizon so to speak. Surprisingly to her, Myrrh softly giggled and came over to James, gently uncrossing her arms and exposing her chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Tyra. It's fine\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tyra?\" asked James with confusion. Myrrh looked James straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new name that I came up with. You're not human anymore and you're a girl now. You needed a new name\" explained Myrrh. \"Tyra\" nodded in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why Tyra?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means \"Thor's daughter\". Thor was the god of thunder and protector of innocent women, just like you did for me\" explained Myrrh, a thankful smile on her face. Seeing her made Tyra smile as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the randomness issue is why I'm 10 years old and a girl now?\" asked Tyra. A nod from Myrrh answered her question. Then, she noticed how different their wings were. Tyra's were solid and bird-like, unlike the energy wings Myrrh possessed. However, Myrrh must have red her mind considering what she said next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wondering why your wings are different?\" she asked, getting a surprised look from Tyra. \"We are telepathic, so I can read your mind. Relax though, I won't do it often\" she further explained, seeing the worried look on Tyra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no privacy?\" asked Tyra with a smirk. This brought forth a little giggling from both girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Anyway, the reason why your wings are different is because you're a child. Misterians possess bird-like wings at birth and keep them through their teenage years. For males, theirs continue to become more muscular as they age. For girls, they start to glow unpon reaching puberty, which you haven't reached yet. Once you reach 17 years old, we have a Coming-of-Age ceremony where a females' wings beome energy from their bodies\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite a development\" Tyra said simply, getting a nod from Myrhh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm sure you don't want to be topless any longer so let's get you properly fitted so we can meet mother\" said Myrrh, a little worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's mother?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh looked away from Tyra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother and your grandmother: Queen Minerva\" </span></div></div>",

Myrrh looked at Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when mother saved your life, it reshaped you into a member of our family. Basically, you became my daughter\" explained Myrrh. This confused Tyra even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter?!! How can that be?! You're not any older than I originally was!\" Tyra responded in slight frustration. To her surprise, Myrrh started giggling. \"What's so funny?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old do you think I am?\" asked Myrrh with a smile, as if this was a game. Tyra almost thought it was a trick question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I imagine around 20 years or so, a little younger than I was before\" she answered. However, this got Myrrh giggling even more. \"Ok, what's the joke?!\" yelled Tyra, angry at her 'mother' for teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the human eye, I may look around 20 years old. I'm actually 485 years old\" said Myrrh. To say Tyra was shocked would be the understatement of the century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! How can that be?\" asked Tyra, begging for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We Misterians live between 2500 and 3000 years. For a while, we age normally like humans. However, once we reach young adulthood, we stop showing almost all signs of visable aging for a long time. We start showing a little more age once we hit 1000 years\" explained Myrrh. Tyra slowly nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when I reach my 20's, I'll stop aging as well?\" she asked. Myrrh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes young lady. Enjoy it for the next millenium\" said Myrrh with another giggle. This actually got Tyra laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there a 'daddy' too?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I do have a mate yet\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misterians don't marry like humans do. We mate for life, similar to animals in your world. We have a mating season which I will explain to you later. That's the only time when we can mate or become pregnant\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're 485 years old but don't have a mate?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm ready to be in a commited relationship now. I'm happy right now and I haven't met the 'one' for me yet. I'm not even 500 yet so I'm not in a rush. You may find yourself in that situation sometime. You have all the time in the world to mate. Just enjoy life as it comes. That's how Misterians think\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One step at a time huh? I like how that sounds\" said Tyra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, case and point, I'll have to take care of you know. I know it will be hard but, like it or not, I'm your mother from now on. So, you better get used to it\" said Myrrh, trying to act like a mother would. Too bad the look on her face gave away from the fact that she was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra however was unsure. It was too much in too little time. Time would be needed to adjust.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, enough about that. I'd say it's time to get you into proper wardobe. You're certainly not going to see mom topless\" said Myrrh. Tyra took one look and remembered that all she was wearing was an orange skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, why am I wearing only a skirt?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sleepwear for you\" said Myrrh. Seeing the confused look on Tyra's face, she continued. \"When we sleep, we wear only skirts for freedom of the legs. We both wear the same underwear underneath of course. Don't worry though, as only mates and families can see each other topless\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You use the word \"same underwear\" pretty broadly\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Both males and females wear the same underwear\" explained Myrrh. Tyra was shocked yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how is that physcially possible?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh knew where Tyra was coming from and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense, both females and males posess a vagina as you call them. However, men keep their manhoods in them. They only come out when they are sexually aroused. You know what I'm talking about so that's why I tell you this\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the lines between male and female seem a little more blurred here\" said Tyra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. In our society, men and woman are all balanced and equal. We have no, as you call it, sexism here. Men do things here that may be considered unnatural to humans\" explained Myrrh. Tyra now knew that there tons of things she had yet to learn in this world. \"Well anyway, I've brought clothes for you that should fit. Let's get the skirt off\" said Myrrh as she helped Tyra remove the skirt, leaving just the panties.Myrrh almost enjoyed herself at seeing Tyra's face invent a new shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we PLEASE get some clothes on me now?\" asked Tyra, a little impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right all right. In our world, both boys and girls your age wear these tops\" she said, gesturing to the top of her pile. It looked like a small green toga dress that would probably act similar to a t-shirt. First off, Myrrh helped her put on a training bra. She explained that it was to help girls get used to it as breasts could be heavy. Boys wear one for the same reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put this one on next\" said Myrrh as she helped Tyra put on the toga top. It hugged nicely around Tyra's torso and didn't interfere with her wings. Myrrh then clasped it around Tyra's left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For girls, it clasps aorund their left shoulder. It's the right shoulder for boys\" explained Myrrh, which got a nod from Tyra. Next, there was what looked like a skort, a pair of shorts combined with a skirt. It was also a little feathered like Myrrh's. It was also dark blue in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are next\" explained Myrrh. She didn't really have to help here as Tyra could figure this part out easily. The shorts part of it felt good for Tyra and the skirt feeling was something to get used too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, there are these\" said Myrrh as she brought out a pair of brown sandals similar to her own. Tyra sat down and watched as Myrrh showed her how to strap the sandals around her feet and calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" said Tyra after Myrrh accidentily pulled too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my bad\" said Myrrh as she loosened up until Tyra was comfortable. She then used the larger velcro strap to wrap around her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, got those done. Let me fix your hair as well. I bet your annoyed with it falling in your face\" said Myrrh, apparently very observent as that was exactly what Tyra believed. Myrrh pulled out a small green-blue hairband and pulled back Tyra's shoulder-length hair, leaving her bangs to fall on her face. She pulled the hair back into a ponytail that started on the top corner of the back of her head..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, it is done. Take a look\" said Myrrh, pointing to the mirror again. When Tyra got there, she couldn't recognize herself. There, standing in the mirror, was a pretty angel girl with her new clothing. The new ponytail made her look even more like a child and her white wings were something to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" was all Tyra could say at her new look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the beginning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know, there's something else I find odd\" said Tyra. She was looking in the mirror and noticed something off with her face. Her eyes were different. Well, one was anyway. She normally had blue eyes. Now, her left eye was green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with my eyes? My left eye is green now\" said Tyra. Myrrh smiled as she figured Tyra would notice eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you noticed. It symbolizes that you were once a human who changed as thanks for the bravery you showed. Those who selflessly sacrifice themselves, such as you, are granted the power to become Misterians. The difference in your eyes shows that you have earned the right to be amongst our race\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Interesting\" said Tyra, surprised at this development. Then, she asked again, \"It's funny. You would think that I'd be hysterical at this transformation and yet I've been rather calm\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another side effect of the magic. It helps to calm the nerves so you can think rationally\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds very helpful. So, where to now?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Sky Castle. It's where the royal family lives. We have to go talk with mother. Oh, she is going to be sooooo mad when she sees me!\" Myrrh almost yelled. Tyra was getting kind of worried about what kind of person Queen Minerva was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go\" said Myrrh as she gently grabbed Tyra's hand and went towards the door. It almost looked like a stone slab and was tan colored. Myrrh touched the door and it slowly vaporized into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\" said Tyra as she witnessed the event. Myrrh smiled as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how doors work. It'll reform after we leave through it. I'll show you how we make sure we keep our privacy later. Not just anyone can open doors, just like in your world\" said Myrrh as she explained to Tyra. It made sense to her so she made no further comment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\" said Myrrh as she escorted Tyra outside of the room where she was resting. Outside led to a small paved sidewalk over a grassy area. A small hill blocked the view. Tyra suddenly became excited. She assumed that over that hill was the Misterian homeland. Without another moment, she let go of Myrrh's hand and ran up the small hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw was beyond her wildest dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://digital-art-gallery.com/oid/0/640x254_223_Cloud_City_2d_fantasy_city_picture_image_digital_art.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://digital-art-gallery.com/oid/0/640...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, this 'hospital' so to speak was on a small isolated island to the west of the mainland. The mainland was glorious beyond natural belief. The Misterian world was a large floating continent with numerous smaller floating islands surrounding it. The mainland seemed to be the equivient of a big city from the human world. It had many houses that were made from stone and covered with straw roofs that looked very sturdy. The meeting area and busier areas od the city looked to be roofless structures to allow Misterians to just fly in. Tyra could make out the busy life there, as if it was nothing different from living in Los Angeles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomes:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://photos.worldisround.com/photos/28/284/263.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://photos.worldisround.com/photos/28...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPublic Area:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cache2.artprintimages.com/p/LRG/30/3063/SICDF00Z/art-print/keren-su-ancient-ruins-of-machu-picchu-andes-mountain-peru.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cache2.artprintimages.com/p/LRG/3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside them was a bugger complex that seemed to house many children. Tyra assumed that it was a school. There was also a coliseum that seemed to house sports events. Tyra seemed to notice that, despite the incan and mayan influences here and there, it was mostly a cover as many things seemed to mostly resemble modern homes from where she used to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of the mainland was a giant temple-like structure that Tyra assumed was the Sky Castle. On the oustide, it looked beyond old. However, Tyra assumed that it looked much more grand on the inside. Aside from the mainland, the other floating islands seemed to mostly just house homes and neighborhoods. They were all of varying size. Beyond the land, clouds surrounded the area, adding a sense of fantasy to the magical world. The sun beamed over the land, not feeling that hot at all to Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky Castle:<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wallcoo.net/human/Cambodia/images/travel_Cambodia_AP46174.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wallcoo.net/human/Cambodia/im...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grand majesty that was the Misterian home almost literally took Tyra's breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Amazing\" said the young girl in awe of what was to be her new home. Myrrh came up to her with a smile on on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Skyaira, my little girl. Our home\"</span></div></div>",

She had a playful side that bordered on immaturity, although she was as kind and compassionate as anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?!\" yelled Myrrh as she gave Tyra a 'gentle push' in the right direction. Unfortunately for Tyra, Myrrh had the 'gentle push' of a drill sargeant. Tyra fell right over the edge of the small floating island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh!\" yelled Tyra as she started falling. The wind tried to catch on her wings, which seemed to slow her down a bit. However, she flipped over and over as her altitude began to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? You want to crash?\" said Myrrh as she caught up to Tyra. Looking at Myrrh, she was positioned like she was laying back in a chair. This nonchalant attitude of hers both scared and infuriated Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!! Shouldn't you, I don't know, teach me the basis?!!\" yelled Tyra out of desperation for her life. She didn't want to die a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in learning on the job\" smirked Myrrh as she looked at her hand. \"You might want to start flapping before you end up like a bug on the windshield of a plane\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Sadist'</i> Tyra thought in anger. Wasn't she supposed to be her mother now? You know, like, protect her and properly show her hwo to do things. Whatever the case, Tyra was scared as she was beginning to fall out of the protective barrier of the floating continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm going to die again'</i> thought the young girl in fear as her white wings turned a bright lavender in color. Not that she noticed as she placed her hands over her eyes. Believing that she was going to die again, she closed her covered eyes as her tears began to fall. Her fall was inevitable.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so it was as she suddenly felt a hand grabbing her left hand. Slowly opening one eye, she saw Myrrh holding her up, just before she got to the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you'll have more time to practice\" said Myrrh, apparently with not much concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time?! Are you ok with making me feel like I was going to die again?!\" yelled Tyra, her wings suddenly brightening to a red color. That was something Myrrh noticed and she felt a little guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I just thought that the experience would help you learn faster. You weren't in any real danger. I wouldn't have let you fall beyond the barrier\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra sighed as she was being uplifted by Myrrh. Myrrh was an interesting character to say the least. Being her daughter would be an adventure in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the distractions over for now, it was time to head to the Sky Castle.</span></div></div>",

You're mostly just helping me glide\" said Tyra. Despite her words, she truely was enjoying this. It paled in comparison to how she would eventually feel when she could really fly but that would be for another day. Anyway, the Sky Castle loomed above them, perched on the top of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's huge!\" said Tyra in amazement. Myrrh smiled at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course it is. Castles are normally huge\" said Myrrh with a hint of sarcasm. Tyra rolled her eyes and allowed Myrrh to hold her hand as she escorted them both into the castle. Inside was quite a sight to Tyra. In some ways, it resembled England beause there were guards stationed there. There were males and females and they weren't moving or talking at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The females are Valkyries and the males are Archangels\" explained Myrrh in a small voice. Tyra nodded to confirm she got the whisper. It was almost creepy walking past the guards as they were barely anything more than statues from the way they acted. After walking past the guards, Tyra marveled at the grand majesty of the castle. Myrrh explained as they went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main hall here is decorated with finely finished colored stone, kind of like stained glass. They say it can show a person's past, hopes, and fears\" explained Myrrh. Tyra gasped at such a relic in this castle. As they continued on, they also saw crystal-shaped lights, or what appeared to be anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those lights react to someone's presence. They go out when that presence leaves\" explained Myrrh again. Tyra nodded in confirmation of the info. Tyra continued to look at the rather modrn looking appearance of the castle. Despite it's older-than-dirt look on the outside, it was birght, shiny, and more modern on the inside. Tyra imagined that it was to pay homage to their ancestors or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we are\" said Myrrh as they came to pair of peach-colored doors. It had a glyph on it that Myrrh slowly touched with her hand. It glowed and the doors opened. Tyra immediately saw Myrrh's wings turn a bright purple when she did. She still didn't know what it meant but she knew that Myrrh was incredibly nervous right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two angels walked inside to the throne room, the doors closing behind them with a loud noise. Tyra looked forward and got her first glimpse of Queen Minerve. As she thought, she looked like an older version of Myrrh. She had long dark hair with an older face than Myrrh. She also had a laurel crown on her head as she was the queen. She wore what seemed to be a white dress with some regal touches here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what caught Tyra's eyes was that Minerva's wings were a bright red, with some spots of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This can't be good'</i> she thought.</span></div></div>",

Tyra felt as if she was seeing into her mind or soul right now. That's the feeling you get around the queen. Tyra noticed that her features seemed to soften a little bit as she glanced at her. However, they seemed to get much angrier again once she looked at Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl looked terrified right now, as she if she expected her own mother to sentence her to death or something. Minerva's wings stayed a bright red as she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I believe you both know why you're here.\" she started, getting a nod from the both of them. She then turned to Myrrh, \"Well Myrrh, your stubborness has always been a problem. Now, it's cost a human the life, family, and friends he had on Earth. How can you justify yourself?\" she said in a calm voice. However, even the guards could sense the hidden anger in her voice. It was clear that Minerva wasn't just mad at Myrrh for her actions: she was furious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry m-mother!!\" stuttered Myrrh, barely keeping her composure at all. \"I-I just t-thought that I-I could handle i-it!\" she continued, trying to defend herself. Minerva's expression did not soften in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <b>thought</b> you could? How many times do I have to tell you that you shouldn't take chances like that?\" said Minerva, emphasizing the 'thought' part. \"You could have simply called for back up if it was too hard. Then perhaps this girl would still have her life\" said Minerva, gesturing to Tyra. Tyra didn't know what to say. This seemed to be between just Minerva and Myrrh for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh was holding her head down in shame. She couldn't even bear to look her mother in the eye, something Minerva noticed and her features hardened more. \"Myrrh, look at me\" she said. It wasn't a request; it was a command. However, Myrrh was still too scared to do it. \"Look at me now!\" said Minerva with more force, the first outburst she had during the whole conversation. Myrrh's head shot up, tears leaking out of her eyes and falling down her face. Tyra couldn't help but feel sorry for her 'mother'. Sure, she got her into this mess but it's not like Myrrh intended for her to get shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMnerva sighed in frustration. \"Honestly Myrrh, when are you going to grow up a little? You're 485 years old now. You should know better. You should be much more mature, especially since you're a princess and my only child. Instead, you insist on being your usual proud and stubborn self\" said Minerva. Myrrh felt another pang of guilt as her mother continued the beat down. \"You're supposed to be able to take the throne of Skyaira in the future once I step down. Yet, no one can take you seriously because of your immaturity. You're a kind and compassionate girl but you allow your more undesirable qualities to be the ones the people see\" Minerva continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh's will was so weak right now. More tears were falling from her face as she struggled to keep herself from breaking out in tears. Minerva was powerful like that. It was one of the many qualities she possessed as queen. Tyra was beginning to think that this was going too far. Like it or not, Myrrh was now her mother. She didn't want to take her mother getting chastised like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you know, don't you think you've gone far enough\" said Tyra, getting the attention of the queen and Myrrh. \"Sure, she got me into this mess but she's my mother now. She's not a bad person and she doesn't deserve to be talked down to like that!\" Tyra almost yelled. Myrrh was stunned silent in both fear and gratitude for Tyra's word. However, Tyra was beginning to think she stepped out of bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry\" said Tyra, hoping that the queen wasn't mad at both of them now. However, to their amazement, Minerva actually gave a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a very forgiving person. First off, I commend you for your selfless bravery for helping my daughter. I can see that, thanks to the essense I used, you are now my granddaughter?\" asked Minerva. Tyra nodded in reply. She then turned to Myrrh again and her features hardened once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Myrrh, as for your punishment, I imagine being forced to take are of your new daughter will satisfy for now. You will raise Tyra here to be a proper Misterian. If this incident ever happenes again or if I find out that you haven't properly taught her as a mother should, your punishment will be even more severe. I can't protect you Myrrh. It's time you finally learned responsibility\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes mother\" said Myrrh, a little more calm but her tears had stopped. Her eyes were still moist though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I hope you will learn something from this. As for Tyra, I believe we should get you into school for tomorrow. You should start learning what we teach here\" she went on to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls nodded at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then you are both dismissed for now. Show the newest member of our royal family to her new room\" commanded Minerva. Myrrh and Tyra both nodded and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Myrrh was still shaken from the harsh words she got from her mother. It surprised Tyra for Minerva to have such power. Before, she thought of Myrrh as a strong-willed person who could stand tall in any situation. With just a few words, Minerva had shattered Myrrh's will and the girl nearly broke down in her prescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok 'mother'. That was kind of harsh of her\" Tyra said, attempting to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I deserved each and every word. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be like this\" said Myrrh, sadness still evident in her voice. With that, Tyra suprised Myrrh by giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll take care of me for now right?\" asked Tyra, truely looking like a child that needed guidance. Myrrh put on a sad smile and hugged the young girl back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'll take care of you the best I can\" said Myrrh, a little happier. It made Tyra happy that Myrrh was cheering up a bit. The two continued down the hallway, with Myrrh making turns here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your room will be next to mine so I'll be able to look after you\" said Myrrh. This sounded reasonable to Tyra so she nodded in reply. Suddenly, they appeared at a stone door, similar to the hospital door. Myrrh let Tyra go ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Just touch the door. Your signature is added to it so it'll react to you\" said Myrrh. Tyra nodded apprehensively and gently touched the door. Instantly, it faded into thin air like before, allowing entry into the room beyond it. Tyra smiled as she was excited to see her new bedroom. The two girls entered the room and Tyra gasped at her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about average-sized, with peach-colored walls through out the room. There were dresser-like cabinets which contained what Tyra imagined to be clothes. Misterians had some variety of clothes but not much. There was a pretty large window, which led to a balcony. That would allow Tyra to get out and fly around whenever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Tyra in amazement at her new room. The, something caught her eye. There was no bed in the room. Instead, she saw a large 'love seat' which had a covering to use for privacy if needed. \"Um, what is that?\" asked Tyra to Myrrh. Myrrh nodded after understanding Tyra's predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ia a bed for young kids and male Misterians\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the bed that I was laying in earlier?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember? You were in a sitting position on that bed, not laying down. Laying down in a bed like humans is only for mature female Misterians. This is because we can turn our energy wings on and off so to speak so we can sleep on our backs. However, you know that young Misterians as well as mature males have solid wings. They can't sleep on their backs because they might injure their wings. So, they sleep in a kneeling position in the bed there and wrap their wings around them to keep warm. We also use a wrap around the wings that is also for warmth\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kneeling position? That doesn't sound comfortable\" said Tyra, making Myrrh smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. When you're tired and ready for bed, you'll feel plenty comfortable\" assured Myrrh. Tyra would just have to wait until tonight to find out if it was true.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tyra and Myrrh walked out of Tyra's new room, her stomach suddenly growled. This drew an embaressing blush to Tyra's cute face. This drawed a giggle from Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone is hungry\" said Myrrh, still giggling. Surprisingly to Tyra, she softly giggled in response after patting her belly with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guess I forgot that I haven't eaten since I got here\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's fix that then\" said Myrrh. With that, she navigated Tyra through the castle walls once again, explaining things along the way when Tyra didn't understand something. Soon enough, they entered a room with a grand table with many seats. They were similar to the one Minerva was sitting on, with a narrow back to help the wings. Near the table was a balcony which allowed the fresh air to come in with no problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you sit down and I'll make something. It's the least I should do as your mother\" said Myrrh as she walked away and through another door to prepare a nice lunch for the two of them. Once she was in the other room and out of sight, Tyra took a random seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, feels nice\" she said as she relaxed. The narrow back chair actually felt comfortable and allowed her wings to be free. She leaned back and closed her eyes as she felt the fresh wind breathe on her. To a Misterian, she figured that this must feel like heaven. It was nice and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until she heard someone crying in apparent fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!! Ahh!!\" yelled the unknown voice. It sounded like a young girls voice, at least to Tyra. She looked back and forth to try and find the source of the voice but couldn't see anyone there. She knew she heard someone but she saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my ears playing tricks on me?\" asked Tyra to herself. Her questions were answered when she suddenly heard a crash into the dining room. She turned towards the balcony, which was where the sound came from and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, laying on the ground and badly hurt, was a young girl. She looked to be around the same age as Tyra. She wore a similar dress top like Tyras, except hers was orange. Her skort was bright yellow and her sandals were of the same color. She appeared to be a few inches shorter than Tyra with very soft skin. Her hair was a beautiful sun blonde color and it was shorter than Tyra's, going down to her neck. However, what really caught Tyra's attention was that she was laying face down of the floor in apparant pain and her wings seemed to be bruised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?!\" Tyra shouted as she ran to the injured girl. The girls face was contorted in pain and tears were falling out of her eyes. The floors of the castle were made of stone and she fell down hard. Tyra felt so sorry for the girl. She ran around the table and gently approached the young girl. She seemed to be having trouble getting up as she wimpered in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" asked Tyra again, this time even softer. \"Here, I'll help you up\" she continued to say as she gently grabbed the young girl and tried to get her into a sitting position. The poor girl continued to lightly sob as she clutched her left arm. Apparently, she landed on it and it showed. It was badly bruised and bleeding slightly. Tyra knew from her human experience that she may have broken her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, that doesn't look good. Don't worry, I'll help you get to a doctor or something and we'll get you healed up\" assured Tyra, smiling as if to comfort the injured girl. She hadn't said anything since she landed and it worried Tyra. However, soon her lips parted slightly, as if she was trying to find words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-...Thank...y-you\" said the girl in the softest voice Tyra had ever heard. Getting a closer look at her, Tyra felt how very soft her skin was. The sunlight seemed to glisten off it. What she also saw was her eyes. They were a deep blue color that almost looked mesmerizing. Tyrs then turned to the girls wings. They were currently white but they were bruised in so many places. To take a closer look, Tyra lightly touched a bruise on the wings, getting a cry of pain from the little girl. It surprised Tyra so much that she immediately backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...d-don't t-touch...my wings. It-t...hurts..too much\" said the girl in her still soft voice. Tyra nodded in understanding and sat down with the girl. She seemed to be so fragile. She was so different from Myrrh. This girl looked like she could break as easily as glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a name?\" asked Tyra. The girl looked straight at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's L-Leala...Please...call me...Lea\" said Lea, still struggling to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lea? That's a good name\" complimented Tyra. To her surprise and delight, Lea gave her a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you....W-What's...your name? she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tyra\" said Tyra simply. Lea's eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tyra? Y-You mean..as in...P-Princess Tyra?! S-So.. the rumors were...\" said Lea, unable to complete her sentence. Tyra tried to comfort the girl as best as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you can call me Tyra. No need for titles\" she assured with a smile. To her delight, it also brought a small smile back to Lea's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tyra? Ok...\" said Lea. Then, Tyra spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you know about me?\" Tyra sked. Lea slowly nodded. Tyra began to figure that the word had spread in the few hours that she was knocked out. Especially that she was now part of the royal family. \"Well, it looks like we're about the same age. How about it Lea? You want to be friends?\" asked Tyra. Lea looked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Friends? W-With...me?\" asked Lea. Tyra smiled to assure Lea. She felt a surge of joy as the first true smile adorned Lea's soft face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I think this is the beginning of a great friendship, one that will help define us both.'</i> thought Tyra. <i>\"Sharing experiences, triumphs and tears, helping each other find our place in this world.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was beautiful.\" said Lea, giggling as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra blushed. She had forgotten Misterians were telepathic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was humiliating\" said Tyra with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't think so. I think it was quite touching\" said Lea, still giggling. Her fear and anxiety seemed to be lessening in Tyra's presense. This pleased Tyra but something still needed to be done about Lea's broken left arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'll help you with your arm\" said Tyra as she walked over to the table and grabbed a small cloth from it. She couldn't heal Lea's arm but she could at least help out. Lea looked confused as to what Tyra was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" she asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just doing to stabilize your arm until you can get it healed\" said Tyra as she started wrapping the cloth around Lea's injured arm. Once it was properly covered, Tyra used the remaining parts of the cloth and wrapped them around Lea's shoulder. She pulled a know around the shoulder, creating a suitable sling for Lea's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, this should work for now. The sling will stabilize you until we get you healed\" said Tyra. Lea looked amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this how humans treat injuries?\" asked Lea. Tyra nodded, assuming that angels probably didn't use slings often because they could could just go to a doctor and get them healed. Then, with the sling done, Tyra took a while to notice how tense Lea still seemed to be. <i>'Maybe I can get her to open up if I help her relax'</i> thought Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Lea, making Tyra remember once again that they were telepathic. Tyra smiled as she needed to keep that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch\" said Tyra as she positioned herself at Lea's back. She got her hands ready and placed them on Lea's shoulders. It was a good thing she still remembered this from her days as James. Slowly but surely, she started trying to message :ea's shoulders. Of course, as messages usually go, it intially hurt for Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What are you doing?\" she asked, a little cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm not trying to hurt you. It'll hurt a little bit but just wiat a second\" assured Tyra. Lea trusted Tyra so she let her continue. After a few more seconds or so, Lea instantly started feeling more relaxed as Tyra worked on her shoulder muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels...nice\" said Lea as she gave a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this technique?\" asked Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called a message. Humans use this to try and relax. I figured that you could use one because you've looked tense since you landed here\" said Tyra as she continued to rub Lea's shoulders, making the girl sigh contently again. After a few minutes, Tyrs then turned to Lea's bruised wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think  can message your wings too. Just give me a sec\" said Tyra as she moved to one of Lea's wings. She placed her hands on it and tryed to rub it in a similar way. Surprisingly, Lea started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop that, it tickles!\" she giggled, making Tyra happy that Lea was happy. She continued working on both of her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, your wings look really damamged. Did you damamge them in the fall?\" asked Tyra. Lea looked a little sad as she hung her head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I injured them long ago. A few months ago, I was trying to fly but couldn't do it very well. I ended up falling through the barrier to the surface\" started Lea. Tyra was shocked to hear that, especially because she nearly avoided falling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Did you injure them then?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was able to make a soft landing on the ground. However, I ended up coming across 2 human men. At first, I didn't pay much attention because I figured that they couldn't see me. You might not know but only those that are pure of heart can see anglels and demons\" explained Lea. Tyra nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I found that that these men could indeed see me. They were drunk and apparently possessed. I tired to get away but they wouldn't let me. They saw me as...\" Lea gulped as she struggled to find her next words,  \"quick entertainment\". Tyra was appaled to hear that, although she knew that it wasn't the human's fault, just like the humans who shot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tried to rape. To do that, they broke me wings first so I couldn't escape. Long story short, my mother, whi is a Valkyrie, was able to save me from them. Howwever, my wings have yet to heal. They tried over and over to completely heal them. However, it has yet to work. I can fly a little but I can't control my flight pattern because of my injuries. It's likely that I won't be able to fly normally until I get my energy wings when I come of age\" explained Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So humans have hurt you too?' said Tyra with a sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't hate the humans do you? You used to be one of them\" said Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't. It's just that you have and I have both been terrible injured by them\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the work of demons. They are not at fault. Everyone seems to think of them as creatures to pity because they are not as 'evolved' as us. Hoewever, I think they are fascinating people. In fact, if possible some time, I wouldn't mind living amongst them for a while\" said Lea, which surprised Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why would an angel want to live down there?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as those men scared me, I saw other things while I wasdown there. There were some scary things but I always saw people that looked so happy. There was one of those playgrounds as you call them where all those children were playing. I wouldn't mind experiencing the life of a human some time\" said Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well maybe someday, I can give you a grand tour of where I used to live\" said Tyra with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You'd do that? You don't have to..\" said Lea. However, Tyra stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can and I will. We're friends right?\" asked Tyra with a smile, getting one from Lea too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Friends\" said Lea. With that, the two fell into momentary silence as Tyra kept working on Lea's wings, making the girl feel more relaxed and happy than she had ever been in recent memory.</span></div></div>",

She seemed surprised at first to see Lea there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Lea. What are you doing here?\" she asked her. Lea didn't really want to answer so she allowed Myrrh to get the whole story from her mind. Tyra watched as Myrrh closed her eyes and watched the incident from her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that was the sound I heard earlier. I thought somebody had just dropped something\" said Myrrh as she put some plates down of the table. She then turned to the young girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lea, so you want to join us for lunch?\" asked Myrrh politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me? Oh no, I don't want to intrude, your highness\" said Lea, trying to be respectful. Myrrh smiled and shook her head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lea, I've told you that you don't need to call me that. 'Myrrh' is just fine. Now come on over here and perhaps I can get your arm healed too\" said Myrrh. The two girls got up and walked over to Myrrh and took a look at the food. Tyra wasn't sure what to think, given that she had never seen Misterian food before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, let's get you better\" said Myrrh as she placed her hands on  Lea's injured left arm. Her hands glowed a light green as it enveloped Lea's arm. Tyra watched in awe as Myrrh repaired Lea's arm. A minute later, the glow vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, the bones should be healed now. You'll be a little stiff for a while though, so be careful\" said Myrrh. Lea smiled and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Myrrh\" said Lea as she unwrapped her arm and tried to move it around. The bones were perfectly healed, although it was stiff as Myrrh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's a good thing I made a little too much this time. We've got enough for me so eat on\" said Myrrh as she took a seat at the table. Tyra and Lea took seats next to each other on the other side of the table. Lea helped herself to what Myrrh brought out but Tyra didn't know what do do. Myrrh looked at her and began to giggle. This kind of annoyed Tyra, her wings turning a little red in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <b>what</b> is so funny?\" said the annoyed angel. Myrrh tried to talk but she kept on giggling like a little schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your face is what. I know you know what kind of things we eat but your expression was priceless\" said Myrrh, continuing to laugh. Lea even giggled slightly through her meal. Anyway, Myrrh finally calmed down and started to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, these are fluff noodles. They're kind of like that Mac &amp; Cheese meal you have in your world. They're grown here in places with much cloud cover because that's what they feed on to grow. The result is a rather watery taste but the sauce mixed in with it is a kind of dairy product we also grow here. Have a taste\" said Myrrh. Luckily, the utensils they used were the same as the humans so Tyra picked up a fork and took a bite of the 'Angel Mac &amp;Cheese' so to speak. Her eyes it up as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This is good!\" said Tyra as she continued to eat more, to the delight of Myrrh and Myrrh. Myrrh went on to explain that the drink was a nector harvested from Nimbus trees which grew in the nearby forest. They were, in a way, similar to cocao tres from the surface, except nimbus fruits grew instead of cocao beans. Those were then used to make the 'milk' they drink here.</span></div></div>",

Those closest didn't have a clue as to wha happened. A missing person's report has been file and the police had been notified. However, so far their efforts had been fruitless but they assured friends and family that it would continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Erin Wilson had often been questioned as they were the last to know of James. They explained how they had just finished up their day and were just heading home. They didn't find out until the morning that James was gone. There was an invesitgation at the scene where it was believed James had been involved in. The 3 men that were found unconscious were questioned but they had no recollection of what happened. They were posessed by demons so naturally the memories didn't stay with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one fact at the so-called \"crime scene\" caught everyone's attention. Some blood was found at the scene. It was currently being tested on, but it was currently believed to be James' blood. Nevertheless, he was still considered \"missing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, James' friends and family were extremely concerned. Nate and Erin wanted to do anything they could to help them find James. Erin had been unable to sleep since the incident and she almost always felt the need to cry whenever James came up. Nate would always comfort his sister, knowing that she had a crush on the boy. He inwardly swore to smack James for making everyone worry once they found him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' family tried to continue on as normally as possible. Michael and Jane, James' parents, kept up hope that their son was still alive and tired to keep their daily life going. However, the same could not be said for James' 19-year old sister, Ellen. She and James had a typical sibling rivalry as kids but they had a peacfeul and loving family relationship over the last few years. The news that her brother was missing and possibly dead pratically killed the young woman on the inside. She barely slept or ate and her parents were becoming increasingly concerned with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Erin had offered whatever help they could. However, they all knew the truth of the matter at hand. Only one thing could cure Ellen's sadness: James returning home safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar things could be said for James' youngest siblings: 8-year old Trevor and 6-year old Nicole. Trevor began trying to act like and say some of the things James would do, in hopes of joy returning to the family. It sometimes worked but everyone knew that it was his way of trying to deal with the loss. Trevor was always one who thought of others. Nicole was also extremely saddened by the loss of her brother and became a bit withdrawn as well. She started avoiding playing with her usual dolls, as James had often offered to play with her when she was sad or alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was anyone's guess as to how this would turn out.</span></div></div>",

Tyra happened to notice that, once Lea left, she had a depressed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine that your first day here was satisfactory?\" asked Myrrh with a hint of a smirk on her face. Tyra gave her 'mother' a small jab in the sides for that but both girls giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so wierd to be giggling like this\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine you'll get used to it\" said Myrrh simply. Tyra nodded at her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had eaten lunch and Lea had left, Myrrh spent most of the day explaining other things to Tyra. For example, she showed her how time was kept in their world. They used the sun and moon to determine time in their world. A parmo was a minute. A mot was an hour. Midday and midnight were called qua-circles. A full day or night was a hav-circle. So, an example was that 7: 15 would been seven mot fifteen in this world. It confused Tyra a bit but she was glad that some things were similar to the human world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, they had dinner together. It was just the two of them this time. The meal was a kind of cooked steak that Myrrh said came from a brave bird. Apparantly, it was a kind of bird that survived at this altitude and had 4 wings. Tyra ended up hoping that she would never come across such a thing, to Myrrh's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm amazed that many things from the human world have an influence here\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes. We have no quarrel with humans and we have no problem learning a thing or two from them if we feel like it\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like the Misterians and humans can work pretty well together\" said Tyra with a smile. Myrrh gave a small smile but then turned away slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad not everyone thinks that way\" she said softly. It confused Tyra as to whom she was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Tyra with a raised eyebrow. Myrrh looked at Tyra and then shook her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it. You'll know in time. Anyway, it's now 8 mot in the evening now. Time for you, young lady, to go to bed\" said Myrrh. Tyra almost gasped at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I really have to listen to you now?\" sighed Tyra, somewhat not enjoying having to be mothered around like a kid again. Myrrh put her hands on her hips and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am your mother now. You'll need some sleep since you're starting school tomorrow\" said Myrrh. Tyra looked surprised again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-School?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, school. It'll be better for you to learn amongst other kids your age. It'll be good to make some friends. If not for Pallas and others keeping me on track, I probably wouldn't have done well\" said Myrrh, a little sheepishly. This caused a smirk to adorn Tyra's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you were a slacker huh?\" asked Tyra, a little cheekily. Myrrh smirked herself and then started tickling Tyra mercilessly. Tyra laughed and laughed while while begging for Myrrh to stop. She did eventually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd watch your mouth if I were you. Now, come on so I can show you how to properly go to sleep here\" said Myrrh as she grabbed Tyra's right hand and they started walking towards Tyra's room. That reminded Tyra of how Myrrh explained how they slept up here, using those love seats as beds. Tyra was still skeptical on how such a thing would be comfortable but she would just have to find out herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they both entered Tyra's room together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'm sure you know how to brush your teeth and such right?\" asked Myrrh. Tyra nodded and went into the bathroom to do just that. Luckily, that was the easy part as she emerged a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now, as I might have told you earlier, we only wear skirts to bed. That means everything else comes off\" said Myrrh. Tyra was a little apprehensive but she did as told.She removed her toga top and removed the training bra from her body, exposing her bare chest to the world, which felt a little cool. She then removed her sandals and skort and Myrrh took out a blue skirt for her which she immediately put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just sit down in the bed in a kneeling position\" instructed Myrrh. Tyra obeyed and sat down on the love seat, her legs being hugged against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, close your wings around yourself\" said Myrrh. Tyra didn't have much experience today in regards to using her wings. It felt so odd with the two extra 'limbs' so to speak on her back. Tyra slowly moved her full wings against herself and wrapped them around her. Surprisingly, she felt a little warm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last touch\" said Myrrh. She grabbed a white wrap from a container in the room and walked over to Tyras. She gently wrapped it around Tyra's wings and body, careful not to damamge anything. It was made so Tyra could simply remove the wrap by extending her wings when she woke up. Once she was done, Tyra felt surprisingly warm....and tired to her amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's so warm. And (yawn) I'm suddenly feeling tired\" said Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say? I told you that it was comfortable. We dont end up with any back problems like humans would do in this situation\" explained Myrrh. Tyra heard her but merely nodded as she was beginning to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.....(yawns)....good night....mother\" said Tyra with a smile as she gently feel asleep. Myrrh felt a bit of pride within her as she smiled at Tyra's words. She leaned forward and gently placed a motherly kiss on Tyra's forehead, sending her a telepathic message as she left the room with the lights dimming as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good night and sweet dreams....my little angel'</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tyra had perhaps one of the most peaceful sleeps she had ever had in her lifetime. In her dreams, she still found herself longing for the human life she lost, even though she knew it was beyond her now. However, her gentle sleep was suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyra. Sweety, it's time to wake up\" said Myrrh in a gentle voice. She lightly shook Tyra's shoulder, waking the little girl up. As Tyra gave a big yawn, her wings instinctively spread out, causing the wrap to simply fall of her body, and stretch out. However, she almost immediately started shivering as a cool wind spread across her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brrr. W-What time is it? The sun doesn't even look up yet\" said Tyra, her arms trying to cover her topless body. Myrrh smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 6 mot 15\" said Myrrh. Tyra gasped as that meant Myrrh had just woken up in the early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you wake me up this early? It's freezing!\" said Tyra as she tried to get herself warmed up. Myrrh kept smiling and helped Tyra to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because today is your first day of school. Don't want you to be late on your first day\" said Myrrh. Tyra looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have school this early?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School runs from 7 mot after the night qua-circle and runs until 1 mot after the day qua-circle. Basically, in human terms, that means from 7 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon. You get a lunch break that lasts for 30 parmo (minutes) at the day qua-circle\" explained Myrrh. Tyra nodded in understanding, although that didn't help how cold she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And how are you not freezing right now?\" she asked, getting another smile from Myrrh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me and I'll explain along the way\" said Myrrh as she grabbed Tyra's little hand. She started escorting her to the the bathroom in Tyra's room. \"All misterians devolop a small resistance to cold weather. In addition, our wings kind of act like solar panels, absorbing heat to keep us warm. However, you have yet to build that resistance. It might take a few days or possibly over a week but soon you'll be able to wake up in the morning without feeling cold at all\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice. So, what now?\" asked Tyra as they were now standing in Tyra's bathroom. Myrrh put down what appeared to be a new set of clothes for Tyra next to a sink and then pointed to an open area that had a shower faucet centered above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to show you how to take a show here. I'm sure you know that you have to strip down\" said Myrrh. Tyra blushed and was a bit hesitent as she started to pull her skirt and underwear down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it;s just us girls here\" said Myrrh with a giggle. Tyra blushed and pulled her clothing off completely. Myrrh took them and set them somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, stand underneath the shower while I get it going and set the temperature\" said Myrrh. Tyra did as instructed and walked into the large flat area, presumbably to make sure everything didn't get wet. When she was wettled, Myrrh turned some levers and, like a normal shower, the water started pouring on Tyra. A little cold at first but it warmed up quickly. As it poured down, Tyra felt her wings becoming heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread your wings out and shake them lightly. That'll get the water out\" said Myrrh. Tyra did as instructed. She was still getting used to moving her wings but it was getting easier. She slowly spread them out and lightly shook them. The water easily came out and they felt lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad that you guys have indoor plumbing\" said Tyra with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes things easier huh?\" said Myrrh with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do I just wash myself normally?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh shook her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's mostly the same as a human shower, with one major difference: cleaning the wings\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh grabbed a small brush and walked over, carefull now to get too wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wings of young boys and girls are very fragile. To clean them, we use a special small brush to lightly groom through them. I'll do it for a while. Eventually, you'll be able to do it yourself\" said Myrrh. Tyra nodded and turned around to allow Myrrh to reach her wings. She gently grabbed one wing and started lightly brushing each feather, careful not to harm her. However, she started to feel it shaking a bit and looked at Tyra, who was giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That tickles!\" said Tyra. Myrrh giggled as well and continued grooming gently. After that, she moved to the other wing, working through Tyra's continued giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised that my wings are so ticklish\" said Tyra, her giggling going down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course. They're just as much flesh and bone as the rest of your body. Now, the rest is just the same as a normal shower. Wash your body and hair and we'll go from there\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra did as instructed and grabbed the bar soap and washed off her body. She moved to her hair after that and found it annoying considering it's longer length now. <i>'How do Ellen and Nicole deal with this?'</i> thought Tyra as she finished up. Myrrh went over to the levers and turned off the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to dry off, just do 'the twist', I believe you humans call it\" said Myrrh. Tyra gave an incredulous look before giggling a bit at Myrrh's instruction. She did as told and shook the water off of her. She got as much as possible before Myrrh grabbed a towel. Tyra was careful to dry herself and avoid her wings. With that done, Tyra changed into similar clothing from the previous day. The only differnce was the colors. Her toga top was yellow, the skort was red, and her sandals were brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing before we go. I need to inspect your eyes\" said Myrrh as she carefully looked at Tyra's blue and green eyes. Tyra was confused as Myrrh inspected her. <i>'What in the world is she doing?'</i> thought Tyra. Apparently, Myrrh heard her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Misterians, a slight or huge change in eye color is a sign of sickness. This is especially important for you, given the heavy shock your body took during the transformation. Your immune system may be weak for a while\" said Myrrh. Tyr nodded in understanding. Myrrh kept looking and smiled as she saw no difference in Tyra's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go get some food before setting you off to school\" said Myrrh as she took Tyra's hand and escorted her out of the bathroom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After catching a good breakfast, Myrrh and Tyra were on their way to the school, walking along the stone roads that lead to an edge of the mainland. Tyra was confused. Where was the school? She couldn't see it anywhere. Myrrh saw her confusion and giggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look up\" said Myrrh, and Tyra looked up, gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.scenicreflections.com/files/sky_island_Wallpaper_4690d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.scenicreflections.com/files/s...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's school?!\" asked Tyra. She almost seemed to have forgotten that she was supposed to be older than she really was. Her childhood curiosity and excitement had been reborn along with her body. She knew this but didn't really have a problem with it after all. It was all good to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's where you will learning everything\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" asked Tyra. Myrrh thought about it but then shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you figure out what we teach. It'll be good for you to learn on your own\" said Myrrh. Tyra gave her a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be getting lazy with my teachings. You know what grandmother will do\" said Tyra with a giggle. Myrrh gave her a hard look that was intended to shut her up but it instead made Tyra laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine whatever. Anyway, let's get you up there. It'll be a good first flying lesson for you\" said Myrrh as she grabbed Tyra's little hand and lifted her into the sky. Tyra was a little worried at first but was getting a little better despite being miles above the ground. She slightly smiled as she looked to Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, soon enough this should all become instictive. For now, I'll hold you up but you should do the flapping. Just focus your mind on it. As I said before, your wings are just as much your limbs as your arms and legs are\" said Myrrh. Tyra nodded and tried to control the wings on her back. Slowly but surely, it was working! Not goood enough yet to fly on her own but passable. A sense of pride and enjoyment went through Tyra as she pretty much flew for the very first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing it!\" yelled Tyra in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job\" said Myrrh as they stayed like that for the rest of the flight there. As they reached the suspended land, Myrrh helped her gently land on the soft ground. They then turned to the school as their wings took a resting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like the castle, the outside is just for appearances. You might be more familiar with it when we get inside\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" said Tyra. Then, she heard noises as she turned to the buillding and saw numerous Misterian kids flying around, playing with each other before the start of classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Tyra knew what it felt to be the 'new kid' so to speak. It wouldn't get any easier from there on. Myrrh giggled slightly as Tyra's wings turned to a bright green color, showing her nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, won't this be fun'</i> thought Tyra sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, have fun. I'll pick you up after school\" said Myrrh as she smiled and flew off the floating island. Tyra gasped and reached out for Myrrh, only for her to already be out of reach. Tyra's wings glowed red in anger at her 'mother' leaving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, feed me to the wolves why don't you?\" said Tyra in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" asked a female voice from behind Tyra, startling her a bit. She turned around and saw a young 10-year olf girl behind her. This wasn't Lea. This girl had brown hair that was tied into a ponytail, with her hangs still hanging on her face. Her eyes were a bizzare purple color but held a certain calmness in them. She wore a more modern top on her body, being tied at the back of her neck as female kids wore. The top itself was violet as well. She also wore a white skort and black boots that went halfway up her calves and was tightened with purple laces. Underneath the boots, she had violet stockings that went to her thighs. She was quite pretty for her young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, it means that she just left me to fend for myself with no warning at all\" said Tyra. The girl giggled at Tyra's expression and explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that how humans phrase it? Kind of like how we got 'thrown out of the nest here'\" said the girl. Tyra laughed a bit at the girl's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have that too\" giggled Tyra, before she snapped out of it and looked at the girl. \"Wait, how did you know that? And who are you anyway?\" asked Tyra. The girl calmed down and gave a serene smile before giving a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my apologies, my name is Karis. I'm a student here. As for you being human, hasn't someone told you that your two eye colors reveal that fact?\" asked Karis. Tyra nodded as she remembered that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" said Tyra. Then, she turned again to Karis. \"Also, you don't have to bow. If you're bowing because I'm a princess, you can drop it. I don't like special treatment. Just treat me as Tyra\" said Tyra. Karis smiled and rose fully up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rumors are ture, you are quite modest\" said Karis, making Tyra blush a bit. \"Well, shall we? Let's introduce you to some of our classmates\" said Karis as she gently took Tyra's hand and brought her forward. Tyra was apprehensive, meeting a bunch of young Misterian children. It would be something that she would have to get used to though. Suddenly, a young male swooped in out of nowhere and hung upside down in front of the girls, startling them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ladies. Wonderful morning isn't it?\" asked the young male. He looked 10 years old as well. His toga top was brown and he wore black shorts with them instead of a skort. On his feet, he had green sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ewol, how are you?\" asked Karis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good\" said Ewol as he touched down on the ground and straightened himself up. Tyra looked at his youthful face and started to feel a small blush growing on her face. Being 21 years old originally, Tyra shuddered as she kenw what this was. <i>'Are you kidding me?! I've only been a girl for a day or so and I'm already crushing on a boy?! What is with me?!\"</i> yelled Tyra in her mind. Ewol seemed to somewhat hear her loud thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing!\" said Tyra, a little flustered, her wings turning pink (which generally meant blushing). Karis giggled next to her. As annoyed as Tyra was, she noticed something about Ewol. He had two eye colors! One was red and the other was brown. It worked out with his short brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever, welcome to Skyaira!\" said Ewol, extending a hand in welcome. Tyra calmed herself down a bit and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Ewol, was it?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep yep, Ewol's my name, making life fun is my game!\" said Ewol, jumping into the air and hovering. He took his leave and flew around the area a bit. Karis sighed and looked at Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Ewol all right. He was a human once like you and was rebirthed\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to him?\" asked Tyra. Karis thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe later during lunch or something. We got to get going into the school. I'll introduce you to everyone on the way\" said Karis. Tyra nodded and followed the girl towards the school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis, I think this could be a wonderful friendship\" said Tyra. Karis smiled, knowing how difficult it must be for the former human male to adapt to this life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree Tyra\" she said, before a smirk graced her face. \"Although, hopefully you won't be acting around every guy like you just did with Ewol\" said Karis, barely containing her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, she's never going to let that go\" said Tyra, sighing as she walked along with Karis.</span></div></div>",

Myrrh followed her gaze and again smiled. \"Those are flame fairy nests.\" she explained. \"They're tiny people, like us but don't worry, they're harmless. Just don't pester them, they have magic and they'll use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt, if they do?\" asked Tyra, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh shook her head, giggling. \"No, but you'll be glowing for a short while.\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Tyra spotted something moving at her feet.

Our language is much different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she awake, Myrrh?\" softly, a new voice asked. \"I wish to meet my new granddaughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is a bit shy, mother.\" smiling, Myrrh replied to a tall woman stepping into the room. \"Let me dress her first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra blushed brightly seeing the woman she guessed was Minerva enter. She was a near perfect replica of Myrrh in a stunning Victorian era dress and a beautiful silver crown on her head.

Only, as she looked at the blouse more closely, she saw no openings for her wings. Confused, she turned to Myrrh, causing her and Minerva to giggle slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called liquid fabric.\" smiling, Myrrh explained. \"It is much like silk only it becomes like a heavy liquid when offered resistance to allow passage for your wings then, when no resistance is offered, it becomes solid again, giving your wing roots the warmth they need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wing roots?\" asked Tyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where your wings meet your back.\" simply, Minerva replied. \"With liquid fabric, we can make any style clothing we wish without any concern for our wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" smiling, Tyra said. \"You must be Minerva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, if you please.\" patiently, Minerva corrected. \"I understand that all of this is a shock but please show respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra blushed. \"Sorry... grandma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled. \"It will take you some time to adjust to your new world.\" kindly, she said. \"Don't rush anything, you have all the time in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... If you are queen, does that make me a princess?\" curious, Tyra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded. \"Yes, it makes us both a princess, Tyra.\" looking at me, Myrrh replied. \"However, that does not give us the right to boss anyone around.\" wincing, she added, \"I learned that the hard way when I was ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chatter.\" with a wave of her hand, Minerva said. \"I think Tyra would like to see her new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know if I can fly.\" blushing, Tyra said. \"I never had wings before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will come with time, my dear.\" kindly, Minerva said. \"For now, we'll carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thought came to Tyra and she turned to Myrrh. \"What of my family back home?\" worried, she asked. \"They will be worried about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know you are alive and safe.\" patiently, Minerva replied. \"When it became obvious that we had to change you to save your life, I set events into motion that placed your family at ease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" confused, Tyra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit complicated to explain.\" sighing, Minerva said. \"Simply put, I magically placed a suggestion into the minds of your family that you had moved out long ago and is doing well in parts unknown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than allowing them to think you are dead or worse, not knowing.\" with a sad smile, Myrrh added. \"You are alive, doing well, and in parts unknown to them so none of it is a lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\" sighing, Tyra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to see your new world, my granddaughter?\" offering her hand, Minerva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra shyly nodded and accepted Minerva's hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What she saw no picture could ever give justice. It was a majestic view of several mountain tops surrounding mist covered valleys with low buildings of every style and grace resting on the many plateaus that seemed to have been carved into the mountainsides. What made everything all the more magnificent was the fact the mist made the mountain tops appear to be floating in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled proudly. \"The valleys below have trees that are as wide as your houses and as tall as your buildings.\" she explained, taking Tyra down to the tree tops. \"It is in these tree tops we have built our homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to take a closer look?\" smiling, Myrrh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra, filled with a sense of wonderment, nodded and they flew in among the trees, stopping to hover near one of the tree top dwellings with bridges spanning the distance to the others.

If you get hit, you are out of the game for that round.\" she giggled. \"It's boys verses girls in this match up but its only training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the winged man Myrrh was chasing turned. He quickly spread his wings, energy sparkling between the gleaming feathers. He then brought his wings crashing together, literally throwing the electricity off his wings, towards Myrrh in a stunning display of balance and timing. Myrrh, however was ready for the attack and spun out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys can't fire lightning from their hands?\" curious, Tyra asked, seeing Myrrh fire back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls and boys produce lightning in different ways.\" quickly, Myrrh explained. \"Only now is not the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra screamed again as a bolt of lightning nearly missed her, flashing across Myrrh's chest and she quickly turned to face a young man who was preparing for another strike. \"He's open.\" said Tyra, \"Can't you fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's against the rules as he can not fly while firing.\" dodging the second blast, Myrrh said. \"We can fire and fly at the same time but their blasts are more powerful, they are forbidden to use full strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a buzzer was sounded and Myrrh flew to the other players who had stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good game, everyone.\" joining the group, Minerva said. \"Thank you for allowing our participation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our pleasure, your highness.\" bowing, a woman replied. she paused seeing Tyra and smiled. \"Is this the kind young man who came to princess Myrrh's rescue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is.\" smiling, Myrrh replied. \"Please welcome our newest family member, Princess Tyra.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She appeared to have been no older that nineteen or twenty years old in human years. Tyra gazed upon her doll like face and smiled as she truly looked like an angel. Only Tyra blushed seeing strange armor Etoile was wearing. It looked like a blue skirted one piece swimsuit; the skirt seemed to have been made of metallic like feathers. The midsection and bust looked much like a leather corset, fitting her very snugly. The top seemed to have been made of black latex, with the way it shined and had armored plates over the shoulders that were made of the same metallic like feathers as the skirt. The helmet looked like something out of the mid-Evil times, making Etoile looking very beautiful but also very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It- It's a pleasure to beet you, Etoile.\" nervous, Tyra said. \"This place is simply awe inspiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile giggled, removing her helmet, revealing her beautiful raven black hair. \"What you have seen so far is but a taste of what Skyaira has to offer, little one.\" she said. \"Would you care to see the palace? I am heading there shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent suggestion.\" smiling, Minerva said. \"Let us go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dismissing the other players, Myrrh carried Tyra towards the palace with Minerva taking the lead and Etoile following close behind. As they came closer, Tyra noticed an arched pathway, leading from the dense forests to the palace and became curious. \"Why can't we walk to the palace down there?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That path is for emergencies and evacuations only.\" sternly, Myrrh replied. \"Just step on the path, from either side, and you are on the other side in an instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are several paths like that, leading to and from the palace.\" added Etoile, flying closer to Myrrh. \"If some one is injured, they can come to the palace immediately rather than flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" softly, Tyra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are about to land.\" smiling, Myrrh said. \"Prepare yourself, the palace is a sight to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being placed onto her feet, Tyra looked up to see two massive doors, which were opened to reveal a magnificent hall beyond that took her breath away. The hall was long with mirror like marble floors and high, beautifully decorated pillars that curved, following the arched, vaulted ceiling. Between each pillar was a tall, live tree, curving with each pillar, giving the entire hall a majestic outdoor look and feel. \"Oh wow!\" Tyra whispered. \"It- It's beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every room and chamber as a natural look and feel to it.\" explained Minerva. \"Bare walls are too cold to stare at and art, although beautiful, is not real. Therefore, when this palace was built, they made certain every wall, every door, and every room would be alive with the outdoors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Myrrh game Tyra a gentle push forward. \"Go one, little one.\" smiling, she said. \"Explore your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra, although nervous, smiled and began to walk down the hall with Myrrh following with a motherly smile on her face. <i>\"She may have the mind of an adult human.\" </i>she thought. <i>\"But even human adults are children at heart.\"<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

As she walked deeper into the hall, a smile touched the corners of her mouth as she watched a girl rise to the next floor above, riding a platform with no visible means of lifting it. \"What a very curious place.\" whispering, she said. \"It seems very simple yet, at the same time, it seems more advanced than anything I had seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Tyra was about to walk to one of the platforms when a strange sound echoed from another hall. At first, Tyra suspected it was a coo from a baby and began to walk closer towards the hall. Myrrh, hearing the sound as well, smiled as she watched Tyra's curiosity get the best of her. Only she said nothing as Tyra approached the entrance to the hall to investigate the odd sound of a cooing child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jl0pgOLX1rb4j0vo1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jl0p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" looking around, Tyra asked. \"Is anyone there?\" pausing, she gently added, \"Come on, I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Tyra saw a patch of the vines moving and smiled with genuine wonder as a small creature hesitantly showed itself, cooing like an infant. The creature looked like it was made of intertwined wines with tiny flowers of various colors mixed in. Its head looking like a small vine colored melon with long and soft moss like hair. She, as Tyra guessed, had a slender body and sleek black eyes that peered at her in the center of it circular eyebrows that like two little bird nests in the front of its head with two tiny slits for a nose and a small mouth with tiny but sharp looking teeth. This did not concern Tyra as the mouth was too small to bite her anywhere as the creature was the size of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" softly, Tyra said to the timid looking creature. \"You are a cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra slowly reached out her hand with Myrrh watching from a distance, smiling. The creature slowly reached out her hand in turn then touched Tyra's finger. It felt as soft as moss on a tree. Tyra smiled, having made contact with, in her mind, was an alien being. <i>\"Nicole would be so jealous of me right now.\"</i> looking at the creature, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to scare the little thing, Tyra moved as slowly as she could and began to stroke the creature's 'hair'. At first, the creature did not seem to know how to react as it pulled away slightly. Only Tyra continued to gently stroke it's hair and she began to purr. It sounded like a distant woodpecker, knocking on a tree, making Tyra giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you made a friend.\" slowly approaching, Myrrh said. \"It's called a vine sprite, they eat nuts and berries in the forest outside, they look like vines to hide from predators.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra watched as the vine sprite crawled into the nook of her arm, stroking its head against her chest, as if wanting to be petted more. Tyra began to pet it again then, before she knew what she was doing, asked, \"Can I keep her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh giggled. \"Your first day as a Misterian and you already want a pet.\" smiling, she said. \"I don't see why not, so long as you can care for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is a she.\" smiling back, Tyra said. \"I guessed she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All vine sprites are girls.\" explaining, Myrrh said. \"Vine nymphs are males.\" shaking her head, she added, \"What are you going to call her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, Tyra replied, \"Flora, because of her cute flowery body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded, amused. \"Well, bring Flora along, there is much more to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra and Myrrh continued to walk down the main hall...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they were on the second floor, Myrrh pulled Tyra to a landing. \"That's enough for now.\" she said. \"You need to get used to using those new muscles, don't want you to push yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" nodding, Tyra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your quarters are at the end of that hall.\" pointing to a vine covered hallway, Myrrh said. \"You will find your name engraved in the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My quarters are that way as well.\" smiling, Lea said. \"My mother is a Valkyrie.\" she smiled, seeing Tyra blush then added, \"Would you like to see my quarters or do you want to see your own first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tyra decide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls carry the child but the men endure the pain through a telepathic link. Once the child is born, the man and woman share the duty of breast feeding.\" she paused, smiling. \"In case you are wondering, yes, boys here have monthly periods but they are to expel dead sperm so to the guarantee pregnancy of their mate during mating season.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton shook his head, it was a lot to process. <i>\"This is deep.\"</i> he thought. <i>\"It can't be real, I'm dreaming.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no dream, Eton.\" replied Myrrh, surprising him. \"We are a telepathic race, I heard your thought but don't worry, you will learn to control your thoughts and block out the overly curious in time. As for the color of your eyes, it is a mark that you were once a human who was rebirthed after a heroic deed. You will be openly accepted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton sighed then asked, \"What of your wings changing color from time to time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled, pleased that her new son's anger was slowly turning to curiosity. \"It shows our emotions.\" she replied. \"When we are happy, our wings are white. When angry, they turn black. Pink is embarrassment, blue is sadness, indigo is fear, and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiouser and curiouser.\" said Eton. \"How deep does the rabbit hole go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh tilted her head. \"I'm sorry, the... rabbit hole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Eton's turn to laugh, his first since his transformation. \"It's from a popular fairy tale on Earth, named Alice in Wonderland.\" he explained. \"How curious is your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled, understanding a little better. \"Will you let me show you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded and Myrrh smiled, touching a section of the wall...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Only, he was panting after only a few seconds of being in the air. \"This is harder than it looks.\" he said. \"I'm already tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh took Eton's hand and took him skyward. \"Just relax then.\" she said. \"We can work on learning to fly after you get your strength back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded and looked around to see where he was and let out a low gasp, seeing a large number of islands, floating in the sky, above the clouds! \"Oh... wow!\" he breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://digital-art-gallery.com/oid/0/r169_457x256_223_Cloud_City_2d_fantasy_city_picture_image_digital_art.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://digital-art-gallery.com/oid/0/r16...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled. \"Eton, welcome to Skyaira, your new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... enchanting!\" whispered Eton, his eyes dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Eton was now a ten year old Misterian boy, he had the mind of an adult human.

It is what has allowed us to live in peace these many centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded then looked forward again to see an ancient palace below them. \"Is that the palace?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://travelhappy.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/angkor-wat.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://travelhappy.info/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" replied Myrrh. \"We maintain the original outside design to honor our ancestors but the inside is quite modern as you will soon see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon landing at the main entrance, Myrrh turned to Eton. \"Inside, you will find a hall with Misterians standing at attention on either side.\" she said, seriously. \"They are not permitted to move or speak, while on duty, guarding the entrance hall unless there is danger.\" she smiled. \"Do not speak, keep your eyes forward, and do not stop walking until we enter the main place, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded, though he was a bit confused. Myrrh took his hand and led him passed the main doors, which opened for them, revealing a beautifully decorated hall with smooth multi colored floors, walls and ceilings that seemed to change as they entered the hall. Eton tried his best to keep his eyes forward but the changing walls and floors and ceilings was very distracting and he could not help dart his eyes up. He saw the ceiling showing changing images of his rescue of Myrrh as James and his change into a little boy over and over. Each time, it ended with Eton awakening to his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting.\"</i> he thought. <i>\"It's like the palace hall is announcing our arrival.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton did not hear a word from the guards and nor did he see any of them move a muscle as they passed them, it was a bit unnerving to him to think that they were really not statues. Upon reaching the end of the hall, Myrrh touched the wall then, with her free hand, took Eton's wrist and had him touch the wall as well. The wall vanished, revealing a great room beyond which they entered as the wall reappeared behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can talk freely.\" she said, smiling. \"The silence serves as a gesture of respect to the guards, both Valkyrie and Archangels, men and women who protect the palace and our people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded then looked around to see that the room they were in had an halls branching off into several directions, each of which seemed to have been decorated to honor a different culture. He turned to Myrrh, confused. \"The palace looked a little smaller from the outside.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh giggled. \"Nothing is as it seems.\" she replied. \"It's a matter of perspective. The palace seems smaller on the outside only because most of it is invisible to the naked eye.\" she smiled. \"Remember, we maintain the 'original' outer look to honor our ancestors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton's eyes widened, glistening with wonder. \"That's so cool!\" he said, excited. \"What does the palace really look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh touched Eton's nose, giggling. \"You'll find out in time.\" she said. \"I didn't see the true look of the palace until I was a hundred years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton looked at Myrrh, stunned. \"A hun... hundred years old!?\" he asked. \"You look no older than twenty, twenty five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, Eton.\" said Myrrh with a smile. \"I'm actually 485 years old. We Misterians live a long time, 2500 to 3000 years, in fact so you have all the time in the world, young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton's jaw dropped with his eyes still wide in shock, causing Myrrh to laugh. \"Please close your mouth, a bird might make a nest in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA laugh escaped Eton's throat as he closed his mouth. \"I'm guessing that is but the first of many shocking discoveries.\" he said, now walking with Myrrh again. \"I wish my little sister, Nicole could see all of this. She always dreams about flying among the clouds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled but did not respond as an image of Nicole entered her mind. <i>\"I wonder.\"</i> she thought. <i>\"Could she be our 'missing angel'?\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough, Myrrh and Eton arrived at a grand set of doors, which also had some guards at attention there. Eton still felt a little wierd around these 'living statues' so to speak. Myrrh grabbed his hand in assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, beyond these doors is....mother\" said Myrrh after a small pause, her wings changing to a color that told Eton of how nervous she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, (gulp) let's go\" said Eton, not knowing what to expect when meeting the ruler of the Misterians. Was she a more casual ruler? Or perhaps more strict? Eton wasn't sure he wanted to find out. Then again, is she was his grandmother now, he would have to face her sooner or later. Besides, Myrrh could use the support. After all, Eton wasn't the one in deep trouble for causing the situation in which he had to become a Misterian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come\" said Myrrh as she gulped and proceeded forward. She pressed her hand on the door and it slowly opened at her touch. Unlike other doors that vanished on touch, this one opened like normal doors. Of course, because they were so large, they caused a huge noise as they glided across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh and Eton walked together into the hall. Eton;s mouth once again hung open as he looked at the grand majesty of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This is the 'Hall of Miracles'</i> told Myrrh into his thoughts. Eton wondered why they called it that. Myrrh responded, mentally again. <i>'It's called that way because, if you're her because you're in trouble, it'll be a miracle if you get out with no problem. That's more or less a rumor though just to scare kids into eating their healthy foods'</i> thought Myrrh with a slight giggle. Eton gave her a dull look that pretty much said 'Seriously?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as they walked along, Eton looked at the throne at the end of the hall. There sat a woman of obvious grand stature. She looked like an older version of Myrrh, with longer dark hair and wearing white clothing. Her energy wings shined behind her. They were mostly white right now, but they had a tint of red which worried Eton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Myrrh and Eton arrived at the foot of the throne and met Queen Minerva's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello mother\" said Myrrh, not doing a good job of hiding the nervousness in her voice. Minerva's eyes traveled to Myrrh, making her gulp again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myrrh. This is quite a problem you've caused. Bacause of your foolishness, this young man's life has been turned upside down with his friends and family in grief. How do you justify yourself?\" asked Minerva, calm and cool as a ruler should. Myrrh however, was none of that. She fumbled around her words, trying to explain herself to the ruler of Skyaira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't, can't you?\" said Minerva, more telling than asking. Myrrh hung her head down in shame. \"I told you over and over that one day, bad things would happen if you couldn't learn how to grow up. You didn't listen to me and look at what has happened. You now seem to have the rare honor of being a mother who hasn't even mated yet. Such things could reflect horribly on you Myrrh\" explained Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I understand mother. It's just that...\" started Myrrh, but Minerva wouldn't let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know? I'm not so sure. You're the only heir I have Myrrh. These are things you should have learning centuries ago. When are you going to start taking your duties seriously?\" asked Minerva. She sighed and then continued. \"Unfortunately, nothing can change the past. You're stuck with what you have caused Myrrh\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\" asked Myrrh, barely able to look her mother in the eye. Eton didn't know what to do in this situation. Myrrh was getting a harsh lecture from her mother but Eton really couldn't do much about it. This meeting was more about Myrrh than it was about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you know. This boy is your son now. Thus, you will be tasked with raising him <b>properly</b>' stated Minerva, putting empathesis on the last part. \"Maybe this could be what causes you to mature, Myrrh. If I find out that you are not properly raising him, there will be severe consequences. That, I assure you. Even I can't protect you anymore Myrrh\" said Minerva, ever keeping her cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mother\" said Myrrh, a little more calm now that she knew that she wouldn't be severely punished. Then, Minerva turned to Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you are the victum in all this. I'm deeply sorry for what my daughter has caused\" said Minerva. Eton didn't know what to say but had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nothing, g-grandmother\" said Eton, getting used to the word. Minerva actually gave a small smile as she heard it, as if she found it amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pray that we can make your new life as good as possible. I can assure that for your heroics\" said Minerva. Eton nodded in gratitude at Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I believe you both have business to do now. You know what to do Myrrh. You're both dismissed\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more needed to be said as both Misterians left the hall with many things to think about now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering the hall outside the throne room, dubbed the 'hall of miracles', all the guards stood at attention as queen Minerva came into view behind them. \"All hail Prince Eton, daughter of princess Myrrh by rite of rebirth!\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards immediately turned to Eton and bowed before declaring, in one voice, \"Hail prince Eton, daughter of princess Myrrh! You shall not be harmed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the guards returned to their posts, unmoving. Eton, taken back, turned to see the heavy door sliding closed with a low ruble and caught a warm smile from queen Minerva. <i>*You may just be what my daughter needs to finally grow up, Eton.*</i> she thought to you. <i>*Welcome to Skyaira, my grandson.*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile touched the corners of Eton's mouth as he waved bye to his new grandmother then turned away and followed Myrrh down the hall, to another corridor that was lined with doors and other halls. Once they were far enough away, Eton asked, \"What was that all about... mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh sighed. \"It was my mom's way of reminding me that I am not alone in raising you.\" she replied \"Queen Minerva never shuts anyone out or leaves anyone to fend for themselves in her kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded then asked, \"So where are we going now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dining hall.\" replied Myrrh. \"You did say you were hungry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton blushed as his stomach began to growl, causing Myrrh to giggle. \"We don't have the foods you are used to but I can assure you they are just as tasty.\" she said. \"I will bring you a little variety and tell you what each dish is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh then led Eton into a grand hall with a long table in the center of the room with a large number of narrow backed chairs, which he guessed were to accommodate for a Misterian's wings. Myrrh smiled then said, \"Find yourself a seat and I'll go talk to the kitchen staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she touched a section of the wall, causing it to vanish, and walked through as the sounds of a busy kitchen filled the dining hall. Eton tried to look inside but the 'door' closed as soon as Myrrh was through, leaving the hall in silence again. \"What a curiously wonderful place.\" said Eton, softly. \"I feel like I'm in one of those fairy tale  s Nicole loves to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Eton sensed that some one was watching him. It was not an new found power but a learned skill he had acquired when he was a grown man. He looked around and spotted a small child, no older than himself, nervously peeking into the hall, looking at him. Eton smiled, catching the child's eye. \"I don't bite.\" he said. \"Please, come in and know me better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child visibly gulped and walked into the room. As boys and girls all basically dressed the same, Eton could not tell if the person was a boy or a girl. \"Hi, I'm Lea.\" she said, timidly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton rose from his seat. \"I'm Eton.\" he replied. \"Um... forgive me, I was just... rebirthed. Are you a boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea looked at Eton for a moment, then giggled as an attractive woman walked up behind her. \"Lea, you're laughing!\" she said, happy but surprised. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked into the hall as Lea explained between giggles and giggled herself as Eton blushed brightly. She entered, bringing Lea with her and gave you a respectful bow. \"Girls keep their hair longer than boys and are more developed, when they enter puberty.\" she explained. \"Also, boys have a more muscular frame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" said Eton, looking slightly lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled. \"I am Charity, master of arms of the Valkyrie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eton, son of princess Myrrh by rite of rebirth.\" replied Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity's eyes widened slightly then bowed further, urging Lea to do the same but Eton shook his head. \"Please, I'm still trying to wrap my head around being a little boy again.\" he said. \"You don't have to bow before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity rose, smiling with Lea following. \"May we join you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Merely saying Prince Eton, you state your standing and your different colored eyes give the status of your rebirth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to have blue eyes.\" said Eton. \"Why did that change to brown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharity smiled. \"All parts of the rebirth are random.\" replied Charity. \"You could have come out of it a girl like Lea or a man, or a woman with any combination of traits and eye colors that exist in the royal family.\" she gave a low giggle. \"I take it Myrrh did not explain Misterian clothing to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton shook his head. \"Um... no, she dressed me quickly then off we went.\" he said. \"I saw that everyone dressed pretty much the same so I didn't question it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are subtle differences.\" explained Charity. \"The toga like... dress, I think you call them, wraps around the body and is secured by a single clasp at the shoulder. Boys wear the clasp on the right while the girls wear them on the left, more as a tradition than anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we wear when we sleep?\" asked Eton, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea giggled, finding it amusing that Eton knew so little. \"Boys and girls just wear panties and a 'night skirt'.\" she said. \"We don't wear any tops to bed, not even a bra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton turned another shade of red as he remembered Myrrh putting him in a training bra. She did it so quickly, it was a blur to him. \"The lines between genders seem very blurred here.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea giggled again. \"You have a lot to learn.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do you, Leala.\" scolded Charity, smiling. \"Judge not less thee be judged yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" said Lea, blushing. \"Must you use my full name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you misbehave, yes.\" replied Charity. she then turned back to Eton. \"Males and females here are equal on many levels but there are lines that separate them we just don't believe in etching those lines in stone, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded, understanding. \"Thank you.\" he said. \"Is there anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should allow your mother to cover the rest.\" she said. \"I have already stepped a little out of line telling you what I did but you needed to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a section of the wall vanished, bringing sounds of the kitchen as Myrrh returned, the wall reforming behind her. She smiled, seeing Charity and Lea, sitting with Eton. \"Ah, I see you've already made some friends.\" she said. \"It's a good thing I had a lot prepared.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She accompanied the human policeman who reported to James' home. She and the policeman informed James' family his remains had been found. The policeman seemed visibly sick as he explained that it looked as if James had been literally torn to pieces. Mom immediately fell into hysterical tears as Dad vainly attempted to comfort her. \"Any ideas who did this?\" he asked, distraught himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are investigating.\" replied the policeman. \"We found three men at the crime scene but they were seriously messed up themselves and had no memory of what had happened.\" he sighed, frustrated. \"We'll find your son's killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind mom and dad, Nicole hugged Trevor, wailing in tears. Watching, Minerva wanted to comfort her but knew it was not possible for her to do so. \"I'm sorry, child.\" she said, softly. \"I wish you could all know the truth but its not our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver near a corner, sat Ellen, James' oldest sibling. Her hands were balled up in fists as she was trying remain strong in the presence of tragedy. However, her facade wasn't working well as tears were leaking out of her eyes. Without a word, she ran upstairs to her room before she could break down in tears in front of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spotted a young man comforting a woman and recognized them, from Eton's memories, as Nate and Erin and listened in as her scout telepathically sent what she was experiencing to her. \"I'll find who did this, Nate.\" he whispered, crying with her. \"I'll make the bastard pay, I swear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva shook her head. \"I fear this Nate will tear the city apart, looking for his friend's 'killer'.\" she mussed. \"I admire him but I must find a way for this family to find peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed something odd and mentally instructed her Valkyrie to comfort Nicole. <i>\"Place your hands onto her back, tell me what you find.\"</i> she thought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police woman placed her hands onto Nicole's back and inwardly gasped as she discovered a pair of hardened lumps where a pair of wings would be rooted. Nicole, feeling the policewoman's touch turned around to see her smile sadly. \"We know you miss him.\" she said. \"I promise we will do all we can to find who did this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole immediately hugged the policewoman while, high above, Minerva heard the report and sighed. \"This case just got more complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aside from a drink that looked similar to milk, the foods looked somewhat odd to Eton. One dish was that of what looked like Mac &amp; Cheese noodles. Except that they were almost white in color and they had a sort of green spice on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, these in particular are spiced noodles. We grow our own food here but we do have some foods that humans eat. The green spice is from a kind of Misterian crop that has a...bit of a kick to it so to speak\" said Myrrh with a sly giggle. Eton squinted at her, as if she just said something odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't spike it did you?\" he asked. Apparently, Myrrh and Charity knew what he meant as they giggled a bit. Lea on the other hand had absolutley no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't do that to a kid. It's kind of like that spicy sause those people from Mexico, I believe you call it\" said Myrrh. Eton sighed in relief. She was talking about the spiciness, not if there was alchohol in it. Anyway, he grabbed a fork and took a bite out of it. Almost instantly, his face lit up with heat. He immediately grabbed his drink and gulped down half of it, much to the amusement of the 3 girls present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you it had a kick to it\" said Myrrh as she giggled. Eton glared at her with an indginant look on his face. Before he could respond however, they heard a knock on the nearby door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myrrh? I need to enter if possible\" said a female voice. No doubt that it was Minerva. Myrrh heard it and motioned for her to come in, the door vanishing as the queen made her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah my queen. To what do we owe this pleasure?\" asked Charity. There was a bit of sarcasm in her voice which made Minerva smile. Charity was an experienced and responsible woman, and she had known Minerva for centuries now. No doubt there was some playful humore between the two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aside for now\" said Minerva, gesturing to Charity. Then, she continued while looking at Eton, \"I need to borrow Eton for a minute. Could you please?\". Eton was confused but he didn't want to go against the queen so he nodded and got up from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat my share!\" he yelled just to make sure. Myrrh gave him a smile that both assured him and yet made him uneasy. Anyway, the two walked into a nearby room for a little privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need, g-grandmother?\" asked Eton, a little uneasy. Minerva smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be nervous. I just need to ask you something\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be?\" started Eton. Minerva composed herself before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I first met you, I saw your memories of what had happened, as well as some other aspects of your life. Then, something caught my eye. A young girl was most often present in your memories. About 6-years old I imagine? Who is she?\" asked Minerva. Eton smiled as he remembered his youngest (and perhaps favorite) sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Nicole. She's my youngest sister. We adopted her 4 years ago. I was always the one with played with her the most. Like me, she often dreams of being able to fly one day. We would always talk about our dreams, to the amusement of anyone around\" said Eton, slightly laughing which brough a smile to Minerva's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, what were the circumstances of your family adopting her?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's kind of odd. Mom said she found her in a dark alley. She said her clothing was shredded and that she was badly bleeding. She also had these wierd markings on her back, which the doctors said were bone spurs on her shoulders. Anyway, Mom saved her and brought her to the hospital to be healed. When she woke up later, we were at a meeting to discuss wether she should go to an orphanage or not. She woke up right ther and asked if Mom was her mother. It seemed as if she couldn't remember anything. Mom said yes and Nicole never questioned it\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never questioned it?\" asked Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like she really believes that she's a blood-related member of the family. No one had the heart to tell her that she was adopted. Anyway, we decided to adopt her as an orphanage would be bad for her. Then, Trevor noted that she looked like a sleeping angel. So, we named her Nicole, meaning 'born by angels'. Funny huh?\" said Eton, finishing his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this Nicole, she believes that she is normal?\" asked Minerva. This confused Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's happy believing that Mom gave birth to her and we're happy when she's happy. Why?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. I was just curious. You can go back to lunch now\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Good day\" said Eton as he exited the room and made his way back to the others. Minerva stayed in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'So Pallas' daughter is alive? She'll be happy to know this. Now, should we convince Aria to come back to not?'</i></span></div></div>",

Lea screamed in fright, falling and Eton reacted by jumping after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eton, Lea!\" screamed the perspective mothers, running to the railing. They looked down and breathed a sigh of relief, seeing Eton flapping his wings, holding Lea in the air by the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asked Eton, panting slightly with effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, Lea replied, \"Yeah, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton blushed as well. \"Any time.\" he said. \"Can you start flapping your wings, I'm getting tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea blushed even more and began to flap her wings, bring her level with Eton in the air. \"Sorry, Eton.\" she said. \"I was so scared, I forgot for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared too.\" admitted Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea looked at Eton, confused. \"Why, you saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton glanced back at his mom and Charity looking at them with loving eyes, which Lea noticed. \"I see, you think they might want to play cupid.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen that look in a girl's eyes before.\" said Eton. \"I know they will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time of talking some more, Eton and Lea returned to the balcony and made a soft landing into the arms of their mothers. \"That was very brave, Eton.\" said Myrrh. \"I'm proud of you.\" she then whispered, \"I think you just made your first friend today, get to know her more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a great friend, Lea.\" said Charity. \"I'm happy you are safe.\" she then whispered, \"He's cute, you might want to get to know him more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton and Lea looked at each other, blushing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The parents, James' Mom and Dad, didn't speak much although they did attempt to try and brighten the spirits of the remaining family members. They had to prepare for James' funeral and they wanted everyone to try and remember the good times they shared with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen had rarely come out of her room since the news. When the police came, she was visably shaking while trying to maintain a strong facade. Sadly to say, she ran up the stairs and secluded herself in her room before she bursted out in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrevor, the youngest of the male siblings, was distraught yet indignant. Losing his brother tore him up but also grew hatred in him for whoever did this. His first words following the policeman's report was that he wanted to track down whoever did this and take them down (and he used more adult words while saying it). Everyone admired his resolve in the face of this tragedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the worst off was the youngest sibling, Nicole. Only 6 years old, she was perhaps the closest to James. They shared a dream of flying together, to the amusement of whoever was around. As Eton had said earlier, Nicole was adopted but had no memory of whoever she was before. James was the one most accepting of her into the family and played with her at each oppurtunity. She hadn't played with her toys at all since the news and just sat on her bed, your legs swinging back and forth off the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole dear, it's time for dinner\" said Mom as she opened Nicole's door, hoping for her daughter to eat more. In the past day, Nicole had barely eaten and it already showed since she was naturally a thing girl. She wasn't anorexic by any means, but her lack of nutrition wasn't helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mom\" said Nicole. Jane, the mother, sighed in relief that Nicole finally acknowledged that. Nicole slowly jumped off her bed and walked out the room, Jane holding her small hand as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't the only ones who had heard the news. Nate and Erin had been told as well. Like Ellen, Erin was distraught at the news and tried her eyes out, despite Nate's attempts to help her. Like Trevor, Nate swore that he would find whoever did this and make them pay for taking the life of his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know that it wasn't an end, it was a beginning. Especially for Nicole, as she would be more wrapped up into what was to come much more than the others.</span></div></div>",

While sleep came easier for most of the family, Nicole was unable to have a peaceful sleep. Since James' death, she had been feeling wierd, almost sick to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I shouldn't tell mommy and daddy yet though. I can't let them worry about me now'</i> thought Nicole. Everyone was dealing with James' death. Nicole didn't want to worry her family even more with how she was feeling. The reason why she didn't eat much was because she constantly felt sick to her stomach. Her head was pounding, as if there were hammers pounding inside of it. In all honesty, it was driving Nicole crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, it was worse than it was before. Her face was a ghostly shade of white and she felt as if she was going to throw up. Currently, she was still laying in bed, trying to endure through it and get through the night. However, she was beginning to sweat profusely and her breathing was hard. If only one could see the inside of her mindscape right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Nicole's Mind******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nicole's mind was an absolute maelstrom of darkness, thoughts swirling in her head. Occassionately, vague visions would appear, such as a boy with what appeared to be angel wings. It scared Nicole not to know what it all meant. All she was now was extremely frightened. Voices could be heard all around but Nicole couldn't make them out. It was like she was drowing into an infinite abyss without the smallest speck of light.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Real World*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor unknown reasons, her condition seemed to be geting worse. Nicole was starting to believe that she was going to die. As this was happening, her door opened slightly, revealing Ellen in her sleeping clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, are you alright? I thought I heard....Oh my gosh!\" yelled Ellen as she ran over to Nicole, taking a look at the distressed girl. Ellen didn't waste a second calling her parents down. No matter what, Nicole wouldn't wake up, but she was shaking uncontrollably. If her face could get any more white, it just did. Eventually, Michael decided it was best to take Nicole to the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen tried her best to comfort her ailing sister as the family drove her to the hospital. It was no use and Ellen felt helpless as nothing seemed to calm down Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, Nicole was laying in a hospital bed. A doctor had taken a look and couldn't quite figure out what was wrong. He guessed that it was perhaps a bad cold but no one seemed too sure. Anyway, Nicole was given some medicine to help calm her down. The family watched in relief as Nicole's breathing slowly went back to normal, some color finally returning to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness\" said Jane as she watched Nicole's previously contorted face soften and relax. She gently combed through Nicole's brown hair as Nicole's head finally began to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What....is...happening?'</i> thought Nicole before a peaceful dreamless sleep enveloped her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Man, what a day!\" said Eton as he sat down on the hard ground without a second thought. Lea giggled behind him. The two had just finished up Eton's first day at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner last night, Myrrh showed Eton how Misterian's slept in what Eton described as love seats. It was surprisingly comfortable sleeping in a sitting position. That mroning, Eton recieved an abrupt awakening, learning that school started at sunrise for kids his age. Myrrh showed him how to properly shower, which involved grooming his wings. It involved an open shower where Myrrh had to help as well until he could learn to do it himself. Being male, he would have to learn since he would have physical wings throughout his whole life, unlike the energy wings that females developed which required no cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Eton was then brought to a small island off the mainland that housed the school for Misterians. Once again, Myrrh left him, leaving him by himself. Luckily, Lea found him and gave him the grand tour of the building. Needless to say, Eton didn't talk much to the other kids besides Lea. It was rather uneventful for a first day. Not many talked to him, although he could hear them discussing about him. He probably would have to confront them tomorrow if not earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just as boring as regular school\" said Eton, glad to be out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I heard you liked Astronomy from when you were human\" suggested Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and that part was kind of cool. Everything else was boring\" said Eton, sighing and making Lea giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally agree, my friend!\" yelled an energetic male voice from behind them. Eton and Lea turned around to see a couple of kids their age approach them. One was male with short light brown hair and a smile that seemed to be permanently etched onto his face. He was wearing a green toga top with the clasp on his left shoulder with what seemed to be brown shorts on, unlike the skorts that most wore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis partner was a brown'haired girl who had hers in a ponytail. She had striking purple eyes which seemed bizarre but seemed to carry an energy in them. She was wearing a top that covered her chest completely and wrapped around her neck, leaving half her back open for her wings. The top itself was purple and she had white fencing gloves that covered her hands and forearms. She wore the standard skort which was white and she wore boot that went halfway up her calves. The boots were purple with green laces wrapping around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you. You kept interrupting the teacher\" said Eton, pointing to the male. The male smirked, as if he had no shame. Looking closely, Eton was surprised to see that he had 2 eye colors! As far as he knew, only rebirthed Misterians had 2 eyes like he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged. Just thought I'd make it more fun. I'm Ewol by the way\" said Ewol, extending his hand. Eton gave him a weary smile and shook his outstretched hand. His attention then went to the girl with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Karis, pleased to meet you\" said Karis, shaking his hand as well. She then turned to Lea and smiled. \"You must have had quite an impact on Lea. She's usually quite depressing\" said Karis. Eton was confused at this, while Lea blushed at her words and hung her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, everyone picks on Lea because she always carries this air of depression with her. To see her so happy around you, it's quite refreshing. Congratulations on your new friend, Lea\" said Karis, making Lea blush more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...it's nothing\" said Lea in a tiny voice. Then, Karis smirked, and not the good one either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, judging by your aura when you're with him, I assume you've already picked him as your mate-to-be?\" asked Karis, allowing Lea's face to invent a new shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? No! I-I don't...\" stumbled Lea, not many coherent voices escaping her mouth before she shut it. Karis then giggled and patted the girl on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I was joking\" said Karis, trying to laugh it off. Lea wasn't laughing though and tried to tell Karis that that wasn't very nice. Eventually, the two girls started going back and forth on it, leaving Ewol and Eton to themselves for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there they go. Such energetic girls they are. Can't say it's not attractive though\" said Ewol. Eton laughed a bit as how much Ewol seemed to remind him of Nate back down in the human world. Then, Ewol turned to Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were rebirthed as well?\" asked Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I noticed you must have been as well\" said Eton, getting a nod from Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was originally a human named Brandon. I had been an orphin for as long as I could remember and I was taking a leisurely stroll around the block. Then, I see this winged girl being attacked by these guys. I tell you, they didn't seem normal. Their eyes were blood red\" said Ewol, chilling Eton to his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the girl?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lea\" replied Ewol. This surprised Eton but he allowed Ewol to continue first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my first instinct is to get them away from her. I picked up some rocks and hurled them at the guys, telling them to leave her alone. However, I was so in over my head and one of them stabbed me in the stomach. As I understand it, Lea's mother then came and slayed the demons in those men, knocking them out. Lea pleaded with her mom to save me and she did just that. After that, I've been Lea's older brother\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Her brother?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, crazy right? Well, it's pretty good so far. It's only been about 5 months since it happened but I'm over it. It's not like I had any family down there who cared about me\" said Ewol, a little sadness evident in his normally happy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton was surprised to already meet someone who already had gone through what he went through. This would be the start of a wonderful friendship between them.</span></div></div>",

That's quite a shock as no one expected Myrrh to be having any children for a long time\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say that Princess Myrrh is in no rush for her own family. She's nearing 500 years of age but has barely even dated someone in her lifetime\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the people of this race have such long lifespans. I don't think I'll have to rush either\" said Eton. Ewol kept smiling and wrapped one arm around Eton's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither\" said Ewol. Looking ahead, they saw the girls finally joining them again. Lea was apparently still not forgiving Karis for her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you girls done?\" asked Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mostly. Anyway, let's go. I want to get some practice in today and you both are coming\" said Karis, apparently not taking no for an answer, or even waiting for an answer that is. She quickly walked to the edge and flew down to the mainland. Lea was trailing behind her. Ewol sighed as he watched Lea fly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only Lea could actually act herself around me\" said Ewol, confusing Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being an only child, Lea doesn't exactly conprehend how to live with a sibling. She always feels like she owes me for putting him in danger and she always tries to be the good sister. She almost never opposes anything I say. It's almost like she's trying to be my servant. It's kind of frustrating\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how it feels to have siblings. Ellen and I would fight alot as kids. However, we've become very close over the last few years as we grew up\" said Eton, reliving the good old days with him and his siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice. I wouldn't mind if Lea and I messed with eachother, because that's what siblings do. I want her to be herself. Maybe you can help her since you had siblings as a human\" sais Ewol. It was more of a request than a statement though, and Eton caught on to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing..friend\" said Eton. Ewol smiled at the word and the two fist-bumped each other. This friendship was off to a great start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what was Karis talking about?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that? She's talking about sparring and training at the Training Hall. You see, Karis dreams of becoming a high-ranking Valkyrie. When you get to know her, it's not hard to imagine why. She's a born leader and alot of people look up to her bravery and grace. She's pretty good with a sword in her hands too and her magic is strong as well. She has the total package\" said Ewol, almost in an admiring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like her?\" asked Eton, innocently. Ewol smirked and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not like that. She's a pal and that's good for now. Maybe in the far future, things could change\" said Ewol, and Eton took that reasonable explanation. Then, Ewol got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you should come too. It's good to train with a weapon. Helps the mind and body much more than this place will\" said Ewol, referring to the school. Eton laughed at his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. Are there instructors there?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, many. They'll help anyone with a weapon. I even heard there's a sword and shield instructor from Titania visiting. She's supposedly quite the looker\" said Ewol with a gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Titania?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Misterian city in Europe. I think it's over the United Kingdom. It a pretty sophisticated place, and they house a Royal Academy for Archangel and Valkyrie training. If this girl is from there, she must be quite skilled. There's even a rumor that she's a rebirthed human as well, born in France\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for then. Let's fly\" said Eton. With that, the 2 friends flew off the edge of the island. Ewol did have to gently support Eton though as he wasn't completely ready to fly on his own yet.</span></div></div>",

Both were panting by the time the reached Karis and Lea. \"You need to practice more, Eton.\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a break.\" pouting, Eton said. \"I'm trying my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't pick on him, Ewol.\" warned Karis. \"I remember how hard learning to fly was for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEwol blushed slightly. \"I also remember how hard you were on me to learn more quickly.\" he fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lea took Eton's hand. \"This place always makes me shiver.\" she said. \"Would you go in with me, Eton?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton, slightly taken back nodded and followed Ewol and Karis into the main entrance. What greeted them caused shivers to run down  Eton's spine. \"The temple seemed much older on the inside than it did non the outside and he could see shadows of what he could only describe as demons flying about the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bestgamewallpapers.com/files/2moons/undergroun-of-parca-temple.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://bestgamewallpapers.com/files/2moo...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...

He let out a surprised yell as he thrust his wings outward,  jumping back, taking Lea with him. He tried to look up to see his attacker but he or she would not give him the chance as the sword came down again only, this time, it was coming closer. Eton was not one to back down from a fight, that part of James was still within him and a fire came to his eyes. \"You want a fight, then?\" he asked, angry. \"Bring it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a renewed sense of energy surged into his body and he swung his wings downward, not only shooting him into the air but throwing dust at his unknown attacker. He heard a feminine cough and threw himself at the sound, hoping to knock whoever it was off balance. Only to his surprise, a hand caught his shoulder and gently pushed him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This exercise is over.\" she said calmly. \"You're pretty good for your age\" she continued, a hint of a french accent in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton looked up at the woman annoyed but froze, taken back by her beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.webtraj.com/img/valkyrie-profile-2-silmeria-ps2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.webtraj.com/img/valkyrie-prof...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Notes: Her hair is a dark black and her armor is dark blue instead of purple)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who.....who are you?\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled at him. She wasn't that much taller than Eton. Only about 5'2 in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Etoile, and I'm an instructor from Titania.

Karis grew a bit concerned for Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok? Do you not want to talk about it?\" she asked. Etoile perked up and smiled at Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. It's just that, even now, it's so surprising how everything happened to me\" said Etoile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go outside to a table and talk about it. I'm sure both Eton and myself are curious as to how another human got here\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're right. Let's leave here first\" said Etoile. With that, the group of 5 left the hall, going to one of many resting tables outside, made for people to just sit down and talk or have lunch together. Once they found a table, they eagerly waited for Etoile's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you're already aware, I was born in France about 50 years ago. My name than was Astrid. I was born into a wealthy family who had a mansion and everything. I certainly would have had a charmed life\" said Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would have?\" asked Eton. Etoile closed her eyes and frowned at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born with a very frail constitution. Even daily activities were difficult for me. I would always end up sick and back in bed. I never got to go to school or make friends with anyone. I wasn't expected to live very long as well. It was only a matter of time before I passed on\" said Etoile, to the shock of all present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sad\" said Lea, sniffling a bit at Etoile's story. She smiled softly and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was about 5 years old when I sensed something bad in my room. I didn't know until later that it was a demon going after me. Luckily, a valkyrie saved me. Her name was Kleio and she was from Titania. However, after she conquered the demon, she was badly injured. I realized that I was the only one who could see her and she was too injured to make it back. So, despite my health, I allowed her to stay with me. I fed her some of my food from dinner and allowed her to sleep in my room until she was better. She was surprised to see a human so caring for a being with wings\" said Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Ewol, noticing how everything seemed to connect back to demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She noticed that I was always looking out at the stars at night. I always hoped that a shooting star would come. I wished that I could be better. That I could have friends and live a life like everyone else. She was surprised to hear that I had been doing that for at least 3 years\" said Etoile with a small giggle. Karis sniffled a bit at how sad Etoile's story was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened?\" asked Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the inevitable eventually happened. A few months after my fifth birthday, my condition got worse. I was on my deathbed, just laying there for death to come. On the night that I knew would be my last, I thanked Kleio for her company, as I never had someone to talk to, not even my own parents. However, Kleio had other ideas. She wanted to thank me for nursing her back to health and wanted to give me a better life. So, she rebirthed me into her daughter. Like with you, my remains stayed behind for my family to bury. She named Etoile, which is french for 'star', after how I wished on one for so long\" said Etoile, her story nearing it's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, what a story. Maybe the demon attacking you was a blessing in disguise then. If it hadn't attacked you, you might never have met Kleio and would be dead by now\" said Ewol, getting a nod from Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my weakness then became my strength. Suddenly, instead of being a frail human, I now had more stamina than the average female Misterian. I want to teach others to defend themselves so I became an instructor. And the rest is history\" finished Etoile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After hearing Etoile's story, Eton lowered his head in thought. He wanted to become stronger than he was right now. Etoile had gone through so much as a human and found strength in her new life. He wanted to do the same to protect his new friends and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Etoile!\" he cried out, getting everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you instruct me as well?\" he asked, getting some surprised looks from Lea and Karis. Ewol smirked, as if he had suspected such a thing to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" asked Etoile. Despite her words, a small smile graced her lips. She had a good idea as to why he would ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was too weak to really protect Myrrh when she was attacked. That was pretty much the queen saving her instead of me. I want to become stronger than that. I should at least learn how to better protect myself\" stated Eton. Etoile's smile got wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you might say something like that. I think I'll take you up on your request\" said Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Eton, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, really. Unfortuntely, I am tied up for a while. How about we start next Monday and we can go from there?\" asked Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine\" saiod Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. Well, it's been fun, friends. Now, I have to get some work done of my own. Au revior!\" she said in her native tongue, taking her leave as she left the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, that was unexpected\" said Karis with a matter-of-fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured that it would be best for me to learn some defense. I don't want to mess up again\" said Eton. Lea shyly smiled in admiration of Eton's resolve, something Karis noticed and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have a fan now\" said Karis, getting Lea's attention and flustering her again. Karis laughed at Lea's expense, the boys not getting the reason why. It's not like they needed to know anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's good for you to learn how to use a weapon\" said Ewol in support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you all know how to wied a weapon as well?\" asked Eton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with the bow and arrow but that's it so far. I still need much practice at it. Of course, I imagine that you haven't been taught how to even use a slingshot yet, right? You should learn that first\" said Ewol. Eton nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, got it. Anyway, what abpout you two?\" asked Eton to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm adapt with a sword so far. I prefer not to use a shield as it requires a different style. My magic is getting good enough to compensate anyway\" said Karis. Lea mumbled something but nothing could be understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lea doesn't wield anything. She's too clumsy to use a weapon\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not clumsy!\" Lea retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I wear boots on my hands\" said Ewol in response, getting everyone to laugh while Lea blushed again, her wings continuing to turn a bright pink in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'd like to get in the practice I wanted to get in\" said Karis as she started to walk back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in. We can get you started with having a blade in your hands\" said Ewol with excitement. Eton agreed to that. It sounded fun. With that in mind, the group entered the Training Hall again but Karis directed them into another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'Demon Room' wasn't where we wanted to go. The 'Fight Room' is where we wanted to go. That's where we czn train against others, without the threat of demons around\" stated Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's what happened\" understood Eton. The four of them took a left turn and went into a much lighter room where some other kids and adults were training in any which way. It was pretty grand and reminded Eton of a gym back on Earth. Then, Karis picked up a couple of training swords and tossed one to Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for a lesson?\" asked Karis with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know, you're going to get a lot of bruises from her. Have fun\" said Ewol as he and Lea watched from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh crud'</i> thought Eton. He knew he was in for it when Karis started charging at him.</span></div></div>",

It went without saying that Eton got beat up pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, enjoy your first day?\" asked Myrrh as she walked into Eton's room. It was the first time she had seen him since dropping him off at school. Needless to say, Eton just glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no thanks to you dropping me off like that\" he said, a little spitefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll get over it. You got to meet some friends today right?\" asked Myrrh with a smile. Eton frowned but answered her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told her about meeting Ewol and Karis, as well as finding Lea. He told her about the school day, about how it was often boring with the lessons on demons and such like that. The astronomy part was interesting but that was it. Then, there was the Training Hall and the meeting with Etoile. Myrrh smiled as Eton told her about his request for her to train him as well as Karis' beatdown of him in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun. Glad you made new friends\" said Myrrh, a bright smile on her face. Eton blushed a bit and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's great. I'll stil wait to wait a week until Etoile can start with me\" said Eton. Then, Myrrh started smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lea, Karis, and Etoile right? So who do you think is the cutest?\" asked Myrrh, making Eton blush like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just answer\" said Myrrrh, and Eton knew he wasn't getting out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Etoile is more mature and kind of feels like an older sister. Karis is graceful and tomboyish, which has a certain charm. Guess she's like a pal. Lea is soft-spoken and friendly, kind of like a younger sister\" Eton told her. Myrrh kept smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder if you'll still feel that way years from now\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Eton glared at her. He still had 22 years of human experience to go back on in situations like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing\" said Myrrh, trying to wave it off. Eton was stil ticked with her but he decided to let it drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope my family is still doing well\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably won't know how they'll get out of this for a while so we'll have to wait. Now, let's have dinner\" said Myrrh, trying to usher him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I especially hope my siblings are ok'</i> thought Eton as he walked out to have dinner with his mother.</span></div></div>",

Myrrh had dropped him off as usual and left, leaving him with Lea, who was waiting there for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone ignored me yesterday. They won't this time\" said Eton with a sigh. Lea's face became filled with worry as she gently touched Eton's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok. I-I'll be there with you\" she said, trying to make hm feel better, but she stuttured as she said it. To her surprise, Eton laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lea. It's nice to have you around\" Eton said, making a massive blush appear on Lea's fair-skinned face. She looked down in embaressment and mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's go\" said Eton, as he walked off and Lea followed him. Waiting at the entrance was Ewol and Karis, ready to start the day as well. Karis giggled at the bruises Eton still had that she inflicted on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, if it isn't the new kid\" said a young male voice. The group turned to find that most of the kids were looking at them now. The boy approached them. The boy had short blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conan, what are you doing here?\" asked Ewol, crossing his arms as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much reason. Just curious about the new kid here. We didn't do much yesterday. However, it's time for a chat\" said Conan, walking up to Eton's face. \"Hmm, you don't look like much. You sure you're the one who saved the princess?\" said Conan, with a bit of arrogance in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is,Conan. The transformation just made him like this\" said Karis, trying to defend him. Conan smirked and lightly pushed Eton's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so? Well, just so you know, it's kind of embaressing for a Misterian to be at least 10 years of age and not able to fly on his own\" said Conan with a smirk, his group snickering behind him. Eton was a little mad at this guy, but someone else unexpectedly came up to his rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leave him alone, Conan!\" squeaked out Lea, to most people's surprise. Conan smirked again at Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, little Miss Gloomy is actually defending someone. Didn't know you could actually talk that loud\" sneered Conan, making Lea's face drop down in nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't we give him a real welcome instead of one of yours, Conan\" said a strawberry-blonde haired boy from the crowd. His clothes were light blue in color mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own business, Hal!\" shouted Conan, annoyed at him for interrupting. However, another spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you pick on someone else for a chage?\" aksed a young girl with braided brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Darcy?\" asked Conan to Darcy. His fists were balled up in frustration. \"Fine, whatever. Let's go. Class will start soon\" said Conan, him and his group leaving through the hallway.</span></div></div>",

He respectfully extended his hand and Eton met him for a nice handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome. My name is Hallvurdar, but please call me Hal\" said the boy. Eton smiled as he finally met a nice person at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to meet you. I'm Eton\" said Eton with equal respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the prince now? Maybe we should show more respect\" wondered Hal. Eton immediately shot that down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I don't need anyone standing on ceremony with me. Just treat me normally\" requested Eton. Hal smiled and brought his hands back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough for me. How about we head back to the classroom now?\" he suggested, to everyone's agreement. They all started walking together, ignoring the continued muttering of the fellow kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I understand what humans go through\" said Hal as they had a pleasant conversation. \"Actually, I lived among them for a while\" he continued, getting surprised looks from the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I never heard of that\" said Karis, genuinely shocked for perhaps the first time. Lea was surprised too but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I fell to Earth during a training lesson when I was 4 years old. I was found, loved, and protected by a human family. I was so young that I had actually forgotton where I came from, but they genuinely cared for me. They even hid the fact that I had wings from everyone else. They even tried searching for my real home. Eventually, when I was 9, my grandfather, another human who helped me, flew me through the skies and approached Skyaira. However, he suffered a heart attack and dies before the Valyries and Archangels could save me and him\" said Hal, giving a short version of his past. This surprised everyone once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he must have been a wonderful man\" said Lea, finally speaking up. Hal nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was. He's the only human to be buried on Misterian soil. I haven't seen the human family who raised me since, but they know I'm safe. I do plan to see them again sometime\" said Hal, a little longing in his voice for those kind people. Eton smiled and gently placed a hand on Hal's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. You'll see them again soon. We can even go with you if you'd like\" said eton. Everyone with him nodded in agreement, making Hal smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I didn't think you'd be so kind to someone that you'd just met\" said Hal with some surprise in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good person, I can tell. It's easy to get to know someone like that\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is. Well, story time aside, shall we?\" suggested Hal to everyone's agreement. They kept walking until they reached the familiar room from the previous day and slowly made their way inside. Once they did, a young girl with waist-length red hair and bright hazell eyes jumped in front of the group. Her clothes consisted of a red and gold top with a white clasp on her left shoulder. She wore a skort that was a little different from the others. The skirt part was just as long, red in color with some frills on it. The leggins underneath were shorter and showed more of her legs but still covered her well enough. On her feet were red aubrun sandals that stopped at her ankles. Her figured was small and slim but with a certain charm to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wow, she's cute'</i> thought Eton. Hearing his thought, Lea felt a pang of jealousy while Ewol and Hal nervously smiled, as if they had seen this before. Karis was holding in giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello new guy! I'm Runa! Pleased to meet you!\" yelled the girl as she extended a hand and Eton shaked it. The girl, Runa, winked at Eton after that, making him blush. Hal couldn't take it anymore after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runi, stop it. We know you and your sister like to do this, but you're freaking him out. Leave the flirting to Runa\" said Hal. Eton gasped and looked at 'Runa'. She smiled and her body slowly changed into a male form. The changes changed to a male style with the gold parts becoming black and the markings on the top changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You caught me. Yoou don't miss a beat don't you?\" asked Runi. Eton was still too stunned to talk at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Can't you take it easy on the new guy?\" asked Karis. Runi just chuckled. soon enough, a girl that looked just like what Runi looked like showed up and gave a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Runa. Sorry if my brother freaked you out there. He's pretty good at mimicing me isn't he? Of course, I'm just as good as he is with his form\" said Runa, making Runi laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What is up with these people?'</i> thought Eton as he sighed.</span></div></div>",

They have a special magic between them which they can use to swap eachother's looks and gender. They use this to play pranks on everyone, especially the teacher\" said Hal, to the smirking faces of the mentioned twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's the sum of it. Sorry if I overdid it on the flirting though. Your expression was priceless!\" said Runi, still cracking up over how Eton was so convinced that he was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" said Eton, not really in the mood to extend this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we having a pleasant conversation here?\" asked a female voice from behind them. It was a woman that was dressed rather well and carried an air of authority, as one would expect from a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom\" said Hal to the teacher, who was in fact his mother Trinity. She looked a lot like Hal himself, except obviously being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. Trinity\" said Karis, respectfully. Trinity smiled and looked at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've met Runi and Runa. Did he prank you with appearing as his sister?\" asked Trinity. Eton didn't respond but his face told the whole story, making Trinity smile but shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't let it get to you. They've fooled many\" she said before walking to the front of the class, the twins smirking at her accusations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there's more to magic than I thought\" said Eton. Ewol came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's plenty of uses for magic, and certainly many uniqye kinds. You've only scratched the surface\" said Ewol, making Eton sigh at whatever wierdness he would encounter next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We'll take it easy around you. We just like to see people's reaction when they find out for the first time\" said Runa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" said Eton before Trinity started calling everyone, as class was ready to begin for the day.</span></div></div>",

There was one thing about the human world at the moment that deeply worried her. Eton's human sister: Nicole. Not many knew of who Nicole really was: a fallen Misterian child who fell to Earth during an accident. Minerva had long confirmed that Nicole was indeed the child that disappeared those many years ago when Eton told her the story of how his family adopted Nicole. She remembered a few days earlier, when Nicole's angel mother, Pallas, was informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'4 Days Earler'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me, your highness?\" asked a young girl who entered the chambers. Despite a very teenage-like appearance, his woman was Pallas, a centuries-old Misterian who was going through a rough time. Her mate had succombed to injuries from a demon attack, and her young daughter was lost to the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Pallas. Please come in. I have something that I need to tell you\" said Minerva as she motioned for Pallas to come closer. Pallas acknowledged and walked closer to the queen, who was looking at some kind of crystal ball. Then, she continued, \"After hearing Eton's story about his family, I've been observing them. I think one person you will find most interesting\". After she said that, Pallas' face became that of confusion. Then, an image appeared, showing the Walker family at home at the moment. When the ball focused on Nicole, Pallas' eyes widened in shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aria?! Is that my little girl?!\" Pallas almost screamed. Minerva motioned for her to calm down a bit, but nodded. Pallas' eyes watered in joy at the thought that her dear daughter was alive, something she didn't believe was possible after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Present Time'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Minerva watched with worry over Nicole. She had told Pallas that they would need to wait to see if anything could be done to bring Aria back. However, what worried her was Nicole's condition. Starting with her nightmare after James' death, Nicole's health seemed to have gotten worse. The bad dreams plauged her almost every night, and her face always seemed to be a ghostly pale. However, that wasn't the worse part. The dreama were starting to affect Nicole's sanity. In contrast to the bright and cheerly girl she usually was, she had become much more irritable, and caused disturbances in her Kindergarten class. Nobody wanted to be around her now, some even began to theorize that she was begin possessed by some fell force. Minerva knew that James' death, as well as his transformation into a Misterian, was traumatizing the poor girl's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessages from Keme, a Misterian woman who was disguiesed as a policewoman in Los Angeles, gave her regular updates on Nicole and the family as a whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This cannot go on. Nicole could end up commiting suicide is this keeps up\" said Minerva as she kept observing. Something had to be done. Without another thought, she sent a mental message to Pallas, requiring her presence immediately. It only took a few minutes for Pallas to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called, my queen?\" asked Pallas in her usual politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. We have things to discuss regarding your daughter\" said Minerva, causing Pallas' face to pale. She almost broke down crying as she saw what Nicole was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please my queen! Let's bring her back as soon as possible. Here, we can properly treat her and she can see her brother again!\" pleaded Pallas, ever egaer to be reunited with her daughter. Minerva shook her head sadly however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would not be wise at the moment. What Nicole, or Aria, needs is not that. We need to help her mental instability, not further it by bringing her to a world she doesn not recognize. She can continue living down there, but we do need to do something to calm her down. The poor girl is bordering on insanity\" said Minerva, causing Pallas to become more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Pallas. Minerva thought for a minute, wondering what to do. Then, her eyes widened as a light bulb went off in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pallas, I have a proposal for you\" </span></div></div>",

He clashed swords with Etolie as she giggled at his efforts. \"You are showing some improvement, young Eton.\" she said, smiling. she then hit him on the rear with the flat side of her sword, causing him to yelp. \"You still need to watch your left side, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton moaned then gave a slight grin before waving Etolie forward. She returned his grin then suddenly threw her sword at him, something he did not expect. Eton screamed and threw his sword up to block it. The two swords made contact and he managed to knock it to the side. It was not until then, Eton realized that throwing the sword was a distraction as the flat side of a smaller blade made painful contact with his rear from behind. \"Never take your eyes off an opponent, no matter what they do.\" instructed Etolie, seriously. \"Demons are full of tricks and they will use them all to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" said Eton, shaking. \"Here's mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, he swung his foot around, tripping Etolie with the intention of taking her by surprise only Etolie brought out her wings and used them to push herself back on balance and pushed Eton in return, causing him to stumble a little. \"That might have worked against a Gaian.\" she said. \"However, we Misterians have wings we can use to keep ourselves balanced in any fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaian?\" asked Eton, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtolie sighed. \"They are a race of barbaric shape shifting beings from another world.\" she explained. \"They live in their spacecrafts deep under the ocean.\" she gave a low chuckle. \"They are not exactly the friendly type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" said Eton, slowly. \"Are they our allies, our enemies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither.\" replied Etolie. \"We leave them in peace they leave us in peace.\" she paused, looking at me. \"There are other races on this world, other than human. Care to learn more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been quite an ordeal, going through Etoile's training session. She was no slouch, that was for sure! She was more effective than his gym teachers back on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me\" said a small female voice. Eton looked to the side to see a young female Misterian staring at him. It was Pallas, not that he knew that though, not having met her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Eton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Pallas. I'm a good friend of Queen Minerva and one of the teachers at the school. It's a pleasure to finally meet the boy who saved the princess\" said Pallas with a grateful smile, making Eton blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was nothing\" said Eton, trying to dismiss it. This made Pallas giggle. Eton then took a good look at the girl. She looked very small for a grown-up Misterian. Eton knew that she had to be centuries-old but she didn't look any older than a high school sophmore, maybe even a freshman. Apparently, Pallas had some idea of what he was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm aware of my rather young appearance, even for my age. That's what happens when you stop aging after reaching adulthood. You get stuck at however you looked\" explained Pallas. Eton nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you here?\" asked Eton. Pallas' face went a little red and she fidgeting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can you tell me more of your sister, Nicole? Like, what kind of girl has she become?\" asked Pallas, to Eton's surprise. Eton imagined that she heard of Nicole from Minerva, but why was she interested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask? It's not like you personally know her or anything, right?\" asked Eton,making Pallas figet a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....um....that is...well\" mumbled Pallas, unable to form a coherent sentence, making Eton wonder if she was alright. Soon enough, she straightned her words up. \"Well, sometimes, rebirthed Misterians suffer some memeory lapses so I wanted to make sure that you didn't forget anything about your human life. Also, Minerva told me about what you said about her and I'm curious\" stated Pallas. Eton still couldn't grasp why she would care, but he didn't see any harm in telling her. He figured that Pallas looked trustworthy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no harm in telling you. She's a great kid\" said Eton. Pallas instantly felt more relieved and gently smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I would always play with her the most when we had spare time. She's really gentle but not afraid to stand up for somebody. Sometimes, she had stood up in defense of others when they're being bullied. Unfortunately, she would always end up in the nurse's office when she did that, but she won't stop doing it. She's pretty much your regular tomboy, wanting to do things like wrestling in the house, or tossing a ball around outside. I think she actually wants to join a sport when she grows up more\" explained Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPallas felt calmness in her heart for the first time in a while. Despite not being able to be there for Nicole, she was happy to hear Nicole was still living a peaceful life and was growing into a kind-hearted young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, young prince\" said Pallas, as she turned around and flew off in the direction of the castle. Eton couldn't help but notice how bright her wings were as she left, as if she was feeling a very strong emotion at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it could be\" wondered Eton to himself.</span></div></div>",

Well, not that anything here was 'ordinary', just that... the sensation it invoked in him was <i>numbing</i>.  And worst still, it was <i>spreading</i> to the rest of his limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Etolie!\" He called out anxiously.  \"Something...\"  Bright lavender tinted his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis instructor was faster than ever.  One second she was gliding above him, and the next, she had swooped into the shadows, like a hawk after its prey, closing in for the kill.  <i>What was she doing?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, Karis!\" Etolie exclaimed with shock.  \"What...\" she trailed off.  \"By the black blood of the Demons!  What are you doing with a Male bow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologise,\" was all Karis replied calmly.  \"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shot that, did you now?\" Etolie demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was by mistake, Etolie,\" Karis explained quietly. \"It was an intended prank.  It was not supposed to hit Eton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton found the numbness in him slowly wearing off.  Finally.  That was creepy.  Gingerly, he made his way towards the conversing pair, wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis!\" Etolie shook her head in disapproval.  \"Those arrows cause paralysis!  They are dangerous!  Tell me, where did you obtain that from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton looked from one person to another, puzzling over the so-called dangerous arrows.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eton,\" Etolie finally acknowledged him gently.  \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than ever.  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Etolie and Karis heaved an apparent sigh of relief, before Karis's wings turned a shade of pink.  Though her face kept up the 'cool' facade, she obviously was embarrassed.  Those burning purple eyes of hers had suddenly turned downcast as well.  Okay, this was suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... Karis?\" Eton asked, concerned.  \"You're the one that looks far from alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Karis hesitated.  \"I took Conan's bow and arrows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took?\" Etolie asked, her voice gentler now.  \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris shrugged, he purple eyes calmer now.  \"He always acts like a jerk,\" she reasoned.  \"He was boasting over his new set of bow and arrows.  And then he went around threatening to shoot the lot of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Eton asked, definitely shocked now.  \"How can he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtolie shook her head,  \"No, he cannot.  It is against the laws for one Misterian to lay hands on the other.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris was clearly upset, but she didn't look anything but composed.  \"He. Was. Acting. Like. A. Jerk,\" Karis stated.  \"So what if he is the son of a great Archangel?  I am too!  And you know what? He gets a Misterian-made bow, and what do I get, nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is extraordinary for him to possess such a thing. He really shouldn't have it until his coming of age. It is customary for males to get one at that age\" Etolie explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And females?\" Karis asked collectedly, but with traces of contempt.  \"I am by far a better fighter than him!  I trained more than him as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton had to agree with Karis. She was most convincing. And it sounded more than reasonable. Conan was nothing than a great bully, while Karis was the true warrior here, female or not. She had trained hard for it, and was definitely more deserving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Karis,\" Eton said. \"Conan doesn't deserve even half an arrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris shot him a wane smile, before looking back to Etolie seriously.  \"See?\" she pointed out, her wings turning crimson red.  \"Conan is an undeserving-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis, Eton,\" Etolie cut in with a sigh.  \"Perhaps you are right, but the bow and arrows still rightly belong to Conan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Karis agreed rationally.  \"I mean to take this back to him, after teaching him a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtolie smiled at this.  \"Good.  Once you are done,\" she gestured towards Karis and Eton.  \"I have a surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton clearly understood what Etolie was getting at, and so did Karis.  Of course, to comfort them, she was planning on presenting a weapon to them.  Or at least he thought she was.  Etolie was their fighting instructor after all.  What better sort of present was there than a weapon?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered what sort of weapon it could be then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris lips tugged upwards at this piece of news, before she stood to her feet quickly, with the bow still at hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let it be a Mysterian sword,\" she said, her purple eyes ablazed with excitement.  \"I would be most overjoyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, be overjoyed,\"  Etolie replied, a smile forming over her attractive features.  \"Because yes, it is a sword.  Either feathered or metallic. Up to you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris's wings turned white with pure happiness, while Etolie began to wonder what a 'feathered' one meant.  Surely, the sword could not be made out of feathers right? What good would it do to have a feathered sword?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading Eton's mind, both Karis and Etolie laughed outright, their wings both turning different hues of the same colours.  Eton only stood there, blushing with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Karis explained between laughter.  \"a 'feathered' swords means the sword was created from an adult male's features.  They are truly amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An adult male's...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Etolie agreed.  \"Male wings contain a hardening agent- which explains why they are stronger than steel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... wow,\" Eton murmured in awe.  \"That is so... <i>cool</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtolie nodded, still smiling.  \"Technically, you are still too young to wield a weapon, but I, as instructor have seen you fight, and I must say, you are not bad.  So, I will allow you to choose a sword which would probably last you another hundred full-rots.  Do choose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Etolie,\" Karis and Eton said gratefully, before Karis spread her pure white wings and took off with the bow, eager to return it to Connan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all truly amazing, but Eton wondered what sort of sword to choose: Metal or 'feathered'?  He had a feeling that it was going to make a difference some day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last few days had taken a huge toll on the young girl's mind. Her face was as pale as ever and she looked very sickly. However, the biggest difference was her behavior. The poor girl's sanity had taken a huge hit. Nowadays, she almost claimed that she could see wierd visions and see people that weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, most people had taken to staying away from her since the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got up and did her usual routine, taking her bath, and putting her clothes on. Today, she wore a violet t-shirt that was covered under a blue zip-up sweater. Other than that, she wore normal blue jeans and white and grey shoes. When she was done with that, she walked downstairs, barely speaking any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Walker family was greatly concerned for her. It was hard enough with James' passing, and now Nicole was acting out of character. They did take her for a doctor's appointment but it yielded no results. No one knew what was wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, morning Nicole\" said Trevor, trying to cheer her up. Nicole almost glared at him and he shuddered back. Their mom and dad looked on sadly at the scene. There weren't many more words shared that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after breakfast, Nicole walked with Trevor to the bus stop and waited there. As stated before, most of the students now didn't really talk to Nicole, afraid that she might lash out at them or start seeing wierd visions or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat by herself on the bus, oblivious to the mutterings around her. She didn't care. All she thought about was her confusing thoughts. Her head still felt as dark as it was last week and not getting any better. The darkness was driving her crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why is this happening? Why does nothing make sense anymore? All the things I'm seeing make no sense'</i> thought Nicole, not knowing how things would change soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Nicole was sitting in her Kindergarten classroom. The classmates continued to mutter about her. Eventually, the teacher came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you all. Today, I'd like to introduce a new student\" said the teacher. More mutterins overcame the classroom. Nicole found herself wondering why there would be a new student at this time of the semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a little quiet so please give her a warm welcome. You can come in\" said the teacher. In walked a girl about Nicole's age. She walked in and looked the classmates, allowing them to observe her. She had waist-length brown hair that was partially covered by a green and white baseball hat that she wore normally. She wore a pale green t-shirt with light brown shorts that went to just above her knees. On her feet, she wore simple grey sneakers and white socks. What seemed to catch Nicole's attention however, were her green eyes, which seemed to be somewhat similar to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. My name is Paula Wilson\" said the girl in a soft voice.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't a very apparent movement, but Nicole had been alert enough to notice that glance.  The girl was studying her...  Studying her?  That was creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a miracle happened.  Paula looked up, gazed into Nicole's green eyes, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile... melted Nicole.  It was smile which offered so many things at one go.  Friendship.  Solace.  Help.  Happiness.  And... Love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Nicole did something she hadn't done in a long time.

Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She knew her name!</i> Nicole thought.  <i>How did that girl know..?</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as though reading Nicole's thoughts, the girl giggled abruptly.  \"I have known you for a..  very long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gaped.  So now the girl could read her thoughts as well!  What couldn't she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Known... me?\" Nicole asked, freaked out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grinned sheepishly.  \"No, I mean- what was I saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you've known me for a very long time!\" Nicole accused playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...

Oh nevermind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought?\" Paula pressed on curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I thought this was another nightmare</i>, Nicole thought to herself.  <i>With scary winged people all around.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Paula said gently, scaring Nicole once more.  \"This is reality.  It is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Paula was very... strange at times.  It almost seemed as if Paula could read Nicole's mind.  She could reach to the roots of her fear and comfort her somehow.  But Nicole didn't mind.  Paula had cheered her up.  She had been the first person to coax her into laughing this week.  She had driven the darkness away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, Nicole felt alive once more.  She felt... herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the same time, amid that happiness, she felt an urge to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello Paula</i>, Nicole thought, half hoping for a reply.  <i>Can you hear me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.  Some sort of hesitation.  Some sort of uncertainty.  <i>Yes, Nicole, I can.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole couldn't believe her ears!  So they could talk... in their mind?  Wow!  That was amazing!  Both girls stared at each other for a long moment, before Nicole broke into a grin once more.  She had made up her mind.  She had made up her mind about Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Paula? </i>Nicole called out hopefully.  <i>Will you be my friend <b>forever</b>?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForever, meant <i>forever</i>.  It sounded simple, but it a great promise.  A promise to stay by her side for all eternity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula's eyes widened at the word 'Forever'.  After all, how could Paula, a true Misterian remain on Earth forever?  Yes, Nicole was her daughter.  But if that was the case, shouldn't she be telling her the truth?  Shouldn't both of them be heading back to their true domain and living happily ever after?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nicole may not want that...  How should Paula reply?</span></div></div>",

Paula sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I've only been on Earth for a little while and my presence may be making her feel worse. Her mind seemed so clouded and it's as if there are many walls surrounding it. As much as I'm glad to finally see her, I don't know if Minerva thought this out'</i> thought Paula. In reality, the girl was Pallas, disguised as a young human girl thanks to Minerva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<i>A couple days earlier***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that I should go down there and help Aria?\" asked Pallas. Minerva had explained her proposal. It was for Minerva to use her royal magic to turn Pallas into a 6-year old human girl. She would still have a little magic with her, and thus still be part-Misterian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel that, with your presence, you may be able to calm Aria down and clear her mind. Besides, this way, you can finally meet your daughter after so many years\" explained Minerva. Pallas loved the idea, although she was still anxious about all this. She'd have to come up with a backstory and fit in with humans, something she had never done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you better get studying on humans then\" smirked Minerva after reading Pallas' thoughts, making her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Present Day***</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really has grown though\" muttered Paula with a smile, glad to see that Nicole was at least somewhat healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Paula, you can use the empty seat next to Nicole\" said the teacher. Paula thanked him and walked to the back of the class. As she walked, both she and Nicole heard the class mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look like sisters\" said a random student, making both girls blush. Soon enough, Paula sat down in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Paula. Then again, I guess you already know that, right?\" said Paula, giving a small laugh as she did. It was nice and sweet as befitted her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" said Nicole and she left it at that, making Paula sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'This might be harder than I thought. However, I can't let her down. How can I call myself her mother if I don't?'</i> thought Paula, trying to keep her spirits up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a couple of days since Eton's training with Etoile had started. He was becoming more adept using the sword, although he still had much to learn. It was hard for him to embrace the fact that it would probably take years for him to perfect the sword and shield style Etoile was teaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is tiring\" he said after drying himself with a towel. He had just finished another session with her. Etoile was giggling a few feet from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one that used to be 22 years old, you are quite childish\" said Etoile, continuing to giggle. Eton's wings flushed pink as his face did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just my new age affecting me. I'm just a bit more like how I was as a kid\" said Eton, defending himself. Etoile continued to smile sweetly at him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course\" she said. Suddenly, a visitor approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Eton. Still going at it?\" asked Karis, approaching the area where they were resting. Karis had taken a huge interest in Eton's training, wondering how far he would go. Everyone wondered weather Eton would consider becoming an Archangel if he got good enough. Internally, it was something Karis hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just finished for today\" said Etoile. Karis came over and they began having some small conversation. Eventually, Ewol and Lea joined along, having been searching for Eton to talk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Eton, I'd say that we're done for today. Keep working on what I've show you, ok?\" she requested, getting a nod from Eton. She smiled again before flying off, getting back to other things she needed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you're always getting quite a workout thanks to her, huh?\" asked Ewol, giving Eton a small pat on the back. Eton nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's hard work but I think it'll be worth it\" said Eton. As Eton continued to dry himself off, Ewol broke off to talk with Lea for a bit. However, Eton and Karis could overhear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you hear the rumors of what's happening under the ocean?\" asked Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that supposedly there's a new princess in the Kingdom of Olympia? It's said that she was a rebirthed human but no one knows for sure. Aquarian news doesn't travel well up here\" said Ewol, getting a nod from Lea. Eton looked confused as he listened on. What's an Aquarian?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys, what's an Aquarian?\" asked Eton. Karis looked over to him as the group rejoined together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, you haven't been told much of the other races, right?\" asked Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think Etoile told me a bit of this race called Gaians, but that's it\" said Eton. Karis nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, she told you to stay away from them. Those guys are bad news all around. Anyway, Aquarians are merpeople\" said Karis, causing Eton's eyes to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merpeople?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, half-fish and everything\" confirmed Ewol. Then he continued, \"They have their own cities in the ocean and have their own barriers like us. They also possess their own telepathy. We're not on good terms with them though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't quite see eye-to-eye regarding humans. We Misterians like humans. We think they're interesting and fun to watch\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you guys pitied them\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too. Mostly because they're young and unevolved. Also, they don't get to experience the freedom of flight like us. Other than that, we don't have a problem with humans, despite their pollution issues. Luckily, that doesn't hurt us much. Our skin offers stronger sun protection so the burning of the Ozone layer isn't a huge problem\" explained Karis. Eton was surprised to hear most of that, although the pollution part didn't surprise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Aquarians?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Aquarians don't like humans nearly as much as we do. They often persecute them because they don't like how they often trash the oceans\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good reason\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but they could do more to help instead of simply hating humans. Aqurians are a little more old-fashioned than us as well. They preserve their old traditions, since they're even older than the Greeks. We tend to go more with the flow, adapting new customs every now and then. That's why we don't see eye-to-eye on this. We're not at war or anything like that. However, don't expect a warm welcome if you decide to go there\" explained Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's quite a story\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, because we care more about the humans, the Aquarians often put is in the same breath as them. They think of humans as \"young and child-like\" and they refer to us in the same way because of how we are sympathetic with them. It's insulting and they don't take us very seriously because of it. Our two races are almost similar in age!\" continued Karis, almost becoming a rant. Eton believed every word of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I don't recommend you go near an Aquarian. Besides, we don't really like swimming\" said Ewol. Eton instantly agreed with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I agree with. Even though I lived by the ocean, I can't swim. I'm too afraid of the water to do so\" said Eton. Then, Lea finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I think it might be fun to learn how to swim sometime\" she said with her usual small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it'll happen\" said Ewol, leaving that there are endless possibilities.</span></div></div>",

He still needed a little help with mobility and such, but he could now fly short distances with no help. However, Myrrh was currently helping him fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting much better\" said Myrrh, with a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Myrrh\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you really should start calling me \"Mother\" or something like that\" Myrrh lightly scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might not happen\" said Eton with a smirk, which in turn made Myrrh smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, might be best. Being called \"Mother\" might make me sound old anyway\" said Myrrh, which made both of them laugh. Then, Eton got to a question that had been nagging him for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Myrrh, what is a Gaian really? Etoile told me a little but I want to know more\" he asked. Myrrh's smile fell and she sighed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. They are not of this world like we are\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Eton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are from another world. Supposedly, they ended up destroying their own world by accident and came to this one. They live under the ground in the oceans\" explained Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they do to their world?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They destroyed it, kind of like how humans currently treat the world. They strived for power and prosperity but it destroyed their world\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, they're a barbaric race. Their goal now is to oppress humans. They believe humans are destroying their world like they did to their own and they're trying to \"stop\" them. However, their vision of that is harsh and they won't stop until all humans are dead\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible. Since when did they become the authority on how to run a world?\" said Eton with slight anger. Everything about this race seemed to anger him in some way. Myrrh nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Not only that, they have their own way of rebirthing someone. It's called \"Absorption\". It's not a painless experience like how you rebrith someone into a Misterian or Aquarian. Their methods are more brutal. They almost literally tear the skin of your body before scaly skin reforms over it. It's said to be a pain like nothing else\" said Myrrh with a small bit of fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even worse! Thanks for telling me this. Now I know what to do if I ever come across one\" said Eton. Myrrh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad that you understand. Guess I'm doing a good job of teaching you\" said Myrrh, proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll get the ultimate grounding from Minerva if you don't, so you better keep it up\" said Eton with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, you little brat!\" said Myrrh, although her giggling gave away her true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and son laughed their way to the Sky Castle, eager for their awaiting dinner.</span></div></div>",

She had attempted to get through to Nicole on several occassions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****4 Days Earlier (Monday)*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep trying to stay with me?\" asked Nicole. The two of them were sitting together at a lunch table. Nicole had only known Paula for a few hours and she knew that the girl wouldn't leave her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to talk to you. I'm sorry if I seem so...effusive. I just don't have any friends of my own\" said Paula, trying to sell her backstory to Nicole and gain her trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me? If you want a friend, go find someone else. I shouldn't be anyone's friend\" said Nicole. Paula's heart almost broke at such words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this because of your brother's death?\" asked Paula. Nicole looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know that?\" asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I heard it from one of our classmates. I know what it feels like\" said Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. How can anyone possibly understand what I'm going through\" said Nicole with slight anger in her voice. Paula was even getting a little angry herself. She really needed to get through to the confused girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm the same way. My big brother died in a car accident. Not only that, my little sister went missing years ago. My family was torn apart because of it\" said Paula, stunning Nicole. It wasn't entirely false. Paula/Pallas had lost her husband years ago and her only daughter (Nicole) fell from Skyaira as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I see\" said Nicole, still stunned to hear that the new student had endured heartbreak of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End Flashback*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Paula had gone to the apartment that she rented with a fellow Misterian, posing as a mother and daughter. The woman was Irene, who was a servant in the castle and was happy to assist the queen as well as Pallas. Pauls noted to Irene that Nicole had unknowingly placed many mental barriers around her fragile mind in defense. Breaking them wouldn't be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****2 Days Earlier (Wednesday)*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't talk much with Paula on Tuesday. She was likely still digesting the information Pauls told her about her \"life\". Paula could tell that Nicole's fragile state wasn't handling it well, and it worried her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, are you ok? You haven't spoken much\" said Paula, as they were settling into class for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Just doing a lot of thinking\" said Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" said Paula, sighing that she wasn't making much progress. Then, Nicole surprised her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry that I insulted you like that\" said Nicole, a small smile appearing on her face. Paula smiled as well. Nicole finally showed a small piece of who she really was. However, it would still take more time for Paula to break through the barriers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End Flashback*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to all this, Paula was finding the human world to be very interesting. She had no problems in class due to her already knowing the answers to such easy questions. Luckily, she was quite a good actress, and could try to struggle with some questions (which she would get right anyway). She found playing sports to be quite fun during recess. She particularly enjoyed soccer, which was a sport Nicole also played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Depending on how long I stay, maybe I could join her'</i> thought Paula, thinking of anything to reach Nicole's inner mind. Another idea had come to her. She had her magic still, and she was thinking of using it to slowly heal Nicole. Nicole had told Paula of the \"bone spurs\" on her shoulder blades, which Paula knew were where her wings used to be. Paula wasn't sure if they would ever heal properly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to try to get to her\" muttered Paula to herself, as Nicole sat in her own seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" she said, still a bit emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" replied Paula. It was time to set her plan in motion.</span></div></div>",

After all, Paula had no intention of scaring Nicole by revealing her Misterian powers.  That wouldn't help one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost physical injuries required physical contact for healing to prevail.  But mind you, mental injuries were <i>far</i> different.  They were a trillion times harder to heal.  Yes, physical contact could be still used.  But using physical contact would mean blowing her cover as an innocent girl.  So physical contact was pretty much out of the question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Paula was left with <i>words</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor healing mental injuries, one had to lace their words with healing magic - so that the words could penetrate the wall of isolation which the victim had built around their fragile minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier said than done.  You had to <i>mean</i> the words you sprout.  <i>Every</i> last one of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula had tried it on Nicole three times during Math, five times during English, and four times during play time.  She was utterly drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nicole</i>,\" Paula had repeated gently - lacing her words with healing magic.  \"<i>I'm your friend.  If you need help, feel free to turn to me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Nicole had replied, tone rather dead.  Had she returned to her previous self?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You can tell me anything</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Nicole had said shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't seem to be helping one bit.  The only thing it seemed to be doing, was <i>killing </i>the <i>already dead</i> Nicole.  Paula wondered how long it would take to come into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day, Paula tried it over and over again.  It was tedious work.  It required concentration... and passion.  She had both, but still, the results remained fruitless.  To get her healing degree in Skyaira, Paula had to pass the 'Healing Test' which included Mental Healing!  Man, why couldn't she even heal her own daughter then?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paula,\" Nicole said finally one day.  \"I don't understand why... why you're still trying so hard to help me...  You keep comforting me, but... I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm your friend</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are, you...  I don't understand why!\" Nicole said, shaking her head over and over again, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I've been through the same thing, I understand you</i>,\" Paula whispered soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's lower lip trembled.  \"Maybe you do... But you can't help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But I will always be there for you</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stared through her.  And for the first time, the corners of her lips twitched upwards.  A slight motion, which only Misterian eyes could catch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Nicole said soflty, before turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey</i>,\" Paula had took her hand once more.  \"<i>You know-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Nicole had ordered lightly.  \"I...\" She trailed off, before before breaking from Paula's grip and racing off, uncertainty written on her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least there was a slight emotion present in her voice.  A teeny weeny bit.  But still, it was there.  Somewhere under that emotionless facade of hers, a speck was slowly returning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light in the sea of engulfing darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula didn't know what had happened.  One moment, Nicole had been sitting stoically on the 'roof' of the playground facility, well out of the playful children's way -who were playing a game of catch-, and the next, she had fallen off!   With a thud, Nicole had hit the ground head first, blacking out upon contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of their classmates had paused in the middle of their catching game, a few erupting in screams of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's dead!\" One of them yelled.  \"Dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call Ms Martin!\" The other screamed.  \"Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula's eyed widened before she hurried down beside her daughter and friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Paula called out urgently.  \"Nicole?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she received no reply, Paula got down on all fours before checking out the girl's arms and legs for any serious injuries.  There were a couple of bruises, and a few minor cuts, but other than that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...!\" Paula exclaimed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor on the underside of Nicole's arm, lay a large gaping gash the shape of a monster's mouth.  Oh man!  Nicole must have scraped herself against something sharp on the ground upon falling! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gash was raw, and fresh blood oozed out from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula didn't think twice.  She didn't think of the consequences of performing magic on a human; nor did she think of the punishments she might face.  Instinctively, Paula's fingers had hovered over the open wound as it normally did, before letting her fingertips slowly run over it.  The healing was evident at once.  The blood dried up upon contact, before the wound gradually closed up, leaving a dark scar etched behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScars were unhealable.  Paula left it as it was, before looking down at her unconscious daughter lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I love you</i>,\" Paula said quietly, knowing Nicole was out cold.  \"<i>Always</i>.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to use healing magic this time.  It came naturally.  The words were so strong that it would have broken through Nicole's impenetrable fortress if she'd been conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Martin, following the group of children, quickly arrived at the playground with her handy first aid kit - which probably wasn't necessary anymore.</span></div></div>",

I just want to be her brother and she to be my sister, a family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded, understanding Ewol's concern. \"You are a good brother to her, Ewol.\" he said, making his wings turn a brighter pink. \"I'll talk to her today, maybe I can convince her to be more like a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate that.\" said Ewol. \"I really like that Lea gives me all this attention but I need her to let me in so I can help her when she is sad or afraid or just doesn't know what to do, I want to be her brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, Ewol.\" said Eton. \"I'll talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Eton found Lea at school and unexpectedly pulled her side. \"Eton, what?\" asked Lea, her wings a slight pink and red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk, Lea.\" said Eton, firmly. \"Ewol is hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" asked Lea, her concern rising. \"Who? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, by waiting on him hand and foot.\" you said, causing Lea's wings to turn blue. \"Ewol wants to be there for you when you are sad or scared or hurt but he can't unless you let him in.\" He placed a hand onto Lea's narrow shoulder. \"Ewol wants a sister, not a servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-What can I do?\" asked Lea, sad that she had inadvertently hurt her brother. \"I thought I was being a good sister to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good sister shares her fears, hopes, and dreams with her brother.\" replied Eton. \"Of course, a sister always keeps somethings hidden, just to drive her brother crazy.\" he winked, causing Lea to giggle. \"Tell Ewol how you feel, let him in so he can share his experiences with you and feel as if he is doing his job as your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea, still shaken, slowly nodded. \"I-I'll try.\" she said. \"I can't change who I am, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is asking you to change.\" said Eton, smiling. \"Just... open up a little, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea's wings slowly turned from blue to a white color as she hugged Eton, causing his wings to turn pink. \"Thank you for telling me this, Eton.\" she said. \"I will talk to Ewol as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not now?\" asked Ewol, walking up to them. \"School has been canceled for the day due to a demon sighting. We are all to go home immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eton!?' came Myrrh's voice. \"Eton, where are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here... mom.\" you said, with pink wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh approached and took your hand. \"You've already had one experience with demons.\" she said, firmly. \"I don't want you to have another one so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea, remembering her talk with Eton, turned to Ewol. \"I-I'm scared, Ewol\" she said, true to her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEwol wrapped a protective hand around her waist, happy that she was starting to open up to him. \"Don't worry, I'll get us home fast.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Myrrh whispered to Eton...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go....now\" she said, silently, but urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were a ways from the school, Myrrh turned to Eton again.</span></div></div>",

Upon landing there, they were greeted by Etolie who stood with a tall muscular Misterian man behind her. \"Greetings, Myrrh.\" said Etoile, politely. \"What brings you to the changing pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travel port?\" asked Eton, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile, understanding, giggled. \"I take it you want him to see our watery friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh shook her head. \"Just the portal.\" she replied. \"From what I heard from Minerva, the Aquarians are having issues with the Gaians. Now is not a good time to visit them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \"The princess is correct, I just returned from Aquarian territory, they had found a small Gaian boy who claims to have been banished, they had sent an envoy to confirm the boy's claims when I took the return trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Taurus.\" said Etoile. she turned to Eton. \"This is our current ambassador to the Aquarians, Taurus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an honor to meet you, Taurus.\" said Eton with a slight bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The honor is mine, prince Eton.\" said Taurus. \"If you'd like, I will take you to the portal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh nodded and Taurus led them inside to a massive room with constantly changing images on the walls an ceilings, much like what Eton saw in the palace. Seeing his expression, Myrrh smiled. \"These images you see are what is happening in the three worlds we may visit.\" she explained. \"though we do not like to travel to Gaian territory, we must keep the option open in case we encounter an enemy they are familiar with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" said Eton, quoting a human phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well put, Eton.\" said Etolie, impressed. \"However, the Gaians are not our enemies or our friends. They are merely a people we try to avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, Eton then saw a large round pool with a greenish energy rising from it. Standing around the pool were a number of heavily armed Valkyrie and Archangels, all keeping a sharp eye on the changing images, while keeping an ear towards the pool. \"This is the changing pool.\" said Taurus. \"By merely submerging into its waters, you and your surroundings are changed. The change in body and surroundings all depend upon where you wish to be.\" he then smiled, adding, \"If you do not think of a specific place, the pool sends you at random so do keep your wits about you when to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\" said Eton, eying the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the guards stood at attention as they saw a small boy with scaly skin fall into what looked like another changing pool somewhere else. \"Taurus, we have a visitor coming from Kraken!\" announced one Valkyrie, pointing to an image, frozen on the wall. \"His body is shifting genders as well as species, I can only surmise that this is an accidental visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaurus sighed before letting out a low chuckle. \"It's the boy who thought he had been banished.\" he said. \"He is certainly not having the best of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile giggled. \"Send word to the Gaians, we will return their lost child once his body recovers from the transformation.\" she said. \"The poor boy is going to be in for a surprise when he arrives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I watch?\" asked Eton, wanting to see a Gaian up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Etoile and Myrrh replied \"No.\" before Myrrh lead him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, a very frightened and confused Misterian girl appeared with tears in her eyes. \"Wha-What happened!?\" she asked, hysterical. \"Where am I!?\" she looked down, feeling a draft, and screamed. \"Why am I girl!?\" she then began to cry as she screamed, \"Where are my clothes!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards all stifled a laugh as Etolie approached the girl, smiling. \"Who dares to trespass upon Misterian soil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I guess that would be me.\" said the girl, terrified. \"I'm sorry. My name is Coy, I come from the Gaian city of Kraken.\" gaining some courage, she then asked, Can-Can you send me back, I-I seemed to have lost my gender and clothes on my way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the guards a laugh as Etoile shook her head. \"You will have to wait until your body adjusts to the changes before we can do that, <i>young lady.</i>\" she replied with a giggle. \"If you will follow me, I will find you some appropriate clothing and take you to the queen, she will decide what to do with you until you can be returned home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, Coy took Etoile's hand and allowed her to lead the way out of the strange building. Etoile struggled not to giggle as she heard her inwardly moan, thinking, <i>\"Why me?\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Etoile.\" said Coy, still very nervous and blushing brightly. \"I am sorry to insist but... I'm naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile giggled. \"This way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy followed Etoile into a small room off the main chamber where an assortment of clothing was stored. \"This is where visiting Gaians and Aquarians are given clothing to wear when they visit.\" explained Etoile. \"Normally, we would have the clothing ready for our guest but as your visit was accidental, we had no time to properly prepare for your arrival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy nodded then, as Etoile rummaged through the various garments, looked at herself. She found that her skin was now a tan like color but felt course, almost like sandpaper. She could feel hair just kissing her shoulders and felt it to discover it was soft to the touch. <i>\"I wish there was a mirror around here so I could see what I look like right now.\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, Etoile returned with a pile of clothing, which she placed onto a nearby table then held out a pair of pink panties. She giggled, seeing Coy blushing. \"Never mind the color, no one will see them.\" she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing, Coy took the panties and slipped them on as Etoile then handed him a pair of white skorts, pointing out that they were shorts with a skirt over them. This seemed to make Coy feel slightly more comfortable as she put them on. Etoile then placed a training bra onto Coy, making him blush brightly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All boys and girls your age here wear training bras, <i>young lady.</i>\" she giggled. \"You just need two more pieces and you'll be ready to visit our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile gently placed a simple white toga style top onto Coy, clipping the garment into place over the appropriate left shoulder, then had her slip into a pair of brown sandals before taking a step back to admire her work. \"Very good.\" she said. \"Now then, Coy is not a good name for a pretty girl like yourself, we will have to fashion you with a new name for the duration of your visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy gulped. \"A new name?\" she asked, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just during your stay.\" promised Etoile. \"You will be Coy again when you return home.\" she paused then asked, \"How does the name... Joy sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess.\" replied Coy, wincing. \"Not that I feel much joy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile gave Joy a sad smile. \"Yes, I heard you were having a rough time lately.\" she said. \"Taurus was visiting Olympia when you were there, hours before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy began to sob lightly then paused as she heard a voice in her head. <i>\"You poor little thing...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse me?\" she asked, turning to Etoile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, dear.\" replied Etoile, blushing slightly. \"We must be off, by now word of your accidental visit has reached the palace, I must bring all visitors before our queen, Minerva.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy shuddered. \"Am I in trouble?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile turned to Joy, surprised but remembered to block her thoughts from being received as she then laughed sweetly. \"No, you're not in trouble.\" she said, gently, assuring her. \"She just likes to meet all those who visit, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy gave her fist smile. \"Oh, well then I want to meet her too.\" she said, a sense of pride in her eyes. \"Maybe I can show her that my people aren't so bad and we can be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile smiled, amused by Joy's innocence. \"Anything is possible, Joy.\" she replied. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nodded then followed Etoile out of the building to the edge of the floating island. There was a certain awe in her eyes as she saw all the other floating continents in the distance. \"Your world is amazing!\" she said, looking around. \"When does the first shuttle come?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile laughed, her wings turning white. \"We have no need for such things.\" she said, still laughing. \"We wings, we can fly... so can you, if you try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy immediately panicked. \"I-I can't fly!\" she protested, not yet discovering her wings. \"If-If I jump off of this floating island, I-I'll fall for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile again laughed. \"What do you call these then?\" she asked, gently running her hand over Joy's feathered wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy laughed, as Etoile ticked her feathers and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Woah!\" yelled Joy as Etoile's tickling of her wings caused her to lose her balance. Unfortunately, they were standing at the edge of the small landmass so....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAH!!!!!\" screamed Joy as she began plummeting through the sky and towards the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe I should have planned that out better\" said Etoile, nochalantly. She was just about to fly down and rescue the poor girl. However, just as she was about to, she caught something, or rather someone, flying towards Joy. Etoile was confused as to who it was at first. However, her sharper eyes soon caught who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Eton!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****A few minutes earlier******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, catch you later today. We've got some chores around the house\" said Lea. She, Karis, and Ewol had met Eton a little later after the \"demon attack\" drill and talked for a bit. Eton was still a bit dissappointed that he couldn't see what happened in the portal room. He expressed that to his friends, who sympathsized with him. However, Ewol and Lea now had some chores to get done before the weekend started (it was Friday today).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later\" said Eton as he watched Lea pull Ewol away. He smiled to himself. Lea was going to try and be a better sister to Ewol, although he was unsure how she would handle it. He could hope that she didn't go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what?\" asked Eton to himself. Myrrh was away on errands so he was on his own. Luckily, he could fly much better now, so he could get from place to place. He was still far from perfect though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a scream from a nearby landmass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he asked himself as he turned the attention towards the noise. His hearing was improved as a Misterian, so that's how he heard it. He ran aways until he spotted a small figure falling from the landmass. Eton figured that it was another young Misterian getting a flight lesson for the first time. However, it struck him as odd that the figure seemed to be similarly sized to him. Also, that figure that screaming and was making very little effort to fly. He couldn't tell if it was male or female, but the scream sounded feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! She's not flying at all! Should I...\" Eton wondered to himself. Should he interfere? Maybe this was the lesson that the girl needed to learn. However, Eton didn't want to wait until it was too late to save the girl. His chivalrous nature hadn't changed at all despite his rebirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! No more waiting!\" yelled Eton as he ran towards the edge of the mass he was standing on and jumped off, allowing himself to glide on the wind. Eton had gotton gliding down, it was just trying to fly independent of the wind that he was still slightly working on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew across the ravine, approaching the frightening figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back to Present*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, guess I'll let him handle it. He seems commited enough\" said Etoile with a smile. Who was she to deny Eton his chance to be a hero again? It seemed to come naturally to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Joy was still screaming as she felt the wind pass her. She was almost at the barrier now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I can't look'</i> thought Joy as she kept her eyes covered. She braced herself for impacting the earthly ground....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she felt herself land in something soft softer, somthing that apparently talked, as she heard it groan after she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Omph, this girl could stand to lose a few pounds!'</i> She didn't know if it was her savior who said that. It didn't really sound like talking, more like something from his mind. In any case, she instantly became angered with the man and lashed out with her left hand, still with her eyes closed. Apparently, the smack she heard ignicated a direct hit on her savior's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What did I do?!\" yelled the figure. Joy didn't answer, as she was still too frightened to watch and kept her hands on her eyes. Suddenly, the figure's grip seemed to become softer, and she heard a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. Open your eyes. You're not going anywhere\" said a calm voice that sent a chill down Joy's spine. She almost felt...warm...on the inside.  Pushing that aside for now, she slowly moved her fingers from her eyes, allowing her to look upon her savior. As we all know, it was a young brown-haired Misterian, wearing typical clothing. She also noticed a red mark on his right cheek, indicating where she hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone other Eton himself, holding her in a bridal style. </span></div></div>",

Part of her couldn't believe what she just thought. Luckily for her, Eton was too focused on the girl he was carrying to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl he carried was rather small, probably around his age. Despite that, she did have some muscle, probably more so than Karis or Lea. Her skin was tanned and really rough, which Eton found wierd but payed no mind to it. Other than that, she was dressed casually. However, Eton did notice her blue and brown eyes. This surprised him but he decided to wait on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite a fall. You alright?\" asked Eton with a smile. Joy struggled to get the blush on her face under control as she instinctively tried to get away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you might not want to let go of me if your flying is that bad\" said Eton. Joy stopped, knowing that he as right. Reacting to it, she put her arms around Eton so she wouldn't fall again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you...take me back up?\" she asked softly. Eton smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not\" said Eton as he tightened his grip and flew her back up. It was a little harder with the extra weight, not to mention that he hadn't prefected it yet, but he was able to manage. He eventually reached Etoile on the ledge and set the girl down gently. Etoile immediately noticed the red mark on Eton's check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" she asked, a hint of knowing what happened in her voice. Eton just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not say\" said Eton, making both he and Joy blush, their wings turning bright pink. This was something Joy hadn't noticed yet about her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, but I figured that he would rescue you. I'm sure you've thanked him, right?\" said Etoile. Joy blushed again and slowly turned towards Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....thank you...for rescuing me\" she said, a small hint of a smile on her face. Eton smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. What kind of prince would I be if I didn't help you\" he laughed, which got a surprised reaction from Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Prince?\" she asked with a bit of shock and fear in her voice. Etoile grinned and got into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You got saved by Prince Eton of Skyaira. You should be grateful\" said Etoile, getting a surprised look from Eton. However, it didn't compare to the shock on Joy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! Oh, I'm sorry for troubling you!\" she said, bowing slightly. Eton laughed sheepishly but straightened her out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, no need to do that kind of stuff. I just like to help\" said Eton. Joy then finally gave a true smile, the first since she had been transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile looked between the two and came up with an idea.</span></div></div>",

This little lesson was just so you can glide with me as I guide you to the palace.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to Eton. \"Do you think you can fly there on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded. \"I can manage\" he replied, his wings turning slightly pink. \"Will Joy be staying with us long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too soon to tell, Eton\" said Etoile with a sigh. \"Time will tell until we get her someplace to stay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile did not want to worry Joy or Eton that she sensed that Joy's body showed warning signs that it may be locking into her new form. She had to get her to the palace so she could be examined by the healers. She turned back to Joy and offered her hand. \"Shall we?\" she asked. \"I promise you won't fall this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nervously took Etoile's hand and she led her to the edge and jumped off with her. Joy screamed but then began to giggle as she remembered to spread her wings, causing her to glide through the air with Etoile helping her along. Eton followed close behind, remembering his own first lesson in flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an odd girl\" Eton mumbled to himself, smiling all the same. He had forgotton mostly about the Gaian that was said to have come through. However, even if he remembered that bit, he wouldn't have pegged Joy as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton smiled again, seeing the look of wonder on Joy's face as she looked at all the sights that blew himself away on his first day as a Misterian. It took all he had not to laugh out loud at some of her comments along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's so open and uncrowded\" stated Joy, in awe. \"Is.. Is that a forest? Wow, I never saw one in person before... Oh! a lake and a waterfall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile giggled. \"You're enjoying this, aren't you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" she replied, still looking about. \"I never saw such things where I came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton thought about Joy's words. As he noticed her odd eyes, he figured that she must have been re-birthed as well. He figured that she must have been far inland or something to that nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful!\" said Joy, tearing up. \"I bet you can play hide and seek in there for weeks and not get bored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile laughed with me following. \"I never thought of it that way.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside her quarters, Minerva frowned at a video screen as she talked to an image of a Gaian man, named Moro. \"If what you are saying is true, Moro, that this machine is still experimental, I can not guarantee your 'daughter's' safe return back the way she came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped Moro's lips. \"Please contact me the instant you know for certain\" he said. \"I must report this the the tribunal... worse, to my mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva sighed as well. \"Good luck to you, Moro.\" she said. \"I promise your child will be well cared for during her stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she severed the link and slid a wall hanging over the video screen. The communication link she had with Kraken was used for emergencies only and only known to her. <i>\"This is turning out to be quite a year for the records.\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the wall images announced Etoile's arrival with Eton and Joy. She sighed, seeing that I had already met her and ordered a guard to allow them in....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing the rumbling sound of the stone doors opening, Joy gasped and took Eton's hand without thinking. Eton blushed, seeing Etoile smile but smiled back as he remembered how nervous he was, seeing queen Minerva for the first time. \"Please enter.\" came Minerva's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay.\" whispered Eton, carefully. \"My grandmother won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nodded, though she seemed unconvinced as Eton then escorted her inside as Etoile led the way. The doors closed behind them with a low rumble and slight thud, causing Joy to jump slightly. \"You have nothing to fear, child.\" said Minerva, standing before her. \"You are very safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva, Eton noticed, had donned the same royal garments she had worn when meeting him for the first time and guessed it was necessary attire for meeting family and honored guests. \"I-I'm sorry I ca-came with-without warning, you-your highness.\" stammered Joy, bowing before Minerva. \"I me-mean no harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva looked at joy for a moment then giggled. <i>\"Who would have thought a Gaian child was so full of innocence?\"</i> she thought, privately, so not to be heard. then she said, \"Relax, Joy, I know and understand that your visit was accidental, you are not in trouble, I merely wished to meet you.\" she paused then asked, \"What do you think of Skyaira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your world is amazing, your highness.\" said Joy, raising her head, smiling. \"I have seen wonders that only exist in pictures where I'm from.\" She was careful not to fully state where she was from. She knew that Minerva and Etoile knew who she was. However, Eton didn't, and Joy was no fool to how Gaians were portrayed. There was no doubt in her mind that Eton would hate her if he knew she was actually a Gaian. She didn't want to lose his friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva smiled as she motioned for a woman to step forward from further in the room. \"I am glad you are enjoying your visit thus far.\" she said. \"I would like to have this woman take a look at you, see that you are in good health, will you allow her to approach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Joy nodded and the woman stepped forward, placing a light hand onto Joy's head. doing so, she stared deeply into her eyes. Joy remained perfectly still, confused but somewhat awed by the woman's sea colored eyes. Seconds later, the woman took her hand away and stepped back before turning to Minerva who's wings turned slightly blue as she shook her head. \"I will need to confirm this with the others, to be certain.\" said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report to me the moment you have your answer.\" said Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman bowed and left, deeper into the room from where she had come. Joy, confused by this, turned to Minerva who sensed her question. \"It's just a quick medical examination.\" she said, lightly. \"We do things a little differently here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" said Joy, still curious. \"So what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could give you a few flying lessons.\" offered Eton. \"I'm not the best but I'm willing to help.\" he then smiled. \"After that, maybe I can take you to the market to look around, it would be my first time there as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smiled but inside, she was uncertain. <i>\"Oh no... Is he asking me out on a date!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton still wasn't skilled with mind reading yet, so Joy's thoughts did not reach him. However, Minerva and Etoile caught them, sending them into giggle fits. Eton and Joy looked at them confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh my, has my grandson captured your heart already? I didn't expect him to do it so quickly'</i>' thought Minerva, channeling it in a way that only Etoile and Joy heard them. Only a truely experienced Misterian could pull of that kind of trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wh-What?! How did you....'</i> thought Joy, her thoughts still flowing through the connection between Etoile and Minerva. Minerva grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Things are different here. We are telepathic as well. So, you might want to watch what you think. You don't want the whole city to know that Prince Eton has an admirer, correct?'</i> thought Minerva, causing Etoile to giggle again and Joy to invent a new shade of red on her face. Eton looked between them, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys mentally talking without me?\" he asked with slight irritation. Etoile then controlled her giggles enough to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just some girl talk\" said Etoile. Eton sighed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I probably wouldn't want to hear it anyway\" he said, making Joy sigh with relief that he wouldn't push it further. Etoile and Minerva smiled at each other. What a development this was. What effect could these two have on each other?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to take some getting used to.\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva and Etoile talked to Joy and Eton for a few more minutes before Minerva told them it was time to leave....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, how are you feeling?\" asked Eton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton and Joy had walked out of the Sky Castle and were on a ledge on the main landmass, as Eton had been able to glide them there. Joy had remembered how much fun it was to fly last time but she knew that mastering flight wouldn't be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I guess\" said Joy, still apprehensive. Two things seemed to plague Joy's mind. One, of course, was learning to fly, as there was nothing but a long way to the surface if something went wrong. The other was her odd feelings towards Eton. Could she really have a crush on him? She had only been a girl for a few hours! It frustrated her, and Eton noticed the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you're ok. You've been acting even wierder since the meeting\" said Eton. Joy perked up at this and glared at Eton, making him flinch a bit. Her face was quite scary when she was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wierd? Is that all you think of me? Like when you called me fat?!\" Joy almost yelled. Eton was confused at that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? First off, no, I don't think you're always wierd. Second, when did I ever call you fat?\" asked Eton. Joy's face went red as she huffed and cross her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you caught me as I was falling, I heard you say that I could stand to lose a few pounds. That's why I slapped you\" she said indignantly. It felt odd to her to be this concerned about her weight, something that never crossed her mind when she was a male Gaian. Eton, on the other hand, was briefly confused. However, his eyes widened as he came to the conclusion that she must have read his mind by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that! No, I wasn't calling you fat. You're just....\" Eton started, getting a very good look at Joy. Joy was certainly interesting, compared to other Misterians. Her tanned skin was a huge contrast to the mostly white skin of most Misterians. Also, despite the fact that her overall frame was a bit smaller than Eton's, she had some good muscle on her body. No wonder that slap still somewhat stung Eton's cheek. You could possibly make the argument that she had more muscle than Eton at this point, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m what?\" asked Joy, her eyes squinting at him, making him nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a bit heavy. However, I guess it's just because you're so well built. You must have been quite the athlete before you were rebirthed. I apologize if I offended you\" said Eton, very politely. Joy's face gave a small blush as her anger settled down, and she softly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right. I shouldn't let that get to me anyway\" she said. Eton smiled at her as well, glad to have that settled. \"So, the lesson?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Well, let's get started. You remember how you felt before right?\" asked Eton. Joy nodded and Eton went through more pointers about flying that Myrrh taught him. Joy had a pretty good memory as she was able to keep up with every thing he said, nodding every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it? Well, let's try it out\" said Eton, awaiting Joy to attempt takeoff. Joy was still apprehensive about it, but she had faith in Eton to help her if she needed it. She smiled at that and tried to imagine her wings taking flight. As if commanded, her wings began to flap, slowly lifting off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, keep at it!\" said Eton in encouragement. Joy kept it up and keep rising off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so bad...Woah, woah!\" yelled Joy as her concentration broke. That was something she would need to work on to sustain prolonged flight. However, she didn't have the experience to know how to recover and started falling back to the ground. Eton ran over and positioned himself to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you!\" he yelled as Joy fell right on top of him. It wasn't exactly a clean landing, and Eton fell right on his back, making his wings ache a bit. This was precisely the reason why Misterians didn't sleep on beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't the thing that immediately caught Eton's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why does my head feel hard to lift? And why can't I breathe?'</i> thought Eton before he finally focused his eyes forward. However, his eyes widened as they looked straight into a bright pair of blue and brown eyes that were as shocked as his own, with a pair of lips smashed against his own lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a total coincidence. Joy's fail, and Eton's ungraceful catch, had positioned them in such a way that their lips happened to smash against each other on the way down. A truly eventfull, and odd, way for both Eton and Joy to experience their first kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't going to be leaving their memories anytime soon, given what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Wow, what a sight!\" yelled a male voice, that sounded as filled with laughter as humanly possible. Eton and Joy immediately separated from each other, blushes still evident on their faces. They looked off the ledge to see none other than Ewol clutching his ribs and rolling around in middair, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Of all people, why did he have to see it?'</i> wondered Eton with a sigh, as Ewol controlled himself briefly and landed next to them. He still couldn't help chuckling though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Eton! I knew you wouldn't be able to ignore the grace and majesty of Misterian women, but I didn't think it would happen this quickly! Well done dude!\" he yelled, giving Eton a pat on the back for a \"good job\" so to speak. Eton sighed again. Ewol then turned to Joy, who was more than a little scared at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, new girl, that you're pretty lucky. To kiss the prince of our fair kingdom must be a wonderful experience\" said Ewol, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...\" stammered Joy, unable to find any words. Ewol continued chuckling and wrapped his arms around both of their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for the both of you. Just remember than you can't mate until you come of age. Anything prior is extremely frowned upon\" said Ewol, almost seriously. This time, all color drained from Eton and Joy's faces at what Ewol was insinuating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewol, there's no time for that!\" said Eton, trying to stop this conversation. Ewol just raised a hand chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you've got more things to teach the new girl. Best of luck to you both. Now, sir and ma'am, if you'll excuse me\" said Ewol, as he flipped into the air and flew off, leaving a couple of confused Misterians as to what just happened.</span></div></div>",

It took them several minutes to reach the landmass holding the market. However, on the way there, Joy was smiling, looking at the many wonders Skyaira had to offer. She was breathtaken by the natural purity of the air, the lush green forests and beautiful landscapes. Only her smile flattened as they reached the market, figuring by then, word had spread that the young prince had found a possible love interest. Both Eton and Joy blushed as a concerned Lea approached them first. \"I heard from Ewol that you two were spotted on the ground kissing.\" she said, almost accusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An accidental kiss.\" said Eton, blushing brightly with Joy. \"She's just learning to fly and she fell on top of me, trying to land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea's eyes widened as she visualized the incident then giggled. \"That must have been a shock to you both.\" she said, grinning. \"I wish I was there to witness it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton sighed and Lea placed a hand onto his shoulder. Seeing this, Joy felt a twinge of jealousy but didn't know why. \"Ewol is known to slightly exaggerate the facts when is comes to things he witnesses.\" said Lea. \"You and your friend will be often questioned but few will come to their own conclusions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea then turned to Joy. \"I see by your eyes that you were also rebirthed. What's your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy's face invented a new shade of red as she bowed her head slightly, her wings giving away her fear and uncertainty. \"I-I'm here by-by accident.\" she replied, nervously. \"It-It's a bit com-complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lea gasped, her wings turning a shade of blue and pink. \"I've heard stories of a human kid being mistaken for a Misterian visiting Earth.\" she said with an air of surprise and sadness. \"She must have been the victim of mistaken identity and rebirthed before anyone caught the error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy, not yet ready to tell the truth, slowly nodded. \"Something like that.\" she said, vainly holding back a few tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea immediately hugged Joy, surprising her. \"Welcome to Skyaira.\" she whispered. \"Want some help shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smiled as Lea released her and nodded. \"I could use all the help and friends I can get.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea giggled, taking Joy's hand. \"We can help Eton with his fashion while we shop for yours.\" she said, pulling her along. \"I'll show you that our world is a wonderful place to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, that's a switch, she's usually so shy.\"</i> thought Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught that.\" said Lea, causing Eton to blush and Joy to giggle. \"You're the one who told me to open up more, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, I did.\" said Eton, shyly smiling as he followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea giggled with Joy. \"Boys...\" they said in unison before giggling more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lea escorted Joy into the market area, she wondered why she made a statement about boys when she used to be one herself. However, remembering that others could pick up on her thoughts, decided not to dwell on it. The market place, Eton noticed, looked much like a flea market on Earth with all of the booths open to the outside with only an awning protecting their products should it rain. There were nearly endless booths, all selling anything from food to clothing to weapons and more. \"I could spend all day, just looking around.\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close, Eton.\" called Lea. \"As a prince, you can have all our purchases charged to the palace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Myrrh would like that.\" said Eton, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" said Myrrh, walking up behind him. \"I was told of your new friend's arrival by queen Minerva. Help her all you can but have her back at the palace before sunset, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton nodded then ran to catch up with Lea and Joy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Joy was looking all around, wide eyed with wonder, at the dozens of open areas with carts and tables, all filled with items for sale. She wanted to run ahead and explore, if only to see all that the market had to offer. fortunately, Myrrh had a firm grip on her hand. she giggled, sensing her eagerness. \"Easy, little one.\" she said, gently. \"We have plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton was a little more controlled, having the mind of an adult but the kid in him had been peeking out more and more the passed few days and he felt the same urge to run about and explore. Myrrh, knowing this, had a firm grip on his hand as well. She smiled, happy to see her new son rediscovering his childhood and laughed as she felt him trying to move ahead to explore. \"there is a lot to see in each shop, Eton.' she told him. \"Don't be in such a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea, although mostly shy, pointed out a few of the shops as they passed them, telling Joy and Eton what they had sold there. \"That's a scent shop.' she said, turning to Joy. \"They sell fragrances for both boys an girls to make them smell nice.\" she smiled. \"Certain scents have a calming effect on one and others while other scents are used to attract a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they get the idea, Lea.\" said Myrrh as both Eton and Joy blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that shop?' asked Joy, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a clothing shop.\" replied Myrrh. \"Would you like to start there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy eagerly nodded and the four walked into that area where they were greeted by a young woman who politely smiled at them. \"Princess Myrrh, it's an honor to see you in my shop.\" she said, with a bow. \"You as well, prince Eton. I am Faith, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Joy, a visitor to our world.\" said Myrrh, nodding to the smiling girl, holding her hand. \"Due to some unforeseen problems, she will be staying with us for a while and needs a wardrobe. Also, my son, Eton needs more clothing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaith looked at Joy and smiled, though she was concerned by her rough skin. \"I will be happy to help you.\" she said. \"What of your other friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just along for moral support.\" replied Lea, her wings turning slightly pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you see something you like, let me know.' said Myrrh. \"I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLea smiled, shyly. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Faith and Lea helped Joy try on a number of outfits, including a black leotard with a matching skirt and a red sash. It was the closet to what she had worn as a boy in Kraken, it made her smile. \"I like this outfit.\" she said. \"The black shoes are a nice touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you.\" said Lea, smiling. \"Only that is a dance outfit, not really used for everyday wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy pouted but became curious as Lea then showed her a flattering white dress that seemed to shimmer in the light. \"Try this next, okay?' she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's no place for my wings.\" protested Joy. \"How would I wear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it on.\" Faith urged lightly. \"You might be surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Joy stepped behind the changing blind and slipped into the dress. To her surprise and delight, her wigs moved right through the fabric as if it were not there and fit her perfectly! Looking at her reflection on her side of the blind, Joy smiled then stepped out, showing off her new look. Eton's jaw dropped, seeing how beautiful she looked while Lea and Myrrh smiled. \"Well,, we have Eton's approval.\" said Myrrh, giggling. \"How do you like the dress, Joy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" said joy, smiling. \"Only, how can it fit without any room for my wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's made of enchanted cloth.' giggled Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fabric is a little more expensive than normal cloth but it gives girls a more grown up look.\" said Myrrh. \"Women have energy wings, they go right through any cloth material. The enchanted cloth gives girls that experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy smiled. \"I'll wear this today.\" she said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh smiled as they then moved on to pushing Eton to try on some clothing as well. while Eton and Joy were busy at the market, Minerva finished speaking to the healers who reported their findings from Joy's medical examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" demanded Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman stepped forward. \"Queen Minerva, we fear that Joy's form is quickly locking, meaning she will be trapped as Misterian girl for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have before her form locks Completely?\" asked Minerva, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shook her head and replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might just be too late\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had just taken the initiative of using small magic to try and heal Nicole. It surprised Paula to see Nicoles mind be the dartk maelstrom that it was. With that in mind, she had taken small magic in her hands and gently rubbed Nicole's back, saying that she was just trying to calm her down and that it was something she read out of a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Paula's happiness, Nicole showed some improvement over the next hour, smiling a bit more and having fun with her new friend. However, it didn't last for too long, so Paula repeated it a few more times over the day. She knew that she was pushing the limits Minerva gave her when she sent her to the surface, but she eagerly wanted Nicole healed. As she did this, she noticed two lumps on Nicole's back where her wings were supposed to be. Nicole explained that they were bone spurs from when she was in an accident as a baby. That's what her doctor said anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, something else grabbed Paula's attention. The magic flowing through Nicole's body seemed to be spiraling rapidly, and Nicole almost seemed sick to her stomach once after one of Paula's sessions. Paula had began to worry if her healing was negatively affecting Nicole's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole claimed that she was fine. Paula didn't believe her though. In that moment, she asked Nicole if she wanted to come over to her house sometime. Nicole said that she would talk to her parents about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Nicole called Paula and said that they were ok with Paula and her \"mother\" coming over to pick Nicole up to go to her house. This was, of course, after the parents did speak a bit with the Misterian woman who was posing as Paula's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Current Day*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this will work?\" asked Paula to Irene, her \"mother\". Irene shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see, won't we?\" she replied simply. Paula didn't say another word after that. The two arrived in their car and walked up to the Wilson home. Irene rang the doorbell and waited for someone to come. When the door opened, it was not Nicole or the parents, but rather her brother, Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is...\" he started before his eyes landed on Paula. Trevor's cheeks redddened as his mouth dropped slightly as he looked at Paula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wow, she's cute'</i> thought Trevor before shaking his head. Luckily, Paula wasn't listening to mental thoughts at the moment. However, Irene was and giggled slightly at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, may we come in?\" asked Irene. Trevor nodded and let them in, closing the door behind them. Soon enough, Nicole came up and walked to Paula, wondering what they would do at her house. The parents said their hellos as well and wished them to have a good day. Howver, their mother caught Trevor looking at Paula with a look she remembered from when she and her husband were little kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Trevor, would you like to go with them?\" suggested their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Trevor. Irene then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm sure Paula would like to get to know Nicole's brother as well\" said Irene. Paula was a little disturbed at this change of events but she went with it anyway.</span></div></div>",

She remembered them going out to the market but that was quite a while ago, they would be back by now. Then, she wondered if Joy might have gone to Myrrh's chambers as she had formed a friendship with Eton. <i>\"That boy certainly has a way of finding women.\"</i> giggling, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try there first, Etoile walked through the maze of halls to Myrrh's chambers and touched the call stone. It was a small half stone on the wall, that, when touched, sends a cheerful tone into the room, indicating there was a visitor outside. Etoile remembered Eton calling it a 'door bell'. It was a quaint name to her mind and she pondered over using it. Then Myrrh answered the door and looked at her surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Etoile.\" she said, happily. \"What brings you to my chambers?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somber news, I'm afraid.\" replied Etoile. \"Is Joy with you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are taking a nap.' replied Myrrh, her face and wings showing concern. \"Why, what is this somber news you bring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must tell Joy in person.\" replied Etoile, firmly. \"It concerns her fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh's wings turned completely blue. \"She's not...\" she began. \"Her parents...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile shook her head. \"Her transformation is locking and there is nothing we can do to stop it.\" she whispered. \"Sending her home the way she came would mean certain death.\" she gulped as her own wings turned blue. \"Joy is an orphan among us as she was transformed, not rebirthed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so unfortunate\" whispered Myrrh, her face downcast as she said that. \"Please enter, I'll take you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile walked into Myrrh's chambers with her heart in her throat as she greatly disliked delivering sad or troubling news. Only, upon entering Eton's sleep quarters, the two saw Joy giving Eton a kiss on the lips as he slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Etoile, more than a bit surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*****A few minutes ago******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Myrrh or Etoile, as they spoke, Joy had been awake for a while, watching Eton sleep on his love seat like bed. She could almost hear her own heart beating as she thought about their accidental kiss earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-If an accidental kiss felt the way it did to me...\" whispered Joy, \"what would a real kiss feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what she was saying, Joy's wings turned bright pink, as she blushed, turning away from Eton. \"Wha-What am I saying!?\" she whispered to herself. \"This is crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to Eton and felt the same urge to kiss him that she had felt before and wondered if she had not taken advantage of that fall to kiss him in the first place without even knowing it. The thought was frightening but she was raised to believe anything is possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I kiss him and he wakes up, how would he react?\" asked Joy to herself. \"Would he embrace the kiss or push me away in rejection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only ten years old, Coy was nervous about kissing any girl. Only, now that she is a girl, she feels more nervous about kissing a guy and nearly left the sleeping quarters all together. However, the urges were getting stronger and Joy somehow knew she would go crazy if she did not discover the answer to the question that was plaguing her. What would a real kiss feel like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May-Maybe if I'm gentle, he won't even feel it.\" whispered Joy, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wings still a bright pink, Joy approached Eton and carefully placed a light kiss onto his lips. The energy she got from that little peck, gave her goosebumps and she nearly giggled out loud. Only she stopped herself and, without thinking, kissed Eton again, unaware the Myrrh and Etoile had entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Present Time*****</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she's exploring her femininity\" said Myrrh, just as susrprised, but holding back a small laugh. Then, both of their attentions went to the two young angels as Eton started to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Eton opened his eyes and was surprised to see Joy, again, kissing him on the lips. Only this time, it was not an accident and, for some strange reason, he liked it and began to sleepily kiss back. This brought forth a surge of magic power, which only Myrrh and Etoile could sesne as Joy's wings turned a bright white, showing her extreme happiness. Myrrh smiled, seeing Joy's rough skin turn soft and smooth but it was a sad smile as she also sensed Joy's new form locking. She was now a Misterian girl for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for interrupting this touching scene.\" said Etoile, causing both Eton and Joy to break the kiss, blushing. \"I have some rather unpleasant news for our visitor, Joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of news?\" asked Eton. Etoile first turned to Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, you need to go, Eton. This needs to be private\" said Etoile. Eton was kind of confused but he got an assuring smile from Myrrh. He smiled slightly and walked out of the room, looking for something to do while he waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as for you...\" started Etoile, as a slightly worried look graced Joy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... What is it?\" asked Joy, her wings turning a pink and green color. \"Is something wrong with the teleporter?\" she gave a small grin. \"I don't mind staying here a little longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that its not the teleporter, Joy.\" said Etoile, gently. \"Your transformed state has locked itself... permanently.\" she sighed. \"You are a Misterian, now and forever. If we try to send you home the way you came, you will die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy's jaw dropped as if she had been hit with an incredible force as tears slowly overflowed her eyes and ran down her now smooth skin. Her wings turned a bright blue before she fell to her knees, sobbing silently, burying her face into her hands. \"Mommy... Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still your mom and dad.\" said Etoile, knelling down to hug her. \"At least your parents know where you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I to do!?\" wailed joy, through her hands. \"Who will care for me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will care for you.\" said Etoile. \"I lost my family just as suddenly as you had lost yours.\" she knelled down to Joy's level. \"We can set up a link so you can talk to your true parents from time to time. Will you allow me to be your guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Joy did not answer but she had also stopped crying as if the question threw her off guard. Soon, she lowered her hands and looked up at Etoile with questioning eyes. \"You- You're not replacing mommy?\" she asked, confused and frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom is in the city of Kraken.\" corrected Etoile. \"I wish to be your guardian here.\" she then gave Joy a shy smile, blushing slightly. \"However, If you later <i>want</i> to call me 'mommy', I won't argue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy blushed as well as Etoile slowly released her from her hug. \"Where do... we live, Etoile?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile sighed as if she had been holding her breath. \"Like you, I am visiting here from another city.\" she replied. \"But now that I have a child to look after, I just may remain here a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy hugged Etoile, crying slightly as Etoilie gently rocked her in her arms until she fell asleep. \"Welcome to your new home, Joy.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Would she be put in prison for her trespass? Didn't seem likely. However, there was a good possibility that Paula might be stripped of her magic and identity for some time, making her nothing more than a normal human girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula felt conflicted by such a thought.

He had dealt with the Gaians before and knew how to approach them. That and the fact he was the Misterian envoy to Olympia, made him the perfect choice to greet the Gaian envoy. Taurus smiled, seeing the shuttle taking a scenic route over Skyaira, knowing that the new princess of Olympia and a recently absorbed human from Kraken was aboard. \"I guess I can't blame Moro for giving them the grand tour.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the shuttle landed with Moro and the new Gaian emerging first, wearing the odd helmets that allow them to breath freely. Behind them was the new princess of Olympia who immediately rose her hands to shield her eyes from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked the man, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, just letting my eyes adjust.\u201d Slowly stepping out of the shuttle, the princess said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living underwater for the past two weeks, I forgot how bright sunlight can be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my hand, the man said, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sam\u2019s help, the two joined up with Moro as Taurus exited the observation room and approached them. Turning to the door, the princess seemed surprised. he smiled as he heard her say, \u201cHera was right. They do look like angels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaurus fought the urge to chuckle as he reached them, his wings politely tucked behind his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back to Skyaira, Moro.\u201d Extending his hand, he said, \u201cI only wish it were under better circumstances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Taurus.\u201d Gesturing to Sam and Adra, Moro said, \u201cLet me introduce Sam and Adra, Princess of Olympia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter greeting Sam, Taurus turned to Adra. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you, Princess.\u201d Smiling, Taurus said, \u201cI\u2019m the Misterian envoy to Olympia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Adra said, \u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pleasantries were finished, we followed Taurus into the building. \u201cMoro, let me say that I\u2019m terribly sorry for what\u2019s happened to your son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Taurus.\u201d Pausing, Moro said, \u201cIs my\u2026daughter well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems to be adjusting. In fact,\u201d turning to Moro, Taurus said, \u201cI understand she\u2019s developed a friendship with the Crown Prince, Eton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCo-Joy was always one to make friends easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walking through the building, until they stopped outside a closed door. \u201cYour daughter is inside with her guardian Etoile; I\u2019ll give you some privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Turning to Sam and Adra, Moro said, \u201cI\u2019d like for you both to be here; Co-Joy has bonded with both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Adra, Sam said, \u201cOkay Moro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Moro turned and opened the door. We\u2019d no sooner walked inside when I heard an excited voice scream, \u201cDADDY!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the direction of the voice, Adra saw a young girl running towards Moro. As she got closer, Adra recognized the face, realizing that it was Coy. \u201cShe makes a cute girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoy, or Joy as she was now called, looked very different from the young Gaian Adra had met days earlier. Instead of his olive green skin, Joy now had smooth tan skin with a nice head of shoulder length brown hair. To Adra's surprise, it seemed as if she\u2019d gained muscle as well; along with two different colored eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll watched with a sense of happiness and sorrow as Joy jumped into Moro\u2019s arms; her wings wrapping snuggly around her father, shining white.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can you leave me a communication screen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so much for that\" muttered Moro, before smiling as well. \"Very well\" he said. Right after that, Etoile jumped into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me for intruding.\" she said. \"Queen Minerva is ready to speak with you, Moro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro nodded. \"Thank you, Etoile.\" he said, rising to his feet. \"I entrust you to raise Joy as your own.

He had been told to wait here for two other people to arrive. Supposedly, they had once been human like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what they're like\" wondered Eton. He wasn't particularly happy waiting for them. He just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Soon enough, the doors opened and he focused his attention on the guests. As he was told, it was a male Gaian and a female Aquarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wierd'</i> thought Eton, but he kept those thoughts to himself. Tauras, who was also with them, bowed and introduced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrince Eton, may I present Adra from Olympia and Sam from Kraken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d Politely, Eton said, \u201cHave a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, Prince Eton. We were told you were once human.\u201d said the aqurian girl, Adra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct; I was told the same about you two as well.\u201d Pausing, Eton said, \u201cHow about we tell our stories of how we got this way? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d Chuckling, Adra said, \u201cWho wants to go first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Adra, a smirk on his face, Sam said, \u201cLadies first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdra composed herself before starting, \u201cI was originally Paul Thomas; just your typical 22 year old guy. I was a junior in college, dating a girl named Carly Kimble. I\u2019d hoped to marry her after we graduated but she dumped me for another girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch. Tough break\" said Sam, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. \u201cSince it was Spring Break, I rented a beach house on the Keys with some friends. Everyone, including my best friend Andy, thought I could use the time to relax.\u201d she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Adra, Eton said, \u201cIf you were a guy, how\u2019d you end up a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne morning I decided to go for a walk; when I heard a cry for help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to me, Sam said, \u201cA mermaid, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my sister, Hera. She\u2019s always been curious about humans, but this time she got too close to shore and was spotted by some bank robbers.\u201d confirmed Hera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard about that on the radio; right before I left with my father and girlfriend.\u201d Turning to me, Sam said, \u201cPolice said they found the money, but no robbers. They said something about signs of foul play\u2026blood on the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was my blood; I got shot in the stomach after luring the robbers away from Hera.\u201d Pausing Adra continued, \u201cShe used some magic to turn the robbers into a flock of seagulls before taking me to Olympia, where she rebirthed me into who I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Thank god I at least retained my gender'</i> smirked Eton. He was getting better as hiding his thoughts from others, as Adra apparently didn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Sam said, \u201cWow. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve had quite the adventure since then, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Giggling, Adra continued, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn, Sam.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to think ill of Sam, being formerly human and all. However, based on what others had told him about Gaians, he needed to keep his guard up at all times. He still felt like throwing up at times when he heard about their absorption rituals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy real name is Samuel Bane; but everyone calls me Sam.\u201d Yawning, Sam said, \u201cI\u2019m 22 years old and I was a test pilot for my dad\u2019s research company.

Looking at Sam, Adra said, \u201cIs Megan 21 years old, with blue eyes and strawberry blond hair?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe-Yeah.\u201d Surprised, Sam looked at Adra and said, \u201cWhy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know her, Sam; she\u2019s my best friend\u2019s cousin.\u201d Pausing, Adra said, \u201cWhat happened in the trench?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was following the trench wall down, and I accidentally sent a small yacht deeper into the trench.\u201d Frowning, Sam said, \u201cI followed it down; only to discover that it had landed on a mermaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA mermaid?\u201d just then Adra remembered the Gaian\u2019s ability to transmutate. \"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI felt responsible; so I used the torch and grabbing claw to cut away at the mast. While I did that, small cracks started appearing in the windows.\u201d Shivering, Sam said, \u201cI\u2019d just freed her when...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdra started tearing up, imagining what happened next. \u201cYou don't have to go on if it\u2019s hurtful to remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Here comes the waterworks'</i> thought Eton. He was never into this kind of stuff, even when he was 21 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it; I don\u2019t remember what happened. One minute the walls are cracking; then the next thing I know I\u2019m on a table with Valdam looking at me.\u201d Sighing, Sam said, \u201cI was now a Gaian, and I\u2019ve been going non-stop ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d Letting out a low whistle, Adra said, \u201cI thought my transition was tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Sam said, \u201cI would\u2019ve freaked if I\u2019d become a Gaian female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes double for me\" smirked Eton, getting a slightly stern look from Adra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving Sam a mocking hurt look, Adra said, \u201cWhat's wrong with being female?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" waving his hands in defense, Sam replied. \"It's just that..,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Sam.\u201d Giggling, I said, \u201cI'm only joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be more trouble than its worth\" smirked Eton again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to slap you?\" asked a stern Adra, good-heartedly but a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt you can\" retorted Eton.

Eton then said, \u201cI don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe neither.\u201d Whispering, Adra said, \u201cSam, are you sure?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam didn\u2019t answer, as he suddenly stepped back. Looking at him, Eton and Adra shivered as they saw his eyes turn blood red. \u201cLook out!\u201d lunging at an unseen target, Sam yelled, \u201cStay back!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Adra thought Sam was just showing off, throwing punches at the air, until a creature appeared in front of him. It was taller than they were, muscular with reddish skin and black wings. Looking at it, Adra realized it reminded her of the demons from the stories she used to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed in terror as she backed off, with Eton standing in front of me brandishing a small sword that he kept with him. He still wasn't that good with it, having had limited practice with Etoile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to be brave, Eton shouted out, \"Just s-stay behind m-me!\". It was clear though that Eton was somewhat spooked by this encounter. It was the first time since his encounter with those three men that he was facing a real demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Adra was touched by Eton\u2019s bravery; although she wondered if he was a match for the creature. Meanwhile the creature slashed Sam\u2019s arm with a large knife, causing Sam to scream in pain. Adra watched in awe, wishing she still had the strength she'd had as a man, as Sam slammed his fist into the creatures face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this thing ever give up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered as the creature demon roared and started punching Sam with all its might. It occurred to Adra and Eton that the creature was trying to get past Sam to come after Eton and me; but Sam wouldn\u2019t let it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and the creature fought for a few moments; until Sam was able to grab the creature and slam it onto the table. As the creature stood up, they watched as it punched Sam in the jaw; leaving him dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing for Sam\u2019s safety, Adra said, \u201cSam! Get out of there!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam ignored her pleas, striking blow after blow on the creature until it fell unconscious to the floor. Looking at it, wheezing, Sam said, \u201cDo yourself a favor, and stay down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that happened, a trio of guards entered the room. While the others took the creature into custody, one ran over to Adra and Eton and Eton. Eton was exhausted and had fallen to the ground. The look of his face was a mixture of fear and disbelief; fear of what he had just witnessed, and disbelief of how he had basically done nothing but stand there in front of Adra. What was all that training he done for? He had been trying to be stronger to better defend himself and others. Yet, he could do nothing while a complete stranger did all the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you injured!?\u201d asked the guard in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" Eton said, \"Sam defended us but I was ready in case he needed me.\" He tried putting on the bravest face possible but the guard could see what he was truly thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the guard tended to Eton, Adra turned to Sam; only to see him stumble to floor. \u201cSam!?\u201d running over, she grabbed his limp body and yelled, \u201cSam! Sam!!\"</span></div></div>",

That said, as he is not a demon, you could not sense him coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" nodding, Eton said. \"I did not sense him coming but I did sense he was after Adra, that's why I drew my sword, in case he got passed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he be after me!?\" startled, Adra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what Moro is saying is true, this Gargoyle wishes to expand on his transmutation ability.\" explaining, Eton said. \"He already has wings so I assume he can fly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he can't be underwater for long.\" turning pale, Adra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have no further worries regarding this one, he has committed a crime on Misterian land, we will deal with him.\" sternly, Minerva said. \"In the mean time, I strongly suggest you tend to your fallen friend and quickly take him back to Kraken or Olympia.\" sighing, she added, \"Sadly, we have no facilities to tend to an injured Gaian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro looked over Sam's injuries and quickly took him into his arms. \"Olympia is closer.\" quickly, he said. \"I can help him but we must be quick, the poison on Gargoyle's sword is known to have very cruel effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to find out what those effects were, Adra nodded and followed him out of the palace to the shuttle with Minerva, Eton, and a number of guards following. \"Safe journey, Adra and Moro.\" said Minerva, politely. \"Farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I would call a pleasant visit.\" jumping into the tank, Adra muttered. \"Will Sam be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoro pulled some sort of bed with a medical station out from the wall and placed Sam onto the bed. \"It's hard to tell.\" strapping Sam in, he said. \"It depends upon how much poison got into his veins and how strong his immune system is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Moro ran to the controls and piloted the shuttle away from the landing pad before making its way down towards the ocean waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was....interesting\" said Eton. Minerva turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has your opinion on the Gaians changed at all?\" inquired Minerva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a little complicated. Sam was formerly human, so I don't know if he counts. Moro seems credible enough though. I suppose I probably would need to meet more of them to have a better understanding\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good attitude\" said Minerva. Then, she added, \"Now, why don't you go find one of your friends. I have more business to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, more and more business. I'm glad I don't have your job\" sneered Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, you might have it eventually\" smirked Minerva right back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, I'll pass, thank you very much!\" laughed Eton. He honestly couldn't imagine himself as a future ruler of Skyaira. It wasn't quite his style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****In a corridor in the castle*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun\" said Joy with a smile as she walked down a corridor of the castle. She was another level of happiness now. She finally got to meet her father, who accepted who she was now, and she was now in very capable hands. What could possibly bring her down now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came just a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.....Gaian\" said a feminine voice from the shadows. Joy jumped about 5 feet in the air and looked around, startled that someone was following her. She didn't have to look far. From behind her, walked a Misterian female about her age. A very familar girl who wore her dark brown hair in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Karis!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I figured that you couldn't have been human before\" said Karis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy flinched as the young girl apparoached her. Joy knew that Karis was a very serious and often violent individual. Not only that, she didn't take well to liers or traitors of any kind. Her unnatural violet eyes bore into Joy, like she was seeing in her soul or something. It was truly frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did you know?! I-I was sure nobody knew!\" stammered Joy, slowly backing away from Karis. Karis smirked in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something seemed off from you from the beginning. I can tell certain things about a person from the tone of their voice. Yours always seemed unsure when you brought up your \"human\" life. Not only that, we've had humans reborn before and they've always looked like us. Your darker skin from the beginning was a dead giveaway to me that you weren't who you were saying you were. Most others will pass it off as something from a human life. However, I'm more perceptive than that\" explained Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked downcast. Her secret was out, and she didn't know what to do. She knew how others viewed her race, so she kept it hidden for as long as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, to finally get my answers, I eavesdropped on your conversation with your dear daddy\" smirked Karis, making Joy look up in surprise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You w-were there?! N-Nobody sensed anything!\" wondered Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just good at stealth. Queen Minerva probably felt me but I guess she didn't have a problem with me knowing. She probably figured that people would know eventually\" said Karis. She then took a deep breath before going further, \"Now that that's settled, what to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy gulped as she felt her back against the stone wall. The dark-haired Misterian had her cornered! Joy closed her eyes and braced herself for whatever Karis had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprised her when she simply felt a small bop on her head. She opened her eyes to see Karis standing in front of her, a blank and unreadable expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I've noticed that, aside from your lying, you seem to be a genuine good person. That's why I never said anything earlier. If you had done anything to make yourself seem like a threat to me or my friends, I would have smashed your face in\" said Karis, tightening her fist in front of Joy to get her point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, you haven't done anything wrong, so I guess we're cool\" said Karis, a small smile on her face, but the prior threat still lingering on her face. Joy gathered her courage and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I assure you, I mean nobody any harm! I just want to be accepted and make friends!\" said Joy, as convincingly as she could. Karis' expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, we're cool. However, it's not my reaction you should be worried about\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eton and the others are the ones you should worry about. I don't know about Ewol and Hal and such, but I'm sure Eton's opinion will mean a lot to you. If I were you, I wouldn't draw this out much longer. His opinion is a little less negative after seeing your dad. You might want to take advantage of this\" warned Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy lowered her head in thought. What was she to do?</span></div></div>",

Likely, after thw fiasco with the meeting, he was out looking for others to hang out with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Outside the palace*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it?\" asked Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was ok. Certainly some wierd characters. One of them has only been female for about 2 weeks and is already mated with someone\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes, so glad I don't have those feelings. Thankfully, we Misterians don't have those emotional problems that Aquarians have\" stated Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True\" replied Eton. Right now, Eton was joined by Lea and Hal, in addition to Ewol. He was currently telling them of the events back in the castle. He also told them about Moro and about how he seemed like a credible guy. The others took that with a grain of salt but accepted it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" yelled Karis as she and Joy approached the gang. Joy was internally battling with herself. One part wanted to wait, while another wanted to talk now. However, it was pretty clear that she wan't to get it out of the way now. The group's reaction would only worsen with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Karis?\" asked Hal, as the two girls approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Joy here has a little confession to make\" said Joy. Joy blushed at Karis' statement but walked up anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this something most of us should leave for?\" asked Ewol, thinking that Joy had a \"private thought\" about Eton that she wanted to tell him. Karis promptly bopped him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, you idiot!\" reprimanded Karis. Ewol sheepishly got up, rubbing his injured head. As amusing as the scene was, all eyes were on Joy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it?\" asked Eton. Joy fumbled with her words a bit before trying to get something coherent out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....you, um......know that Gaian guy from the palace?\" asked Joy, trying to start this off on the right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Moro? Yeah, I know him. Doesn't seem as bad as I figured he would be. Why?\" asked Eton. Joy fumbled with her words even more, and some were starting to wonder if she was having mental troubles. Soon enough however, the words came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He's.....my dad\" spoke Joy. Her tone was very soft and hard to hear, but everyone heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAY WHAT?!! YOUR DAD?!!\" yelled Ewol, loud enough to almost break everyone's ear drums. Joy winced the accusation but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so if you're serious, that would mean that you were...\" started Hal, before everyone, including Eton, came to the same conclusion. Needless to say, the tension in the air rose as Ewol crossed his arms and glared at Joy, who took a step back in fear. Notably, the entire group seemed a little frustrated, including Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better have a good explanation for this\" threatened Hal. Joy gulped at the threat but she told them her story. She told them about how she ended up as a Misterian girl, leading to the revelation that she was once male as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well normally, I would smash something in right now\" started Ewol, making Joy tremble that they were going to gang up on her. However, he visably toned it down. \"However, like Karis said, you haven't shown us any reason to believe you're not a good person, so I'll let it slide as long as you're good. You play nice and we'll play nice\" said Ewol, smiling a bit, although it still contained slight apprehension. After all, it wasn't easy to get over the shared hate of the Gaians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewol pretty much said everything I would have said\" said Eton, smiling a bit as well. Joy sighed in relief as the group accepted her revelation far better than she imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she said in gratitude. While the rest of the group gave small smiled to her, Eton turned away and placed a head on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need therapy. I can't believe my first kiss was with someone that was male just a couple days ago. Know anyone good with memory erasing?\" asked Eton, mostly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Ewol and Hal broke out in laughter, while Karis and Lea just giggled. Joy massively blushed.</span></div></div>",

Karis brought up that Joy would have to more quickly learn the ways of Misterians. After all, hitting someone in the back of the head was NOT the best way to meet an angel. In addition to learning how to act as a girl, Joy had her work cut out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, Eton had told them of the gargoyle incident. Everyone was shocked as how someone so twisted could be around, even for a Gaian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, that guy is properly punished\" stated Hal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm sure Minerva will take care of it\" said Eton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to believe it used to be a regular female and is now some twisted guy\" said Lea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technology can be just as frightening as it is intriguing\" stated Hal, to everyone's agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, they heard not much from what the fate the Gargoyle man endured at the castle dungeons. Eton didn't really want to know what kind of punishment Minerva was enacting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, the week passed by with the group trying to get Joy more accustomed to their ways. Lea was mostly put in charge of instructing Joy when Etoile was busy. Speaking of which, Joy moved into Etoile's house near the castle. Things were going lovely for her so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eton continued to train harder with the sword. He couldn't take what happened before lying down. He had to get stronger. The fact that he was a kid now was no excuse. He had to be better than that. So, he continued his training with Etoile and on his free time as well, not quite paying attention much in school, which drew some disappointment from Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, during the week, Karis approached Etoile with the intention of asking her to take her as an apprentice as well. Etoile wasn't sure about taking two students, but she was sure that Eton and Karis would learn better by competing with each other. So, she accepted her proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Gaian meeting behind him, it was time for more stories Skyaira to begin.</span></div></div>",

He had just gotton out from an hour in the training hall. Man, was he starving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked pretty good in there\" said a female voice from behind him. Eton smiled as he turned around to see Karis behind him, holding a lunch of her own. She walked over to Eton's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" she asked sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not\" replied Eton, allowing Karis to take a seat next to him.

The Flightleader is the leader of the Valkyries. You could almost say that the Flightleader is the Number 2 woman in Skyaira, the highest ranking general so to speak. I want to be that strong one day. So, I'm going to be the youngest Flightleader ever!\" said Karis, her excitement showing in the brightness of her wings, making Eton laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, I see. Well, you certainly have the drive for it. So, who's the current Flightleader?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Sigrun. She's by far one of the most talented warriors in the world. She's the ultimate ideal for female fighters. She commands with grace and strength\" said Karis, in an admiring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like quite a woman. Have you met her?\" asked Eton. His question seemed to catch her off guard, as she stumbled over her next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....yes....I guess\" said Karis, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing\" said Karis, a smile returning to her face. Eton didn't buy it but he let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's not the reason I wanted to talk to you. I found something very cool off the coast of Skyaira. I was thinking that you'd like to see it. It's only visable at night so we'd have to go then\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At night? Wouldn't that be dangerous?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine. We're both strong enough to take on anything\" said Karis, giving Eton a pat on the shoulder. He somewhat agreed with her. Whatever Karis was planning, he was interested for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's do it. However, if we get caught, I'm blaming you\" smirked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Just know that you're going to get it from me if you do\" retorted Karis. Both of stared at each other in the face for a few seconds before erupting in laughter. After they somewhat calmed down, they ate the rest of their lunch in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton was still apprehensive about this, but he was confident that could handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's training Joy going?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going well, sort of. Apparently, Gaians greet each other by slapping their heads. Unfortunately, she did that with Ewol, and he nearly strangled her. It was kind of funny actually\" laughed Karis, while Eton sheepishly grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, at least she's finalyl starting school. Old habits will be hard to break. Also, I told her that you used to be a 22 year old human. She looked disgusted at that revelation\" Karis continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, perhaps Ewol's prediction about the two of us getting together might not come true\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainly won't if you both keep thinking about the circumstances of who you used to be. Maybe it'll be easier later on in your lives\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows. Things stick around in my head for quite some time\" laughed Eton, causing Karis to laugh with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night soon fell upon Skyaira. Everyone was already in bed, with it being past midnight and all. Eton remembered where Karis had said to meet her, and stealthily climbed through his window and out into the cold night air. Even in a warmer climate like Skyaira, nights were pretty cold. Luckily, Misterians had their own versions of winter gear so it was easy to bundle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Eton was more adept at flying now, he flew away from his room in the castle, descending down to the mainland where Karis was waiting. Soon enough, he found her waiting near an edge of land. With slight differences, Eton thought she looked like a skier girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got out fine?\" asked Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, all clear.  A bit easier than I thought it would be. Aren't there archangels and valkyries that have night watches and such?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. However, most Misterians aren't crazy enough to fly at night at this time of year. It's especially cold during the spring. Anyway, we should be good though. Just stay with me and we'll be fine. I've gone there many times\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" said Eton. With that, both of them took off from the ground, flying into the dark clouds. However, unfortunately, they had neglected to know what a storm was brewing in that night. A rather violent one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold my hand so we don't get lost\" said Karis, offering her gloved hand to Eton. Eton told it gratefully. He still hadn't mastered flying so it was a good precaution. As he took Karis' hand, it reminded him often of when he was really a kid with Nate and Erin. Erin always liked to hold hands with Eton when he was still James. It was her way of making sure nobody ever got lost. Eton felt touched by this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he shook out of it when Karis started tapping his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there!! Look!\" shouted Karis, redirecting Eton's eyes to where she wanted. Needless to say, it was a beautiful sight. It was an aurora borealis, one that somehow made it's way to where Skyaira generally was. However, seeing it from a Misterian's view, the starry background only added to the majesty of it all. Truely, it was beautfiul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Karis, that's amazing! Where did you find such a spot?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it while flying around at night a few months ago. It's kind of like my own secret view. Pretty huh?\" asked Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" muttered Eton. He looked to his right and his eyes widened again. The lights of the aurora seemed to reflect off of Karis as well, adding a sense of grand sereneness to her. Eton's face blushed at the sight, but he quickly shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No need for that now! I've already got enough issues on that topic!</i> he mentally reprimanded himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something?\" asked Karis, picking up on his mental thoughts but not entirely sure what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing\" he quickly denied. Karis decided to let it go after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad the gentle moment between the two would soon be violently interrupted.</span></div></div>",

Everyone will probably realize our absense before too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point\" said Eton. Just as they turned around however, the scenery began to darken to a level that Eton had never witnessed. Everything was becomign pitch black, and very little light could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" asked Eton, beginning to worry. However, Karis was even more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I forget to check the weather report for tonight!\" she yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?!\" yelled Eton right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, there's a storm coming tonight. And it looks to be a rather violent one, given the darkness. Not many can take this kind of storm! If we don't get back in a hurry, the storm will eat us alive, figuratively speaking!\" yelled Karis, extreme worry evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go!\" yelled Eton as they grabbed hands again and tried to find their way back. However, soon enough, huge bolts of lightning stuck, and heavy rain began to pour. The rain hampered their progress, making their wings feel heavier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold on tight!\" yelled Eton as he tried to press forward. His wings were a bit stronger than Karis' were so he tried the most to push them forward. However, the rain soon became the smallest of their worries as the wind also began picking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winds were almost tornado-like, given their altitude. Eton's wings were strong but no where near enough to take tornado-force winds. Struggling to keep their hands together, the two began getting tossed and turned by the ragin winds and rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!\" yelled Eton as he stuggled to hold on to Karis' hand. If they got separated now, who knows where they would end up. Looking at Karis, he saw the most frightened face he had ever seen on any girl. Her face had vastly paled by now, almost making her look a ghost. Eton figured that they would probably BE ghosts soon unless they escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use though. They weren't nearly strong enough to resist the storm's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to stay together, Eton felt a pair of arms surround his body. He opened his eyes wide enough to see Karis holding onto his body for dear life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't let me go!\" she yelled, barrying her face into his shoulder. Eton could swear he saw tears streaming down Karis' pale face, although it could just be the rain. At that moment, he embraced her as well. They couldn't decide were to go right now. Their fate was at the mercy of the winds and rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them continued tossing and turning at the winds, the rain coming down hard and large bolts of lightning barely missing their bodies. It was fair to say they both thought they were going to die that night.</span></div></div>",

Neither of them noticed a small figure moving at fast speeds towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Of all times, such recklessness'</i> thought the unidentified figured as it flew towards the couple, streaking through the howling winds as if it was but a minor obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure flew up to Eton and Karis, embracing the two of them. The couple felt a couple of strong arms embrace them, but they were both too frightened to open their eyes. Sensing this, the figure gripped them tightly and manuevered their way away from the storm, getting back to the safer haven that was Skyaira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****A few minutes later*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Eton and Karis could barely heard the howling winds and rain, and they both slowly opened their eyes. They saw the dark storm in the distance, but they were clearly in a safe area now. After getting their senses back, they looked around. They were safely back in Skyaira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the hugging is very touching, but I think you can both let go now\" spoke a feminien voice. Eton and Karis looked at each other finally, seeing them both still tangled up from when they were clinging to each other for dear life. With massive blushes on both of their faces, they separated, to the slight amusment of their savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not quite the way you want to date a man, won't you agree?\" spoke the voice. Eton and Karis turned their heads to the user of the voice. While Karis' face paled in horror, Eton's jaw dropped. Before them was a stunningly beautiful woman, clad in armor befitting a valkyrie. However, her armor was pale, and glistened in the moonlight, as if it was made of a different quality from the normal valkyrie armor. Her long dark brown hair framed her face and flowed down her back. A sowrd was fastened at her waist and she wore mint green clothes underneath the armor. Her eyes were a fascinating violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the one who saved us?\" asked Eton. The woman gave a small smile and nodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. I'm glad that I happened to be on night watch tonight. Not many can sense a couple of Misterian kids during a thunderstorm of that magnitude\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, thank you very much ma'am. What's your name?\" asked Eton, trying to be as polite as possible. The woman smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sigrun\"  said the woman. Eton's eyes widened at her words. Sigrun?! As in the Flightleader of the valkyries?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're the leader of the valyries?! I'm so sorry you had to concern yourself with our trouble\" said Eton, politely. Sigrun smiled yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, Prince Eton. Consider it a good learning experience. Making sure others are safe is part of my duty after all\" said Sigrun. However, at that moment, her face and eyes became stern as she directed her gaze to Karis. Karis' face, if possible, paled even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis!\" yelled Sigrun, startling Karis. \"I believe I've told you many times about being fully prepared before doing something reckless. What you did tonight almost got you both killed. Where would Skyaira be the prince of all people died because of you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry ma'am!\" pleaded Karis, barely able to face eye contact with the woman. Sigrun's gaze became even more stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize what this means, right? You better be prepared for the consequences of doing such reckless things that endanger both yourself and your friends. I thought I taught you far better than that\" stated Sigrun, your stern gaze never wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am\" said Karis again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis\" said Sigrun, drawing out the name as if she wanted something specific from her. Karis' head dropped even lower in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Understood................mother\" said Karis after a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eton's eyes could possibly get any bigger, they just did.</span></div></div>",

We don't want to wake the whole city up\" said Sigrun, a small smile on her face. Still surprised, Eton turned to Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Flightleader is your mom?\" asked Eton, as calmly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes\" replied Karis. Sigrun smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so she never told you. Well, she doesn't seem happy to ever talk about it\" said Sigrun, lightly chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom! It's not like that!\" replied Karis with an indignant look. Sigrun chuckled a bit more before her face became stern again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's enough of that. You both need to be in bed. Karis, we're also going to have a talk, yes?\" said Sigrun, asking a question she already knew the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother\" said Karis, pretty much accepting what was going to happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the three of them split off to their respective homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Next Day*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis!\" yelled Eton as he ran across the land to where Karis was standing. After going to bed, Eton decided that he wanted to inquire further about Karis and learn more about her. The fact that her own mother was the Flightleader and he never figured that out showed him just how little about her he knew. He was commited to changing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Eton! Nice day isn't it?\" asked Karis with a smile. Eton smiled and looked at her. Her clothing today was a little more casual than normal. Her lilac top was shaped like a t-shirt (with the upper part of the back exposed for her wings) and she wore simple thin tan shorts and boots. She honestly looked....cute, to Eton's slight embaressment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is wonderful. May we talk?\" asked Eton. Karis' smile wavered a bit, but she nodded. She pretty much expected him to say that. After agreeing, the two walked to a nearby ledge and sat down, allowing their legs to swing over the edge. After living here for a little more than 2 weeks, Eton no longer really feared falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess the secret's out\" said Karis, likely referring to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I never would have guessed that your mom was the Flightleader. That's pretty cool, Karis!\" said Eton, trying to cheer her up. Karis gave Eton a small smile and then looked down at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kind of is. I'm not really sure though\" said Karis. Eton looked at her with an incredulous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that? It must be pretty cool to have a close family member so well respected\" said Eton. Karis looked straight at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. However, that also means higher expectations are placed on the offspring of such a well respected person\" sighed Karis. Eton was confused for a second before a light bulb went of in his head and he understood. She was talking about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is the strongest female warrior here. Because of that, everyone expects me to be the best fighter in school. The problem is that I'm not the best. And when you're not the best, with such expectation, you get picked on a lot\" said Karis, closing her eyes and allowing her memories to roam. Eton's memory awareness had been improving and he could see the images Karis wanted to show him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life was pretty rough. Everyone had placed high expectations on her from pretty much the time she would walk and talk. Trying to live up to those expectations created a hard and serious exterior on the outside, but on the inside, there lived a scared individual who was quite frightened of other people's perception of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always try to shove aside my doubts, thinking that everything will just turn out alright. But, whenever I think I'm on the right track, I always seem to fall short. I'm good in many subjects, but I'm not the best\" she said, allowing her head to rest on her hands. \"Sometimes, I hate myself for it, because I can't just be myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEton felt incredible sympathy for Karis. He had no idea what he would do if people placed those kinds of expectations on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when you told me that you wanted to be the youngest Flightleader ever?\" asked Eton. Karis sighed and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do want to be Flightleader some day, but I just don't know if I'll ever be good enough\" she said as she closed her eyes again. Eton could see her eyes twitching slightly, as if she was trying to withhold tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat surprised Eton even more was how open Karis was being with him. He barely knew anything about her before this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis, if I may ask, why are you telling me all this? I've barely known you\" said Eton, with a tone of sadness. He was dissappointed that he couldn't do more to comfort her. However, as he looked at Karis, he could see a ghost of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I trust you. You're a good person, Eton. I've seen the things you've done and I would trust you with my life if I needed to\" said Karis. Eton was surprised once again by her words. Yet, he was also warmed that someone had so much trust in him. In some ways, Karis kind of reminded him of Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really the first person who has really bothered to listen to me\" said Karis, looking down again and trying to keep her composure. Eton decided right there that he wanted to help her, to allow her to know that she had someone supporting her. With that in mind, he gently hugged her. Karis gasped in surprise as her head rested on his right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thank you for trusting me this much Karis. I assure you that I will be there to help you. After all, you've been a great help in showing me how to live here. It's the least I could do\" he said. Karis buried her face into Eton's shoulder, hoping to hide the massive blush on her face. Despite that, she smiled, a couple tears flowing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" said Karis, her arms gently wrapping around Eton's torso as the two enjoyed a peaceful embrace. If anyone had been watching, it would have been one of most touching scenes between friends you would have ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slowly separating, they got up from their seating position and looked out over the ledge, just looking at the clouds. As they did, Karis turned and, with a sweet smile, placed a small peck on Eton's check, causing both of them to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Way to go man. Your sappy nature just got you into a deeper hole!'</i> Eton mentally repimanded himself. Then again, when he turned to see Karis giving him her usual bright smile, part of him thought it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to go do something?\" asked Eton, wanting to go do something else. Karis' face dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I can't\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Eton. As he asked that, a sheepish smile appeared on Karis' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In human terms, my mom grounded me\" she stated. After a couple seconds to let it sink in, the two friends broke out in laughter, enjoying the happy moments between them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Eton bid farewell to Karis, he decided on taking another walk through the mainland. Supposedly, Karis wasn't allowed to do certain things while she was grounded. Her earlier conversation with Eton was probably the most he would hear of her for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should I do now?\" asked Eton to himself. Suddenly, he heard a loud screech, which immediately caused him to cover his ears. It had to have been one of the msot disturbing screams he had ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the devil was that?!\" wondered Eton out loud. It almost sounded like a baby's cry, if it weren't for the really loud part. Eton decided to investigate and follow where he heard the cry. Eventually, he started hearing voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down Luna! It's ok. I'm here for you!\" pleaded a young male voice. Eton rounded up the hill and spotted two young figures. One was a male, probably around 7 years old with brown hair and eyes of the same color. In his arms, he was trying to cradle an infant, who Eton assumed was the source of the cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something I can help you with?\" offered Eton as he approached the couple. The boy turned to look at Eton and jumped a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Prince Eton, aren't you? N-No need to worry about me! I can take care of this!\" pleaded the boy. Eton chuckled a bit at the boy's actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so formal about it. I'd prefer it if you adressed me as you normall would. So, what's your name?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Alain. I'm seven years old\" introduced Alain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure. So, who's the kid?\" asked Eton, smiling while looking at the infant in Alain's arms. The infant shared Alain's hair and eye color, and seemed to be squirming quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my little sister, Luna. She's only 5 months old. She's generally very quiet, but she has a hell of a scream, which you might already know\" Alain laughed sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, I see. She's a cutie\" remakred Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she looks a lot like Mom. I have to take care of her often. Dad is always on business trips to other cities and Mom works in the market all day, so it's really just me\" said Alain, to which Eton nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Luna squirmed out of Alain's arms. Eton attempted to catch her and keep her from falling. However, it wasn't necessary as Luna was softly flying in the air. She wasn't doing a lot of moving but she was easily floating in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! She can fly already?!\" asked Eton in surprise. Myrrh had told him that Misterians generally take a year to become strong enough to fly on their own. The fact that an infant of only 5 months was doing this was remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a natural. She's probably the only one who can fly at her age\" said Alain, as he reached out for Luna. However, Luna suddenly swerved to the right, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again! Come back here! Mom will kill me if you're hovering around when she gets back!\" yelled Alain, taking to the air himself to try and catch Luna. Eton chuckled at the scene. What a lovely sibling relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was great talking to you, Eton! Let's do this again sometime! You know, when Luna isn't driving me batty!\" yelled Alain as he went after Luna. Eton waved good bye to his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there are many more things I need to see and learn\" muttered Eton to himself. He was fine with that though. After all, he had all the time in the world to learn it all</span></div></div>",

He still hadn't asked Etoile for more sword practice since she was probably too busy with Joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Joy had pretty much merged into Misterian society. After the incident in which she hit Ewol in the back of the head, she didn't take long to take note of the Misterian traditions. Word spread quickly about her being a former Gaian, but most were actually able to accept her, given that she was one of them now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to this, training Joy in Misterian customs was part of Kari's two-week grounding. Today was the day she was finally off her punishment. During this week, Eton offered to help Karis is teaching Joy the customs of Skyaira. Needless to say, Eton and Karis began to bond closer during this time. When he first met her, Eton didn't see much more than a warrior girl. Now, he had gotten to know Karis the girl. Ewol often smirked when he saw them together. He could see the seeds of romance beginning in them both. Of course, given how hopeless they all were, they would probably need some pushes in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis!\" yelled Eton as he glided onto the mainland, having gotten even better at flying, although he was not a master yet. Karis waved and greeted him, wearing her casual clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Eton. I'm so glad to finally be off my punishment\" said Karis, sheepishly giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too. What have you been doing today so far?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I finally got to ask Etoile if I could train under her. She said yes\" said Karis, beaming. Eton's jaw dropped but he beamed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're going to train with me now? Cool\" said Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. Joy has also integrated into our society quickly. I don't think I have to show her much anymore. She almost acts like a proper Misterian now\" said Karis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" asked Eton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hearing some of the guys are quite taken with her. That wouldn't be happening if they still thought of her as a Gaian\" said Karis, giggling at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't that nice. As if she doesn't have enough on her mind\" said Eton. After that, they both heard voices from a ways away. It was Ewol, Hal, Lea, and Joy waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up guys?\" asked Eton as they all gathered together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something cool. We're going to explore something no one has done before\" said Ewol. Everyone turned their eyes to him, wondering what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" asked Hal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me and you'll find out. It's not too far off the coast of the mainland, but there's alot of cloud cover where it is. It's still not too hard to find though. I happened to come across it a few days ago\" said Ewol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, lead the way\" said Joy with a bit of a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly\" said Ewol as he raced forward and flew into the air after jumping off the edge. Everyone want to see just what hehad discovered so they all followed after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Karis gently held on to Eton's hand, just to make sure he didn't fall. He smiled in gratitude.</span></div></div>",

It was her first day, taking a week to grow accustomed to being a Misterian girl, and she wanted to make a good first impression on the other kids. Upon seeing Karis, she rose her hand to greet her but Karis stopped her. \"No, no, Joy.\" she said, firmly but kindly. \"Remember, we talked about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" said Joy, blushing. \"Old habits are hard to break, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris sighed. \"I know you mean well, Joy.\" she said. \"Still, you have to learn that we do things much differently here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" sighing, Joy said. \"I am trying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing a lot better than last week.\" said Karis, comforting her. \"Ewol wanted to strangle you when you 'greeted' him the day after that attack.\" she giggled. \"Don't worry, I told him it was for him laughing at you when you fell onto Eton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karis, I'm nervous.\" said Joy, suddenly. \"News of where I am from has had to have spread by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine, Joy.\" said Karis. \"Just remember that we greet each other like the humans. A simple \"hello\" will do. Slap someoen and they'll get the wrong impression. I'm sure there are a lot of crazy things you are used to, we will help you learn our ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Karis.\" said Joy. \"You're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay a good friend as long as you do the same.\" replied Karis, seriously. \"Friends do not keep secrets from each other, no matter what.\" she paused, then added. \"On that note, you should know that Eton used to be human man around 22 years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was human man?\" asked Joy, surprised. her face hardened. \"And you're preaching about not keeping secrets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, easy!\" warned Karis, sternly. \"It's something we just don't think about, okay? Don't take it personally!\" she sighed, trying to see Joy's side. \"Look, I'm sorry we didn't tell you earlier, consider us even on that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy sighed, then nodded. \"Fair enough.\" she said. \"It's just that I kissed a guy who was once more than twice my age.\" she made a face. \"Ewww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris laughed as they continued to walk. \"It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.\" she said. \"We'll treat you right, don't worry about it. Just try to remember that you are the new kid here, even Eton had some troubles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy managed a small grin. \"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Runa.\" she said, blushing. \"Sorry but Runa is a strange name for a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuni immediately changed back, including his clothing, stunned. \"How did you know I was really Runi?\" he demanded, almost pouting. It was his favorite game to trick the new kid in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy blushed even more. \"Gaians have to ability to change their bodies, we call it transmutation.\" she replied. \"Even as a Misterian, I can sense when someone has changed recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuni blushed brightly as the real Runa came up, giggling. \"It looks like we're going to have to work a lot harder to fool this one, bro.\" she said, amused. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Joy.\" she paused. \"Is it true?... You used to be, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nodded. \"I was once a Gaian boy named Coy.\" said Joy to Runi and Runa's gasps. \"I was accidentally sent through a teleporter machine they were still working on and became a Misterian girl.\" she sobbed slightly. \"Only it was a one way trip, I can never return. If I try, it will... kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuna's wings turned a shade of blue, feeling sorry for the girl before her. \"Oh, Joy.\" she said. \"What of your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy shook her head. \"Th- They ga- gave m- me-e up.\" she said, her wings a full blue color. \"Etoile ado- adopted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They gave you up?\" asked Ewol, his wings turning a slight shade of red. \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy's parents had no choice.\" said Etoile, comforting her new daughter. \"They could not live here as their ideals would poison our society but Joy is young enough to learn a new way of living, if you give her a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already promised her that chance.\" said Karis, nodding to Joy. \"She's off to a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile nodded. \"Well, I can see you are in good hands, Joy.\" she said. \"Try not to worry and have a good first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she flew off, leaving Joy on the floating island with her new classmates. \"I'll try, mo... Etoile.\" whispered Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not comfortable calling her 'mom'?\" asked Karis. \"Give it time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nodded then followed the others into the school where she was introduced to her class as a child 'rescued' from the city of Kraken, making her tear up slightly. Only she discovered why it was worded that way quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you a prisoner there?\" asked one student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was born there.\" replied Joy. \"It's really a spaceship, as far as I understand it.\" she sighed. \"There's not as much room to play there as there is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you happy there?\" asked another student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all I knew.\" replied Joy. \"I had ever left the city until I had a misunderstanding with my dad.\" she sobbed slightly. \"I thought he was going to banish me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Banish you!?\" came a chorus of concerned voices. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsters!\" said Runa, her wings showing anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! It wasn't like that!\" said Joy, defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly told her story. \"My dad was talking about the probe that pulled the humans in, not me.\" she said, completing her tale. \"When I returned home, dad showed me the teleporter. That was when my life change forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Karis rose to her feet. \"Joy is still used to the Gaian way of doing things.\" she said to everyone. \"Apparently, their way of greeting each other is a slap to the back of the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few giggles rose from the class, even Ewol chuckled. \"I got a taste of that greeting.\" blushing, he said. \"Those Gaians are a rough type of people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I want to learn your ways.\" said Joy, nervously. \"I ju- just need a little help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do Gaians formerly greet each other, Joy?\" curious, the teacher asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy blushed. \"You don't want to know.\" she said. \"It's a lot different from what you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease, show me.\" pressed the teacher. \"I promise I won't get mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy was clearly hesitant but she summoned Karis with her finger. She came and Joy whispered in her ear. \"Formal greetings, boy to boy, is a smack to the front of the head.\" she explained, quietly. \"Girl to girl, they... cup each others'... chests and boy to girl is a slap on the rump.\" pausing, she added, \"The harder the slap, the more personal the 'hello'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris blushed brightly then whispered back, \"Don't you <i>dare</i> try any of those greetings here, we'll teach you the proper way of doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy nodded then watched as Karis whispered to the teacher, who also blushed brightly. \"Well, I think we will be starting the day by demonstrating how Misterians greet and treat each other.\" she said, politely. \"Karis, would you mind showing Joy the proper formal greeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaris nodded. \"Yes, ma'am.\" she replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone had a good time as I told them my stories of my formor home. They apparently see living in tight quarters in a city-sized spaceship as not a good thing. I grew up dealing with it so I guess I never thought of it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a massive storm that night. I had never seen one before so I was on the ledge, watching it. The electricity lighting the sky, the heavy clapping sounds afterwards were terrifying and exciting all at the same time. I was tempted to fly out in it but Etoile cautioned me not to as a storm is best viewed from a distance. I remembered what Eton and Karis told me when they went out and got caught in a storm. I certainly did not want that happening to me. I did not sleep well that night but at least I was well entertained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a week since then and I believe I have become more accustomed to my new body and new world. Both Eton and Karis were a very big help, explaining everything I need to know to lead a normal life in Skyaira. All my friends are nice, but kind of wierd. Especially Ewol. He's such a clown, at least what's what Eton called him. I feel accepted as one of their own and am treated well....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy looked up from her journal and sighed, smiling. \"What a week it's been. A little hectic at times but still good\" she said as she glanced out the window, seeing the sun shining overhead. Living in such sunlight took a little getting used to for Joy, but her new body was easily able to adapt to it. She had laughed when Eton said humans needed certain materials to withstand such extreme sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Joy do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She complained of being too cold and wanted to use a blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, it is not cold enough to need a blanket,\" responded her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy, I need it,\" whined Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may use if for a few minutes then take it off. Let me carry you upstairs,\" answered her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, Nicole was in her bed wrapped in her favorite blue blanket. Her mother kissed her on the forehead and departed from the room. Nicole started to get the feeling she had when she had a hunch that things weren't what they seemed. She knew that her brother wasn't dead. He couldn't be. How could he be found in the exact alley where she was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant....\"Oh no...\"she thought, \"please don't tell me the big bad people have my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis frightened poor Nicole so much that she began to get extremely cold with chills throughout her body. When she was a Misterian, she had always gotten these urges and drastic isymptoms whenever she feared something that she believed was true. Pallas, her mother, would always worry about her health. Minerva would reassure her saying that Aria would do great things one day. She would be able to control certain situations to avoid a possibly horrific outcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right now, Nicole was not good for much. After all, she didn't even remember her time as a Misterian due to the trauma inflicted on her when her wings were torn off by demons. She was coughing and felt like she was about to throw up. At the time, Ellen walked into her room, saying, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom told me you weren't feeling well. I wanted to see if you were ok...Oh my gosh, Nicole!\"yelled Ellen. Nicole appeared to be uncontrollably shaking and having a seizure. Ellen immediately called her mom who soon entered into the room to treat Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh no. I don't want to have to lose another sibling. Please not her too'</i> begged Ellen in her thoughts. Out of nowhere, Nicole snapped out of it as if to answer Ellen and say that she would be alright. Her mother was relieved by this.She then proceeded to tell Ellen to keep an eye on Nicole as she called 911.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Skyaira, Minerva watched this whole scene take place. She felt terrible about what was going on with the child. She had already contacted Pallas about her daughter who said that she would arrive as soon as she can. Minerva wanted to send a telepathic message to Nicole and say that she will be alright, but Minerva knew she would get in huge trouble. All of a sudden, she received a message from Nicole in her mind that said James might be caught by the \"big bad people\". Minerva knew Nicole referred to demons with this strange nickname, but she was shocked that Nicole was capable of sending a telepathic message to her. However, when she looked down at Nicole, the girl appeared to not have been aware that she sent the message at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If she doesn't even realize what she is doing sending me messages...Aria might be in more danger than I had thought'</i> thought Minerva to herself. </span></div></div>",

Nicole looked and nearly screamed, seeing that she now had a pair of wings, which were flapping to keep her hovering above the bed. She turned back to James, jaw hanging, as he smiled and spread a strong pair of wings of his own. \"Where you came from is where I have gone.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I... came from?\" asked Nicole, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will understand in time... Aria.\" said another voice. \"Please... please remember me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked at the woman, thinking that she had seen her somewhere before. \"Do I... know you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the woman could answer, Nicole fell, letting out a low scream and woke up on the floor with a startled mom still holding her hand. \"Oh, my gosh!\" she breathed. \"Nicole!

He tried to move his arms and wrinkle his nose but found it to be nearly impossible. Without warning, the girl with the wings appeared before him. He blinked his eyes twice. Many thoughts were racing through his head: <i>\"Where am I?\" \"How did I get here?\" \"Who is she?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe last remembered being with his friends, and now he is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. Um..thanks for saving my life back there. That was brave of you. Though, I wish you knew what you were up against. You could have been killed...actually you definately would have if it was not for me,\" said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked James nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. How rude of me. I am Myrrh. You are in a hospital in my world. Right now, you are out of harm's way. You were shot, but you will be okay,\" she added with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, James was too shocked to even speak. He was staring at a beautiful girl. A divine light seemed to shine on her. He wanted to say that being with her made him feel like he was in heaven. Yet, he decided best not to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am James. James Walker.\" stuttered James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not at my best now, but as long as you are okay I am fine,\" he added a little more confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing he saw before his vision faded was her eyes. They were dark but seemed to burn with a flame from within. <i>\"She kindles my heart,\"</i> thought James as he passed out.</span></div></div>",

The twin siblings had returned home and were watching some tv. Their parents were out for the night so it was just them for the night. However, Erin had a look of worry across her face. Nate shook his head. Erin had always been a little wierd. It was like she had some special 6th sense or something. Not many people could fool her, as she was very perceptive and could tell her friends and family from anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's....nothing\" said Erin slowly. However, Nate was also quite perceptive, especially to the plights of his younger twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying. What is it?\" he said flatly. Erin sighed as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...got this strange feeling about James. I feel as if something terrible has happened\" said Erin, her hands clasped together in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" asked Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intuition?\" suggested Erin. Nate gave her a small smile as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about that. However, I think James is fine. He may always have his head in the clouds but he can take care of himself just fine\" said Nate assuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right\" said Erin as she took a look outside the window.

James hadn't called in a while and they had to have dinner without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I don't get it. Why wouldn't James call? He's always good about that\" wondered Trevor, James' 8-year old brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Trevor. This is most unusual for him\" wondered Lynda, their mother. Ellen, James' 19-year old sister, was especially worried for her older brother. They had been close for many years now, after finally outgrowing their sibling rivalry from when they were kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Why do I feel as if I might never see him again?'</i> wondered Ellen as a solitary tear fell from her eyes. She knew immediately that there would be no sleep for her tonight. Not until she knew that James was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole Walker, the youngest of the Walker siblings, was also worried. After being adopted into the family 4 years prior, James was the one who had taken much time out of his day to play with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could do was look to the sky and hope and pray for her brothers safe return.</span></div></div>",

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Myrrh, the Misterian princess. The Misterians are what you humans call angels, however there are a lot more versions then what you see pictures of. There are spirit angels, phantom like beings with tattered wings and a pale green glow. They're sort of half dead angels. Next there's the bestial angels, entities that resemble other kinds of Earth animals, including reptiles, fish, mammals, and any other species class. All other mythical beings are subtracted of these beings, like Kitsune, Atlantians, vampires, and even werewolves. A third version are the chlorophites, angels that are part plant. They act like how plants usually act, fire toxic projectiles, heal others, and fly with leaf-like wings. The fourth type is a strange one, the mechangels, robotic Mysterians that upgraded themselves to become mentally and physically superior but only succeeded in looking cool as well as a few other things. They can fire bullets, lasers, missiles, hook up to the Knowing-Net and become super smart, and fly with jet enhanced rigid metallic wings. Finally, you have the strangels, warped Mysterians who ally theirselves with the entity Thornton Sair, creator and leader of the world Ignus. Thornton altered them to make them the perfect scouts as they can teleport, use telepathy, create, alter, and destroy minor objects, and levitate with their fractured upside down wings. Any questions?\" Myrrh informed with a know-it-all tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames had many questions to ask, but he only asked the one that he just thought of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you tell me all this?\" James asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering with words, Myrrh, with a worried look on her face, summoned a reflective surface.

That's how dark it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where.....am....I?\" he spoke slowly. This almost didn't feel real, and yet at the same time, it was very much real. It felt like a place where even time and space were all screwed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's one way to look at it.\" </i>came a soft voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames instantly tried to look around, startled by the sudden voice. Again though, he couldn't tell where he was looking. However, as he continued to look, a small orb of light floated near him. It wasn't very bright, but it was enough for James to tell that he was actually looking at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he spoke again, a little bit faster than before. The orb of light slowly bobbled in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This place isn't really governed by temporal or spacial laws. That's how a mindscape works\"</i> spoke the orb again. After hearing it again, James thought that the voice sounded almost spiritual, like the voice of someone from another world or something. At the same time though, it sounded very familiar. Like he had just heard it recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the voice giggled, as if hearing something funny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I'm not a spirit. Trust me, I'm far from it. Think of me as someone who'll get you back on your feet soon enough\"</i> spoke the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so? First of all, what's a mindscape? Second, how are you reading my mind? Third, who the hell are you?\" spoke James, getting angrier by the second. He didn't like dodging around the subject like this. Once again, the voice laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So many questions. I can't really tell you everything right now. I don't have much time here. All I can say is that you went through a great ordeal just now, and I'll help you live again when the time comes\" </i>spoke the voice. James raised an eyebrow at that comment. Live again? Was he dead? He didn't feel like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Trust me, you aren't dead. More like half-dead.\"</i> spoke the voice. Before James could answer, the orb of light seemed to start flickering, like a lightbulb about to go out.<i> \"Crud, I'm out of time. Know this, you'll awaken soon enough. When you do, things will be different, but you'll always have help. See ya.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the orb flickered out, leaving James back in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was bizarre\" said James, wondering about what kind of trouble he was in now. However, he didn't have much time to think on it, as his mind began to cloud again, and he once again entered a deep slumber.</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, you blinked enough to see a small figure sitting on your face, with a face contorted in excitement and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a little girl, or perhaps a young teen. She was fairly small, not really into puberty yet. She had dark hair like the angel girl from earlier, although it was really short and very messy, like it hadn't been combed in a long time. She wore a violet short-sleeved dress that reached her thighs, a white long-sleeved shirt underneath it. A dark purple vest with some elegant characters adorned her chest and kept the dress close to her body. Her bright eyes were alight in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's awake!\" screeched the girl, making James wince a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fae, that's enough. Calm down and let me show her what she looks like now\" came another voice. James slowly turned his head and saw the girl from earlier, although he didn't see her wings. She slowly approached him, a small mirror in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but it all we could do\" she said somberly.

The face was soft, with radiant blue eyes. His hair was the same dark brown, but was now down to his shoulders and appeared a bit more black than normal. James just gasped at the sight and looked down. He saw a slightly curvaceous figure wearing a plain long-sleeved shirt with shorts of the same color. Two noticable lumps adorned his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" he, or rather she, screamed. The girl holding the mirror had to close her ears for that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite a screech, although I guess it was to be expected.\" sighed the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is going on? And who are you anyway?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Myrrh. Pleasure to meet you.\" said Myrrh, her demeanor turning a 180. \"And long story short, you saved my life from those Shadorians, and now you're the same as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just raised an eyebrow at her, not having a clue as to what she just said. \"Could you say that again in english?\" he asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh shrugged and was about to elaborate, until.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty miss!\" said the little girl from before, who jumped on the bed again, bouncing James a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, and you are?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Fae! It means \"fairy\", so don't forget it!\" exclaimed the little girl. James was completely confused right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fae, we're talking right now. Why don't you go play?\" suggested Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna! I have a right to see my new cousin!\" said Fae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf possible, James' eyes got even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, cousin? What in the world are you talking about?\" he asked, very much upset about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as I was getting to before I was interupted..\" started Myrrh, pointing a glare at Fae. \"I was attacked by those Shadorians, who are those demons you saw. You saved me from getting killed, but nearly got yourself killed in the the process. The only way we could save you was by using our power of rebirth on you. However, the results of it are very random, so that's why you became like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just sat there dumbfounded. \"So you turned me into a girl?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unintentionally, yes. Like I said, the results are random. If we didn't do it, you'd be dead right now.\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sat there, trying to compose his next question. \"So what did this girl mean by \"cousin\" exactly?\" he asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull your shirt down and look at your right shoulder.\" said Myrrh. James did as told, looking at said shoulder, pulling the neckline down far enough. Once again, he was surprised, as there was a mark there. It looked like a circle, surrounded by some elaborate markings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the Mark of the Exalt, and only members of our royal family have them. I as well, and so does Fae, or some odd reason.\" said Myrrh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" remarked Fae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at both of them and saw what they meant. Fae had a similar mark on her forehead, but he couldn't see Myrrh's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine is above my left breast, and I don't feel like showing it right now.\" she smirked, making Jame blush a bit at the thought. Then, another thought came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Royal?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, royal. I'm the princess of Skyaira, and next in line as of right now. Fae here is from a branched family line, but got the mark anyway.\" said Myrrh, getting another remark from Fae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying I'm part of it too?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.\" said Myrrh.</span></div></div>",

He tried shaking his hand to shake the light away, but it just grew stronger as he became more nervous. \"Stop James, you must control your emotions to wisp that light sphere away\". James got a hold of him, or probably now herself. He breathed deeply trying to calm down. In his mind he tried to focus the light sphere away. The light obeyed and disappeared. James was calm for a moment, trying to collect himself. Immediately afterwards he asked Myrhh \"wha-what the heck is going on? How did I do that\" he asked in his new girl voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrhh looked with a bit of sadness at James, but it soon changed to a content look. \"I didn't wish for you to find out so soon but, you have a great power within you James\" she said. James raised an eyebrow before asking \"a great...power\"? Myrhh responded calmly by saying \"yes\". \"You have a powerful energy resonating within you\" she said. \"You see during the rebirthing process we were repairing your body, but we found something unexpected. During the process an energy ignited within your body. It changed you. Your eyes became a bright blue and while it isn't certain, this energy was probably partially responsible for transforming you into a girl. We don't know what this energy was, but we theorize it was your good intention of saving my life that manifested itself into light energy that burns within your body during your rebirth into a mysterian. It was a rare finding for even us Mysterians\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames was overwhelmed by this new discovery. Myrhh saw his sad face and comforted him by saying. \"You should be happy James. That light energy is a gift. In fact you're one of the very few Mysterians that have ever been granted such a power,and probably the only one who can control light\". James sat still overwhelmed, but calmed himself and simply looked up at Myrhh. Myrhh could see into his eyes. James was unaware of this, but his eyes glowed during brief moments, changing from blue to yellow and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this power, it burns within me and I can make these...light balls\" he asked again to be sure. Myrhh giggled and happily responded \"yes, and you can do so much more with light than you know\" she said. \"But you have to learn and train\" Myrhh said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" James said, accepting this situation as much as he could. He couldn't believe it. First he was a girl, then he found out he had some sort of superpower.  In his own short way, he said that the whole situation was him having an \"off day\". \"It may seem hard to take in, but I promise you that this will be the beginning of a new life for you\" Myrhh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames simply nodded in agreement. \"Good, now the next matter is deciding your name. It should be something to reflect your new form and species, hmmm\" Myrhh thought. After a moment she brainstormed a perfect name for James' new angelic, girl form. \"Ah, I know\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked on in anticipation of what name she thought, though he really preferred his own name although he knew he wasn't a \"he\" anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name will be\" Myrhh said... </span></div></div>",

He moaned and allowed his eyes to flicker open, only to remember his experience in the alley. Fearful, he bolted up right and began to examine himself. To his relief, he was unharmed but, to his confusion, he was wearing only his boxers. \"Where am I?\" whispering, the asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around to find himself in a barren bedroom. Across from the bed he was in was a dresser in the corner with a small television and radio resting on top. To the right of it was a door to a small washroom with a shower and, on the other wall was a door, he presumed to be the only way out. Behind him was a small window, allowing a small summer breeze. Looking at all, James recognized it at his family's summer home in the country. \"How did I get here?\" groggily, James muttered. \"Last I knew I was in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rolled out of the bed and spotted a note on the nightstand, next to his cellphone and a set of car keys. Curious, he took the note and opened it up. It was a typed message that stated... <i>'You are healed but not completely, we left you here to rest. A rental car is outside, return home when you feel ready. If you change, you will know what to do. -Myrrh.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" confused, James asked, reading the cryptic message. \"Who the hell is this Myrrh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he again thought of the incident ion the alley and began to wonder. \"How surreal can it get?\" bemused, he asked. \"Was it all a dream? It felt real and... this note....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames paused to scratch his back, feeling a bad itch coming on and decided to take a shower so to tackle this new mystery with a refreshed mind and body. \"There has to be a logical explanation to all of this.\" striping down, he said to himself. \"Maybe my college buddies playing a prank on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, as he stepped into the shower, two hard lumps had formed just under his shoulder blades....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was not a bad itch but it was still a bit annoying as he could not quite reach it. He sighed, wondering if he should call his family so they don't worry. He moved to pick up his cellphone only to jump as it rang.  Seeing it was his mom, Natalie, he answered. \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, where are you!?\" panic in her voice, Natalie asked. \"We've been searching for you for hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at our summer home, outside of town.\" wincing, James replied. \"Only I'm not sure how I got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't know how you got there!?!\" her panic rising, Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw three men jumping a girl in an alley.\" smartly not mentioning her wings, James replied. \"I tried to help but didn't see the fourth guy.

Although he was still feeling weak, he spun around to find himself facing the winged girl he had saved the other day. She had a somewhat sad expression on her face as she smiled at him. \"Thank you for saving my life, James Walker.\" releasing his hand, she said. \"I am truly sorry you were shot in the process but, as you can see, we repaired the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you mean by we?\" fearful and curious, James asked. \"I seem to remember others charging onto the scene...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am princess Myrrh of Skyaira.\" placing a light finger onto James' lip, she said. \"My mother, Queen Minerva and I had a disagreement and I fled to Earth to find some peace.\" pausing, she added, \"Only, I found Shadorians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sha- Sado..\" struggling with the name, James asked. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadorians.\" giggling slightly, Myrrh said. \"You call them demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do 'we' call you?\" curious, James asked. \"Angels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the sense you are thinking.\" with a thin smile, Myrrh said. \"We are called Misterians or citizens of the mist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you back to me?\" looking at Myrrh, James asked. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I am here is because you are going through the 'unknown change'.\" sadly, she explained. \"Our healing methods are a little more advanced but they were really not meant for use on a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'unknown change'?\" feeling unnerved, James asked. \"What is that, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, our healing methods were really not meant for humans but I insisted it be tried anyway as you saved my life.\" looking regretful, Myrrh said. \"The same process we used to heal your body is changing your body to that of a Misterian but, as it changes you right down to your very DNA...\" she paused. \"You could come out of the change much younger or even as a member of the opposite gender, hence its called the unknown change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames became very worried. \"How long before I'm completely changed?\" almost whispering, he asked. \"Can I be changed back to my old self?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know but my mother might.\" wincing, Myrrh replied. \"I need you to allow me to accelerate the change so I can take you to Skyaira and meet my mother.\" tearing up, she added. \"Please, I am in stormy clouds as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames figured Myrrh meant 'stormy clouds' to say 'in hot water' or in huge trouble.

As he looked into her tear filling eyes, he knew that he would have done the same thing if he had to do it again. James had saved Myrrh because it was the right thing to do and she had saved his for the same reason. Finally, he smiled and offered his hand. \"Let's meet your mother and straighten this all out.\" softly, he said. \"I saved you at a risk and you did the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh, obviously grateful, smiled then took James' hand. \"This won't hurt a bit.\" he wings glowing slightly, she said. \"It will, however, feel a little strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded then paused as he felt a pressure in his back. As Myrrh had promised, there was no pain but it did indeed feel strange. The pressure continued as he then felt an odd weight building before he spotted something moving out of the corner of his eye. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh pointed to a full length mirror and James turned to it to find that he now had a large pair of wings, like her own but his seemed more rigid. It was like comparing the soft feathers of a sparrow and the firm feathers of an eagle. Throwing Myrrh a curious look, she smiled. \"Men in out world have stronger wings but the women have magic, its a firm balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....\" turning back to the mirror, James said. \"Wait, I'm still changing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be afraid.\" almost whispering, Myrrh said. \"The changes will end soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames continued to watch as the changes continued and soon he found himself shrinking to that of a teenager. \"Well, at least I'm not becoming too young.\" muttering, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes James finish changing or continue to change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He continued to watch as his hair increased in length, turning a lighter color, and his shoulders became more rounded. \"Oh man...\" he whimpered, his voice rising. \"I'm becoming a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames winced, feeling his body shifting inside as he felt something entering his nether regions before his, or rather, her hips widened slightly. The two lumps on his chest increased in size, finally stopping at what seemed to have been B cup breasts, causing James to moan again. Within minutes, the changes were complete and James blushed brightly, seeing a beautiful winged girl staring back at him in the mirror with no top on. \"Well, this is awkward.\" surprised by her new voice, she said. \"I need to find something to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wrap yourself in a blanket.\" giving James a sad smile, Myrrh said. \"You just got your wings, they will not be strong enough to carry you for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, James wrapped herself in a blanket and Myrrh led her out of the cabin where she took to the air, carrying James in her arms. \"Just relax and enjoy the ride.\" soothingly, Myrrh said. \"I'll take you to the palace where we will find you something suitable to wear before taking you before the queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded and try to be still as Myrrh took her higher and higher into the clouds. <i>\"This is so surreal.\"</i> looking around, she thought. <i>\"I always wanted to fly like a bird but this is not quite how I imagined it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked by, James gasped as she saw what could only be described as a floating island in the distance. \"Am I dreaming?\" almost whispering, she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh giggled. \"No, James.\" softly, she said. \"You are not dreaming. That is one of many floating islands that make up the Skyaira kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What keeps them in the air?\" curious, James asked. \"Why haven't anyone seen them before this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrrh laughed. \"The islands have their own gravitational pull, allowing them to float.\" amused, she explained. \"Why no one else can see them is simple, Skyaira and the other Misterian cities hover over where no humans live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked at Myrrh, confused. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Myrrh giggled. \"The island you see ahead is a moving island.\" smiling, she said. \"I used it to flee to your city and to take you to that cabin we left a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the island, Myrrh landed near a strange arrangement of crystals. She placed James down then began to work with them. \"These crystals, when moved in a certain order, will make the island disappear from here and reappear where ever you want.\" pushing and pulling on the crystals, she said. \"Hang on now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rush and James found himself again in Myrrh's arms.

It was made of marble floors with massive pillars that had lush trees standing among them. It was a beautiful sight to behold. \"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pseudowitch.deviantart.com/art/Main-Hall-334366382\" target=\"_blank\">http://pseudowitch.deviantart.com/art/Ma...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the halls are decorated this way to remind us of nature's role in our lives.\" smiling, Myrrh said. \"Without nature, we can not exist, we respect it for that reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded then took up the blanket and continued to follow Myrrh down another hall into an exquisite throne room. It was the same style as the other halls only James did not recognize a single tree. They were all huge with towering trunks that looked as if they could swallow a car. In the very center of the room was a huge throne that seemed to have been carved out of the trunk with a tall and slender woman sitting on it. She was a spitting image of Myrrh only with sapphire blue eyes that seemed to look right through her. The woman smiled at her and Myrrh as they entered and rose to greet them. \"My dear daughter, you have returned.\" hugging Myrrh, she said. \"May I assume this is the brave man who had rescued you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, or rather, she is, mother.\" as the woman released her, Myrrh replied. \"May I introduce James of Earth.

The table was four strange small trees whose trunks and branches turned and intertwined with each other with the top sanded down to a flat surface. The chairs were all carefully pruned bushes that had been shaped and used for sitting. \"Wow, I would have loved to have furniture like this on Earth.\" whispering you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could, if they just give it a try.\" serious, Annette said. \"Why don't you try the group chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the couch?\" motioning to the row of bushes, Ana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what you call it on Earth?\" bemused, Annette asked. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna walked to the 'group chair' and sat down in the middle.

It was unlike anything Ana had ever seen. The oven was made of stone with a flat top and an iron door in front. On the top of the oven was four circular indents with a circle of curious stones in it and a smaller circle of candles on the middle of it. Annette smiled, seeing your curious expression. \"These are called dragon stones.\" pointing to the rocks, she said. \"They become very hot when a small heat source is introduced. We use them for cooking and baking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's incredible.\" amazed, Ana said. \"We have nothing like that on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you do.\" serious, Amadeus said. \"You just have not discovered them yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are literally thousands of undiscovered minerals and creatures on your world.\" touching Ana's shoulder, Annette said. \"Some unknown to us, some unknown to humans, and the rest unknown to both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stepped back and took up a long wooden spatula before opening the oven with a heavy cloth like a pot holder. Watching from the side, Ana could see the dragon stones glowing inside. They were placed in rock indents all around the inside of the oven for even baking. On the bottom of the oven, Ana noticed, was a large single candle. Annette slid the long wooden spatula in and used it to pull out a pan with the yeast loaf and set it on a wooden plate on a stone counter. Once done, she put the spatula back on its large hook and took up what looked like a candle snuffer and put out the candle before closing the oven door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spatula is made of cinder wood from a cinder tree.\" placing the pot holder aside, Annette said. \"They are really stone outcroppings that resemble thin tree trunks.\" she smiled, adding, \"They are cut and formed with special tools to make things like the spatula and the hot plate I put the yeast loaf on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" awestruck, Ana said. \"Those dragon stones would save my people, err, humans millions in electricity and gas per year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Millions of what?\" curious, Annette asked. \"That silly paper they call money?\" she giggled. \"What a way to run a world. It's invites greed into everyone's lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna sighed. \"I can't argue with that.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything we need comes from the world around us.\" smiling, Amadeus said. \"If we need something fixed or built by someone else, we call upon a neighbor and they call upon us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, way of doing things is perfect but it works for us.\" calmly, Annette added. \"Now, please wash your hands while I slice you a piece of yeast loaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna walked over to what looked like a stone sink and looked about, curious. \"Um... Where do you get the water from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna laughed as she approached then pointed to two petals on the floor. \"They're right under your nose, silly sister.\" amused, she said. \"The right is cold water and the left is hot water.\" she then pointed to a green bar of soap. \"That's the soap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that much, thank you.\" blushing slightly, Ana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hold down the petal until you are done using it.\" smiling, Annette said. \"Its designed that way to prevent accidental spread of germs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna pushed down the hot water petal the took up the soap and washed her hands before placing the soap back and rinsing. Once done, Anna gave her a towel she used to dry her hands. \"Put it in the 'to wash' basket.\" pointing to a panel door in the wall, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna pushed the panel open and dropped the towel down a wooden chute then turned to find Annette holding out a wooden plate with a slice of the yeast loaf. \"Please, enjoy.\" she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next to it was another table, like the one in the living room where she placed the plate down and took the yeast loaf into her hands. The first bite made her smile as it was a bit on the sweet side but not overly so. \"It's really good.\" after swallowing, she said. \"It has a bit of a sweet taste to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.\" smiling, Annette said. \"That one slice will expand in your stomach, making you feel satisfied for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" curious, Ana asked. she smiled. \"Then I better not ask for seconds if I want room for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette laughed. \"You learn quickly, Anastasia.\" amused, she said. \"All of our food is filled with nutrients and they all expand so no one needs fear hunger as food is always plentiful.\" she then winked. \"Those who over eat, learn quickly that its not a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have to drink?\" curious, Ana asked. \"I'm a little parched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not try a fruit nectar drink?\" pointing to what looked like a stone pillar, Ann suggested. \"They are in the cool box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool box?\" raising an eyebrow, Ana asked. \"You mean like a refrigerator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" tilting her head, Ann asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmadeus chuckled, leading Ana to the stone pillar, and pulled on a wooden handle, opening a steel door that Ana did not notice before.

She got off of the sleep shrub and looked around to find that she was alone in her room. She turned one way and found what looked like a dresser and a vanity but that was not what she needed. Looking in the other direction, she found a doorway to what looked like a bathroom and hurried through to find what only could be described as a huge pitcher plant. It was a cucumber shaped carnivorous plant with an open top that lured insects in with a sweet scent. Once the insect lands to investigate, it hits the slippery insides and falls into its digestive juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what they use as a toilet!?\" worried, she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna sighed and decided she had better at least try or have an accident. Cautiously, she sat down onto the plant, which surprisingly took her weight, and did her business. Once she was done, she stood up off the plant then turned to what she recognized as a sink. Remembering the foot petals in the kitchen, Ana found similar ones at the sink and washed her hands with some soap then walked back into her room to the dresser. It was made up of two plants that had their branches interwoven into each other, forming holes for drawers that were made of a curious colored bark. She opened one drawer and found a number of panties of which she took one and quickly changed out of her drawers she had warn earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit more comfortable.\" blushing slightly, she muttered. \"Maybe I should change into a whole new outfit for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the other drawers, Ana found a knee length skirt and a blouse to wear. Once dressed, she turned to the closed door and tickled it as Amadeus did. The vines separated and rose to clear the doorway for her to pass. \"This place is too much.\" giggling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking back down to the first floor of the house, Ana was greeted by Annette. \"Did you sleep well, Anastasia?\" smiling, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna nodded. \"The toilet will take some getting used to.\" blushing she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toilet?\" turning her head slightly, Annette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you go pee...\" still blushing, Ana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette giggled. \"Is that what you call it?\" amused, she asked. \"That is a waste plant, it eats waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't eat... people, does it?\" wincing, Ana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette laughed. \"No, dear child.\" giggling, she said. \"It only eats waste.\" she then pointed at me, adding, \"Just don't try to feed it your leftovers unless you want to clean up the mess later; waste plants can only digest waste, nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" quickly, Ana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnette smiled. \"I think its time to start your flying lessons.\" firmly but kindly, she said. \"Are you ready to start, Anastasia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to learn sometime.\" shrugging, Ana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAna followed Annette out a doorway in the rear of the house where she found a large open space between the trees with a huge net about a hundred feet below them. \"This is a flight training clearing.\" calmly, Annette explained. \"Here you will learn how to fly.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello everyone! I am back with my newest interactive! In this story, my own original character, James Walker, is back! Only, in this life, he is set to embark on a grand adventure through a new world which he must embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any of you have any questions about the story, characters, or nature of the angel race, please feel free to ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer. I have an outline prepared for this story (work in progress currently).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules as usual:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13! <br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much. In other words, no blowjobs or stuff like that!<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence)<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. Try to make it a good length if possible.<br>\r\n6. Have fun with it and let's add to this new world together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Walker is an ordinary 21-year old living in Los Angeles, California. Since birth, he has dreamt of flying one day, which inspires him to one day become a pilot. To help achieve this, he is currenly attending college with his friends. Currently, it is summer break and he's completed his sophmore year of college. However, a chance meeting changes those plans as an act of heroism on his part forces him to live among the fabled Misterian race of angels. Now, in a new form, James must adapt to his new life, while freely embracing the freedom of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. James Walker- 21 years old, short strawberry-blonde hair, blue eyes, currently attends college nearby with friends.<br>\r\n2. Myrrh: A princess of the Misterians. Looks like an older teen but is about 485 years old. Strong-willed and compassion. Often acts stubborn though, which often leads to trouble for her.<br>\r\n3. Erin Wilson: 21-years old and friend of James, harbors a crush on him from when they first met in Kindergarden. She is also Nate's twin sister.<br>\r\n4. Nate Wilson: 21-years old. James' best friend and twin brother of Erin. A good-natured rogue so to speak. Always bending the rules just a bit. Knows of Erin's crush on James and often teases her for it.<br>\r\nMore charaters to come likely.</td>",
