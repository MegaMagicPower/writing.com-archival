Your parents had just left about fifteen minutes ago for their special anniversary date, and even though you repeatedly insisted that you were now fourteen, going on fifteen, and you were too old for a babysitter, they went and got one anyway, much to your annoyance and chagrin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess the sitter was more for your little brother Dave than you. He was always doing his best to annoy you and drive your parents insane, so you can't really blame them for wanting to get out for a while. Still, you can't help but feel a tiny bit of resentment towards them for leaving you here with him while you wait for the babysitter that you didn't need in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the doorbell rings, and you hear your little brother call out for you to answer it. You sigh, the little pest couldn't even be bothered to pause his Super Smash Bros. game for an instant to answer the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly get up and go downstairs to let the sitter in. You open the door, and standing there on the welcome mat was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will be your sitter for the night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Tanya - A ten foot tall werewolf with thick black fur covering her body. In her human form, she is an unassuming seventeen year old dark haired girl. She's generally pretty mellow, but get in her bad side, and she'll show you just how monstrous she can really be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sabrina - A normal, sixteen year old nerd who just happens to be a witch. She can be rather nice, but make fun of her glasses, braces, or anything else about her, and she'll cast a nasty spell on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Katie - A smoking hot succubus and biker chick. Pretty much a wild card when it comes to personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Vanessa - A goth vampire girl, who will may or may not invite her boyfriend over after you go to bed. Can be rather moody, and doesn't seem to happy about spending her Friday night babysitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had dark brown hair, wore a grey t-shirt with a varsity jacket over it and tight-fitting jeans. She absent-mindedly tapped away at her phone before looking at you, \u201cHey kid, what\u2019s up. Name\u2019s Tanya. I\u2019ll be your babysitter.\u201d She put her phone away and shook your hand, she had a really strong grip. You let her come in and as she entered into the living room she smiled a bit, looking down at Dave play his videogames, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a cutie!?\u201d Dave just retorted, \u201cYeah, well you smell like wet dog lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya growled at that, clenching her fists, \u201cWhat!?\u201d Dave smirked, \u201cYou heard me. You smell like a wet dog that rolls in it\u2019s own crap. And you\u2019re face ain\u2019t too pretty either.\u201d Tanya snarled, her eyes changing, into yellow, wolf-like eyes, \u201cYou little snot!\u201d Tanya then growled, a deep animalistic one. This made Dave squeak in fear. Thick, dark hair started growing all over her body. Dave remarked, \u201cEw, you should shave more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs and body elongated, stretching her form to a towering eight feet, her legs bent and became hunched, her face elongated into a snout, her black-painted fingernails and toes stretched into claws. AAARRRROOOOOOOOO!!! Lumbering towards you two was not a late-teenage girl, but a towering werewolf, dressed in Tanya\u2019s ripped varsity jacket and jeans. This was Tanya\u2026 your babysitter is a werewolf? In fright, you and Dave huddled together in fright, wondering what the approaching monster would do to you two.</span></div></div>",

Giving him no time to protest, the werewolf shoves Dave headfirst into her drooling maw, splatting his face against her nasty tongue. She closed her lips around him, shoving his entire upper body into her mouth. She starts licking Dave, enjoying his flavor, \u201cMmm, tasty.\u201d You could tell your little brother was fighting like crazy in her mouth due to his kicking legs that suck out from between her lips. You weren\u2019t sure if you should be doing anything to save him, since you were scared yourself about being put on tonight\u2019s werewolf dinner menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the werewolf tilted her head back, slurping up Dave\u2019s legs like noodles and with a loud GLURK she swallowed him whole. A large, little-brother-sized bulge slowly slithered down her esophagus, reappearing in her rounded, extended belly. Now she looked heavily pregnant with a big, round dome of a belly that jiggled and squirmed with your protesting little brother inside of it. You could even faintly hear him yelling and calling her names from out here. Then you heard the werewolf belch in your direction, BBBBLLLOOOORRRRPPPPP. She sprayed you with werewolf saliva, \u201cEw, yuck!\u201d The werewolf slapped her gut a few times, \u201cAh, hit the spot. Nothing like a brat for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver in fright as you look up at the looming werewolf. She gives her gut a few slaps and belches on you again. You wave her stinky breath away from you, \u201cTanya? Is that you?\u201d The werewolf was to wrapped up in her meal to take notice of you. Her dinner-plate-sized eyes widened as she looked down at you and grinned, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Sorry if I scared you, but your little brother had to be punished.\u201d You were still a bit frightened, \u201cY-you\u2019re not gonna hurt him, are you?\u201d Tanya chuckled, \u201cNah, he\u2019s just in time out for now, I\u2019ll barf him up before the night is over.\u201d Then a sly grin form on Tanya\u2019s muzzle, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have to have you as seconds, am I?\u201d You shook your head, \u201cN-no! I\u2019ll behave.\u201d Tanya smiled, putting her paws on her hips, \u201cGood! Now that you know I\u2019m a werewolf\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was hunched over in the house but now fully straightened. The 10-foot-tall creature towered over you. You could barely comprehend how powerful she was.<br>\r\n\"So, are we playing?\" She asked, meanwhile she playfully wagged her tail. So she looked more like a dog than a wolf.<br>\r\nYou picked up one of your brother's balls and threw it away. Tanya immediately threw herself after it and caught it in the air with her teeth. Then she took it back and dropped the salivating ball into your hand.<br>\r\n\"Harder.\" She instructed you.<br>\r\nYou did it again with more force. Tanya caught it again and returned it.<br>\r\n\"Stronger. What kind of man are you?\" She teased you.<br>\r\nThat's how you threw the ball for hours. By the end, you throw it so that it managed to fall to the ground. Tanya caught the wildly bouncing ball and brought it back to you.<br>\r\n\"This last throw was quite tolerable.\" Tanya patted your shoulder. When..<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\" There was a loud scream from the fence.<br>\r\nIt was the kid next door. One of your brother's friends. He must have wanted to come over to play with your brother. He climbed up the fence to climb over, but then he saw the werewolf.<br>\r\n\"Monster!!\" He shouted and fell off the fence.<br>\r\nYou heard his footsteps running towards his house behind the fence.<br>\r\nYou look up at Tanya's face who says:</span></div></div>",

You were still amazed that your babysitter not only turned out to be a werewolf, but she gobbled your little brother up whole. You could still see the occasionally lump push out from her belly as Dave was struggling to escape. Tanya seemed indifferent to his attempts to get out, keeping him down with ease. She looked at you with what was supposed to be a comforting smile. Unfortunately her big teeth make it look more creepy than comforting. Upon seeing you cringe away from her smile she laughs, putting a reassuring hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't think you've got much to worry about. Little monster secret for ya, but the reason we only go after bad kids is the good ones taste horrible. Like trying to swallow the world's biggest hairball horrible. So unless you get all bratty like your little brother...\" She pats her belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still not certain about having a whole pack of werewolves in your house. Just one of them was already enough to deal with your brother. At the same time you couldn't help but feel incredibly curious. You had so many questions, not the least of which where the hell she came from. If werewolves are real, you'd have expected to hear more about them. Tanya looked down at you expectantly, trying her best version of puppy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. But no shedding on the couch.\" You add with a smile. She laughs loudly, slapping you on the shoulder. Unfortunately she forgot her immense feral strength for a moment and knocked you over with her enthusiasm. One apology and a phonecall later the doorbell rang. Tanya excitedly bounces through the living room to let in her friends. On the doorstep stood what looked like several teenagers. Your babysitter explained that you and especially Dave already knew they were werewolves. Giggles and sighs of relief all around as the girls transformed into their true forms. They all came into your house and shook your hand. Unsettling toothy smiles seemed to be their calling card as each of them sent a small shiver down your spine. Why did you think this was a good idea again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all settled down in the living room. You were sat on the couch with Tanya next to you and another werewolf on your other side. She had a beautiful coat of silver-grey fur. You listened to their small talk and gossip. It was amazing how little difference there was between the monster world and the human world. Though it was all draped with a distinct monstrous tinge, the subjects were remarkably similar. Talk of clothes, boys and that one bitch that wasn't invited were common. Soon their attention turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What's it like knowing werewolves are real?\" The silvery wolf asked, hungrily looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing!\" You blurt out. You weren't sure what to say, but in a room full of werewolves it was probably best to stay on their good side. Especially with Dave already showing what happens to those that get on their bad side. \"Eating my little brother aside, you guys are awesome.\" Tanya burped almost on command, making the others double over laughing. The silvery werewolf composed herself again and continued asking questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever kissed a werewolf before?\" You had no answer for her, turning bright red. The others hollered and howled, with Tanya rolling her eyes. \"Anna! Leave him alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm sure a handsome boy like him has kissed lots of girls already. I'm just asking if any of them were werewolves.\" She said, barely stifling a giggle. You weren't sure if you could physically be more embarrassed right now. Anna threw a reassuring arm around you, pushing you into her furry side. Before you could stammer out an answer she already leaned in and spoke softly. \"You wanna try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolves all howled with delight, egging the two of you on to do it.</span></div></div>",

You felt her heavy paw gently rub your thigh and she leaned her muzzle in close to you, you could feel her warm, meaty breath brush past you. It felt really weird to you, first knowing that monsters exist, and secondly having someone of a completely different species come on to you. You nervously chuckle, \u201cU-um, that\u2019s all right. I-I, um\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m kind of only into human girls.\u201d All of the werewolves gasped in a very overexaggerated, and comedic way. Anna leaned in even more, moving her paw up to your chest, her muzzle nearly touching your lips, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re vanilla?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya rolled her eyes, and started tuning out of the conversation you and Anna were having. Your babysitter jokingly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t chew on him too hard Anna.\u201d The pack of monster girls giggled as they started up their own separate conversation, giving you and Anna some alone time. You were just glad that you hadn\u2019t done anything to piss them off yet. Anna pulled you in close and ran her large tongue across your cheek, \u201cSo, help me understand\u2026 what\u2019s so wrong with us werewolves. We\u2019re stronger than humans, so I\u2019d be great at protecting you. I\u2019m nice and furry for when you humans get cold. I\u2019m a great kisser\u2026 I would think you\u2019d be head-over-heels for someone like me?\u201d Unbeknownst to you, Anna already had a boyfriend, but she just loved toying with shy boys like you.</span></div></div>",

Anna\u2019s lips were much larger than yours and the huge werewolf seemed to guide you through it. Eventually you both broke the kiss and looked into each other\u2019s eyes.

For now placating the beast seemed the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... unexpected.\" You say, a dopey grin on your face. \"Not just the kiss... but all of this. I mean, werewolves are real. How is that even possible? Wouldn't humanity be at least a little aware? Especially since you can apparently order one online to be a babysitter? Does this also mean other monsters are real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour barrage of questions was interrupted by Ana. She put a clawed finger on your lips and smiled. \"Slow down there buster. You want answers? That's gonna cost you.\" She looked around the room with a toothy smile. \"What do you think, girls? One smooch for one question?\" All the werewolves burst into giggles. Even Tanya couldn't suppress a smirk. Ana looked back at you and continued. \"To answer one of your questions... yes, they're all real. Werewolves, ogres, yeti's, krakens, gnolls and so much more. We all live in the Monster World, a different side of reality where we can be ourselves. Some of us like to blend in to keep an eye on the humans, but for the most part we stay in our own world, only interacting with children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at Tanya's wiggling belly. Some interaction that is. Ana lets you think about her answer for a moment before speaking again. \"Now, who wants a kiss from this handsome boy next?\" The others giggled before one of them beckoned you over with a single clawed finger. She looked more muscular than the others, but her goofy smile greatly diminished her intimidating figure. When you got close enough she grabbed your arm and pulled you into a soft hug. Ana might've been joking around when she said werewolves can give soft, fuzzy hugs, but she was right on the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there cutie, my name's Alicia. You ready?\" She puckered her lips and you quickly lean in and give her what she wants. The others cooed and hollered as your lips met, Alicia taking hold of your head to keep you locked in this passionate kiss. Truth is, she didn't need to push anything. After Ana the weirdness of kissing a werewolf had faded and you happily shared this moment with the muscular beast. When your lips parted she excitedly put a big lick across your face, making the others giggle as you wipe away the trail of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you earned that one. Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... uhm.... how do I say this... is it normal for a werewolf babysitter to eat the kids she should be looking after?\" All the werewolves burst out in laughter, Tanya loudest of all. Once she'd wiped the tears from her eyes she patted her belly. \"Don't worry about little Dave here. If we actually ate all the bad kids I'm fairly sure you'd hear about it on the news.\" You look at her incredulously. \"Okay, let me explain. Monsters eat kids all the time, they're a delicacy among all of monsterkind. But we can't go around digesting people. We'd run out of children in weeks.\" You gulp. Math wasn't your strong suit in school, but unless Tanya was greatly exaggerating that meant monsters didn't just exist, there were many millions of them. \"So instead of that, we bring them into a nightmare, seamlessly pulling them from reality. It's hard to explain, but long story short, Dave will wake up in the morning having had the most horrible dream where a big evil werewolf ate him. That's also why you hear so little about us. Is any of this real? Or are you dreaming too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoiler alert, it's real.\" Alicia giggled, pinching your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they said made sense. You've definitely had nightmares about monsters chasing you before, but you always just thought those were bad dreams. Were all those horrible things real? And had they visited you at night? You look around the circle of giggling werewolf girls. Who was next to demand a smooch in return for some answers?</span></div></div>",

Don't you dare think you're getting away from me with just one itty bitty kiss.\" Anna pointed her clawed finger down before her. You were needed and Alicia reluctantly let you slide off her lap. Tanya just nodded, graciously passing her spot in the queue over to her friend. You were barely within arm's reach of the white-furred werewolf when she grabbed you by the hand and pulled you close. Not content with the human merely in her arms she span around, all but throwing you into the couch and looming over you. You gulp, looking up at the hungry eyes of your babysitter's friend. Drool began to leak from her toothy smile, but she wasn't interested in chowing down on you, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came shortly afterwards as she aligned her drooling maw with your face and plunged down. You feared she was going to bite, but you were overwhelmed by her passion. She seemed committed to breathe for the both of you, covering your nose and mouth with her muzzle and letting her tongue dance about freely in your mouth. You try to struggle against it, but hidden under Anna it's hard to see. The only thing you hear is loud slurping as your head is slowly encased in slobber and giggling in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, Anna, you're gonna scare him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh puh-lease. He watched Tanya scarf down his little brother and barely blinked. He's fine, aren't you?\" Anna replied with a playful smirk. You only offered a weary groan, too shellshocked by what she'd just unleashed on your poor face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rolls back around, holding you tightly against her chest and revealing your drool-soaked face to the others. \"Oh my god,  you're such an animal.\" Tanya joked. Anna didn't seem the slightest bit upset, instead appearing almost proud of herself. She looked down at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've definitely earned your next question. Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off what just happened as best you could and try to think of another good question to ask the group of werewolves currently lounging about in the living room. Of all the strange and unusual things that had happened tonight, there were two questions burning most in your brain. First, the easy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why an internet babysitting service?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smirks and pats her belly. \"Well, meeting new kids to eat is always a nice prospect. That aside we make sure we've got a decent enough disguise ready. Though you wouldn't believe how many parents let us walk right in even if there's a patch of fur or bloodshot feral eyes still visible. Whatever it takes to get them a few hours of time to themselves, right?\" You gulp. Was your house really just a buffet at this point? How long until you'd be sitting inside one of their bellies. They said you wouldn't taste good because you weren't a brat like Dave, but how much of that was true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too easy. I think this boy is just fishing for kisses now. C'mon, ask us something difficult.\" Anna growled. What luck, you didn't have to lock lips and taste werewolf breath again. You turn to look her straight in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolves come from a curse. Do you need to be bitten or are there... other ways?\" The white-furred wolf flew into a fit of laughter, her whole body shaking so much you nearly fell off her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry your little head, human. I can't pass along this gift with just a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya butted in with a huge smirk. \"Yeah, there wouldn't be a human male left on the planet that hadn't been turned by now.\" The two exchanged icy glares before Anna continued. \"It takes a bit of effort, so don't you be nervous now. We can kiss all night and you won't grow an extra hair.\" You looked at her with a tinge of disapointment. Being a werewolf sounded cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, I think that's enough questions and answers for now. How about we do something else?\" Tanya suggested. The others nodded, all looking at you. What's next on the agenda?</span></div></div>",

You got any more bratty little brothers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on command the big belly you were laid upon growled, Alicia and the other werewolves responded in kind. The loud gurgling put a chill down your spine. If you didn't do something fast you were going to be next on the menu, no matter how poor your taste might be. You slide yourself from Anna's embrace and onto your feet. The kitchen didn't have nearly enough for all these hungry ladies. There were some things in the freezer, but that would take too long to thaw out. They'll have reduced you to dinner long before that was ready. Suddenly you had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls like pizza?\" Immediately all eyes were on you. \"What am I saying. everyone likes pizza. I'll order some delivery.\" The room lit up with cheers and howls of delight. Sounds like you just found a way to get on their good side. You breathe a sigh of relief, well aware that their bad side was likely the inside of their bellies. You grab your phone and take orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, healthy werewolves probably need more than a pizza each, let's make it two a piece.\" All nodded, Alicia even putting on her puppy eyes for a third. You roll your eyes and agree. This opened the floodgates as a room full of feral glares turned into a puppy pen. You let out a big sigh. \"Fine, three pizzas for everyone. And not a dime left in my piggy bank after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya quickly chimes in \"Oh, don't worry about that, I'll pay for them. I can't go and invite my friends in and then expect you to go bankrupt for them.\" You smile at your babysitter. \"Thanks Tanya. Next question, what kind of pizza does everyone want?\" They all shot you a blank, incredulous stare. \"Take a guess...\" Alicia said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, pineapple pizzas for everyone.\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that and we'll have to add a bit of extra flavor and put you on our pizza.\" Tanya said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and call the pizza place. Thankfully there was one almost in your neighborhood, so you wouldn't have to wait too long with five hungry werewolves in one room. Someone picks up and introduces themselves with a thick accent. \"Welcome to Ray's Place, what's yer freaken order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One pepperoni pizza...\" The voice repeats your order and waits for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and fifteen meatlover's pizzas.\" The voice on the other end falls silent before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that right? fifteen meatlover's? Kid, what kinda freakin party you throwin? Don't need to know, just hang tight. Yer pizza's gonna be there in about twenty minutes. Try to make sure yer guests don't friggin eat ya in the meantime.\" You could hear laughter on the other end of the line, but he had no idea how close to the truth he was. You hung up and gave your guests the good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty minutes?\" Anna mopes with a drawn out voice. \"That's like forever away. I'm hungry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Anna, it's not so bad.\" Tanya chimed in. \"Besides, we've got good company to kill that time with.\" You decided to ease their mood and get them a round of drinks. Twenty minutes fly past and soon enough you hear a car parking in front of the house.</span></div></div>",

Tanya gave you some money and when the doorbell rang you opened up to a stack of pizzas. You quickly handed the delivery guy his money and a small tip for not keeping you waiting. It didn't take a psychic to know what would happen to you if the pizzas would be late. The room burst into toothy smiles as you walked in with the heavy tower. The greasy smell quickly got everyone salivating and you hand all the werewolves their three pizzas. You opened up your own dinner and looked around to see your guests enjoying their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly table manners weren't much of a thing in the monster world, because the feral vigor with which these girls attacked their dinner was unsettling. They tore through their meal by the time you'd only gotten halfway through yours. Even handing them three pizzas each didn't seem enough for their appetites. Soon you had to contend with a row of puppy eyes staring intermittently at you and the few slices of pizza you had left. You held strong for a while, but when there were still two pieces left you promised they could have them if they didn't tear down the room determining who were the lucky ones. Tanya was first to opt out, feeling she'd already gotten some extra by eating Dave. Seeing the stalemate forming and tensions rising you sighed with pity. You walked into the kitchen and cut the remaining slices in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now there's enough for all four of you.\" The werewolves didn't mind their smaller portions and quickly chewed through them. With all of their bellies full they sat back, patting their gut. Alicia was the first to let out a growling burp, soon followed by the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was tasty, little man. But now I think it's time we have some fun.\" Ana suggested. You gulp a little at the sultry tone of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I got it.\" Tanya interjected. \"How about some hide and seek, werewolf style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... Werewolf style?\" You repeated anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you hide and five evil werewolves are looking for you. And if we find you, then... well... you know.\" She licked her chops staring at you. Her menacing glare was interrupted by another belch. \"Actually, let's skip the eating you part and just sit on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, good one. Because you're the babysitter.\" Alicia chimed in with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, how's this. The faster we find him, the more of us get to sit on him at once.\" Ana added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea. For every minute you stay hidden, there'll be one less of us sitting on you when we find you. If you can last the full five minutes, you win. But you better watch out, we werewolves are really good at finding scared little boys.\" Tanya said with a broad smirk on her face. You weren't getting any choice in the matter as she closed her eyes and began to count down from thirty. The others also closed their eyes. Great, now you didn't just have to hide from Tanya, but from an entire pack of werewolves. With precious little time you had to think fast. What would be a good hiding place from them?</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re sweating bullets at this point. You silently shut your bedroom door and crawl underneath your bed. You could hear a muffled, \u201cReady or not, here we come\u201d, from downstairs. You gulp as you hope the werewolves don\u2019t find you. Being stuck under a bunch of chubby werewolf butts was not how you wanted to spend your night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought came to mind.

Evidently your tip-toeing wasn't anywhere near quiet enough for those sensitive ears of them. You could only hope your choice of hiding place would prevail longer. The prospect of just one of them sitting on you was bad enough. You hear a door open at the end of the hall. Thankfully these beasts didn't know which room is which yet. Muffled chatter came from the other side of your bedroom door. With a villainous laugh they flung open the next door, only to burst into laughing when they realized it was the bathroom. They laughed even harder when they opened up the upstairs toilet. But now they were out of doors. Only your bedroom remained. With a creeping slowness you watched the handle go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in horror as the werewolves were opening your door. Had it even been a minute already? The moment the door handle was down the door flung open, bright light from the hall flooding in. The sudden loud slam of the door hitting the wall almost made you yelp, but you kept quiet and shuffled back a little. More disturbing was the cavalcade of giggles and the distinct sniffing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, this is the place.\" Tanya cheerfully announced. \"This has got to be his bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, the toilet looked like a solid option too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shove it, Anna. Now, where could the little guy be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom under your bed you watched them fan out and explore your room. Slender legs and footpaws came down all around you as they gave a running commentary on your room. You didn't dare to even breathe for fear of giving away your position. With a loud rustle Tanya confirmed you weren't in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that would've been a bit too easy I guess. Hey Alicia, see if there's any monsters in his closet.\" The others all burst into giggles as Alicia opened up your closet and took a step inside. \"Yup, there's a big scary werewolf in here.\" The laughs continued, but they were rapidly running out of places to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, looks like he's not in here.\" Tanya announced. The others looked at her and saw her winking, but from your low, hidden vantage point you couldn't see anything above their waists. You couldn't believe your luck. Did these monsters really not bother to look under the bed? It almost seemed too good to be true. Your attention was so focused on your babysitter you didn't even see the pair of legs on the other side of your bed kneeling down. Suddenly a whisper from behind you caught you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who're we hiding from?\" An unknown voice asked. You absent-mindedly respond. \"These werewolves, dumbass.\" Only after your reply did things click and with a horrified glare you look behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna hadn't just kneeled down to take a look. She'd already seen you and crawled under the bed too, laying right next to you. With a cutesy little \"hello\" she lunged towards you, wrapping you in a hug. You scream in horror from the sudden assault, fighting in vain to free yourself from the werewolf. All things considered it was probably a good thing she held you so tightly, since you would've almost certainly banged your head against the underside of your bed in your panicked attempts to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" She shouted triumphantly as the others all peeked under the bed to see her wrestling the human into submission. After mere seconds of futile battle against the much stronger werewolf you give up. She slides out from under the bed, still tightly holding you against her. With little fanfare she stands up, throwing you over her shoulder. \"You're coming with us, little man. You've got work to do.\" Tanya announced with a smug grin on her face. She knew her finely honed senses would lead her straight to you. It was never even a contest. You were taken back to the living room and dropped on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you managed to stay hidden for a whole minute because Sherlock here thought you were living in a toilet. Still, that brings the total to... four butts in desperate need of a human to sit on. Buckle up, buddy.\"</span></div></div>",

Sorry I can't hear you.\" Tanya says and starts bouncing on your face while the other girls laugh at your humiliation. \"How does it smell brat ?\"  Tanya laughs and taunts, \"Hey Tanya, that's one good way to put him to sleep.\" Anna giggles, \"Yeah, but he's doomed if you like let one go or something hahaha.\" one of the other girls stated.

Are you hard of hearing or do you just have a two second attention span like most kids do nowadays?\u201d Dave\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cYou\u2019re Tanya? Geez, and I thought you were ugly before!\u201d The werewolf snapped her jaws at him, angrily, \u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve eaten you instead.\u201d You meekly step out into the backyard, \u201cTanya?\u201d The werewolf spins around and turns her threatening scowl into a smile, \u201cUh, hey kid. Sorry, about my little fit of anger. Just had to teach your little brother a lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement as you approach her. Dave continues to struggle against the dirt but it\u2019s no use, \u201cW-what are you gonna do now?\u201d Tanya chuckled, \u201cLeave you here. It\u2019s time out, remember?\u201d Dave struggled some more, \u201cYou can\u2019t just leave me here!?\u201d Tanya giggled and knelt down so her big muzzle was closer to Dave\u2019s face, \u201cWatch me little guy.\u201d Tanya stands back up and turns towards you\u2026</span></div></div>",

You were still in awe at her size. She was so big, she\u2019d even dwarf the tallest of basketball players! She must be around twice your height! \u201cUgh! Just a couple minutes in and this whole babysitting gig is a disaster. James was right. I\u2019m terrible at keeping secrets,\u201d she sighs, pulling out a lighter and a packet of cigarettes from her jacket. \u201cYou mind if I have a smoke?\u201d You shake your head, and she just smokes for a while in silence, relaxing while you stare at her unusual form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her breathtaking, glowing golden eyes glance open at you, a frown forming on her face as she stretched out her arms. \u201cWell, now you know, kid. All those monsters you hear about in folklore, read in fairy tales or see in horror movies\u2026 they\u2019re all real.\u201d You shuddered at the possibility of running into one of your most feared horror movie monsters. This was all so much to take in! Your whole view of the world was being changed! \u201cNow, that\u2019s probably a scary thought for ya. But don\u2019t worry! We\u2019re a peaceful bunch. Honestly, have you been watching the news recently? Humans are WAY more dangerous than monsters could ever be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, trying to take this all in. With a sigh, she crossed her arms, glancing at the ground. \u201cNow, I can trust you not to go trying to tell other people about us monsters, right?\u201d She pauses for a bit, thinking this through some more. \u201cWell, I mean, hell, you can tell whoever you want, actually. It\u2019s not like they\u2019d believe you. But if I catch you trying to get photographic evidence or something, oh ho ho ho, believe me, I will be ANGRY.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately shake your head. \u201cI-I wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d You insist, genuinely. \u201cI swear! I\u2019m not gonna tell ANYBODY about monsters!\u201d Whatever glory you\u2019d gain by exposing the existence of monsters DEFINITELY isn\u2019t worth angering literally everything that goes bump in the night. \u201cTo be honest, my brother might, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs, turning and looking at the boy who\u2019s still wriggling in the dirt, loudly complaining. \u201cYeah. He doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of keeping his mouth shut, huh?\u201d She said, giggling as she kicked some more dirt into his face with a hindpaw, just to shut him up for a moment as he coughed and sputtered, trying to spit the dirt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again,\u201d you laugh, starting to feel a little more comfortable around the massive monster girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whatever. Like I said, it\u2019s not like anyone will believe that brat!\u201d She chuckled, taking one last draw on her cigarette before stubbing it out. \u201cWe should head back inside. I don\u2019t want anyone seeing me out here.\u201d Glancing around, you realize that the werewolf is, indeed, so humongous that she could clearly be seen from all your neighbor\u2019s backyards! Luckily, nobody seemed to be out today, so the two of you were able to skulk back into the house unnoticed, completely ignoring Dave\u2019s loud protests. You\u2019re a little worried from him, but at the same time, you\u2019re happy to see him finally getting his comeuppance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, what\u2019s there to do around here?\u201d She stretched out as she walked into the house, returning to her regular, chilled-out self now that Dave wasn\u2019t constantly bothering her. She perked up when she noticed the Switch hooked up to the TV in the living room. \u201cAw, sweet! I\u2019ve been wanting to get one of these babies\u2026 but money\u2019s been tight, y\u2019know?\u201d For a moment, you were a little surprised that a werewolf would play video games\u2026 but then you remembered that, at her heart, she was just a normal teenage girl, just with an\u2026 unusual power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sorted through the games you had, and before you knew it, the two of you had the entire afternoon planned out. The two of you were gonna chill, watch movies, play video games, and order some \u2018monster food\u2019. You don\u2019t know what monster food entailed, but Tanya seemed to be enthusiastic about it, so you try to keep your hopes up. Eventually, while you were right in the middle of a Mario Kart match, you jump, startled, at the sound of talons on your roof as what sounds like an immense bird lands on your house! \u201cOh! That must be the delivery girl!\u201d Tanya smiled. You could hear the talons tear from off your roof as the giant avian jumped into the front lawn, and Tanya rushed out to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance out the front door curiously, only to be awed at the sight of an absolutely massive bird woman handing Tanya some grub, before practically blowing you off your feet with a flap of her massive wings as she takes off! You sit back on the couch as Tanya excitedly walks over, carrying the strange-looking basket of food under her arm. \u201cOhh! Trust me when I say monster cuisine is gonna blow your mind!\u201d She smiled, her tail wagging excitedly as she sits down next to you. \u201dFirst off, these are my absolute favorite\u2026 gummy boys!\u201d You tilt your head curiously as she produces a little container, pulling the lid open to reveal what seem to be gummy bears inside. Wait\u2026 these gummy bears look exactly like tiny people. And they\u2019re moving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in awe as you realized that the \u2018food\u2019 Tankya had presented was alive! Or, at least, it looked that way. The various \u2018gummy boys\u2019 in the container gazed up at the two of you, curious expressions on their faces\u2026 before you gasp when Tanya picks one up by his shirt collar, and plops him into her mouth! Before you can react, she gulps him down, and the bulge moves down her throat! \u201cYou just\u2026 ate him!\u201d You shudder, horrified!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry! They\u2019re not actually alive,\u201d she laughs, waving it off. \u201cThey\u2019re just magically enchanted to make it look like they are. They\u2019re basically like\u2026 robots. Tasty, magical robots. Wanna try one?\u201d She offers you one of the \u2018gummy boys\u2019, but you just gag at the thought, declining her offer. Sentient or not, they look too human-like for comfort! In response, she just giggles and shrugs. \u201cHeh! More for me, then!\u201d With that, she happily wolfs down the rest of the \u2018gummy boys\u2019, bulge after bulge travelling down her throat as she swallows two or three of them at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you\u2019re a little fascinated by the sight\u2026 but before you know it, they\u2019ve all disappeared into her belly. She caps off her satisfying meal by unleashing a thunderous belch right into your face, before giggling and blushing a bit when she saw you gag. \u201cSorry!\u201d She chuckled, before reaching back into the basket. \u201cOkay, so I get you don\u2019t like the gummy boys, cause they do look sorta like you. But this next thing, I guarantee you\u2019ll like!\u201d With that, she pulls out...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re sending Hera? Great!\u201d The werewolf quickly hung up the phone and sighed, looking down at her tattered clothes, \u201cAnd these were my business clothes too.\u201d She then noticed you still gapping at her, she chuckled, showing off her huge knife-like teeth, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you kid? You look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost\u2026 or a werewolf.\u201d There was an uncomfortable silence until she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s me! Tanya!

For a brief moment, it looked like he was still laughing, but when he realized no sound was coming from his mouth, he began to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to him?\" You ask, astounded at what you just saw. \"Just a little silencing charm.\" Said Sabrina \"Basically its like a mute button on a remote control, but for people.\" Now it was your turn to laugh as you watched your brother try to shout and scream as hard as he could, but to no avail, as though his voice box had been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" You ask, once you've caught your breath. \"Oh, it's just a simple spell. I've been studying magic for a few years now, and I've gotten pretty good at it, if I do say so myself.\" Sabrina then kneels down to Dave's height and says \"Here's the rules, shorty.

But do anything to anger me or get on my nerves, and I'll cast an even worse spell on you, got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave just glared at Sabrina in silence  for a few moments before reluctantly nodding. \"Good.\" Sabrina turns to you and says \"So, any ideas on what to do while we wait for your folks?\" </span></div></div>",

We tolerate each other but monsters have the same fights and issues as you humans have with each other. That\u2019s why so many of us come to the human world to escape all the petty drama and problems of this world.\u201d Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow....this is amazing can we explore some!\u201d Dave asked as he jumped up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry boys...The land of monsters has one strict rule above all others....no humans allowed.

The instant the tv shut off, your brother let out a whiney  cry of \"HEY!\" \"Listen to me, you little brat!\" Said Vanessa, getting madder by the moment. \"I'm in charge while your parents are away, so what I say goes, got it?\" Much to your surprise, Dave actually gave Vanessa the finger in response to her demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected her to lay him over her lap and give the brat a hard paddling for that, but instead she grabs him by the shoulders and glares into his eyes. Your brother stood transfixed by her gaze, until she said a single command. \"Sleep!\" In an instant, your brother was in dreamland, and she let him fall to the floor with a light thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you-\" You tried to ask, unable to believe what you just saw. But she cuts you off \"Nevermind that, just go to your room and keep quiet. Do whatever you want, just stay there and be silent. Okay?\" You definitely weren't going to argue with her, you you quickly run upstairs. When you get to your room, you peek out the crack of your door to find  Vanessa...</span></div></div>",

If this keeps up, I\u2019m gonna be stuffed before the nights even half over. And it looks like Mr. Bucawk will be too.\u201d You both scream and run, Dave tearing up as you feel the chicken\u2019s hot breath on your neck.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were already nervous enough when some weird clown woman walked into your house all of a sudden\u2026 but even your idea of the \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 wasn\u2019t as bad as THIS! This was like something straight out of a horror movie! You could hear the chicken\u2019s warm breath against the back of your head, and you knew it was only a hair\u2019s breadth behind you, cackling and chirping like some crazed beast! You had no idea how this sort of thing was possible\u2026 it violated everything you thought you knew about reality\u2026 but you could ponder THAT once you weren\u2019t at risk of becoming bird food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little brother stuck right by your side as you sprinted towards the stairs, hoping that the massive chicken would have a difficult time navigating them\u2026 and indeed, it did, ending up clucking angrily as it was stuck at the bottom of the stairs. What you forgot to account for was that one of the stairs was half an inch higher than it should be! This is something your dad promised to fix, but never got around to. It\u2019d been a pain in your behind for months\u2026 but now, it was potentially lethal, as both you and Dave both simultaneously stub your toes on the stairs in your panicked rushing, and end up faceplanting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, the two of you end up rolling and sliding down the carpeted staircase\u2026 and with a smug smirk, the chicken leans down and slides open its massive beak, its mouth waiting for you at the bottom of the stairs! You both let out panicked screams as you try to grab onto the railings\u2026 but it\u2019s no use! All you can hear is Jenny\u2019s uproarious laughter as you both fall right into the massive chicken\u2019s mouth! Triumphantly, the bird rears back, two pairs of kicking legs hanging from its maw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both crying out in panic, thinking that the chicken was going to chew you up with its massive, powerful beak\u2026 but the reality was almost scarier! Instead of chewing you, it just brought you deeper into its maw\u2026 and your heads ended up slipping into its cavernous throat! Your panic reached its peak when you realized the massive avian wa going to SWALLOW YOU WHOLE! \u201cMm\u2026 this is the most scrumptious fear I\u2019ve had all month! Sure am glad I took this job!\u201d You could faintly hear that sadistic clown giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never particularly liked the smell of chickens, but the stink within its beak was the worst of all, especially as you\u2019re covered in its saliva as it prepares to gulp you down. Jenny gluts herself on your terror as the chicken takes another gulp, its throat pulling you in up to your chests, as your knees start to enter its beak. It waves your legs around playfully, savoring its meals\u2026 before, with one last gulp, your feet disappear into its beak completely, as you\u2019re sealed entirely within the grossness and warmth of its body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts throat squeezes painfully tightly around the two of you as you\u2019re reduced to a massive bulge, travelling down its long neck. Eventually, you\u2019re deposited into its big, roomy stomach completely, as the chicken let's out a satisfied cluck. \u201cHave fun in there, boys!\u201d She smiles, poking the chicken\u2019s big, swaying, feathery gut as she feeds on the terror of the boys within. You were both kicking and pounding against the walls, crying out in terror, believing you were about to be slowly digested!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 but wait. As you slowly tuckered yourselves out, you began to notice something. There wasn\u2019t any acid in here! After thinking about this whole situation for a moment, you finally put two and two together. \u201cDave! Dave! Wait!\u201d You grab him by the shoulders, preventing him from struggling for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re not actually digesting! See? It\u2019s safe in here!\u201d He pauses, looking around, and although he was still shaken up, he seems to calm down a bit when he realizes there indeed wasn\u2019t any acid gurgling away at you. \u201cIf we wanna defeat that clown\u2026 we just have to not be afraid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d He asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think she\u2019s feeding off our fear somehow!\u201d You say, judging based on the weird things the clown has been saying. \u201cSo\u2026 whatever she does\u2026 we just have to not be afraid!\u201d He looks at you, a disoriented expression on his face as your words sink in. When they do, the clown claps, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp\u2026 looks like you figured me out!\u201d She chuckled a bit. \u201cSee, this is why I don\u2019t tend to babysit older kids! They figure the whole thing out too quickly!\u201d She crosses her arms as she leans against the chicken\u2019s big, round gut. \u201cJojo, let \u2018em out!\u201d She snaps her fingers, and immediately, you\u2019re roughly pulled back up the chicken\u2019s gullet, groaning as its throat squeezes you again. Before you know it, you\u2019re dropped back onto the ground, covered in saliva\u2026 and when you look behind you, you see that Jojo is just a regular rubber chicken again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re both relieved to have survived your trip to an avian\u2019s gut\u2026 but you quiet down when the clown looms over you. \u201cStill, I\u2019d hate to end the fun so soon!\u201d She smiled warmly, before announcing the next step of her plans...</span></div></div>",

Your voice is so booming, it breaks windows! He looks ready to flee, but it\u2019s too late - your maw descends upon him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let's out a muffled cry as you close your jaws around him, lifting your head and letting out an amused hum as you feel him writhe around in your slobbery maw! He punches at the side of your cheeks, making little bulges\u2026 but ultimately, he\u2019s so tiny compared to you, there\u2019s really nothing he can do. You swish him around in your mouth with your tongue, just to torment him some more. It was nice to finally be able to give him his comeuppance\u2026 and besides, he was the most delicious thing you\u2019ve ever tasted for some reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all fun and games\u2026 at least, until one of his punches landed right on your uvula! Your maw shuddered open as you let out a gag, your entire head shuddering for a while as a nauseous feeling overtook you. Once the feeling subsided\u2026 you realize you couldn\u2019t feel Dave in your maw anymore! You try looking around for him\u2026 only for the realization to slowly sink in\u2026 you\u2019ve accidentally swallowed him WHOLE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 oh God!

You look down at your round, scaly belly, and you notice he\u2019s so small, he doesn\u2019t even make the slightest bulge\u2026 but still, you can feel him deep in there, indignantly punching and kicking the walls. He didn\u2019t seem to be running out of air or getting digested or anything. \u201cWait, so\u2026 he\u2019s going to be okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry about him. Monsters have full control over their digestive systems, so they don\u2019t digest anything unless they specifically want to,\u201d Jenny shrugs, nonchalantly. \u201cSo that brat - unfortunately - isn\u2019t going to end up as dragon fat any time soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I let him out?\u201d You ask, not fully trusting the clown for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what? You\u2019re going to let him out ALREADY? After he\u2019s tortured you all these years?\u201d She almost looks disappointed. \u201cYou\u2019re missing out on your once-in-a-lifetime chance to get revenge! I have a better idea; why don\u2019t you keep him in there, and let me feed off his fear. And in return, I\u2019ll take you to see The Land of Monsters! A big ol\u2019 man-eating beast like yourself should fit in perfectly there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a moment. Apparently, he wasn\u2019t going to be harmed in there\u2026 and feeling him move inside your stomach was actually rather pleasant, and it felt great knowing you were getting your revenge, and there was nothing he could do about it.

You\u2019d probably be terrified here\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that you were so much bigger than most everybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good you swallowed \u2018im, really! Your belly\u2019s probably the safest place to be around here,\u201d Jenny laughs. \u201cA boy like him probably wouldn\u2019t go on for long here before being snatched up and gobbled down by some demoness or something.\u201d You shuddered at the thought, laying a hand of your scaly gut and hearing the movements deep inside. Dave definitely doesn\u2019t seem to like it in there, but at least he seems to be safe. With his struggles, he\u2019s been tiring himself out, and soon all he can do is try to get comfortable inside your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you find yourself staring up at the most ornate, odd and fancy restaurant building you\u2019ve ever seen! It almost seems non-euclidian in its architecture, a towering silhouette against the scarlet sky. \u201cNow THIS is the best joint around, for all connoisseurs of monster cuisine! Of course, nothing\u2019s tastier than spoiled brats...\u201d Jenny calls as she disappears through the double doors into the restaurant. \u201c... but the food here is the second best thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors are big, but still, you have to fold your wings behind your back and crawl just to fit through the door. Once you were inside, though, you were stunned by the sheer size of the place! You could hear a cacophony of spooky voices as every monster you\u2019ve ever heard legends of, or even seen in movies, was all here! You gawked as you stumbled past an xenomorph flirting with a purple people eater\u2026 a grey alien doing tricks to impress his rakasha girlfriend\u2026 this place really had EVERYTHING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh\u2026 it smells in here\u2026\u201d You groan. A barrage of the worst stench you\u2019ve ever smelt was pouring from the kitchen! Although, even as you scrunch your face up on impulse at the stench\u2026 it\u2019s actually not all that unpleasant. In fact, you actually sort of liked how bad it smelled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmells so GOOD, you mean!\u201d Jenny said with a sway of her hips. \u201cEverything you found gross as a human, you\u2019ll find wonderful as a monster! Trust me!\u201d You walked up to the counter\u2026 only to see the restaurant was being manned by an absolutely massive kraken woman, who was actually a little larger than you were! You were in awe at her size, as her single huge eye glanced down half-interested at the eager clown woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have some fried fingers, a royale with cheese, and some gummy boys for the road,\u201d Penny smiled, before pointing over her shoulder at you. \u201cAnd a landfill burger for my friend here!\u201d The kraken had a bored expression on her face as she rung her up, before the two of you found a table. Jenny took a chair, while you kind of had to awkwardly lay down on the floor, waiting for them to bring you your orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gawked around the restaurant in awe, you couldn\u2019t help but notice a gnoll woman eagerly rubbing her lips as she looked over her meal. An entire buffet was laid out for her - apparently, judging by her weight, she was a big eater. The centerpiece of that buffet? Well, lying there on a tray, tied up with an apple stuffed in his mouth, was a boy about Dave\u2019s size! He struggled against his bindings, his protests muffled by the apple, as the hyena woman licked her lips as she looked down at him with hunger in her eyes, a big bib on her neck reading \u2018EAT YOU\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only watch as the gnoll slips her \u2018meals\u2019 feet into her mouth, cooing at the flavor before pulling them into her throat with a gulp. All the boy could do was squirm futilely as he was brought deeper and deeper in with every gulp, the gnoll\u2019s slobbery lips coming up to his waist in no time at all, the ropes binding him rendering him seemingly helpless. All he could do was wriggle as her hungry jaws travelled over his belly, and then his chest, until most of his body has disappeared into that darkness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce only his head was sticking out from between her jaws, he finally managed to spit that apple out! \u201cNo! Please! Not again! Somebody! Help-! Mph!\u201d His loud, panicked shouting fills the restaurant for a moment, but it was too little, too late. One last gulp was all it took to reduce the boy to a bulge in her throat, and then, her belly. She let out a thunderous belch as she leaned back, her hands wrapping around her much rounder gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that, everyone! This one\u2019s a fighter!\u201d She sheepishly apologized to the other customers after that loud outburst, although most of them seemed to be either amused by it, or indifferent towards it. Even now, you could see the hand and footprints of the boy inside, as the gnoll sits back seeming ecstatic at the feeling, her tail wagging behind her. \u201cTasty, though. My compliments to the chef!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, a little disturbed by the sight\u2026 but you had to remind yourself that at least that boy wasn\u2019t getting digested. Heck, it\u2019s not like you even had any room to judge, considering you\u2019ve just eaten your own brother yourself! Still, it begged the question of why the boy was even here. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they served PEOPLE at this restaurant,\u201d you noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. They serve pretty much anything you can imagine,\u201d Jenny laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what was that kid even doing here, in The Land of Monsters?\u201d You ask. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just for, like\u2026 monsters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sometimes, when a brat is as bad as, say, your little brother, their parents send them here for a few months to be properly \u2018disciplined\u2019,\u201d Jenny explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice place for a brat to be, for sure! There\u2019ll be exposed to their worst fears\u2026 eaten over and over and over again\u2026 basically tormented 24/7! They always end up becoming little angels, though. The brattiness gets scared right out of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at the thought\u2026 and yet, the more you think about it, maybe some of them do have it coming. Like Dave, for example. You couldn\u2019t help but like the thought of letting these monsters give him the discipline he needs, so he\u2019ll stop being the utter, nightmarish thorn in your side that he always seems to be. Before you can contemplate this some more, your food\u2019s finally ready! Jenny gets a more traditional meal laid out for her\u2026 while you have an entire table wheeled over to you, boasting the largest hamburger you\u2019ve ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time has to be at least a thousand pounds! Even for someone of your sheer size, it was definitely a filling meal! However, the more you smelled and analyzed it, the more you learned why it was called the landfill burger. Pulling the buns back, the burger was completely full of rancid garbage and rotten food! The stench was absolutely overwhelming! \u201cJenny! Is this supposed to be food? It\u2019s disgusting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby! Just give it a try,\u201d she rolled her eyes as she chomped down on some weird french fries, which looked ominously finger-shaped. \u201cTrust me, now that you\u2019re a monster, you\u2019re gonna find this sort of food delicious!\u201d You\u2019re about to protest\u2026 but the awful stench of the burger is sort of appetizing for some reason. And the more you look at all the garbage filling it, the more your stomach starts to growl\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you work up the courage to take a bite\u2026 only to smile as the flavor delights your tastebuds! Sure, it wasn\u2019t as tasty as Dave was\u2026 but it was still the second tastiest thing you\u2019ve ever eaten! \u201cMmmm! This IS pretty good!\u201d You smile, chewing and swallowing your meal before going in for another bite. You were soon chomping happily away at the burger, enjoying the new flavor! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dave\u2019s struggles intensified as he was covered in rancid, disgusting garbage inside your stomach! But it\u2019s not like you cared about that. In fact, back when you were a human, you were used to how bratty Dave was\u2026 but now that you\u2019re a monster, it\u2019s starting to make you angrier and angrier to think about. How DARE he be so rude, so inconsiderate, so selfish all the time? It was almost like your natural monster instincts were driving you to want to punish the brat! So, covering him in garbage inside your stomach was immensely cathartic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the burger was gone, and your stomach was now a lot fuller\u2026 and a lot grosser. You let out a satisfied sigh as you rubbed your scaly gut, your tongue hanging from the side of your maw. Now that you\u2019ve finished dinner, what\u2019s next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, you\u2019d be too self-conscious\u2026 but here in The Land of Monsters, you have no hesitations letting out a satisfied belch as you walk out of the restaurant. After all, most of the monsters around here seem to pretty gassy after a good meal, and they don\u2019t bother to hide it. Now that you\u2019re full, though, one question lingers on your mind. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d You glance at Jenny, your massive wings coming unfurled. \u201cDo you\u2026 do you think I could fly with these things?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new wings of yours are big, but you\u2019re not sure they\u2019re big enough to carry your massive form. Still, Jenny just rolls her eyes. \u201cWell, duuuuuh! A dragon that can\u2019t even fly\u2026 why, that\u2019d be a sorry sight!\u201d She said. \u201cGo ahead and stretch your wings while you have \u2018em, buddy. I\u2019ll wait for you right here by the restaurant.\u201d You were a little nervous as you trotted away, preparing to fly. You have no idea how flying works! What if you just immediately fell into a building or something and got into huge trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you couldn\u2019t chicken out now! You closed your eyes and held your breath\u2026 before taking a big flap of your wings! You let out a little gasp as they propel you into the air! However, even though you\u2019ve never flown before, your dragon instincts kick in immediately, and you start flapping yours wings until you\u2019re hovering in the air. You let out a little, relieved chuckle, realizing you\u2019re really flying for the first time! You hover there for a while, flapping your wings while you build up your courage\u2026 before lifting yourself into the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little nerve-wracking, flying so far from the ground. Even with your thick scales, if you fell from this height, you\u2019d get seriously hurt! Still, at the same time, it was extremely liberating. I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to be able to fly whenever they want, wherever they want? You were pretty much living the dream! Now that you got an aerial view of The Land of Monsters, you were starting to learn a lot about this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the whole \u2018land\u2019 was just a massive, gothic city built on a big, flat hunk of rock. The rest of the realm was just a hazy red void, stretching on infinitely. You were fascinated by the sight, wondering how exactly this realm came to be, and what its history was. As you hovered there, however, you were suddenly distracted by a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re really bad at flying, pal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, a harpy lady\u2019s landed on your back, sitting on your shoulders! She was about 7 feet tall, which still paled in comparison to you. You blushed at her teasing, as she giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s my first time\u2026\u201d You whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat? A dragon that\u2019s never flown before?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s not that! It\u2019s just...\u201d You paused, wondering if you should tell her this, before giving into the humiliation. \u201cThis\u2026 this is only my first day as a dragon. I was only transformed an hour ago\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the harpy\u2019s mood soured. She hopped off your back, flapping your wings as she hovered in the air in front of you. \u201cOh. I see Jenny\u2019s up to her old tricks again,\u201d she scowled. \u201cYou know, transformed or not, HUMANS aren\u2019t allowed in The Land of Monsters without the express approval of the queen! Which I\u2019m 99% certain you don\u2019t have. So I\u2019m gonna turn you in, and then you\u2019re gonna be sorry, brat~\u201d She stuck her tongue out at you, before flying off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped in your chest! You didn\u2019t know being here was illegal! Were you going to end up like that boy you saw in the restaurant\u2026 just being constantly tormented by gross, powerful monsters? A fight-or-flight response kicked in as the harpy started to soar away, as you tried to figure out how you were going to avoid getting thrown into some sort of monster jail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a storm seems to be brewing in the scarlet sky above...</span></div></div>",

If she turned you in for trespassing, would you suffer the same fate that boy from before was\u2026 being constantly tormented by every monster in the realm, without relief? Worse, since you weren\u2019t sent here for a specific amount of time, did that mean they\u2019d be able to keep you here\u2026 forever? That thought chilled you to your very bones! You knew you had to find a way out of this situation\u2026 but how? You considered fleeing\u2026 but then, another part of you demanded you prevent the harpy from ratting you out in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy was flying luxuriously through the air\u2026 until she suddenly let out a bird-like screech as she felt your massive, scaly hand wrap around her! She was letting out angry little shouts as you held her up to your scaly face. \u201cH-hey! What are you doing? Let go of me, you big stupid lizard!\u201d As you glanced at her, wondering what to do next\u2026 your stomach growled once more, despite already being filled to the brim. You suppose you do, indeed, have one safe place to keep her. She let out a squeal as you slid open your massive jaws. \u201cNo! Don\u2019t you dare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026\u201d You whimper\u2026 before unceremoniously stuffing the bird woman into your jaws! She immediately tries to get up and hop out, but you smack your jaws shut before she can, sealing her inside your maw completely. You push her around your maw with your tongue for a while as she squirms and wriggles, trying your best to maneuver her into a good position to be swallowed down. Eventually, she slid to the back of your tongue, pressed against the back of your throat\u2026 and despite her efforts to hold onto your tongue, your powerful throat pulls her down all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan as you feel that squirming bulge slip down your scaly throat, before she disappears completely into your massive belly, getting squeezed in with all the horrible garbage in there. \u201cOh no, oh no\u2026\u201d You whimper, contemplating the situation. \u201cNow I\u2019m REALLY in trouble!\u201d Trespassing was bad enough\u2026 but eating one of the monsters here? Now you DEFINITELY couldn\u2019t get caught! If they caught you eating one of their own kind, you couldn\u2019t even imagine the sorts of horrors they\u2019d subject you to! \u2026 although, after knowing that monsters like to eat kids so much, being able to eat a monster as payback was kind of cathartic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, adrenaline was rushing through your veins as you start to fly again, heading back towards that restaurant. You have the diner in your sights as you draw near. \u201cG-gotta find Jenny. She\u2019ll know what to- YIPE!\u201d Your heart leaps as your ears are wracked by the boom of thunder, as a massive, red lightning bolt slams into the restaurant right before your eyes, causing a huge explosion! You look up, and notice that that ominous red storm is in full force\u2026 and you can hear similarly explosive lightning cracking all over the city! \u201cOh crap! Ohhh crap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, seeing the storm rain lightning down on the little city beneath you. Building after building seemed to be destroyed by the onslaught from the skies! \u201cOh my God\u2026!\u201d You mutter to yourself, wondering just what kind of storm this could possibly be. You wonder if being up so high makes you a target\u2026 but it was too late to fly back now. \u201cAuuugghhh!\u201d You let out a pained cry as one of those lightning bolts cracks right into your back, your entire body tensing up as a strange, overpowering energy shoots through you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t actually hurt you\u2026 instead, it just drains you of your energy. Still, you\u2019re panicking as you\u2019re sent flying down to Earth, without any energy left to beat your wings. All you can do is let out a terrified roar and brace yourself for the impact! All you can see is the ground looming every nearer with every passing moment\u2026 and, in the next moment, darkness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 \u201cGet UP, you big idiot!\u201d Your slumber is interrupted by the feeling of tiny hands beating along your side, along with the sound of your brother\u2019s voice. You let out a groan, clutching your head with a clawed hand, groaning as a headache wracks you. You felt yourself lying on some cold, cave floor, hearing what sounded like muffled rain and thunder outside. Your huge eyes lazily slide open\u2026 only to see Dave and that harpy, still covered in garbage, looking down at you angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a yelp as Dave reached forward and poked you in the eye! You immediately reared back, clutching your eye with a claw. \u201cTHAT\u2019S for eating me and covering me with garbage, you shithead!\u201d He loudly protested. You sighed, guessing you probably had that one coming. Still, you were wondering just what on Earth was going on! Looking around, you seemed to be in some type of subterranean cavern, that storm still raging outside. Strange, exotic glowing flora covered the cavern, and bioluminescent streams ran through its chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the harpy rolled her eyes and stepped forward to explain things to you. \u201cLook, pal. When you crashed, you smashed into the ground SO hard that you ended up burrowing into this little underground cave system here,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cProbably a good thing, really. I\u2019ve never seen a soul storm this bad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed down at the two of them with a thousand questions flying through your head\u2026 one chief among them. \u201cHow did you two\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... escape from that PUTRID stomach of your\u2019s? Well, while you were unconscious, crawling up your gullet was a simple enough task,\u201d the harpy gagged at the memory of being trapped in your grimy gut. \u201cNow, you BETTER not have been planning to digest us in there, or I swear-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Of course not! I would never!\u201d You stuttered, shaking your head. You take a moment to try and calm yourself down, glancing around the cave. It seems like you were going to be stuck in here for the time being, while that \u2018soul storm\u2019 raged outside. You had no idea what it was, but it seemed that rain and lightning drastically drained people\u2019s energy for some reason, and that lightning was able to level buildings in a single crack. You can\u2019t imagine how much property damage was being done! You hope nobody\u2019s gotten hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it\u2019s all a matter of what to do while you wait it out in this cavern...</span></div></div>",

Soon enough you\u2019re back to being a young, human teen. You huff and puff from the odd experience, now feeling weird being human again. You turn to Jenny and smile, \u201cThanks.\u201d Before Jenny could bring you two home you feel a huge clawed hand wrap around you. You and your little brother are hoisted up to the scowling snout of a dragon, dressed in a uniform similar to how human police dress, he must be an officer. The dragon snorted in your face and talked in a deep, rumbling voice, \u201cWell, well, well, what are you two boys doing here? Did your parents send you here for punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble on your words, trying to think of something to say. The huge, scaly face of the giant dragon terrified you.

The dragon rumbled, \u201cI\u2019ll ask again, are you here because your parents are punishing you or do I have to book you two for trespassing?\u201d</span></div></div>",

A tall pink woman was standing in the doorway, nearly eight feet in height, she towered over you. She had thick hips, a large bubble butt, and round breasts covered by a bra and a tight-fitting pair of shorts. The weird part is that her bra and shorts seemed to be apart of her body\u2026 and her whole body seemed to be made of a translucent, pink, jello-like slime. Before you could say anything the slime woman cooed, \u201cOh, aren\u2019t you the cutest, little human.\u201d She knelt down and pinched your cheek, leaving a slimy residue.

I mean, all ya\u2019 gotta do is look under your bed and in your closet.\u201d So you weren\u2019t crazy when you told your parents there was a monster under your bed when you were eight. Sylvia gestured for you to let her in and you did. She stepped into the house and looked around the place while you shut the door. It was shocking, a monster for a babysitter. Sylvia then stepped into the living room where you\u2019re brother was playing videogames, \u201cHey there, little guy, wanna hug?\u201d Dave turned around and sneered, \u201cWho the hell are you, lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia smiled, \u201cI\u2019m your babysitter, silly.

Dave kicked and squirmed as he started to sink into Sylvia\u2019s jelly-like body, \u201cHey stop, you\u2019re eating me!\u201d Sylvia giggled, \u201cNo I\u2019m not, it\u2019s called a hug!\u201d You wanted to stop this but thought it would be the perfect revenge for all the headache\u2019s your little brother has given you.</span></div></div>",

She was so huge, she had to lean her head down lest her horns scrape against the ceiling\u2026 and from her tone, expression and mannerisms, she had already had a little too much to drink tonight. Hearing what she said, your heart dropped as you looked down at her massive scaly tummy, which swayed beneath her! She was even bigger than Nancy, so if that naga could swallow you up, this dragoness definitely could! \u201cN-no! I\u2019m not a\u2026 party snack!\u201d You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaat?\u201d She giggled, visibly woozy as she looked down on you with a dopey, amused expression. She apparently can\u2019t hear your tiny voice over the blaringly loud EDM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you\u2019re not supposed to eat me!\u201d You repeat, cupping your hands around your mouth as you shout out at the top of your lungs, hoping to clear up this misunderstanding before it\u2019s too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to GREET you?\u201d She tilted her head, visibly confused by this. \u201cWell, why not? What\u2019s wrong with saying hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You crossed your arms, visibly annoyed by the continuing misunderstanding. \u201cI said 'EAT me'!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEAT you?\u201d She laughed, a little surprised. \u201cWell, you\u2019re being awfully insistent, little man\u2026 but sure, if you say so!\u201d Before you could respond, she had one of her massive claws gently wrapped around your torso, easily hoisting you into the air with her terrifying strength! Your heart dropped as you found yourself being dangled over her massive maw, and looming, cavernous throat! Her insides seemed to be all purple, notably, just like her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! No, no, no, no-\u201c You screamed at the top of your lungs, but it was too little, too late. In another moment, the dragoness simply drops your tiny body into her massive, powerful maw, snapping her jaws shut to seal you inside. You let out a frightened whimper as her tongue pressed you against the roof of her mouth, then swished you around against her cheeks as she toyed with you in her maw. She smiled as she savored your delicious flavor! Just like the fairy tales and storybooks claimed, it seems kids really were a monster\u2019s favorite food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you were completely coaked in her thick, sticky, gross saliva, and her tongue was starting to press you towards her throat! You let out a nervous yelp, grabbing onto her uvula and hanging on for dear life\u2026 but that only caused her to gag, making you lose your grip, and immediately descend into her depths! Instead of squeezing around you like you expected a throat would, the dragoness\u2019 throat was more like a water slide\u2026 you just slid down along the smooth, purple flesh at an incredible speed, before finally landing in her stomach proper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That really hit the spot!\u201d She laughed, patting her massive, round belly, as she feels you slip easily inside. You really were just like a bite-sized treat to her; you were so small, you didn\u2019t even make the tiniest of bulges in her belly. In fact, her stomach was incredibly roomy, so big you can stand up and walk around inside of her! Of course, it was hard to keep your balance, with her belly constantly swaying beneath the dragoness as she walked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon landing in her stomach, you start pressing against and kicking at the walls. \u201cP-please! Let me out!\u201d You cry, frightened. But unfortunately, her stomach walls were far too thick for you to be heard, and all your struggles amounted to was giving the dragoness a relaxing belly massage. Soon, you just tuckered yourself out, and just sat there in her tummy, leaned against a wall, thinking about this whole situation. It seems that she wasn\u2019t going to digest you, at least\u2026 but it was still pretty gross and uncomfortable in here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do is sit back and wait it out, the EDM now just a very faint cacophony in the background, drowned out by the sound of her heartbeat and the gurgling of her stomach. Eventually, it started to seem rather relaxing in there. You ended up taking a nap in the dragoness\u2019 stomach while the party resumed...</span></div></div>",

You forgot what was happening as well. In your slumber you dreamt of sailing there high seas for the first time, a dream that was assisted by the wet insides of the dragon belly and the sway of her gut. While the dragoness twerked and bounced her scaly butt to a bass-heavy EDM banger you dreamt of a dangerous hurricane on the horizon of your ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the party ended. All of Nancy\u2019s monster friends went home. It was midnight. The kids parents wouldn\u2019t be home until at least 1 a.m. maybe 2 a.m. Nancy stretched her arms and patted the bulge Dave made in her gut, \u201cAnd a good night was had by all\u2026 well\u2026 at least us monsters. I don\u2019t know about you kids. But you\u2019re really only good at being monster snacks so\u2026 who really cares, am I right?\u201d Nancy slithered up the stairs and opened the door to your bedroom, flicking on the light, \u201cHey kid, party\u2019s over, you can wake back up now if you\u2019d like.\u201d The naga gasped when she realized you weren\u2019t there. Nancy looked around in a panick. She bent over and wretched her stomach, barfing up Dave, waking him up from his stinky, wet slumber in her belly. Nancy shook Dave like a ragdoll, \u201cKid? Boy? Whatever your name is? Where is your brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave choked, coughing up some of Nancy\u2019s drool, \u201cHow should I know? You ate me.\u201d Dave then sneered, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re\u2026 eating your words, huh?\u201d Nancy growled and yelled, \u201cLook, you\u2019re brother is missing. If he were to leave, where would he go?\u201d Dave shook his head, \u201cMy older brother wouldn\u2019t leave the house. Mom and Dad taught us to always call them if there was an emergency at home.\u201d Nancy nearly shouted in Dave\u2019s ear, \u201cOk-alright-cool. So where would the phone be?\u201d Dave replied coldly, \u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d Nancy looked down the staircase and towards the kitchen realizing that was where the party was. There were no parents coming yet. Which means\u2026 one of her friends left with him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only had, at best, two or three hours until your parents got home, she couldn\u2019t let your parents find out she wasn\u2019t human, she\u2019d never get a job here again, on top of that she had to find one of their kids, probably inside one of her friend\u2019s stomachs. Nancy slapped her hands over her eyes and shrieked, \u201cTHIS! NIGHT! SUCKS!\u201d Nancy\u2019s near panic attack was interrupted by Dave\u2019s snickering, \u201cWhat are you laughing at your hairless rat!?\u201d Dave giggled, \u201cYou\u2019re the worst babysitter ever. You really suck at this.\u201d Nancy scowled and before Dave knew it he was reintroduced to Nancy\u2019s slimy mouth. The large naga popped him into her mouth like a piece of candy as he protested, bulging out her cheeks nicely. She tilted her head back and gulped, sending the boy down her bulging neck again and into her snake belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA satisfied belch escaped her lips as she patted the wiggling bulge under her scales, \u201cNothing like seconds, huh, little guy.\u201d The naga pulled out her phone and started furiously calling up every friend she had in her phone book that she invited. Unfortunately, the dragoness that ate you was a friend of one of Nancy\u2019s friends that dragged her along. Nancy slithered down the stairs and out into the night, diligently talking on her phone, \u201cHello, Jamie? It\u2019s Nancy? Did you happen to see a human kid wandering around the party?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the tipsy dragoness had now become a plastered dragoness as she stumbled down the hallway of her apartment complex, Ghouls &amp; Acres. She nearly tripped over herself, grabbing her doorknob for support. She belched, tasting it and smacking her lips she muttered, \u201cDrunk food is\u2026 THA BEST FEWD!\u201d The dragoness giggled to herself as it took her a good five minutes to fish her keys out of her butt-pocket, fit them into the door and jiggle the lock open. Once inside the drunk dragoness screamed into her empty apartment, \u201cHome sweet home, BITCHES! Another killer party! Can\u2019t wait for Jakes frat party tomorrow\u2026 ugh, then I gotta study for my Monster V.S. Human Political Science Exam\u2026 gross!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness grabbed a large 64 oz. can of Coke, although it was rebranded for monsters as Croak! The huge reptile slumped herself onto her couch and turned her tv on. There was never anything good on at 12:30 a.m. but she channel surfed until she came upon on of those cheesy sitcoms \u2018Honey, I Married A Monster\u2019. The show was about some human man (played by a vampire actor) who unwittingly marries a crocodile woman. A huge croc woman steps into a kitchen set with a leash hanging between her lips while her human husband cooks and ogles her, \u201cHoney! Did you eat the neighbor\u2019s dog again?\u201d A laugh track played as the croc woman shrugged, \u201cMaybe.\u201d The human husband scoffed at her, \u201cWell that\u2019s the fifth one this year.\u201d A louder laugh track played. The croc shrugged again, seemingly chewing on whatever was in her mouth, \u201cBeats the time I ate the neighbor\u2019s son. He was real mad at me for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness\u2019 eyes widened and she put a scaled paw on her ample chest, \u201cOh my god, me too. That\u2019s so relatable. I still can\u2019t believe that creep had the nerve to yell at me for swallowing his son whole. Like these are some real first world monster problems. UURRRPP!\u201d She gave her belly a slap as she cracked the soda can open and started downing it. In your dream, your ship had been wrecked and you were up to your neck in sea-water, with only a few scrambled pieces of driftwood as your life raft. In reality your unconscious form was floating in a small pool of beer, vodka, and now soda at the bottom of a dragon\u2019s stomach. The belly slap and the soda trickling onto your hair woke you up, \u201chuh, wha\u2026 HEY! HEY! WHERE AM I? LET ME OUT! LET ME GO!\u201d You scream as you kick and punch against the slick, purple belly walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness burped a few more times and even let out a nasty fart or two. She clutched her fat, scaly belly, \u201cHey, calm down in there kid. I\u2019m trying to watch tv!\u201d You shriek, \u201cI wanna go home!\u201d The dragoness rolled her eyes, grumbling, drumming her claws on her belly, \u201cGeez kid, you act like you\u2019ve never spent a night in a monster\u2019s belly before?\u201d You shout back, \u201cCause I\u2019ve never been eaten by a monster before. Now take me home, before I call the cops.\u201d The dragoness giggled, slapping her gut, \u201cI don\u2019t you\u2019ll get good reception in my belly. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, a girl\u2019s gotta get her beauty sleep.\u201d You continue to scream and protest, which is only met with an uncaring yawn and a thunderous fart. The dragoness snuggles up on her couch with a nice corny tv show on and a belly full of beer, vodka, soda and kid. You slosh around in her stomach for some time but soon hear her start to snore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes of nothing but her heartbeat, her gurgling belly, and her obnoxious snoring, you hear a cellphone ringtone. It was the dragoness\u2019 cellphone she left on her coffee table. The vibrating and ring stopped. The dragoness\u2019 voice spoke the voice message, \u201cHey, it\u2019s ya\u2019 home-girl Alexis, I\u2019m either partying, on the toilet, or ignoring you. Leave a message if you\u2019re not my ex.\u201d The message rang and Nancy\u2019s panicked voice could be heard, \u201cAlex, it\u2019s Nancy. Did you see a kid wandering around the party? I need to find him, call me!\u201d As soon as the message recording stopped the phone vibrated again, Nancy was calling a second time. Does this wake your dragon captor up or will she let it go to voicemail again?</span></div></div>",

You made it!\u201d The two reptiles slithered up to each other and hugged, \u201cYou look great Alexis.\u201d The dragoness nodded, \u201cYou do too Nancy, you\u2019re super hot.\u201d Nancy waved a hand in front of her nose, \u201cP.U. Alexis have you been drinking? Your breath smells worse than a gnoll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness chuckled and put her claws on her hips, \u201cFirst of all Nancy, that\u2019s racist. Secondly\u2026\u201d She clicks her claws and sha-shays her hips side to side, in her drunk, slurred voice she giggles, \u201cYa\u2019 girl\u2019s been getting\u2019 down, partyin\u2019, drinkin\u2019, met a hot vampire named Vex, and I even gotta snack!\u201d She pressed out her wiggling, screaming belly as it happily wobbled about. A werewolf frat guy leaned over, poking her gut, \u201cThat a kid in there?\u201d Alexis smiled and nodded, the werewolf giving her a hi-five, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Just snackin\u2019 and drinkin\u2019. We were gonna hit up the scout camp grounds for a late night snack after the party.\u201d Alexis clawed her paws together, burping in the werewolf\u2019s face, \u201cOh I\u2026 UUURRRPP\u2026 LOVE scouts! They go so good with marshmellows.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis turned back to a grimacing Nancy, \u201cYo Nance, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nancy pointed at her squirming gut, \u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d Alexis smiled drunkenly, \u201cUhhh, Prince Albert in a Can?\u201d Nancy swiftly punched Alexis in the gut, making the dragoness keel over and start to cough and hack. It didn\u2019t help that she was already tipsy and woozy. The dragoness craned her neck and barfed you up. You were dragged up her waterslide-like esophagus and rode a wave of belly slime and booze to your freedom and you were hacked up onto the floor. Nancy put a hand on Alexis\u2019 shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m sorry girl, but I have to handle this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to run away but the slick dragon saliva that coated you made it hard to move without slipping on yourself.

She lost count at ninety-one, oh well, dragons were big monsters, they could handle a lot more liquor than your average monster, let alone your average human. She downed her second full bottle of vodka in the kitchen, as a parade of monster college students cheered her on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness took a bow and then let out a large, fiery belch.

So did the rest of the party guests, making them way more rambunctious, some started wrecking the house. Whether it was on purpose or by accident since this house was not built for monster use, the crowd started tearing into the place\u2026 literally. Claws slashed into couches and beds, elbows obliterated family pictures, paws stomped into furniture, drool and slime got everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness marched upstairs in search of a bathroom, her stomach a bit upset. Someone ended up bumping into her, the motion of her getting pushed and her gut wobbling made the dragoness loose it. She was going to vomit! She bent over and barfed. A torrent like stream of dragon drool and alcohol flooded out of her maw. You too were pulled up her esophagus and awoken from your sleep. BWARLF! You were spat onto the floor.

The woman stood at an impressive ten feet tall. She had swampish green skin, a chubby body, complete with large breasts, tree-trunk like arms and legs, a jiggling pot belly, a chubby face, long flowing red hair, tubby fingers, dirty fingernails, a bubble butt that was bigger than your living room couch and some classic ogre B.O. She wore tight-fitting dusty black pants and an equally tight black t-shirt with the words \u2018Momma Bear\u2019 written on it. Her tight fitting clothes definitely showed off her curvy and chubby body, as well as the plethora of grease and sweat stains on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in a gruff and fairly deep voice for a lady, she greeted you with a smile, giving you a whiff of her bad breath and a view of her yellow teeth, \u201cHi there. I\u2019m Onra, your babysitter.\u201d Trying not to scream or start crying from your stinging nostrils you replied, \u201cH-hi, come right in.\u201d Onra stomped her way into your house, squeezing her way through the door. She looked around the house, \u201cNice place ya\u2019 got here kid. It certainly is a little too\u2026 clean for my ogrish tastes, but I imagine it\u2019s nice for a human family.\u201d You both her Dave yell from the living room, \u201cHey is that our dumb babysitter, or what!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnra snorted angrily at this as she charged into the living room, \u201cI\u2019ll have you know young man that, that is no way to call your caretaker. I am here to make sure you\u2019re both safe and I will not be mocked.\u201d Dave was about to sneer at her, expecting to look at some stuck-up woman in her forties\u2026 what he saw instead was a big, green knee\u2026 he looked up the body it was attached to and locked eyes with your grimacing ogress babysitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dave could let out a scream he was assaulted by her rancid B.O. Your little brother pinched his nose and squinted his eyes, \u201cYuck! Do they have showers or deodorant where you come from lady?\u201d You had to agree with Dave, but you didn\u2019t want to risk pissing your babysitter off, especially when she was ten feet tall and clearly large even for her size.

He looked up at her, quickly realizing the sort of mistake he just made\u2026 but it was too late! Soon, one of her massive, stubby hands was wrapped around his torso, and he quickly gasped as he realized just how incomprehensibly strong she was in comparison to him! \u201cShouldn\u2019t have said that, kid\u2026 but you were going to have to learn this lesson sooner or later. Might as well happen now. Down the hatch!\u201d She shrugs, nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only watch as the massive, bulky woman stuffs your little brother straight into her mouth in a single movement, closing her lips around him to seal him away completely in darkness. You immediately felt sorry for him. Her breath was foul enough all the way from over here. You can\u2019t IMAGINE how disgusting it must be to be trapped entirely inside her mouth, with only her atrocious breath to breathe, as he\u2019s completely covered from head to toe in her disgusting, meaty slobber!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in awe and horror as she starts rolling him around in her mouth with her tongue, pressing him up against her cheeks as she teaches him a lesson. Eventually, you see two hands poke through her lips\u2026 and you catch a glimpse of David\u2019s terrified face as he manages to pry her lips apart a bit! \u201cPlease! Let me go! It\u2019s disgus-\u201d Before he can choke out another word, she angrily pressed a finger against his forehead, and pushed him back into her mouth! She crossed her arms, a disapproving expression on her face as she keeps pushing him around with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dave has found himself in some sort of nightmare! There\u2019s basically any room to move in her mouth, and any time he manages to get a grip on something, her powerful tongue pushes him around, smothering him against her cheek or pressing his face into a puddle of disgusting slobber. He was completely covered in drool, and he gagged every single time he was hit with her garbage bin-like breath. He couldn\u2019t tell which way was up and which way was down! He was fully at her mercy! All he could do was try desperately from getting too close to that cavernous throat at the back of her maw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like she torments him in her mouth forever\u2026 but eventually, it comes to an end. Instead of spitting him out, though\u2026 your head drops as you hear a loud gulp, and the bulge in her cheeks disappeared, replaced with a similarly sized bulge in her throat! You hold a hand over your mouth, shaking as you can see a clear imprint of your body\u2019s struggling form in her neck before it disappeared behind her ginormous chest. She let's out a satisfied belch, patting her gut with a hand as she feels the boy land in her stomach proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock and horror are running through your veins as you stare at her big, round potbelly. It was already so big, your brother didn\u2019t even make a bulge! You wouldn\u2019t even believe he was really in there if you hadn\u2019t just seen her swallow him with your own eyes! \u201cOh! That really hit the spot!\u201d She smiled, patting her gut, seemingly amused by the horrified expression on your face. She\u2019s made her point clear - now you knew what happened to any bratty kids who found themselves under her care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you ate him\u2026\u201d You stuttered, never witnessing such a sight in your life. Not only did she eat him, but she swallowed him\u2026 whole! And with complete ease, too, like your brother was just some bite-sized snack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, yes I did! And I\u2019ve still got plenty of room in here,\u201d she smirked, poking her belly and making it obvious you could join him in there. \u201cSo while you\u2019re under my care, I expect you to be in tip-top shape! Capiche?\u201d You nod eagerly, horrified at the thought of ending up inside her huge, gurgling gut. Even now, you were fighting back tears, thinking that was the last time you\u2019ll ever see your brother again. \u201cGood boy! Now, your brother, on the other hand, deserves a time-out, I think. How about an hour?\u201d She says, walking over and lounging on the couch, which creaks beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, a little confused. What did she mean, a \u2018time-out\u2019? \u201cSo, you\u2019re not going to digest him?\u201d You sheepishly ask, your voice almost a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a weird look. \u201cWhat? No! Of course not. Why would I?\u201d She says, as if that much was obvious. \u201cI may be a little \u2018intimidating\u2019, but I ain\u2019t a monster! Well\u2026 okay, I AM a monster, but not a MONSTER monster.\u201d She pats her gut. \u201cI just believe in good ol\u2019 fashioned tough love, just like how all ogres raise their kids! So many human children are far too spoiled and bratty nowadays. Their parents go so easy on \u2018em!\u201d You stare down at her big pot-belly, still stunned by the knowledge your brother is inside. At least he wasn\u2019t being digested\u2026 but it still must be unbelievably DISGUSTING in there! The ogress\u2019 body was nasty enough on the outside\u2026 you couldn\u2019t even imagine what it was like on the inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you kept this to yourself, trying to avoid staring at her tummy too much. Eventually, she glanced at you. \u201cYou seem like a good lad, though. Tell me; what sorta things do you like to do for fun?\u201d</span></div></div>",

How about we go to my side of town and we can explore it together. I doubt you\u2019ve ever been there.\u201d You curiously ask, \u201cWhere?\u201d Onra giggled, \u201cThe monster world silly.\u201d You weren\u2019t sure if you wanted to go there, but Onra didn\u2019t offer much of a choice as she rubbed her palms together and then snapped her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were both consumed by a blinding light. As the light faded you looked around and saw a gloomy neighborhood. It was nighttime, there were clouds slightly covering a full moon, dimly lit streetlights were on every corner and ever house and building looks like your stereotypical haunt from the horror movies. Onra waved her hands around, \u201cWalla! The Land of Monsters. I bet you\u2019re so excited.\u201d You were definitely not excited. If Onra could swallow up your little brother, you could only imagine all the other creatures skulking around here that would love to turn you into their snack.

We\u2019re a pretty calm and nice bunch, for the most part.\u201d Her huge, muscular hand wrapped around your arm as she tugged you along with her, \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve got so much to show you.\u201d Onra, happily strolls down the dark and eerie street as she forcibly pulls you along with her. You look around both in fear and curiosity. Onra was right, this was a much different world to your own, but you\u2019d rather just take a postcard and head home. You hear Onra squeal, \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d You look up to see you\u2019re in front of\u2026</span></div></div>",

How was holding the fort while I was away?\" He asks, kissing Orna on the lips.<br>\r\n\"Not bad! You don't mind if I brought my babysitting gig with me?\" She giggles, the male ogre now noticing you.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Reekers here. I know my wife can be a bit over the top, but she really does care about the kids she looks after. I hope you can be lenient with... our ways,\" he said, pausing for a bit before finishing his sentence and you nod, knowing why he called Reekers.<br>\r\n\"I just made my famous swamp pie, would you like some?\" Reekers asks, his wife's face lightening up.<br>\r\n\"We would love some, but I just ate recently,\" Orna said, rubbing her fat belly.<br>\r\n\"Huh, so there was at least another kid you were watching. Remember to spit them out! We don't want last time to repeat itself,\" he said, you looking a bit worried when some heavy thumps come down the stairs.<br>\r\n\"Jeez, Mom! You done it again! Why can't you get it that humans aren't... built... like... us...\" The new ogre said, as she appears from the stairs and stops everything as she sees you as you wave to her.<br>\r\nThe newcomer was basically a duplicate of Orna, minus the mole and her hair was black. Being a head shorter than Orna, she was still bigger than you and was wearing an ill-fitted red hoodie with very tight jeans, stains all over her clothing.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's our daughter, Belladonna, or Bell for short. Come say hi to my client's kid! He's around your age,\" Orna said, only for Bell to run back upstairs, red faced.<br>\r\n\"That's odd. She's usually giving a look of disdain whenever I bring guests,\" Orna wonders aloud, confusion on her face as Reekers giving a calm huh.<br>\r\n\"Say, Honey, how long has that brat been in your stomach for?\"<br>\r\n\"About fifteen minutes, why you...\" Your babysitter asks before her tummy grumbles loudly.<br>\r\nA very wet fart exits her rump and she holds her belly in pain before running off.<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine. Just made her system do an evac. Third door on the left after turning right at the stairs,\" Reekers said, a glow fading from his finger before he follows his wife.<br>\r\nDespite your worry for your annoying brother, you trusted Orna's word and left Dave to them before heading to where Reekers guided you. Standing at the door, you knock on it and Bell opens the door aggressively before noticing you. She was utterly speechless before you spoke.<br>\r\n\"May I come in?\" \"O-of course!\"<br>\r\nAs pass her, you were surprised that she smelled good. Not very good, but much better than everything else you experienced this night. Her room was surprsingly what you expect from a girl her age would have, depite its run down appearance. You both sit on the bed and for an awkward amout of time, you sat there until Bell hands you some food you would never imagined to see in the monster realm: human food.<br>\r\n\"I've made it myself. It's probably not as good as the real deal, but using the ingredients here, it was the best I do,\" she explains, you eating a cookie and like she said, it wasn't that great but it was still good.<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all.\" \"I know it ain't the best, but you still liked it?\" Bell asks, you nodding as you eat some more of the food she gave you.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you guys have it too?\"<br>\r\n\"We can eat it, but for some reason, when I eat anything like that, I get very gassy. My farts have... been known... to knock out...my own... fellow monsters...\" The ogress answer, though she became depressed as she continued on and you quickly changed the subject.<br>\r\n\"Say, you seem to know a lot about humans.\"<br>\r\n\"That's because I want live with them, instead of here!\" Bell said, getting all fired up and starts to talk why she dislike her home.<br>\r\nYou both start talking about any complaints you have and how each world works to the best of your abilities, before it changed to your hobbies. As you were talking, Bell slid a bit closer to you until you were touching as the hips, or rather, her thigh went a bit onto your legs.<br>\r\n\"Other than the gross habits and appearances, you monsters might as well be humans,\" you said, Bell smiling a bit as her face flushes red and she tries to pull up her jeans over the rest of the half moon, to no avail.<br>\r\n\"I'll head over to the bathroom now.

There's a moment's panic as you remember what happened to Dave, but instead of going down Bell's hatch, you find her overwhelmingly large lips plastered over your mouth.  Her lips are wet and slippery and her breath isn't exactly pleasant despite attempts to make it so with strong breathmints, but if you look past that the kiss feels...really good.  It feels especially good since, as her surprisingly large tongue elbows its way into your mouth, she's now hugging you against her massive soft body.  Her belly feels amazing squashed against you as do her massive boobs which (braless as they are) seem to surround your torso.  In your shock, and given the fact you're smaller and not near as strong as Bell is, there's nothing you can do but spread your arms around what you can of her massive middle and kiss back.  Given it's your first kiss, you're not exactly skilled but given that (you figure) it's Bell's too...she doesn't seem to mind.  You lose track of the moment until Bell's lips seperate from yours with a loud wet pop and a lot of panting.  Bell continues to hug you against her, now planting your head lovingly against her massive ogre-girl boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I didn't scare you away just then,\" Bell murmurs, \"It's just...you've been so sweet to me.

Maybe you're not ready, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I just stay here in your arms forever?\" you manage to say, both trying to reassure her that you liked what just happened and also just plain overwhelmed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her squeeze you against her, just a little, just enough, and hear her sigh contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish,\" she giggles, \"but eventually, mom's gonna have to take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shi...uh...darn,\" you say, remembering that her mom could be listening so you need to watch your language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't mean we can't see each other,\" says Bell, \"It'll probably have to be at night, most humans aren't used to seeing monsters, but I bet I can get mom to let me use your bed to slip in and see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes along with the whole 'monster under the bed' thing,\" Bell explains, now loosening her grip enough to look you in the eyes, but still holding you against her warm softness, \"If we have...permission, we can come out from under a bed or slip back home using the same path.  You know, you could dangle your arm or leg by the bed to let me know you wanna see me, or I could pop my head out from under to visit you...maybe give you another goodnight kiss from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winks at you and you blush a little.  You really did enjoy that kiss she gave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll need to give me express verbal permission before I can do that,\" she tells you, \"that's the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it.  This is all coming at you pretty fast.  Giving her access to your house (and room) is a pretty big commitment and you've only just met Bell.  On the other hand, you already like her a lot and...if Dave got annoying again Bell would be a valuable ally in dealing with him.</span></div></div>",

Her smile grows tenfold, but you do hastily add on one last detail. \"But please do try to call ahead so I can tell you if the coast is clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogress snickered loudly, pulling you back into her greasy body to continue her hug. Softly she whispered in your ear. \"Don't worry, I'll be careful. Wouldn't want your brother to walk in on us and rat us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you just go all ogre on him for a minute to... convince him not to?\" You suggest a little hesitantly. \"You don't have to eat him if you don't want to, but maybe just sit on him or something.\" She giggled at your suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it'll be fine. Let's not worry about Dave. I'm far more interested in you.\" She hooked a finger under your chin and guided your face back to the slobbery embrace of her lips. Her kiss covered almost your entire head, making it impossible to see. Despite this you clumsily grab hold of her and passionately kiss back as best you can. It felt amazing to kiss someone this big, but even all the mints in the world couldn't fully disguise her rancid ogre breath. Bell's tongue explores every part of your face, meeting your own and curling around it. The intense kiss lasts so long you began to run out of breath, but she was insatiable. You began to see spots by the time she finally released you with a loud smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe I'll be visiting to collect more of those.\" Bell said with a sly grin, reaching over to grab her phone. She loosened her hug enough for you to do the same and you exchanged numbers. \"There, now you can call me too if you're feeling all home alone. Speaking of going home, my mom should be about done getting your brother out of her.\" You give the ogress a weak smirk, not wanting to think too much about how Orna would've made that happen. Bell is quick to distract you by grabbing hold of the back of your head and forcing you to pay attention to her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more for the road?\" She asks with a broad smile. You nod enthusiastically. But Bell didn't intend on giving you another kiss. She wanted to show you love the ogre way. What does she do? </span></div></div>",

You look on in shocked arousal as she pulls her top off of her, revealing the gigantic bare belly and massive ogre-girl boobs.  She shuffles to the bed, looming over you before slipping above you to let her huge boobs and belly dangle and pat against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When an ogre-girl really wants to show her affection,\" she says, \"she surrounds him in her love...like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her massive fatty body descends to press you into the bed, her giant tits surrounding your head and her tremendous tummy surrounding the rest.  She wiggles and lightly bounces on you as if trying to press you into her as much as possible.  You can't see, you can barely breathe, and yet all that flesh (odoriferous as it may be) still feels awesome.  You try to hug back and even wiggle and squirm under her experimentally.  Bell giggles and grinds as if she likes that.  You then take a chance and motorboat her stupendous mammaries which makes her giggle and even moan a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh you've done it now,\" she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I go too far?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how far you're willing to go,\" she winks, \"but now you've done that to my boobs, you'd better be ready to give them a good sucking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly find your head pretty much buried under one of Bell's tits, and seeing no other way out, your mouth seeks out her thick nipple and sucks it hungrily.  You have both your hands around that mammary mass and Bell is grunting like crazy with pleasure.  In a moment, she releases your face, only to press her other tit down on you for the same treatment.  You're not sure just how long you have, but are determined to enjoy every moment, noisily slurping and licking her fat and responsive nipples.  Bell actually stiffens and grinds herself against you after a bit of time and you realize that you've just coaxed an orgasm out of her just from the squash/boob play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, holy crap that was good,\" she gasps, flopping to her side and snuggling you against her.</span></div></div>",

The human and her daughter, both laying in bed. The exhausted look of a man freshly smothered in love. And the distinct smell of an ogre's sexual peak. You gulp loudly, worried you may have overstepped your boundaries. You were in no rush to get punished like Dave was. She collects her thoughts for a moment before a big grin grows on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I see you two are really kicking it off...\" She coos with a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Bell responds, blushing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go easy on him, he's not a durable as us.\" Orna adds with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away mom, you're ruining everything!\" The ogre teen throws one of her pillows at her mother, getting even redder in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I'll see if Reekers and me can take care of the little brother for a bit then so you two lovebirds can have some more time.\" She put on her smuggest grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM!\" Bell yelled out. The large ogress laughed, closing the door before another pillow could hit her in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were snuggled up close to her and you could feel her rapid breathing. You brought your hand up to her head. She was bright red with embarrassment and anger. When you laid a hand on her cheek she grabbed your arm and squeezed it painfully. Your strained yelp was enough for her to snap herself out of it and let you continue. Slightly worse for wear you put your hand back on her cheek and guided her head until her eyes met yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that out of the way, shall we get back to what's important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... you're still up for it after...\" She stammers, prompting you to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, parents embarrassing you happens in every reality it seems.\" You give her a knowing smile. Granted, if your parents walked in on this scenario they'd probably scream and run, but you could hardly blame them. It wasn't every day you found yourself snuggled up to an ogre, especially one as cute as Bell. \"Now put me on top so I can return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell looked at you confused, but for a laugh decided to play along. She hoisted you up on top of her with ease, laying back and wondering what the hell this funny little man was up to. He shuffled around a bit on her belly, his wiggles feeling real nice against her greasy skin. He tried to get a bit close to her face, but his torso was getting wedged between her boobs and soon he couldn't advance any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling the love yet?\" You said with a silly grin. Bell just shot you a confused look. \"I'm smothering you beneath me as best I can, but I feel a little outclassed.\" Finally the ogre understood what you intended when you wanted to return the favor and she burst into laughter. Her whole body shook, sending you bouncing up and down atop the fatty surface. As this hilarious earthquake came to a close she wrapped you in a loving embrace, pulling you up until your groin was wedged between her boobs and your mouth was back in kissing distance. She plastered her thick lips against your face for another breathtaking kiss. You held on to her as best you could as you felt your love for her growing. Though it wasn't just a metaphor. You felt your pants strain slightly as they were forced to conceal a small bulge now. Hopefully Bell hadn't noticed it was your turn to be embarrassed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another lengthy kiss her lips detach with a wet pop and she looks at you amorously. What did Bell have in mind next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel Bell's body relax again after that overwhelming kiss. If she could feel your bulge poking against her boobs she sure wasn't showing it. You quietly thank whoever will listen for that, as you're uncomfortable thinking about what things she might do to you if she discovered you were such a pervert. Then again, given how romantic this was feeling, she might well react by taking it up a notch and putting you between her legs. You're not sure which prospect is more terrifying. You look up to her to see if your daydreaming has raised any curious eyebrows, but it seems like the ogre is lost in thought as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha thinking about?\" You ask carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'd be able to live in your world?\" She asks jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you wouldn't fit in any house, but I suppose there's some woods close by. People see weird things in there all the time and after what I've seen today, I can honestly believe you wouldn't be the first monster to live there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... These woods... Are they close to your house?\" Bell's expression went from teasing to intrigued as she waited for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we live right on the edge of town. The woods are literally just outside our back yard.\" You reply enthusiastically, not quite catching on to what she's referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if some pretty ogre girl were to live in those woods, would you mind her sneaking into your yard and stealing you away for a few hours for cuddles and kisses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the penny dropped and your felt a shiver run down your spine. She was serious about this, wasn't she? Including the part about abducting you out of your own house. You gulp as you imagine her reaching in through your bedroom window and grabbing you. You hastily stammer out a response. \"Well... I would prefer it if they called ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell burst out into giggles, causing you to bounce up and down on her jiggling chest once more. \"Hehe, alright. I'll make sure me stealing you away fits in our schedules. Silliness aside, do you think I could manage it? Like... for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not wanting to insult her outdoor skills, but you had absolutely no frame of reference for how well she might do in this scenario. You decide that honesty is the best policy. \"Well, I don't really know how outdoorsy you are, but I imagine you could handle it. There's a garbage dump a few streets away that you could probably sneak into for supplies. But I don't exactly live someplace tropical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee, that's okay. I'll keep you warm.\" She illustrates her argument by pushing you between her boobs. Your whole torso was smothered between the two soft, fleshy walls. Her greasy skin smelled offputting, but you couldn't deny that it was comfortably warm. You smile awkwardly before continuing your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's food and drink. I suppose the little creeks running through the forest can get you some clean water but when it comes to eating I've got no idea how to tackle that. The dump's got food on it, you could sneak in and steal people's trashcans, but fresh human food is gonna be hard. Because even with the best will in the world I'm afraid my efforts wouldn't amount to much compared to your big belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're so sweet.\" She squeezed her breasts together, intensifying their sweaty embrace. \"But we ogres didn't get this big by being picky. I'll be able to handle myself. You should still bring something small to eat with you though, just for the taste.\" She hastily added that last line, salivating a little at the thought of fresh human food. Silence fell between the two of you, but you could see her busily thinking about something. You worry now that this was far more than a hypothetical situation. She really wanted to go through with it, didn't she? Were you that much of a catch that she was willing to give up the comforts of home just to squat in the woods?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not... uhm... do anything hasty here, shall we?\" You stammer, but her mind seemed set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. I'm not gonna go live in the woods permanently. Just for a couple of weeks. It's like an exciting adventure! And you'll be involved too.\" She hugged you tightly before shuffling out of bed and onto her feet. With you still firmly wedged between her boobs she went downstairs to talk to Orna. She and Reekers were sitting on the living room couch. Dave was all but missing from the picture save for his feet poking out from underneath Orna's rear. She was taking this babysitting gig a bit too literal it seems. With all the composure she could manage Bell spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, can I go on vacation into the human world for a few weeks? I promise I'll call you lots and I'll be out of sight. I just want to go out there and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this about that boy you've got there?\" Orna interjected with an amused smile.</span></div></div>",

Their daughter was smitten by the little man and wanted more time with him. It was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you take good care of yourself, sweetie. This one might be cute, but most humans are not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogre holding you rolled her eyes. Her mom just didn't understand how people like you were harmless at worst. I mean really, what could a human possibly do to harm her? Nevertheless, it sounded like she had permission to go live in the woods for a couple of weeks. She was about to turn around to pack together some things for the trip when Orna stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Before I watch you leave the house for a few weeks, I do want something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell sighed. She knew her mother well enough to anticipate a catch. What would it be this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see if the human loves you too. I want you two to kiss, right here and now.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's all?\" Bell said with a small shrug. She worried it might've been something difficult. You had little time to brace yourself as those big, pursed lips closed in. Soon your face was covered completely by them, saliva flowing richly. With what little direction you had you spread your arms wide and wrapped them around the ogre's head. She returned the favor, cupping most of your head in her palm and pressing you into her puffy lips even harder. Her breath was still bad, even with all the mints taking the worst of it away. With a loud smack she pulled away, leaving you gasping for air. Your face was glistening from the aftermath and the ogre defiantly turned to face her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrna and Reekers exchanged another glance before smiling. \"Well, I'm convinced. You better hope you're ready for this, human. An ogre's love is no easy thing to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for damn sure.\" Reekers added with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, you two start packing. I'll make sure little Dave makes it home. After we're done babysitting of course.\" She grins, sitting back down on the couch and hiding the lower half of Dave beneath her butt. Both ogre parents fart in unison. It was nearly enough to make you pity your little brother, but you had other things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world shook as Bell carried you up the stairs in an excited sprint to her room. She dropped you off in there and left to get a bag. When she returned the ogre-girl started to manically pack things into the scuffed sports bag. Some clothes, other supplies, snacks and more. You had to be quick on your feet lest you'd be caught underfoot by the cheery ogre. Getting trampled by those sweaty stompers seemed like a less than ideal way to start this little adventure. With her bag packed Bell finally slowed down enough to consider you again. She quickly slung the bag onto her back and picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next stop, human world.\" She cooed as she snapped her fingers. Much like her mother did before, she produces a bright light, blinding you. When your eyes readjust you notice you're in familiar territory. Bell had taken you to your backyard, looking around with fascination. She'd made trips to the human world many times before, but it was always exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where shall we begin...\" She mulled over her options before turning to you. \"I know, how about you go into your house and get us something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogre-girl set you down and you quickly entered the house. You grabbed some bags of sweets you'd kept stashed in your room. Among them was mercifully a large bag of mints. Something told you they were going to be lifesavers. You wandered back out to see Bell carefully stepping over the back fence. She didn't want to destroy it or leave any evidence, even if her large footsteps would assuredly do so. But when you looked at the ground, not a trace was present. Before you could pry further she beckons you over, picking you up and lifting you over the fence with ease. Before you stretched the woods. They were as ominous as ever in the darkness, but now that you had a monster on your side, you didn't feel as afraid of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, pretty scary, huh?\" She mused. Her monster senses could pick up fear with ease. The little guy carried that distinct smell. Not a big surprise when one faces an ogre, but somehow the dark had him more on edge than the monster that could gobble him up in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself picked up again. This time she wrapped you into a hug, her strong arms pushing you into the soft mass of her belly and boobs. Your head nearly slipped into her cleavage completely before she adjusted herself. \"There, much safer.\" She mused as she began to wander into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few minutes she came across a small creek. The ogre-girl set you down and threw down her bag. \"There we go, camp's made.\" She said with a giggle. It was already getting late, but that wasn't about to deter the adventurous ogre. What surprised you more is when she suggested she'd get in her sleeping clothes. You were curious to see what she was referring to, but to your surprise she simply undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should've told you, I sleep in the nude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uhm... you look beautiful.\" You stammered out, not wanting to make things awkward. \"But isn't it cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, not when you've got some insulation.\" She bellowed, patting her jiggling gut.</span></div></div>",

Onra joyfully kicked the door shut as she stomped her way towards you with a brown bag of food in both hands, \u201cTime for dinner boys.\u201d She set the brown bag down on the kitchen table and dug her hand into her butt crack, fishing Dave out, who sputtered and coughed on the floor.</span></div></div>",

It squelches as you bite in and you can already feel your gag reflex arguing with you. After a few chews, trying your hardest not to taste it, you look down at the full plate which makes you feel like you have a thousand mile walk ahead of you. There's only one thing for it and you know it's going to happen regardless of whatever you have to say about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the most audible wail you've made in years you puke it it out, throw the rest on the plate and shove it back towards Orna. \"I'm sorry, I can't do it. You can't be very good at your job if you can't cater for human children too!\" you tell her exasperatedly. Dave wasn't really paying attention. He was more fixated on why his burger was moving. Orna however, stood up; beaming at you. \"Is that right? Well let me show you how good I can be at my job. It's <i><b>time-out</b></i> for you\" she said in a calm-angry tone. It was spine-tinglingly scary to see her towering over both of you. Although Dave was still prodding and poking his burger, trying to illicit a reaction from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide the best course of action is to try and run. There's no way you're spending any amount of time in that bulging gut of hers. Especially not right before or after she's been eating, you think to yourself. You dart by the side of her as suddenly as you can to catch her off-guard. \"<b>HEY!</b> Where do you think you're going you little twerp!\" she roars as she starts to bound after you; her belly jiggling as she does, almost as if to taunt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your bedroom door and slam it shut, falling against it. You begin to scan your room for a hiding spot but before you can make any sort of decision, Orna starts banging the door and it shook every time she hit it. After a few attempts, it burst open and sent you hurtling towards the floor a few feet out in front of her. \"Ha Ha Ha! I've got you now little one!\" she jested menacingly. Walking swiftly towards you with her massive frame, you decide it's time to go on the offensive. You spring up and launch both of your arms into her in order to shove her back. Almost as if she could see the future, Orna grabbed both of your arms and twisted them; making you bend to your knees like clockwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see her flashing a victory smile at you. Her hands released your arms and clamped themselves around your upper arms; pinning them to your body. Orna lifts you up to face level, she was out of breath from all of the sudden movement. \"<i>Now</i> it's time for your <b>Time-out!</b>\" she pants, laughing wheezily. \"First things first though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly overcome with a bizarre feeling. It feels like your skin is getting tighter. You look down at your body, trying to suss out what's going on with you. You look back at Orna to ask her what she's doing but you instantly realise; Orna is <b><i>a lot</i></b> bigger than before. \"What's happening to me!?\" you yell. \"It's Ogre-magic, Einstein\" she replies half laughing at you. \"<i>Ogres</i> know magic?!\" you quiz back. \"We didn't <i>always</i>. Millenia passed before my people let magic into their lives. Now all the tribes have at least <i>one</i> Shaman\" Orna explains to you as you continue to shrink. You never noticed as it was happening but Orna was now holding you with one hand and you're still getting smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more horrific moments of shrinking go by. When it stops, you're about an inch tall and standing in the massive great palm of your ogre babysitter's hand. \"Well now, I'd say that's about the perfect size. Wouldn't you?\" Orna asks you in a coy tone. \"Is this even reversible?!\" you shout back, hoping she'll be able to hear you. \"Oh yes it is, but you'll need to earn that!\" she laughs. \"Right...<b><i>snack time</i></b>\" she says smiling dangerously at you. \"Please don't eat me Orna! I'll be good I swear!\" you plead desperately. \"Too late shrunk-stuff\" she replies. \"Don't worry, you won't get digested. I've seen to that\" she adds. Before you can say anything else, you fall back as her hand begins to ascend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers close over you, sealing you in darkness only for a moment before she opens her hand again, keeping you between two fingers. \"Down the hatch!\" she instructs you. Before you can give any attempt at a protest, her fingers let go and you plummet towards her open, gargantuan maw.<br>\r\nFeeling you landing on her slimy tongue, Orna quickly shuts her mouth and tilts her head back. She opens her mouth once more to let you see the outside world before you go for your time-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud and obnoxious gulp drags you into her throat and you begin sliding down immediately. Tossing and turning all the way down seemed like hours before you eventually came to the end. You land in a large pool of green sludge. There are large chucks of dinner floating around and the smell was almost unbearable. Very suddenly, you're taken of your feet by an immense shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Orna had begun to grab and slosh her rotund and quite large gut around. \"<b><i>That'll</i></b> teach you. Enjoy the ride, squirt!\" she laughed. \"I'll let you out when I think you're ready to start treating me with some respect!\" she cackles in a haughty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>'Great!'</b></i> You think to yourself. \"What now?\" You say out-loud quickly realising you are talking to a cavernous ogre's gut.</span></div></div>",

The dragoness sniffed the air, \u201cHold on, I smell another one.\u201d She snaked her tail into your house. You could hear Dave screaming inside as the dragon wrapped her tail around him and pulled him out of the house, snatching him out of her coiled tail and into her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness lifted you both up to her huge snout, \u201cHey there kids, I\u2019m Daneera your babysitter. I tend to bring the kids a babysit home with me, got a treasure to protect and all that jazz. So you\u2019ll be bunking at my place tonight. Sound good?\u201d Daneera didn\u2019t really leave any time for you two to reply as she stretched her wings and took off into the night sky. You both screamed the whole fifteen minute ride there. It was terrifying seeing your small town get smaller and smaller as Daneera ascended a few hundred feet in the air.  Daneera chuckled, \u201cFirst time riding with a dragon I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she started to descend towards a cave on the side of a large mountain range that was a few miles out from her town. She landed and set you both down on the cave floor. Daneera sighed happily, \u201cAh, home sweet home, am I right?\u201d As you looked around you had to admit the cave was fairly well furnished for a dragon\u2019s lair. You were expecting piles of skeletons and knights armor, or a big pot to cook you both in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead the cave somehow had wood floors, framed pictures on the cave walls, a television, a kitchen area and many other modern furnishing. Daneera chuckled as she saw you both gaze at her home, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Thought I lived like some kind of savage?\u201d Dave turned around and asked, \u201cWhat did you say about treasure? Can I have some?\u201d Daneera smirked and shook her head, \u201cOh dear, a dragon\u2019s treasure is a special thing.

Well, small when compared to the full-grown dragoness anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller dragon, light blue scales and silver horns was about your height. Maybe Daves' at minimum. The larger one was easily taller than you with the same dark red scales as Daneera and looked like he could pin you with one hand. Paw? Claw?

Or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly wonder just how good of a baby sitter Daneera was since she seemed quite happy to leave her other two charges alone for a bit to collect you and Dave.

For some reason, she seems to get increasingly anxious whenever she's on land for too long, to the point of potentially having panic attacks! Luckily, she does have some coping mechanisms that calm her down - getting a belly rub usually does the trick, bonus if it's from the inside. Still, in the end, she might just end up dragging you to the local swimming pool. Aside from this, she's quite a shy and demure lady, and speaks with a distinct Australian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice - A 12 foot tall ahool whose too big to even fit through your front door! No need to worry about that, though... she'd be caught dead wasting her time stuck in some cramped, claustrophobic little house! No... this bat lady would rather take you and your brother through adventures to through the air, flying you around to wherever you might be interested in going! She can fly at ridiculous speeds, reaching over 500 knots, so if she's flying at full power, you're either going to have to hang on for dear life, or get a much safer, 'internal' seat to wait out the flight.

You could tell an idea was brewing in his head. You didn't doubt that it would be an incredibly stupid idea, but whatever works to get this smelly beast out of your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you hide and I'll seek. But let me tell ya, I'm the best seeker in this neighborhood. I bet you can't even stay hidden from me for five minutes.\" Dave said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes? Too easy. Make it fifteen!\" The gnoll seemed uncannily confident in her ability to hide. Surely the smell alone would be enough to easily track her down. You didn't exactly need a bloodhound to follow her stench around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" Dave said and Gloria hopped off the couch. \"You got thirty seconds to be gone.\" Your little brother added, the gnoll already looking around for hiding places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30, 29, 28...\" The smelly beast ran off, up the stairs. You weren't so sure about letting this walking stink bomb camp about inside your house. What if she'd hidden under your bed? Your room would smell like fetid gnoll sweat for weeks. You pray to whoever would listen she'd find her way to Dave's room instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour little brother was still counting, but he'd already opened his eyes, the little cheater. Moreover he was walking back to his video game and sat down before the tv. When the count finished he even loudly announced he was coming for her without making any inclination to move a muscle to do so. He'd effectively got the babysitter to leave the two of you alone for at least fifteen minutes. As effective as his little ruse was, it was a plan earmarked by his usual shortsightedness. It didn't take a genius to imagine the gnoll was going to be mighty pissed if she found him like this. Even in the best case scenario, he was still letting her win the bet. But whatever got him his game time, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be facing an angry gnoll you begin walking about, curious to see where the muscular beast might've tried to hide. From behind you your little brother called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother with that bitch. She's gone and I'd like to keep it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was practically the law for big brothers you ignored him, walking up the stairs as he was quickly getting way too absorbed shouting at his video game. Much like you'd expected the smell was easy to follow. With a mounting sense of dread you opened the door to your room and... nothing. Phew, at least you didn't have to worry about her contaminating your stuff with her stink. Next up, Dave's room. Again the door creaks open, but no gnoll to be found. You turn to the bathroom and as you get close the smell gets worse. You open the door and a smile forms on your face. Standing in the shower, curtains drawn to cover her presence was Gloria. She peeked just past the side of the curtain. You quietly winked at her, her secret was safe with you. She smiled in return. You softly closed the bathroom door as she whispered to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned a little, knowing she'd be right. After all, hiding is easy when nobody's looking for you. As you went down the stairs Dave shot you a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did you find the bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" You lied, shrugging your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit, where's a fat freak like her gonna hide? Oh fuck, she's not in my room, is she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not.\" You shook your head before sitting back on the couch. Minutes ticked by and as Dave's time to find the gnoll ran short he seemed just as committed to ignoring her as before. He could've saved himself so much trouble if he took thirty seconds to hop up the stairs and find her like you did. But after twenty minutes had passed you could hear your babysitter's footsteps upstairs. Gloria walked down the stairs with a massive toothy grin on her face. She'd handily defeated that little twerp. But when she saw Dave sitting in his chair playing games it quickly dawned on her he'd never even bothered to look. </span></div></div>",

So it looks like you\u2019ll have to do whatever I say.\u201d Dave grimaced, throwing his videogame controller and standing back up, looking up to look at your babysitter in the eyes.

I\u2019m much stronger than you little guy.\u201d Gloria\u2019s huge paws came down and scooped up your brother, Dave struggled but it was no use.

The gnoll woman groaned, \u201cAw, you didn\u2019t even play, did you?\u201d Dave just snorted, \u201cHell no, Hide and Seek is a baby game. Plus, why would I wanna play with a smelly freak like you.\u201d Gloria growled angrily, \u201cThat\u2019s it kid. You\u2019ve tried my patience.\u201d Gloria stomped over to Dave and grabbed him by the collar of his shirt. Your little brother protested, \u201cGet off of me you freak, you smell like shit!\u201d Gloria stomped her way over to your basement door and flung it open. She ran downstair, forcibly throwing Dave onto an old, dusty couch and jogged her way back upstairs. Gloria shut and locked the basement door before Dave could even make it up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both soon heard Dave banging on the door and screaming, \u201cLet me out.

They\u2019ll arrest you and the government will experiment on you and\u2026\u201d Gloria nearly punched a hole through the basement door to get Dave\u2019s attention, \u201cHey kid, did you know monsters live in the basement. Hungry one\u2019s that eat little boys like you.\u201d Dave spat, \u201cBullshit. That\u2019s all made-up fairytale crap.\u201d Gloria pulled out her cellphone and dialed a number. She smirked at the basement door and replied, \u201cReally? Monsters aren\u2019t real? Then explain how I, a gnoll, a monster, happen to be standing right here, in the flesh, in your house?\u201d Dave didn\u2019t reply, he was going to say she was wearing a costume, but deep down he knew she was the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person, or monster, picked up Gloria\u2019s phone call. The gnoll smiled, \u201cHey Tia, I know it\u2019s a Friday night and you\u2019re technically off duty for the night, but I have this bratty kid I\u2019m babysitting who really need to be taught a lesson, and you\u2019re the best basement-monster I know. Think you could teach him a lesson? Great! I\u2019ll even throw in some of my tip your way. Thanks beautiful, see you later.\u201d She hung up the phone and knocked on the basement door with a sly grin, \u201cHey Dave, one of my best friends is coming to play with you down there. She skipped dinner by the way\u2026 play nice.\u201d Dave continued to bang on the door and protest while Gloria gestured for you to follow her back into your living room, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tia can handle him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria\u2019s old, big, happy grin returned to her muzzle, she sighed, \u201cSo now that that\u2019s out of the way, I\u2019m REALLY itching to play another game. Whatta ya\u2019 say?\u201d You smiled up at Gloria and nodded, she seemed pretty scary when she was mad, but really sweet and kind when she was happy. She was definitely kind of stinky, but you wanted to stay on her good side. Gloria clapped her paws together and jumped up and down, making the floor beneath you shake, \u201cOh boy! Now, what game should we play?\u201d Before you have a chance to answer she waves her paws in the air, \u201cOh, I know!\u201d</span></div></div>",

And if he doesn't learn from it, then he'd better make sure to check under his bed and in his closet, because he might well find himself with a visitor.\" Gloria flashed her biggest, toothiest grin. There was little comfort in this knowledge. But before you got too sad, the gnoll encouraged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't be scared. You're a good kid.

She didn't think you were being flirty now did she? You were a bit young for romance and she was a bit too tall, smelly and not to forget: a gnoll. Before things got too awkward you pushed the game along. \"Alright, my turn. Truth or dare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make things interesting. Dare. What would you have me do?\"</span></div></div>",

The slithering mass of tentacles unfurled from Dave, all but throwing him at the gnoll. Gloria made sure he could enjoy his newfound freedom by scooping him up in her strong arms and giving him a might bearhug. Not a single snarky remark could escape from him before the air was crushed from his lungs. His eyes were watering at the sheer horrible sweaty stench radiating of his captor. Things couldn't get much worse for him, or so he thought. With a wicked smile the gnoll squeezed her prey tighter, she was just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne muscular arm released Dave's body, only to lift her shirt and shuffle him underneath it. The horrid stench grew tenfold as he was smeared against the greasy, sweaty fur of the gnoll. What little air he could breathe was like breathing soup, The humid air was the least of his worries as he felt the gnoll slide him upwards. Her soft boobs added a distinct sour note to the stench as they surrounded the boy's head. Gloria briefly squeezed them together, just to feel the little pest squirm. Finally she pulled him back out, letting him flop onto the basement floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia looked on in admiration. Her massive size tended to interrupt playtime long before she could do fun things like Gloria was doing. Those tasty boys just can't handle a good tentacle hug it seems. So what if those hugs used to be able to sink ships?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria got down on all fours, looming menacingly over the shivering troublemaker. Dave looked up and almost gagged at the sight. The gnoll's toothy grin was leaking saliva on him. Slowly she leaned down, opening those fearsome jaws. This was the end. He was about to be messily torn apart and devoured by this beast of a babysitter. The boy's shivers seized when he felt a large, warm tongue splat down on his neck and drag itself along his throat. Gloria began to lick the little pest all over and the stench of humid saliva was added to the foul cocktail tormenting Dave's nose. But with his body not being crushed anymore he found his voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For fuck's sake, get off me you dirty...\" His complaints were interrupted by a large tongue dragging across his mouth. Gloria stared daggers at him and growled softly. \"Speak again and we're going to find out how far I can drive this tongue down your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave scoffed at her threat. \"Try that and I'll bite your damn tongue off!\" But the gnoll only appeared more excited by his words. \"Challenge accepted\" She cackled as she grabbed Dave's head with both hands. With her immense strength she pried his jaws open and kept them opened. From her corner Tia chimed in, just in case the little pest had missed it. \"Gloria loves a fighty victim, you're in for it now, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll dropped as low as she could, taking most of Dave's head into her maw. Everything was focused on plunging as much of that squishy tongue down his neck. His cries were stifled as Gloria went in, easily filling that little mouth of his and venturing down his throat. Dave felt the squirming, slobbering tongue push down his neck far further than he could've ever imagined it to be. It nearby reached his stomach before Gloria withdrew herself. His jaw slackened as she pulled her tongue back out and when she let go of his head he simply laid there, whimpering. Both monsters knew a troublemaker like him wouldn't learn so quickly. The moment he'd catch his breath he'd be spouting abuse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could form a coherent sentence Dave looked up to see Gloria's massive, stinky butt approaching. It loomed over him ominously, threatening to drop down and squash him flat. But the monster tormenting him had a far crueler idea. A distant rumble gave Dave the slightest warning, but long before he'd deciphered the meaning Gloria let it rip. She blew an immense, lengthy fart down on him, making him gag and cough. Even from several rooms away you could hear it. You almost feel sorry for siccing this smelly beast on your little brother, but Dave more than deserved it. You dread to think what the gnoll might do to you once she's finished with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria steps back to admire her handiwork and both her and Tia smile. She'd effortlessly reduced the boy to a shivering, stinky mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before Dave could form a coherent sentence Gloria was back to tormenting him. She walked up to him and knelt down, looking him in the eyes. Her huge paw came down onto his head as she playfully ran her claws through his hair. She giggled, \u201cNot so tough now, are ya\u2019 short stuff?

It quickly wraps around Dave\u2019s leg and starts pulling him back towards the writhing mass of tentacles. Dave fights as best as he can against the tentacle, but he was fighting something with a grip force of around a few tons, there was no way he was winning any battles of strength with this massive sea creature. Dave screamed, \u201cHey, stop, quit it, get off!\u201d Tia cooed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry little one, but momma\u2019s hungry.\u201d The kraken\u2019s tentacles wrap around poor little Dave, ensnaring him in a huge tangle-web of strong, muscular, slimy coils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia brings the struggling boy up to her huge, yellow, glassy eyeballs. Each eye was nearly the size of his parent\u2019s SUV. Tia eyes the wiggling Dave and chuckled, \u201cYou look so cute Dave.

He squeaked and whimpered but to no avail. He even tried to grab onto one of the tentacles that previously bound him, but it was no use. The poor boy lost his grip on the slimy and rubber flesh and fell, he was headed right towards Tia\u2019s fishy-stenched maw, \u201cMOMMY!\u201d That was the last thing Dave said before SPLAT, CHOMP! Dave plopped right onto the kraken\u2019s tongue and she slammed her beak shut, trapping him. Tia took her time tasting her prey.

David, did you know you\u2019d probably go great wish soy sauce\u2026 or maybe some mustard.\u201d This clearly didn\u2019t make Dave feel better as his crying got louder. She continued to poke him around her beak and taste him until she got bored. Tia cheerfully teased, \u201cWell sweetie, it\u2019s snack time. Hope you\u2019re as excited as I am!\u201d The kraken tilted her head back and with a powerful GULP sent a shrieking Dave down her powerful esophagus and into her belly.

Of all the challenges she expected you to throw at her, this one was certainly unexpected. A sly smile cropped up on her face. The little guy didn't specify what kind of shower. She could pop to the monster world and shower in raw sewage. To be fair, she'd been slacking off on that lately. Might be a good excuse to get out of the house too. The little brat was already in Tia's care and this kid seemed responsible enough to handle himself whilst she was off getting the shower he dared her to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it has to be our shower, in this house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, he was onto her. The smelly beast furrowed her brow. Showering with clean water was anathema to her kind. She'd need to roll in filth for hours to get her proper stench back. Gloria shot you a pleased smile. You weren't making this easy for her, and she loved herself a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's gonna fit? I'm a big girl.\" You could smell her bullshit from a mile away, much like the rest of her. You weren't having any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already seen you hiding in it, you know it's big enough. but if you can't stomach a shower...\" A low snarl rumbled out of the gnoll. You were afraid you'd pushed your luck a bit too much. The last thing you wanted was to piss off your babysitter. You could see Gloria mulling over her options. She concludes with a sigh that she didn't have any other choice. But if she was going to endure a human shower, perhaps she could spice things up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, ya got me. I don't back down from a challenge. But let's say we make things interesting. Your parents asked me to make sure you got a shower in too. Now I know I'm getting ahead of things here since your Dare ain't done, but how's this for mine... I Double Dare you... to join me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't quite have the words to react. Your gut feeling was to stay away from that reeking gnoll as far as possible. But if joining her got her in the shower. Wait, she was right, she'd not finished her challenge yet. Technically you could refuse. Cautiously you ask Gloria what might happen then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're gonna make me shower all by my lonesome, I'll change my Dare so something a bit more fitting. Oh, I know. You're making me get clean the human way. So if you refuse, then I'll dare you to let me clean you the traditional gnoll way, with a tongue bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened with shock. She couldn't be serious, right? Already Gloria smiled, licking her chops. No shower was going to fix that foul maw and she was keen to slobber all over you. The thought of being soaked with gnoll spittle made you feel queasy already. Suddenly sharing the shower didn't seem all that bad. But what if it was a clever trick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I shower with you, you're not gonna dare me to get licked anyway, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, gnoll's honour.\" You didn't know if gnolls had a concept of honour, but Gloria seemed sincere enough. Now the hard choice was on your shoulders. Do you join the gnoll as she takes a shower and endure her up close? Or do you let her shower alone and give you a tongue bath? Neither option felt particularly good for you, but the lesser of two evils was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anything sounded better than a tongue bath from that rancid monster. Reluctantly you agree to join her as she takes a shower. You could see her gleeful smile grow. She wasn't going to like the upcoming cleaning session and she was determined to make sure you would loathe it every bit as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, little guy. Let's get this double dare over with.\" You both stood up and walked to the bathroom. You couldn't get more than a few steps in before Gloria's large arm wrapped around your waist, hoisting you off your feet and carrying you up the stairs. The smell was unbelievably foul, but the goal of getting her in a shower made you persevere. Your nose was held close to the beasts' sweat-soaked clothes. It smelled like a pair of worn out sneakers dipped in sewage. The caustic stench stung your nostrils. With little care the gnoll dropped you on the bathroom floor before beginning to undress herself. You blushed brightly as she swung free her fuzzy boobs. Her big gut gave her some difficulty getting her pants off, but soon she was standing before you, completely naked. Pudgy gut aside she didn't look too strangy. Much to muscular and inhuman for your taste, but you could imagine any gnoll boys in your position would be quite delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna shower with your clothes on? C'mon, lose em.\" Gloria huffed impatiently. The sooner she got this infernal shower over with the better. She tapped her foot as the frightened human quickly shed his little outfit. Soon he was standing in his birthday suit, blushing brightly. His hands were covering his crotch, making the gnoll woman smirk a little. He was far too young for her to try anything. Far too clean too. The hulking gnoll stepped into the shower, surprised by how spacious it is. Now that she wasn't hiding from prying eyes she could appreciate it. She quickly got the hot water flowing, shivering with disdain as layers of carefully built up filth washed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe that your babysitter was taking a shower right in front of you. You didn't get much time to linger as a large hand reached out and pulled you into the shower. Immediately you began to regret your decision as Gloria's wet fur smelled even more awful than normal. The heat and moisture are washing away ancient deposits of filth, unleashing their foul stink onto you. More pressing matters were the lack of space and her brutal way of dealing with it. The gnoll made it inescapably clear this was her shower. She pressed her hefty gut into you, pinning you against the wall. Periodically she would lean on you, squashing you flat and crushing the air from your lungs. After a few more minutes of torment she stepped back a little, hoisting you up in a gentle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just messing with ya, you big goof.\" The painful squeezing you endure felt anything but goofy to you. Hopefully she knew how easily someone as strong as her could hurt you. With yourself lost in thought you don't hear her call out to you straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey... HEY! My eyes are up here you little pervert!\" You had unwittingly been staring at her gently swaying tits all this time. You blush so brightly you're convinced your head is glowing red right now. \"That's right, you keep staring and I'll let you give m\u00e9 a tongue bath. The mere thought of having to service her whole body with your tongue shocked you right back to reality. Since you'd already gotten her here, why not push your luck a little further?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does shampoo work on your fur?\" You ask innocently, occasionally eyeing the bottles next to you. Gloria sees where you're taking this and responds jokingly. \"Oh yes, we spend a lot of time worried about personal hygiene.\" You took a bold step, popped open one of the shampoo bottles and handed it to your babysitter. \"What do you want me to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash yourself of course.\" You added condescendingly. The gnoll sounded irritated. \"That's not what we agreed on.\" You simply smiled and replied. \"Then how about we spice things up a bit. What if I Dare you to shampoo your belly and more if you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're on.\" the gnoll said with a sneer. She squirted the contents of nearly the whole bottle onto her belly and began to rub. As expected the shower was soon filled with bubbles of all sizes. To your surprise she was actually beginning to smell nice. The perfume in the shampoo was working overtime to conceal the rotten stench the gnoll produces. During all this she played painful little games with you, squashing you against the wall with her large body or using you as an improvised wash rag. Getting you clean as well seemed all the way down at the bottom of her list. When she's done using your face as as towel you both dry yourselves off and pull your clothes back on. You swipe together a few old shorts and T-shirt from your parents' room to avoid Gloria from ruining her cleanliness with those filth-soaked rags.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gloria was amused how seriously the human took her cleanliness. He'd even dug up some of his parents' clothes for her. She didn't really have the heart to tell him what'd happen to those the moment she returned to the monster world. but if he was to be believed, they wouldn't be missed. She simply shrugged in response, for there were far more important things to discuss. First she guided him back to the living room. Next she excused herself for a minute to check on Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll opened the basement door and smiled broadly. Nearly the entire room was filled with thick tentacles, coiling and winding around themselves. Amidst the writhing mass was Dave, wrapped up tightly. He could barely breathe in the tight grasp of Tia, the kraken diligently making sure he stayed silent by crushing the air from his lungs every time he tried to speak. Dave's tenacity was remarkable. She'd been repeating this for at least half an hour and still he tried to insult her at every opportunity. But stubborn boys in need of more tentacle hugs were her favorite. Once she'd squeezed the fight out of him she would take her time to swallow him whole. Saliva already flowed down her cheek. The kraken briefly looked up to Gloria and winked. Everything was under control down here. The gnoll nodded and closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Tia and Dave are having lots of fun together.\" Your babysitter said gleefully as she entered the living room again. You'd dug up an old plastic bag and put her dirty clothes in it. She smiled at the thoughtful gesture and sat down next to you on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, little man. I think it was my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurn? What did she mean? Suddenly you realize she was still thinking about Truth or Dare. And with your dare in the shower she was indeed up next. A shiver ran down your spine. You could tell she wasn't too happy about being clean. You could only hope she would show mercy. With a massive, smug grin the gnoll leaned close. She'd already squashed you between her fat gut and the bathroom wall during her shower, what more could she have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth, boy...\" You gulp loudly, further widening her smirk. \"Do you think... I'm cute?\" You look at her, baffled by the question. Was she really hitting on you or was this part of her game? If you said yes it'd give her reason to smother you with her adoration. But if you said no she'd take umbrage and punish you. You had to choose your words very carefully, since neither her overwhelming love nor her gleeful punishment sounded good to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were a gnoll, I'd say you're the cutest thing I've seen.\" You stammered out, making Gloria sit back a little. She was blushing brightly, flattered by your suggestion. She decided to keep prying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you... kiss me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would open my muzzle wide and slobber all over that cute face of yours.\" You made sure to remind your babysitter this was all some hypothetical scenario in which you were a gnoll, but Gloria didn't care. She leaned back, subtly lowering her arm around your back and pulling you close to her. You bump into her big belly. The smell was surprisingly bearable, a distinct gnoll stink covered up by a bottle's worth of shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know just what to say, little man.\" She said with a smile as she snuggled up to you. \"What else would you do on our first date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDate?! You really hoped she was still thinking about your imaginary gnoll man. The mental image of that kiss alone was enough to make you feel a bit queasy. You wouldn't last ten minutes in a gnoll date. With a weary sigh you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'd take you to swim in the city's sewage plant. Then we go for dinner to the finest restaurants to dive through their dumpsters. Finally I'd take you to the city dump and look at the stars with you whilst sitting atop the biggest mountain of filth we can find.\" With each line she hugged you a little tighter. Finally she looked down with pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human girls are lucky to have you. You're a real romantic.\" You smile awkwardly in return. You just tried to think of the most disgusting things to do on a date, figures the gnoll would be all over it. At least she didn't want to take you out on such a date. Gloria yawns loudly, her foul breath washing over you. Inbetween the games, the shower and your little chat just now bedtime had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gently cradles you in her arms and takes you to your bedroom. She tucks you in lovingly and sits on your bedside. A devious glint popped in her eye and she looked down at the little man in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last dare...\" She whispered. You rolled your eyes. Of course she'd want to keep playing around. Her competitive spirit wouldn't allow anything else. You feared for the worst, but Gloria's soothing smile calmed you down a little. You wouldn't have expected a literal monster to be so friendly. Granted, she'd squashed you mercilessly in the shower, but by her standards that seemed almost insignificant. You were spared a lot of stinky torment. You kept your cool and managed not to make Dave's mistakes. You almost pitied him, right up to the point where you remember what a gigantic asshole he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dare you... hmmmm...\" Gloria falls short, causing you to raise a curious brow. \"I've got two options for a dare and I like them both. I know, I'll let you choose.\" You gulp a little and nod. \"First, I could dare you to let me kiss you goodnight. A gnolly kiss though, if you know what I mean.\" She licks her chops in anticipation. You shiver at the thought. \"Orrrr... I could dare you to let me sleep under your bed.\" That didn't sound so bad. \"Of course, monster rules say that if I see any limbs dangling over the side I get to grab them and drag them and whoever is attached to them under the bed too for some... monstering.\" Her smile grew a mile wide at the word 'monstering'. What did it even mean? Gloria refused to elaborate and laid out the choice before you. A gnoll kiss or having a monster under your bed preying on you?</span></div></div>",

Furthermore, you had to guess \u2018monstering\u2019 meant she\u2019d probably eat you whole, and the last thing you wanted was to spend the night in a gnoll\u2019s belly. You looked back up at Gloria as she grinned toothily down at you, \u201cUm, I\u2019ll go with the goodnight kiss please.\u201d Gloria\u2019s grin grew wider as she clasped her paws together and licked and smacked her huge, rubbery black lips, \u201cWonderful. Now hold still!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria bends over and puckers her drool soaked lips as she starts to smooch your forehead, leaving behind an oozing trail of gnoll saliva. She opens her jaws and buckets of drool seep out onto your face, getting in your eyes and even some dripping into your nose. You cough and sputter as her tongue slurps its way across your face. Her hot garbage breath wafts through your nostrils. She licks your cheeks, your nose and even slobbers her tongue across your mouth as she lightly nibbles your cheeks and kisses your nose. By the time she\u2019s done your entire face is soaked with gnoll spit, and some spittle even founds its way onto your pillow, making your pillow dampened and smelling of gnoll saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe playfully waves at you and coos, \u201cNight, night, don\u2019t let the werewolves bite.\u201d She giggled as she exited your room, winking and smiling at you on last time before shutting the door. Once she was gone you grumbled to yourself. You were still shocked that you were just tucked in by a monster, but annoyed that she had to just gross you out before bed. Plus, with her drool and breath still lingering on your pillow you doubted you\u2019d get a peaceful nights sleep tonight. Gloria walked downstairs, happy with how her job had been going so far. Then she remembered Dave and her friend Tia. The gnoll smirked, wondering how they were \u2018getting along\u2019. Gloria crept to the basement and opened the door. The hyena monster stepped down the creaky staircase to find\u2026</span></div></div>",

You looked down towards the floor and gestured to her, \u201cWould you mind sleeping under my bed?\u201d Gloria chuckled and winked at you, \u201cNot at all sport.\u201d Gloria laid down on her stomach and started crawling under your bed without any hesitation or issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to peer under your bed to see how she managed to squeeze herself under there but you feared she\u2019d grab you and pull you under.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could even think of a response to her dare, the gnoll raised her hand, as if asking permission to speak. \"Oooh, oh, I got an idea. Why don't I dare you to do both?\" You raise a surprised eyebrow. Were you really going to have to explain the obvious to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's against the rules?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I put in a little something extra to sweeten the deal?\" Gloria said with a devious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could you possibly offer me to accept both those dares?\" You had no idea what the hell she had in mind, but you had to admit you were certainly curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give you my phone number. If your little brother is being particularly dickish you've just gotta call and he'll be getting a smelly nighttime visit from yours truly. How's that sound for a reward?\" Holy shit, that actually sounded great. The ability to make Dave's life hell, just a phone call away. The little prick usually asked for it, but you somehow always managed to get in trouble with your parents the moment you pushed him away. He even managed to get you grounded a few times pulling this shit. You seriously began to consider the gnoll's challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, suppose I agree to this, what next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know what's coming next.\" Gloria said with a toothy smile, leaning down. She took hold of your head with two muscular hands, drool trailing from her maw onto your chest. She only needed the slightest confirmation to get started and there was no going back now. Seeing that big maw approaching and smelling the horrid breath washing over you filled you with regret almost immediately. She was coming in for that kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria loved feeling the little guy squirm in her grasp. Not all the showers and shampoo in the world could undo her gnollish breath. A kiss might not be much, but she'd make sure he'd remember this one for the rest of his life. She opened her maw a little and flopped her tongue down onto his neck. Slowly she dragged the soggy muscle up along his face, leaving a thick trail of smelly spittle. In just two more slow licks his entire face had been glazed with gnoll drool. But where other gnolls might consider that a job well done Gloria eagerly went for a few more licks, just to be sure. The boy still wasn't very tasty, unlike the little delicacy that was his brother. The gnoll almost felt bad for tricking him. She could only hope her phone would ring soon so she could spend some time tormenting Dave before gobbling that delectable little brat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlobbering all over your face was just the beginning of this nightmarish kiss. You wanted to cry out for mercy, but you knew the gnoll wouldn't give you any. You also really wanted to avoid any of that slimy saliva from entering your mouth. You hoped those stinky licks were the gnollish equivalent of a kiss, but Gloria was there to show you how wrong you were. Two thick lips pressed themselves on your mouth and she began smooching your face. The look in her eyes made it clear. She wanted in and she would keep on slobbering all over your face until she got the kiss you owed her. There was no other way out of this, but you had one last trick up your sleeve. Her eyes widened in shock as she felt your hand on the back of her head, holding her steady as you opened your mouth and let her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large gnoll tongue plunged in without hesitation, spreading the rotten taste of gnoll spit all over your mouth. It was so horrible you started to convulse in sheer disgust. Gloria didn't seem bothered in the slightest by your twitching and thrashing. She was far too busy plastering the inside of your mouth with her saliva. The large tongue coiled around your own and drove itself deep into your throat, playing freely as you were hanging on for dear life. For a moment you began to feel lightheaded, the gnoll's passionate kiss leaving no air for you to breathe. With a wet pop she finally detached herself from your face. You were on the verge of passing out, your breathing shallow and your heart racing. You clumsily wipe the worst of her kiss from your eyes, looking up to see the world's smuggest grin on your babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pity the human girl that has to top that.\" She said proudly, looking at the drool-soaked face of her victim. Gloria sat back a little to let you recover. You managed a wry smile, content in the knowledge that this was probably the hard part of her dares. After all, having her lurk under your bed for a night couldn't be all that bad, right? As long as you kept your limbs on board she'd have no reason to drag you under and unleash a 'monstering' on you. And the grand prize of her phone number would make it so worth it. You had to suffer one kiss, Dave would be on the receiving end of so much more and so much worse. You reached for your shirt to wipe of the foul spit, but Gloria gave you a hand, grabbing your shirt for you and roughly rubbing it on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, part one complete. Now for the real monster magic.\" Gloria got down on all fours and peered under your bed. She began to crawl underneath, the darkness below your bed playing tricks on your eyes. How else was it possible for this pudgy gnoll to even begin to fit under your bed. She was easily four times fatter than the gap she was now effortlessly slipping into. Suddenly she stopped and pulled back, looking surprised. She poked her head under your bed one more time before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia? What are you doing under there?\" A second voice rang out from under your bed. \"Oh, I got a bit lonely. This little brat isn't doing much talking anymore.\" Gloria covered her maw, snickering loudly. \"Hah, you gotta see this.\" She said, beckoning you over. You lean down and look under your bed. Beneath it was a seemingly endless expanse of darkness. In the dark you could vaguely identify the humongous mass of writhing tentacles that was Tia. First the gnoll and now an entire sea monster, all under your bed? And without it even lifting a little? What other monstrous trickery could they perform? The kraken cheerily waved her slimy tendrils and pointed at her body. Amidst the slithering mass her smooth skin turned transparent, revealing your little brother struggling in her stomach. You weren't sure how to react. Dave was a prick, but you were literally watching him digest alive. Gloria saw your concern and tried to soothe you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine. We can't actually hurt him, just scare him. This is all a bad dream to him, and in a few minutes he'll wake up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia smirked. \"Yeah, wake up good and scared. Your little brother is amazing. He just wouldn't stop shouting as I wrapped my arms around him and squeezed his little bones to dust. And his taste... so good. I felt him squirm the entire way down my throat. The best meal I've had in years.\" Her enthusiasm was unsettling, but it did raise a question. If under your bed was already occupied, what would Gloria do? And would she ever explain what the hell 'monstering' meant? She kept avoiding the latter topic, but on the former one she had a few ideas.</span></div></div>",

Move any closer and I could easily grab your little head and pull you down here.\u201d You didn\u2019t like the sound of that so you got back into your resting position, pulling your covers back on and tried to sleep. After a few horrible hours of hearing the two monsters chat, plus those slimy tentacles and the ear-piercing laughs from Gloria, you fell asleep. The last time you looked at the clock it was around 1:12 A.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groggily reawaken, a few hours later, you stare at the clock and see that it\u2019s 4:38 A.M. You lightly feel the need to go to the bathroom, but then you realize something that makes your blood run cold. You gasp as you feel a large, powerful gnoll paw tightly grasping your leg. You hear the feminine giggles of the two monsters under your bed. Gloria blurts out, \u201cGotcha, small fry!\u201d You are swiftly pulled out of your bed, you slam against your bedroom floor before you\u2019re pulled under your bed. Once underneath the darkness beneath your bed you\u2019re pulled towards a mischeviously grinning Gloria, \u201cNow time for a good monstering!\u201d You whimpered lightly, about to wet your pants, \u201cW-what does that mean?\u201d The gnoll smirks, finally answering your question\u2026</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not like you\u2019d intentionally go in there, you knew what was waiting for you in there. Then again, the smug look on her muzzle told you she had some kind of devious plan.

You were part curious and part terrified what this crazy monster would think of next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't have you whisked away by some betentacled horror.\" She announces grandly. From under your bed you can hear a perturbed. \"Hey!\" Apparently Tia does not approve. But you were still none the wiser to the gnoll's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall protect you from her.\" With a slight tremble in your voice you ask the babysitter how she would accomplish this. She looks you in the eye and her smile turns a mile wide. You already know you're not gonna like this, but it doesn't look like there's any stopping this gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will stop any of your limbs from hanging over the edge of your bed.\" Gloria was a champion at keeping you guessing, though you were not expecting her next move. She took off her shirt and got closer. \"Prepare yourself kiddo, I'm coming in.\" The gnoll struck a T-pose and let herself fall forward. You yelp in surprise as her pudgy form collapses on top of you. In an instant she had you smothered up to your neck, utterly incapable of moving. Her tawny fur brushed against you as you tried your hardest to just breathe beneath her. She wasn't crushing you as heavily as you feared, but the massive weight did make every breath a struggle. By far the worst aspect of this was her head landing right next to yours. She pulled you close, the air slowly filling with foul gnoll breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria... too much... please...\" You stammer out. Mercifully she adjusts herself, shifting a lot of her bulk off of you. Instead of her big body, now her arms were wrapped around you to immobilize you. They held you firmly, pinning you against her fuzzy body. It almost felt like spooning, but the gnoll had a different picture in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, like a cute little teddy bear. Don't worry human, I won't let you fall prey to Tia's tentacles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" The sulking kraken under your bed replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shush you, you already had the other one to play with. Don't be greedy.\" The gnoll countered, drawing a tiny giggle from Tia. Your heartbeat quickened as a thin tentacle rose up from under your bed. It glistened with slime and squirmed with anticipation. Did you already leave a limb exposed? No way. Was Tia breaking the monster rules? Fortunately, the kraken had far less sinister plans. She waved the tentacle at you. \"Good night, little human. Maybe we'll get to know eachother better another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria held her little teddy human close. His smooth skin felt soft and his worried heartbeat was funny. She snuggled up to him tightly, trying her hardest to reassure him. But perhaps it was precisely because a gnoll woman nearly twice his size was hugging him that his heart was racing. She simply murred softly, enjoying the moment, as her eyelids started to grow heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began to accept that this crazy night was just going to end like this. With you in the arms of your babysitter, who was falling asleep in your bed holding on to you like a human-sized plushie. Also of course the giant mythological sea monster that now somehow managed to fit her enormous body under your bed. The same monster who proudly showed you she'd eaten your brother, but not really? You still had so many questions about Gloria and Tia. In a strange way you hope they'll come babysitting again. For a smelly beast, Gloria was surprisingly gentle. Though you were under no illusions that part of her appeal was the fact you dared her to shower and use up an entire bottle of shampoo. This would be far less pleasant had she still carried her usual stink. You shudder to think of her rotting sewer-like smell seeping into your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gnoll's body calmed down and Gloria began to drift off, you too began to feel at ease. In the gnoll's grip there'd be no chance of you accidentally shuffling a limb over the edge of your bed. You're almost surprised she'd not just crawl under your bed anyways. If the darkness under your bed can fit an entire kraken, how hard would it be for a gnoll to fit in too? Maybe this was her plan all along. She was close friends with Tia after all. Your got more and more drowsy as you fall asleep on the soft pillow that is her chest. You blush a little, realizing the gnoll's chest is probably this soft because your head is resting on her boobs. Oh well, when life gives you a gnoll babysitter, use her tits as a pillow, right? With a broad smile you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up to an unfamiliar sound. At first it sounded like that obnoxious neighbour on his loud motorcycle. But when it fell still only to start up again seconds later you began to realize this wasn't the heavy rumble of an engine. You slowly put one and one together and concluded that the source of the noise was still in your bed. You felt the comfortable hold of Gloria on your body. She hadn't moved an inch all night, snuggling you like her big human teddy bear. She did however start snoring like a chainsaw. You catch a glimpse of your alarm clock. Thankfully it was already morning. You couldn't hear anything over the noise. Wasn't she supposed to be gone anyways? Surely your parents were home by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nose is the next to sound the alarms as you notice the shampoo has lost the war against her natural stink. Already she was smelling a lot more unpleasant and she hadn't even been near any source of filth yet. This was just her default. You began to gently wiggle in her arms, hoping to leave the monster asleep as you went to look for your parents. But she was on the verge of waking up too and within your first few wiggles the snoring was suddenly interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... wha... hmmm... oh, hi there. Did you sleep well?\" She asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're surprisingly soft.\" You replied with a smile, making the babysitter giggle a bit. Probably best not to mention the smell for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, with my cuddly protection there'll be no tentacles snatching you out of your bed and into the depths. Oh my, is that the time? We should get some breakfast sorted out.\" Gloria sat up, placing you beside her on the bed. You were glad to be clear of her smelly body for now, but you immediately worried how much of that sweaty stench had soaked into your bedsheets. With a big yawn the gnoll got up, stretching her back. Her hands easily reached the ceiling, making her giggle for a second. She got down on all fours and peeked under your bed. As she expected the dark depths beneath your bed were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, Tia's already back home. Speaking of, I should probably hand you back to your parents.\" You absentmindedly nod and follow her to the living room. In your head you were already working out how to most effectively air out your room. You walk down the stairs to an eerie silence. It seemed like you and the babysitter were the only ones home. It made you wonder something else too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, where's Dave?\" You expected him on the couch, swearing at his videogames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last you and I saw him was in Tia's belly. So he's probably shivering in his bed. To be honest, I'm more confused by the lack of your parents. Do you know where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No, they're real early birds. Hopefully they're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both yelped in surprise when the phone rang. Gloria immediately walked to it and picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parker residence, this is the babysitter speaking... Oh hello Mr. Parker, how are you... They've been fine. Dave and I had a little trouble seeing eye to eye first but nothing a little perseverance and discipline couldn't fix.\" You chuckled at the gnoll's idea of discipline. Throwing your little brother to the mercy of a sea monster was definitely a way to instill obedience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Yes... Yes?... Let me think, I should be able to... Alright, I can do that... Not a problem... Have a good time... Goodbye Mr. Parker.\" She hung up and smiled at your increasingly curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents had so much fun celebrating their anniversary they've gone and planned a little holiday for the weekend. They just called to ask if I could stay a bit longer, and my agenda is completely empty for this weekend. So now I'm going to watch over and play with you for the next two days! This is going to be so much fun!\" She giggled with glee. You froze in place. Another two full days with this smelly beast stinking up the house? Surely you were still asleep and lulled into a stinky nightmare by the gnoll. You pinch yourself to wake up, but nothing happens aside from Gloria raising a curious brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, this must be a dream come true! It's not often I get to babysit someone nice. Now come on, let's get you some breakfast.\" You tell the gnoll to take it easy. Being fourteen meant you could sort your own breakfast. With a cheeky smirk you offer the gnoll the contents of the trash can in the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're so kind.\" She cooed before sitting down in front of the can. She popped the lid off and gasped. \"Oh my word, this looks delicious!\" You gag a little at the thought alone as she smells the pungent rotting food. Without another moment's pause she digs in with both hands, greedily devouring the trash. Your stomach turns a little as you prepare a sandwich. You both finish your breakfast at about the same time, Gloria contently patting her belly and letting out a big burp. You're glad you're not near it, since you fear it would smell so rotten it could strip paint. At least you didn't have to take out the trash anymore. The foul beast got up from her meal and looked at you. Suddenly a devious smile grew on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna prank Dave? He doesn't know yet I'm still here.\" Another opportunity like this wasn't gonna happen soon and you wholly agreed that little brat could use some more misery in his life. You sneak upstairs, Gloria proving to be surprisingly stealthy for a big, pudgy gnoll. You opened the door to Dave's room to find him still sleeping. He seemed peaceful enough, his night with Tia must've really tired him out. A pity he was in for a rude awakening. What did Gloria have in mind?</span></div></div>",

She speaks in her most motherly tone, \u201cSweetie pie? Honey? Time to wake up for school.\u201d Dave seems to grumble in his sleep before he gets a whiff of a nasty smell.

The gas blast filled the room with a thick green fume. It was so thick you could taste the fart. You pulled your shirt over your mouth and nose but it did little good as you kept gagging.

Her personal mantra of 'the early gnoll eats the best' hadn't let her down let. Just when kids think the long scary night is over she'd strike, dragging them under their beds and gobbling them up. But for Dave, she wanted something a little different. If she ate him first thing in the morning she wouldn't be able to play with him all day. And besides, she just ate already. Thankfully she had plenty of other ideas in store for the sleeping boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared in awe as she stood beside her bed and turned around to present her massive ass. Seeing it loom over Dave almost made you feel bad. In spite of you not doing anything you felt a little complicit in encouraging the gnoll to do this to your brother. But then you remembered the time he stole your headset and broke it on purpose. Her butt couldn't come down hard enough. Gloria looked over her shoulder at you and with a devilish smile you nod. Time to wake Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smelly beast raised her butt up high before simply hopping back and sitting down on the bed. With a heavy <i>WHUMP</i> she sank about halfway into the mattress, making little Dave disappear beneath her. Through what could only be described as a miracle the bed didn't collapse completely under her pudgy mass. The wood creaked and groaned, but held on. The only evidence that the gnoll wasn't just sitting on an empty bed were one of Dave's hands and feet poking out from under the flabby cheeks. They trashed wildly, joined later by a soft, muffled screaming echoing out from where his head would roughly be. The babysitter just sighed with relief, feeling her victim squirming beneath her. She looks over her shoulder again to see you standing there with a big grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for babysitting?\" She asked with the biggest, goofiest smile as you groan at her shitty pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, little Dave here might make you look good, but you barely hesitated when a half-ton gnoll offered to sit on your brother. Maybe the apple doesn't fall that far from the tree after all.\" You gulp. What did she mean by that? So far she seemed to treat you better because by her own admission good kids taste gross. But if letting her do this made you bad, did that mean you were slowly putting yourself on the menu? Gloria continued. \"And daring a poor gnoll to use shampoo... that's cold, man.\" She wasn't really still upset about that, right? You had to save face somehow, lest this smelly monster might think about sitting on you next or worse, eating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I also offer you a bin full of our finest garbage?\" You counter, hoping your limited understanding of monster logic would save your skin. Gloria begrudgingly nods, salivating a bit at the memory of that meal. Her wide smile soon returned. \"Just watch yourself, buster. I can be a bad influence on kids. Speaking of which, before I forget. Here.\" She pulled a small business card out of her pocket, handing it to you. It had a phone number as well as a bit of text. 'Gloria - professional stench connoisseur - high-impact babysitter - experienced child handler' You look up to her and ask with a smile: \"High-impact babysitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria laughs. \"I don't know about you, but I think Dave's feeling the impact of my babysitting quite a lot.\" You chuckle in agreement, whipping out your phone to store the gnoll's number. \"You just call me whenever you want Dave's day to be a little more miserable and a lot more smelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I call you just to talk?\" You asked, hoping to show you didn't want to just use her as a tool to punish Dave. Maybe she'd understand you weren't the bad kid she thought she was turning you into. At first it seemed to work, the gnoll raising a curious brow. She even stopped wiggling her butt and grinding Dave beneath her. But when she responded in a sultry tone you immediately feared you'd given her entirely the wrong idea. \"Oh, I can pop out under <i>your</i> bed too if you want. Maybe chat a little, see where the night takes us...\" You had a sinking feeling this was going to bite you in the butt almost literally at some point. For now you kept your best smile and looked down at Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll leans back one last time before getting up, looking down at the flattened boy.</span></div></div>",

His eyes slightly flutter open as he groans, \u201cHmmm, I\u2019m tired. Five more minutes mom.\u201d Gloria cackled, \u201cOh, that\u2019s precious. You think I\u2019m your mom.

She wrapped her arms around his waist and hoisted him off the floor. His head bounced against her jiggling rack, saved from slipping between them by her shirt. The gnoll steps back to a mostly clear part of the room. You quickly realize what is happening and that you might be in the splash zone for this belly flop. She didn't seem to notice or care until she freed one arm and raised it grandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, the Belly Bomb! Best clear the range because this one's coming in heavy.\" With those words she gave you a big pat on the back. So big that you stumble forward onto the ground. When you look behind you to see what the hell had gotten into her you scream. Towering over you was the gnoll's enormous gut, Dave held tightly against it. Gloria had already jumped up and like a fatty blimp she was hovering over you moments before gravity would bring her down on you. Everything seemed to slow down as your body was buried beneath her big gut. The impact was heavy enough to make the joists in the floor creak, her belly completely smothering you and Dave.

Both you and Dave scream as she flattens you up to your necks under her massive bottom. One cheek for each of you, enough mass to make you fear your bones would snap at any moment. You cry out for mercy and thankfully the giddy gnoll only squashes you two for a few seconds. She looked back at the kids, smiling broadly. \"Sorry boys, I just couldn't resist.

Then a loud bassy rumble could be heard from Gloria\u2019s belly, it was rumbling, hungry for more food. The gnoll rubbed it with her paw, with a disappointed look on her muzzle, \u201cReally? Hungry again? I just had breakfast too.\u201d The gnoll caught a whiff of something tasty and delicious, she followed the scent and turned her head to Dave. Her kraken friend may have gotten a taste of Dave last night but now it was her turn. With a devious grin, the gnoll walked up to Dave, she happily chimed, \u201cHeya Dave! Wanna see something cool?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was not at all happy with his huge, fat, stinky monster babysitter, \u201cWhat is it you smelly freak?\u201dWithout even answering, Gloria hip-checked the boy, sending him back on the ground. The next thing Dave saw was Gloria\u2019s wide, drooling maw, \u201cNot again-\u201c That was the last thing Dave said before his entire upper body was shoved in the gnoll\u2019s muzzle. Gloria murred in pleasure, enjoying the squirming boys flavor, \u201cMmm, tastes like chicken!\u201d The hyena monster tilted her head back, sucking in the struggling boy even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now his head was in her tight esophagus, making her furry neck bulge out as all that was left outside was his kicking legs. Gloria slurped up Dave\u2019s leg\u2019s like a pair of noodles before on last GLURK sent a little-brother-sized bulge down her throat. The gnoll let out a bassy belch as your brother plummeted into her belly, turning it from a chubby gut to a full on jiggly dome of a belly. You have to stifle a laugh, it looks like Dave just makes good monster-food! But what is your gnoll babysitter\u2019s next move?</span></div></div>",

Both you and Dave were on the ground, shivering and groaning a little, recovering from her painful butt squash. Your whole body ached and the smell of Gloria's butt sweat had clung to your nose. As you try to sit up and regain your composure, you hear the babysitter mumbling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, breakfast's done. They're awake and I got a little morning workout out of them...\" Suddenly she looked you both in the eye and spoke up. \"I know, it's time for your bath. But none of that horrible human stuff, you're getting a bath the gnollish way. C'mere you.\" Whilst Dave was still confused you knew better than to just lie there. She'd already exposed you to that foul tongue once before, you were in no rush to meet it again. With your little brother already in her grasp she stumbled after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hold up. Don't be like this. I'm only gonna wash your face, otherwise this is gonna take all day. If you stop running right now I'll get you a treat.\" Try as she might, the gnoll couldn't catch up to you whilst carrying Dave around. With a frustrated sigh she gave up the chase and set about resolving this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just wait there, I'll get you in a moment. First I'll take care of your brother.\" You almost pity Dave, listening to the loud, wet slurping echoing down the hallway. She was being very thorough with her tongue bath. Though her delighted murring gave you the suggestion she was only being this meticulous because your little pest of a brother tasted so nice to monsters. Greedily she dragged her big, squishy tongue all over his face, savouring the taste and leaving behind thick layers of gnoll drool. He tried to fight off the slobbery assault, but against Gloria's strength there wasn't much he could achieve. When she was finally done with him, the gnoll set him down in the hallway. One down, one to go. As the slurping noises stopped, you knew she was done with your brother. Desperately, you try to bargain with the smelly beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I just use the shower?\" You offer, but she just laughs. \"Oh no, not a chance. I need you to be clean, no excuses.\" Heavy footsteps followed, far faster than you'd ever expect from someone as pudgy as her. Without Dave slowing her down, the gnoll was upon you before you could reach the end of the hall. She grabbed your arm and pulled your horrified face close. The stench of fresh gnoll sweat was horrid, but her breath was even worse. Her short chase had worn her down a little and she was panting loudly right in your face. After a breakfast of the kitchen trash can, you weren't surprised it was this bad, but even then it was almost impressively foul. A burning dumpster would smell heavenly compared to the gnoll's breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you in her grasp, what does the gnoll babysitter do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The stench of her foul breath became a hundred times worse as she took your whole head into her mouth. Gently she closed her jaws around you, her thick lips shielding you from her sharp teeth. You whimper and wiggle, but you're at her mercy. Gloria starts your punishment with a throaty belch. The nasty, caustic stink burns your nose, but it's just a precursor for the hell she's about to put your through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll hoists you off your feet and carries you with her, loudly slurping and suckling on your head. Feeling you wiggle and squirm pathetically in her tight grip was a delight. Especially after you so rudely ran away from her. Now she could give you a tongue bath for the ages. But as her tongue began to slither all around you she thought of an even better punishment. Why not just keep him where he is now? She began to loudly hum to herself, enjoying the sensation of her tongue tormenting you. With each lick it deposited another payload of fetid gnoll spittle on your head until you feared you might drown in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her human lollipop securely in her arms she walked back and picked up Dave. He was still recovering from her savage tongue bath earlier, drool leaking from his twitching body. He wasn't permitted the time to process the horrors he'd endured as Gloria had bigger plans for both of you. With a satisfied smirk she kept you in position with just one strong arm pinning you against her belly and chest. The other meaty hand grabbed Dave and pulled him up. He barely struggled as she carried you both down the stairs. With a heavy grunt she dropped him onto the couch and pointed at him to stay seated. With a horrified expression your little brat of a brother was forced to look at the babysitter treating you like a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, youw wrotheh tashte like craph, but he feelsh nice.\" She spoke with her maw full. Gloria never even paused her tongue's slobbery assault as she kept laying on the punishment. With every lick you feared you might just break down crying. Either because of the stench or the creepy notion that she was secretly trying to French you. That tongue lapped by your mouth far more than anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria slurped and suckled for minutes straight, your body twitching and struggling in all kinds of cute ways for her. Only when she feared the stench might finally knock you out did she release you. A loud, squelching pop signaled the end of your tongue bath as she proudly showed off her handiwork to Dave. You looked ghastly, every part of your head was utterly soaked in thick, pungent saliva. Your hair was matted down and your eyes seemed hollow. The gnoll was quick to pick up on your dead-eyed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, does the poor widdle human need a moment to recover? Maybe next time you're offered a tongue bath you won't be so rude about it. But it's okay, we can take a break. Let's watch some TV. Human programs are always so funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set you down on the couch. You exchange a horrified look with Dave, who looked practically pristine compared to you. A bit of TV was probably nice after the nightmare she put you both through. But you were celebrating too early. Both you and Dave let out a panicked scream when you see Gloria's wide bottom come crashing down towards you. With a loud <i>THUMP</i> the gnoll fills almost the entire couch with her big butt. The two teens were completely smothered beneath her. A single, massive buttcheek had you pinned, leaving almost no room for you to breathe. You had no way of telling, but you couldn't imagine Dave doing much better right now. both of you wiggled as best you could to unseat the pudgy beast, but Gloria was having none of it. She ground her massive cheeks from side to side, pressing you into the couch even more and drawing a chorus of pained groans from under here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you boys stay put, you hear me. Or I'm going to have to get real nasty with you.\" She spoke threateningly. Her belly rumbled as if it had been waiting for this moment. The prospect of being subjected to farts on top of the heavy punishment you were already enduring was enough to scare you motionless. How long does the gnoll remain seated?</span></div></div>",

She laughs herself silly at all the strange creatures on the screen. How could humans get this stuff so wrong when there were so many monsters out there. When a haggard looking were-bear rips a man to pieces all she can think of is her old ex having a really bad hair day. Her bellowing laughter shakes her whole body, ensuring you didn't miss a single funny moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dave were not so cheerful. The immense gnoll butt had you smothered completely, a large buttcheek for each of you. The weight was enormous, but thankfully you could just about manage to breathe. How you hadn't suffocated yet was a mystery, but it wouldn't surprise you if Gloria had some strange trick up her sleeve to make sure the naughty kids she sat on lasted nice and long under her big bottom. She probably loved your faint wriggling as you tried to no avail to find an ounce of comfort underneath her. Intentional or not, she managed to squish you just a little bit more every time she burst out laughing. And though you couldn't tell what the hell she was watching, you could hear her laughing and you could feel her body shaking whenever she did. All you could do was hope it was just a short comedy sketch she was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo excruciating hours later you were finally given your reprieve as the movie's credits rolled, only to be cut off by more commercials. Gloria turned off the TV and stood up, eager to inspect the teens who've been keeping her company throughout the movie. Your newfound freedom was met with loud, pained groans as you tried to rub some sense back into yourself. Getting compressed under the gnoll's massive but had left you sore all over. Things took a turn for the worse when you looked over at Dave. He wasn't there anymore, just a small dent in the couch where he used to be. Immediately you fear the worst. He'd ended up stuck in her buttcrack, maybe even shoved up the gnoll's butt completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria too notices Dave's absence, but she hadn't pulled him in. She scratched her head until the obvious solution hit her. She reached behind her and peeled your younger brother of her asscheek. He'd been smushed so thoroughly he was plastered onto the soft surface. She dropped him back on the couch and loomed over the pair of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, boys. Maybe one day you'll put some real monsters in your movies. Wouldn't that be something... Can you imagine. Gloria, movie star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were too knackered to do anything more than nod. Even Dave couldn't manage a snarky response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what shall we do next...\" The smelly gnoll ponders aloud.</span></div></div>",

You stay here for a few minutes, boys. I'll be right back.\" Gloria cooed as she walked up the stairs. She didn't have to worry much about either of you getting up to much. Both you and Dave were still worn out from enduring her heavy butt for two hours. You were steadily trying to rub the circulation back into your limbs. Dave did the same, loudly grumbling about the gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does that damn bitch think she is?! This is such bullshit man! When mom and dad get back they'll have her arrested for abusing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" You answer sarcastically. \"Mom and dad were the ones that ordered her, remember? I doubt you find a website to order monster babysitters by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever happens, I'm not taking anymore orders from that smelly mutt. I'm packing my things and heading over to Johnny until our parents are back. Fuck spending another minute here getting tortured by her.\" As much as he was a little shit, your younger brother had a point. At this stage Gloria didn't seem to care that she was hurting you too, in spite of you trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. You didn't respond to him. You weren't sure why you felt the need to keep quiet, but you had a gut feeling all his ranting was about to bite him in the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave quickly grabbed a few cans of cola from the fridge and a packet of crisps, throwing it all together in an old shopping bag. He put on his coat and walked to the front door. You tried in vain to talk him out of it. So far the gnoll had been playful, you dread to think what she'd do to him if she got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give a fuck!\" Dave shouted, swinging open the door. He didn't manage to take a single step before colliding with a large, hairy belly. Before him stood Gloria, smiling from ear to ear with a fearsome, toothy grin. Your brother yelped in fear before she threw back her butt and thrust her big gut forward, bumping your brother clean through the hallway. Before he could get back on his feet, a large hand grabbed him by the throat. The gnoll carried her prize back in to the living room and dropped Dave on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They always try to run... I love it when my prey tries to run.\" She growled. Your little brother tried to get up and run but she grabbed him by his coat. He shook it off, but it was too late. Her hand found its way around his neck again and she lifted him off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And fighty to boot. I've got a special place for you. Promise you'll keep squirming, okay?\" Gloria's savage grin managed to get even wider as she brought Dave close to that big, toothy smirk. She opened her maw wide and let Dave peer down her ravenous gullet. He only offered a last loud \"fuck you!\" as she slammed him down her throat. For a moment your brother seemed to have gotten stuck halfway down the monster's neck, but with a low growl Gloria persevered, gulping him down whole. She followed it up with a satisfied belch whilst rubbing her big belly. It was barely visible to you, but she could feel Dave pushing against her stomach. With your pesky brother out of the way, the gnoll's attention turned back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good kid. You wouldn't try to run from me, would you? I had to put your little brother in timeout for today, but now I've got even more time to play with you. And I know just what I'm in the mood for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate my brother!\" You stammered, gobsmacked by her casual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He deserved it, for trying to run and for saying those horrible things about me.\" You felt disturbed, but also validated. Your gut feeling had been on point, she had heard everything you two said in her absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll babysitter walked over to the couch and motioned for you to clear out lest she'd sit on you again. As she sat down Dave's dangling legs were pushed up her butt effortlessly. She grabbed you and wrapped you in a warm, if intensely smelly, hug. You squirm for whatever distance you can get from her rancid body odour, but against her strength it's of little use. She switches the television over to a romantic movie and starts to watch it intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what's worse. The disgustingly cringy movie or the sewer-like stench Gloria was almost certainly soaking your clothes with. You like this shirt, and now you'll probably have to burn it. But given the brutal display you've just seen, being held tightly to her smelly chest seemed like a mild annoyance. As the romantic scenes roll by on the screen you begin to feel more and more awkward. Mostly because you feel the fat gnoll babysitter ruffle your hair, stroke your neck and even once giving the back of your neck a small lick. Finally the lovers on screen start kissing and the movie is over shortly thereafter. But being pressed against her chest you felt the gnoll's heartbeat rising all this time. You fear for what she has in mind next.</span></div></div>",

She had you wrapped in a hug and judging by her amorous stare she wasn't planning on letting you go anytime soon. You're not sure what she was doing, just sitting there and looking at you. Was she thinking about eating you too? Or possibly even worse... kissing you? She'd kissed you last night on a dare and it made it pretty clear to you that you didn't want to repeat that for the rest of your life. Now she might be contemplating doing it again without any rewards attached. You squirm a little, but she just absent-mindedly hugs you tighter, making it hard to breathe. Eventually she eases off, but not before mashing your face against her sweat-stained shirt. Were it not for the stench, this would've been adorably cute and comfortable, but right now the only thing you want is to stop this nightmare and get away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll was barely paying attention to the squirming human in her arms. She was busy daydreaming about the movie. If only you were a little older she wouldn't hesitate to replay every scene with you. Every sloppy kiss, every tender moment. She would carry you to the bedroom and do things to you that would make every human girl on Earth seem inadequate. In her amorous trance she held her human close, squeezing him into her soft, pudgy belly and chest. Finally she snapped out of her daydreams and saw you slowly starting to pass out from her overwhelming hug. She eased off and teased you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, gnoll girl leaving you breathless?\" Her flirty tone sent a shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J... Just a bit\" You wheeze out, struggling to breathe mostly because of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'll be gentle.\" Gloria loosened her death grip and rolled back, laying on the couch with you draped on top of her. \"So... did that movie give you any... ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that I'm not the target audience for that stuff... what a snorefest.\" You reply jokingly. Gloria catches on to your tone, but seems a little disappointed nonetheless. As much as you don't want to upset her, you really don't want her to think you're into getting romantic with her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm sure my gnollish charms will sway you sooner or later.\" You gulp. She seems disturbingly motivated to woo you. You remind her of your age, but that just puts a churlish smile on her face. \"I'm a patient girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do also know I'm not a gnoll, right? I appreciate that you're being patient, but I'm not sure I'll ever be into gnoll romance.\" You say, feeling a little creeped out by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised how little difference there is. But let's not have an argument now. You're far too sweet and soft to argue with.\" Gloria coos, dragging you a little bit further up along her body. Her soft chest feels incredible, like a fuzzy waterbed. You can feel the soft fur through her shirt and she giggles a little when you try to bounce up and down. Her jiggly body is kinda fun to play with. It still stinks in ways you can barely describe, but since she's not letting you go, you might as well make the best out of a bad situation. The gnoll watches with a smile until she tightens her hug a moment to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's fun, watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat beast sits up a little before spinning herself around. She slowly leans forward, her big belly already pinning your feet and steadily covering more of you. Like a blubbery steamroller you feel the gnoll's big body advance, enveloping more of you. That soft chest is looming over your own, pressing down on it gently before completely smothering you. The gnoll stops herself from engulfing your face too, looking down on her pinned human with a big smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In Soviet Russia, belly bounces on you.\" She said with a heavy fake accent. You roll your eyes and groan at her shitty joke, but she was being more literal than you imagined. The gnoll rocked her body, making her big belly sway up and down, bouncing on top of you. It felt surreal, like a giant flabby hammer smashing you into the couch before lifting off you again. She only did it a few times, but it was enough to knock the wind out of you, leaving you gasping for breath as she settled her mass back on your body. You gag a little as every deep breath you try to take is suffused with her rancid body odour. In a rare wave of pity the gnoll raises her belly. But her smile tells you this act of kindness has some strings attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a little game for you, human. Crawl out from under my belly as fast as you can. If you're fast enough you can watch some TV or play some games whilst I take a nap. Or... you could stay put and let this big, warm gnoll smother you and take a nap with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot into action, scrabbling towards Gloria's face in a desperate rush to avoid her smothering you as she was napping. She hadn't fully lifted her belly and the heavy mass made progress difficult. You nearly reached your goal when you felt something grab your ankle. The gnoll put on her biggest devious smirk as she pulled you right back under her and flopped down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, too slow. Thanks for joining me, human. You're nice and soft too. Now be an angel and keep still down there\" The fat gnoll yawns loudly. \"Babysitting is so tiring, I'm just gonna...\" Her sentence trailed off as the fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does Gloria's nap last?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sleeping gnoll had you pinned under her weight and no matter what you did, she wouldn't budge. Like it or not, you were stuck under the heavy, sweaty gut. With all other options exhausted you try to push past the horrid stench surrounding you and catch some sleep yourself. You weren't even tired yet, but it was better than laying around unable to move. You listened closely to the gnoll's steady heartbeat. It was that or concentrating on the stench and your poor nose practically begged you to do anything else. You felt her shift a little with each breath she took and eventually you managed to drift off to sleep yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke several times that night as the horrible, sweaty stench of the gnoll got too far up your nose. The odd fart didn't help much either. Even when pinned under her gut the smell somehow managed to reach you. In the bits of sleep you do manage to get you're haunted by the strangest dreams. Most of them make little sense and are forgotten the moment you wake up, but one of them sticks with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stood inside the living room, but your perspective had changed. You were taller, nearly big enough to hit the ceiling. You looked down to see a massive hairy belly and an impressive pair of tits on you. You raise your clawed hands and yelp with surprise as you realize you're looking around from Gloria's perspective. Right on cue Dave walks in and immediately you feel a hunger emanating from within your large belly. With every second spent looking at that tasty boy you find it harder to restrain yourself. Just as you lunge towards him you wake up. You were still completely pinned, but there was a strange taste in your mouth. Was this what the gnoll tasted when she ate your brother? You're almost surprised she hadn't eaten him sooner, the taste was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's big belly had you completely isolated from the world. It was impossible to tell how much time had passed, but your gut feeling told you that you'd been under here for a very long time. When the gnoll finally sat up again your hunch proved correct. The living room clock was nearing eleven in the morning. She'd slept for nearly fourteen hours! You're surprised you didn't die of stink and boredom beneath her. She groggily stared at you, still only half awake. A smile crept up on her face and she peeled you off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. Heh, I see you slept well too.\" She said, looking at your thousand yard stare. You tried to shake yourself out of it, the realization slowly sinking in that the nightmare was over. With a grunt you move your aching limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I didn't squash you too much last night, you were just so comfy.\" Gloria blushed a little, making you feel even more weirded out. She set you down on the couch and stood up, stretching her limbs before giving you a hungry look. You perk up quickly. She'd already made a meal out of Dave, was it your turn now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any more of that delicious garbage for me?\" She caught you off-guard with her question, but you were more than happy to point her to the bags waiting for garbage day to roll around. She smelled them and let out an enamored sigh like one would do sniffing a fine perfume. With zeal she tore into the bags, leaving nothing behind as she made them into breakfast. You make a sandwich for yourself and both of you finish you breakfast at the same time. With the putrid stink of garbage on her breath she takes you back to the living room, just in time for Dave to come down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep well, Dave?\" Gloria cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shove it.\" He grumbled. His eyes suddenly bulged out as he realized his mistake and fearfully stared at the growling babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, be nice. Tell you what. How about we play some video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave reluctantly approaches the smelly beast before stopping in his tracks. He squints and asks: \"Hold up, what's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" The gnoll feigned ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always a catch with you. What, winner eats the loser?\" He moped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good one, but I was going for the slightly more tame 'winner sits on loser.'\" She smiles. Gloria had already proven she had an ass big enough to smother both of you beneath it. Being pressed beneath that sweaty, stinky mass again was not high on your wishlist. But Dave didn't seem intimidated. Judging by his cocky grin he had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but only if we play humans vs. monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"two against one, I'm not sure that's fair...\" The gnoll mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not up for a challenge...\" Your little brother said with a smirk. That got the smelly beast fired up. \"Fine! You're on! You okay with Call of Duty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I'm twelve, Call of Duty is my life.\" Dave boasted. He wasn't wrong. The number of hours he spent playing it was only eclipsed by how often he screamed at the people he was playing with. Your little brother handed everyone a controller and soon the game was on. Two humans versus a gnoll, who would win?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The game was a close one. Both teams were almost even in terms of score. At least, half your team was even. Despite Dave's boasting, it turns out that time spent playing didn't immediately correlate to skill. He had this idea in his head that just sprinting around the map and shooting only when someone got in front of him was a bad idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria kept outmaneuvering him at every turn. Every time she shot him in the back or timed her grenade throw perfectly to get him, Dave would leap up with a string of curse words and insults for the knoll babysitter. If this was how he played all the time, then all the screaming you would hear s starting to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were killing Gloria at every opportunity. By the time she even knew where you were, you had already killed her. Unlike Dave, you had actually taken the time to learn the game and play smart. It showed as the game was winding down and you still had no deaths yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe score was tied even. Whoever got the next kill wins. You frantically search the map for Gloria before Dave got himself killed again. Then, time seemed to slow down as you heard the sniper shot. DEFEAT. It read one your screen. Dave had died once more, meaning your loss and what was about to happen was on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria sighed in relief as she stretched. \"Well, that was a close one. Alright you two. You know the bet. Lay down, face up.\" Dave reluctantly did as he was told, while muttering a string of what you assume to be curse words. He lays down on the couch as instructed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you try to join him however, Gloria puts a hand on your shoulder. She shakes her head. \"Not you my little love bug. You almost won. You might have too if he didn't drag you down with his little 'two on one' rule.\" Before Dave could complain, she sat down on his face, muffling him. \"Aahhh. That feels nice. I'll tell you what. One more game, one on one, you and me, double or nothing. If I win, you get down under me with your brother, as well as you both agreeing to do whatever I say for the rest of the night, no questions asked. You win, and I'll let him go, you both get to sit on me, and I'll leave you both alone for the rest of the night. You in?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were uncertain about Gloria's proposition. The price for losing was steep. Having to obey her every desire for the rest of the night would be a challenge to say the least. But she did have a point. Were it not for Dave you might well have defeated the babysitter in that match. She got so many easy kills off him that were this a free for all you might've come out number one. And winning now meant you would be spared from her smelly presence for the rest of the night. With a confident smile you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on. One v one, no tricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly smile crept up on her face. The human was learning fast. She put her hand on her heart and agreed. \"Very well, let's see how good you are without your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match starts and you've barely stepped out of the spawn point before a shot cracks from long range and you're sent right back. First blood to the gnoll, whose sly smirk had turned to a steely gaze. She was concentrating hard, barely having time to enjoy Dave squirming beneath her. Where he would provide distractions by dying to her she now had her full attention on you. Your flanks were met with shotgun blasts to the face and any sniping attempt quickly found you in the same room as a grenade. Your every plan was quickly torn apart as the gnoll always seemed a step ahead. Far too late you realize the trap you've fallen into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" The gnoll coos insincerely. \"You seem to have lost a bit of your edge. Were you expecting me to go easy on you again? I'm afraid that with such a prize ahead I may actually have to try and win.\" She quickly supported her argument with a clever sniper shot to the face from out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. You tried your best to adjust to your opponent, but she always seemed to be a step ahead. You'd feared her using her disgusting breath or burps to distract you, but that was child's play to what she would be allowed to do if you lost. Dave too would be forced to obey her every whim, but that barely mattered to you. In part because he's a little prick that could use some humility in his life, but mostly because it felt like she was going to do all those disgusting things to him anyway. You were far more worried about the special treatment she had in mind for you. Calling you her 'little love bug' sent a shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a final humiliation she shot you down to a single point of health and finished you off with a grenade. Not the explosion, but the physical impact of the grenade hitting you in the head was enough to seal the deal. The match ended with the gnoll doubling your score. You look up to the winner and see the single most satisfied and smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you lost, human. You know what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang your head in defeat and motion for her to lift that fat ass so you could get under there. \"Alright, let's get this over with.\" You added with a reluctant sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you're adorable. Let's skip the sitting and get straight to the good part.\" Gloria licks her chops as she holds you close to her. You gulp loudly, squirming against her foul-smelling body. What did the slobby beast have in mind for you?</span></div></div>",

He can barely contain his giggles as he imagines himself finally dominating her in something he's good at. But even in the face of challenging two teens to a game of Call of Duty Gloria remained calm. Did she have a trick up her sleeve? Hopefully she wouldn't cheat. But without resorting to doing something like letting out smelly farts or wrestling Dave into submission you didn't expect the gnoll to stand a chance. It took only a few minutes for her to completely remove those concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what weapon you and Dave used or what angle you tried to flank from, the gnoll was always a step ahead. With razor-sharp reflexes she managed to answer all of your best laid plans with precise rifle fire and a quick game over for you. Dave didn't fare much better, slowly losing his mind as he barely managed to put a scratch in the gnoll before she blew him away. You both managed to whittle away at her enough to get a few kills in, but she singlehandedly wiped the floor with you both on the scoreboard. With every passing minute her lead grew and so did her smile. You played like your life depended on it, desperately trying to avoid the forfeit you'd agreed upon. You didn't want to go underneath that fat ass again. But where you managed to get a little bit more accustomed to her style, Dave got worse and worse. His classic strategy of shouting at the screen was not doing him any favors, especially when Gloria began to pick on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, you bitch! You're cheating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound a little mad. Here, have a grenade.\" The gnoll snarkily replied before adding another kill to her tally. \"I told you two against one wouldn't be fair. Now be quiet or you get to be my cushion early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise your little brother actually listened to the babysitter for once. Focusing again on your own play you manage to avoid her bullets and nearly eke out a kill before she surprises you with a grenade. As the match comes to a close you finally swallow your pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get to be this good at the game?\" You ask. Gloria smiles. Even if this was just a trick to distract her, she was so far ahead it wouldn't make a difference. Maybe the little human really was curious. \"Well, when you're used to playing with other monsters that have far faster reactions than you humans you just kinda... get good.\" She responds with an awkward grin. \"You should see Tia play some day, she's even better than me and with all her tentacles she can play four characters at the same time.\" You chuckle at the idea of the kraken holding four controllers with her slimy tendrils. The match ends with the gnoll having won by a landslide. You managed to hold your own decently well near the end, but Dave's strategy of getting angry had predictably not worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay boys, you know what this means.\" Gloria said with a wide smile as she stood up. With a reluctant sigh you threw up your arms and shuffled over to one of the dents her asscheeks had make in the couch's surface. Dave grumbled loudly, but did as the gnoll expected, knowing her punishments for disobedience would probably just be even worse. The gnoll chuckles and tells you to lay on your bellies instead, that way your arms and heads would be spared the weight of her butt. \"I still want you to be able to play, sillies. Don't worry, I'll go easy on you next round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she asks and the pudgy beast sits back down, smothering most of you under her fatty buttcheeks. You wiggled a little to free up your arms. The gnoll's rank body odor was beginning to fade to the background. Whether you were beginning to get accustomed to her or your nose was simply seizing to work you didn't know, but it worried you all the same. You play several more rounds whilst most of your body is slowly getting squashed beneath the fuzzy rear of your babysitter. Whenever she wins she grinds her butt down and lets out a big fart on you two to add insult to injury. The game in front of you helps to distract from the squashing and the smell, and hours tick by. Though she was holding back a little, you felt more and more confident. Each match got a little closer in score until you and Dave finally managed to surprise her right at the end and win. The relief of her finally lifting that oppressive weight off your back was an even greater reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, boys. Now you get to 'squash' me flat under your butts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could deliver a snarky response the phone rang. The gnoll quickly picked up and after a brief back and forth she came back to you with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your parents. They'll be home by this evening. I just gotta fix you some dinner before then and make sure you two are tucked in. How's pizza sound? I know a great place to order some from.\" Your eyes grow wide. You've seen her eat nothing but garbage and your brother so far. You quickly interject with your own suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go with the human pizza place here instead. I'm sure we can find something nice to spice up your pizza with around the house.\" The gnoll smirks and agrees, handing you the phone to place the orders. Half an hour later a hearty meal shows up at your doorstep. You bring the pizzas in and find a small collection of week old potato peels in the garbage to sprinkle onto the gnoll's meal. She coos with appreciation and ruffles your hair before all three of you dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening is filled with watching TV together. Dave was quick to claim the recliner, forcing you to share the couch with the babysitter. She pulled you close, letting you use her big belly as a cushion. Were it not for the rotten smell it would've been strangely comfortable. Gloria announced you two would have to go to bed quite early, as your parents expected you to be asleep by the time they got home. She tucked Dave in first, bidding him good night with a loud belch right in his face. He didn't so much fall asleep as get knocked out by the concentrated miasma that washed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the smelly beast turned her attention to you. She brought you to your bedroom and waited outside as you slipped on your pajamas. When she came back in you were ready to go to sleep. Unsurprisingly the slobby gnoll didn't require you to wash up or brush your teeth. But she wasn't quite ready to tuck you in yet. She expected something from you first.</span></div></div>",

Hearing this, Gloria pauses, giggling at your cowering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all you've been through, a little kiss is too much? C'mere, give ol' Gloria some sugar.\" She cooed, leaning in closer. Her flabby belly rested on your legs, pinning them and leaving you no way to escape. The gnoll grabs you by the shoulders and plants her plump lips on your face. The smell of the fat beast's spittle is familiar but still every bit as unpleasant. Like a pair of fat slugs the gnoll's lips smother most of your face, seemingly trying to coat all of it with a smelly layer of drool. But after last night you knew better. This slobbery assault would not stop soon. She wouldn't back off until she had pushed that slippery tongue of hers into your mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you gave in she went straight for the prize, her tongue pushing itself past your lips and into your mouth. The gross taste of gnoll drool made you shudder and fumble with disgust, but she had you firmly pinned down. You gripped your bedsheets and held on as she took charge and gave you a thorough French kiss. No part of your mouth was left unattended and the seconds crept by agonizingly slowly. The slobbering beast seemed insatiable, but finally her tongue withdrew. She stood back up, wiping away the worst of her goodbye kiss with her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we'll meet again. You were a lot of fun. And your brother was real tasty. Don't forget, if you need me you've got my number.\" She gave you a big wink, but after her overwhelming kiss you were too dazed to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I always leave 'em breathless.\" She boasted. \"If you really miss me, hang a leg over the side of your bed. Maybe I'll still be under there...\" The gnoll crawled beneath your bed, giggling to herself. You try to sleep, to forget everything that happened this weekend. Maybe it was all just a bad dream. But the sticky, smelly spit on your face made that hard to believe. You wipe it off on an old shirt and try to get the sleep your body was so eager for. You could've sworn you heard something laugh as you tried to sleep, but finally you manage to drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day everything seemed right back to normal and daily life went on like the two-day visit from the gnoll had never happened. There was no lingering smells in the house, even Dave seemed right back to his old annoying self. You almost began to doubt if the gnoll was ever there, but when your parents commended you on taking care of the trash you knew those weren't just nightmares. As cuddly and friendly as you recall her being, especially compared to Dave, you quietly hope you won't see Gloria again anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

You let out a quick yelp of surprise as you are pulled under the bed, but it wasn't enough to alert your parents or Dave, who was currently experiencing his own visit from Tia the kraken. You are pulled down into the darkness under your bed, only to find a lot more room than you had expected underneath such a small space. Your time for pondering is short, however, as your face is pulled straight into a pair of furry breasts. Your nostril fill with stench as the memories start flowing back to you and you look up to stare in the eyes of your former babysitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lookie what we have here, my favorite little man finally slipped up and couldn't keep himself from going over the side.\" You stare up at Gloria's smiling face as she lets out a wolf whistle. \"Look who's all grown up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Gloria? I can't believe this, I thought you were just a figment of my imagination.\" Gloria fakes being offended by this as she wraps her arms around you in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt that you can't remember me, and after I've been waiting all these years to see you again. I've hoped for the day we could see each other again as adults.

The damp fur stank in ways you could barely imagine. The last thought in your head was trying to pucker your lips to kiss that horror show. Gloria's only reaction was to clumsily try and do it for you, mashing your face against the soft surface before getting frustrated and pulling you free. You gasp for air as the tight confines of her rack release you. Her annoyed grimace softens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was it a bit cramped in there? No wonder you didn't do what I said. Come give mama Gloria some sugar then, right here...\" She pulled you up, dragging your body up against her soft tits until your eyes met hers. She took hold of your head with both hands and licked her chops. The gnoll felt you shivering, unsure whether she was about to kiss you or eat you. To make you even more nervous she flashed her biggest, toothiest grin at you. Even a vague hint of her rancid breath was enough to make you shudder, but the smelly beast had so much more in store for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push the slobby attacker away, but your hands barely found purchase in her breasts and it mostly served to just turn her on more. With practiced slowness she pulled your head closer, puckering her lips a bit and blowing more warm gnoll breath in your face. You winced at the intense stench, but against her strength there was nothing you could do. Four years older and stronger meant nothing to the muscular creature about to kiss you. When you were mere inches from her Gloria's patience finally ran out. Your eyes shot wide open as she surged forward, planting a big, slobbery kiss onto your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips were sealed to keep the gnoll from sticking her tongue in. She'd done that before and the sheer horror of that experience was flooding back to you now. Unfortunately her big, drooly kiss was covering both your nose and mouth. It was only a matter of time before you'd have to gasp for air. And judging by the devious glint in her eyes she knew precisely what she was doing, patiently waiting until it was time to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria didn't have to wait long for her favorite human to surrender to her. Your mouth opened wide, getting a ragged lungful of air into you. The gnoll struck without remorse, pushing her thick tongue in to meet yours. The saliva-soaked organ left no part of your mouth untouched, slathering it all in horrid gnoll drool whilst playing with your tongue. Words failed you to describe the taste. Not even your worst nightmares could conceive of something this nasty. As though she'd spent the last four years reaching the impossible goal of making her kisses even more horrifying. If your yelp from before went unheard, maybe the loud squelching and slurping of this messy kiss might alarm someone. Though being in this strange limbo beneath your bed made you worry not a sound could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter and eternity of intimate, drool-soaked kissing Gloria's lips finally parted from your face. Thick slobbery strands were still present between the two of you and judging by that mile wide grin on her face, the gnoll still had much more she wanted to do to you.</span></div></div>",

With a snap of her fingers, a door of light appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean in the... the...\" You stutter. You know the final words, but you think that if you don't say them it won't be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster world, yes.\" She finishes before walking through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't tell if it was the portal or your host, but your nose is filled with an incredibly eye-watering stench. It burned your nose while you both traveled through the light before a door materialized before Gloria. \"Home sweet home.\" She says as she turns the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, you were suprised to see a pretty normal looking living room compared to what you were expecting. As Gloria entered and shut the portal behind her, you sigh in partial relief as the smell of the portal fades away, only to be replaced by Gloria's odor once again.. \"Wait here, I'll go get some snacks.\" She sets you down on the floor and heads into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see that it really doesn't look that different from your own living room. It even has some gaming consoles hooked up to the TV. If it weren't for the smell you would feel right at home here. Wait... the smell? You take another sniff of the air, and sure enough, despite her leaving the room for about a minute now, this place still had her stench, only... stale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your mind lingers on the thought of smelling her even when she's not here, the gnoll in question returns with a snack plate. \"Here we go. Beetle larvae for me...\" She says taking a bowl of the squirmers, you shudder at the thought of eating that. \"And potato chips for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your suprise, she hands you a bowl of regular old chips. Not wanted to upset your \"host\" you take a hesitant bite of one of them. Nothing tastes funny about it. \"Oh come on. I'm not gonna poison you.

The couch was more than wide enough, but she insisted on scooting right next to you, letting you lean into her pudgy flank. The gnoll snickered a bit as you leant into her, nearly spitting out her food. You eat another handful of chips before breaking the awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo.... now what? You've abducted me from my home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up.\" She protests. \"I didn't notice a whole lot of resistance from you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair, you're stronger.\" You argue, blushing a little as you recall her simply throwing you over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit your bellyaching. I'm sure you're gonna love it here. Don't think I didn't notice you eyeing all my game consoles. I even went and got human food for you. I've waited for far too long.\" She said with a smile, winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you talking about? Waiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're 18 now. Finally a man. You can live wherever you please.\" Her words put the hairs in your neck straight up. Was she seriously suggesting what you thought she was suggesting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria couldn't contain herself any longer. She set the grubs aside and wrapped a strong arm around you. You tried to squirm, but the immense gnoll paw had you firmly pinned to her side. She reached down and put a finger under your chin, guiding your head up to meet her amorous gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I want us to become housemates. My home will be your home and I'll take care of you as best I can. I'll find you delicious human food and maybe I can even get you to try some of my delicacies.\" You think of the squirming grubs in the nearby bowl and shudder with revulsion. But the gnoll hadn't finished her speech yet. She leaned in closer, her voice lowering to a whisper. \"And I'll show you love in ways no human could ever hope to match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the final straw, you tried playing along and appease her, but this was too much. You push and wriggle until you finally slip free, standing in the living room with a panicked squeak in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, no way. I'd like to go home now. Please take me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Gloria interrupted herself. She wracked her brain about what to say or do. Finally an idea sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thinking back, this all started as a game of truth or dare. So how about a challenge? If you win, I'll take you home.\" She offered, a sly smirk creeping onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the gnoll held all the cards in this game. She was the only way for you to get home, so you didn't have much of a choice. You let out the deepest, longest sigh of your life and throw up your arms. \"Okay, what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I challenge you to live with me for two days. Give me that time to win you over and if by the end of it you still don't want to live with me I'll take you back to your home straight away. Once you see how awesome the monster world is, you'll never want to leave it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of another weekend with the gnoll was gutchurning, but you felt like this bet was a bit onesided. It was your turn to offer a cheeky smile. If she wanted this to be a challenge, you would give her something to think about. \"Hmmm... let's up the stakes. If you don't manage to sway me, you've gotta come with me and take a shower as punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vile snarl left the gnoll as she recalled that horrid experience. But she wouldn't be deterred so easily. She scratched her butt and extended a grimy paw. You were loathe to shake her hand, but if it meant crashing her fantasies of you living together and punishing her with a shower on top it was worth the sacrifice. Gloria eagerly waited for you to grab her hand, only to snap it shut around your arm, pulling you off your feet and onto her soft belly. Before you could move a muscle her arms draped themselves on top of you. Her overwhelming hug pressed you into the plush, smelly fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be great. What shall we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

What'll it be then? Another round of Call of Duty?\" She asks, remembering the sheer humiliation she dealt you and Dave all those years ago. You, however, have no such memory. As such, her words leave you confused. Then, an idea hit you, a way to hopefully spare your nose for as long as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a little side wager?\" You ask, causing her to raise a questioning eyebrow. \"We each pick one game and agree on a third, best two out of three wins.

Otherwise, it's only 24 hours.\" You compromise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now what do I get if I win? Remember, it better be good if you want me to risk my entire fun for the weekend.\" Plenty of ideas flash through your mind, but you can only think of one that could possibly appeal to the gnoll, and you dread it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win, I'll k-k-kiss you with an open mind, no need for you to force it.\" Gloria became ecstatic. She was so close, now to seal the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for my 'double or nothing'. What do I get if <i>I</i> happen to win all three games?\" Crap, you already forgot about that. You already played your big card with the kiss. To go further, you would have to offer... *gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... if you won all three... I would... I would...\" You choke on the words, while Gloria lights up, knowing what's about to come next. \"I would make l-l-l-love to you.\" You finally force out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Gloria says, grabbing your hand and shaking it before you could even think about this or reconsider. \"Alright then, since I'm the one accepting the challenge, I say I should get first pick of the games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she choose?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly a sly smirk pops onto her face as she walks up to the shelf next to the consoles and grabs a box. You only had a moment to look before her wide frame blocked it, but that shelf didn't look to be filled with videogames. What was she up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" She turned around and presented a colorful box. It was Twister. You'd heard of this game before. Back home you didn't have it, but you've been to a few friends' houses and played it. You can't help but feel Gloria picked it as an excuse to get her smelly body close to you. Altogether the surprise is enough for you to raise a curious brow. The gnoll hands you the box and starts pushing aside some of the furniture to make space. You open up the box and find a large mat with the signature colored dots. But the wheel that is used to inform people what limb needs to touch what color next seems to be missing. Instead there's a weird contraption in the box that reminds you a bit of a simon says machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a silly giggle Gloria leans in and grabs the mat from the box, unfolding it to reveal your first challenge. This game was clearly designed for monsters twice your size and the dots, though larger, are spread apart quite a bit more. It shouldn't be too big of a hassle, even if it felt a little cheaty for the gnoll to pull something like this. She laid the mat out and returned to you, fetching the device from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's automated. So you don't need someone to spin the wheel. You've got 30 seconds every time to get in position. First one to fail, loses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy enough.\" You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, in the monster edition you're allowed to burp, fart and slime on your opponents, but I doubt I'll need to in order to beat you.\" The gnoll adds with a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on, pudgy!\" You taunt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria pushes the button on top of the device and a mechanical voice rings out. \"Players, get in position. Game starts in 30 seconds.\" Three beeps indicate the time has expired and new instructions follow. \"Left hand, red\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you lean forward onto the mat, putting your left hand in the red circle. Like a pair of sumo wrestlers moments before their match starts you stare eachother down. Gloria blows you a kiss to unnerve you further, giving you a toothy grin afterwards. You couldn't let her win, not even once. The prize of not being smothered, farted or worse was too good to let slip. Unfortunately her motivation to win would be every bit as strong. What in the world possessed you to put sex with her up as a wager?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps later and both you and Gloria were struggling to keep up. Though she had size and therefore more reach, her big belly constantly got in her way. You were a good bit more agile than the gnoll, but unfortunately that same belly also hung in your way. It loomed nearby, threatening to squash you if she slipped now. It'd still be a win for you, but at what cost? In addition to that the ever-present stench wafting from her body was still very unpleasant. Though you dread to think it, the piercing smell did seem less powerful. You really hoped this was something of her doing and not you getting used to it. You couldn't ever imagine being comfortable near someone that smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right hand, yellow\" The machine called out. She barely had to move for that one, but you had to twist your back around, stretching your arm far. It left you looking straight up at her chest. Her soft boobs were swaying gently and she was quick to notice you staring at them. Gloria arched her back a little and leaned down, filling even more of your vision with those enticing globes.</span></div></div>",

She then starts to shift her upper body, jiggling her breasts even more and rubbing them across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so distracted by the display, that you didn't notice your foot moving without you, straining for the green space without the rest of your body going with it.

You ponder deeply whilst looking around. You see her tapping her foot impatiently, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I've got two more games I need to beat you in. Then I'll show you just how much of a monster I can be in bed...\" The gnoll says seductively, licking her chops and blowing you a kiss. Your mind is racing with possibilities until an idea strikes gold. You scan the boardgames she has stored on the shelves and point to a strange small coffer. It was brightly decorated, but you saw no game name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those poker chips?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, if skill won't do, maybe luck will be on your side?\" Gloria said mockingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'luckiest' players are the ones with the skill to know when to bet on their cards. But if you don't consider yourself to be lucky, then...\" You responded in an equally condescending tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're on, little man.\" She said with a feigned frown. She reached up and grabbed the coffer along with a deck of cards. You were assigned to the recliner as she took up the couch herself. The chips were split and you both agreed that after twenty rounds whoever had the most chips would be declared the winner. She dealt the cards and soon the game was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few rounds were mostly uneventful. Neither of you made big plays, occupied with trying to spot the other's ticks and tells. You were feeling confident in your ability to hide your excitement. Even more so when the gnoll seemed to be struggling to not flash you a toothy grin whenever her cards were good. Was she just bad at the game or was this all part of her plan? If it was, it didn't work too well as you built a small lead in score. What definitely was part of her plan were all the gnoll's lewd descriptions of the kiss she was confident she was about to win. Nothing was left to the imagination as she pictured every detail. In her mind it was like star-crossed lovers meeting at last, but the thought of going anywhere near that cesspit of a mouth of hers made you feel a little queasy. After a few more hands your lead had increased further. Gloria huffed a little as she looked at her cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, more crap. How am I supposed to beat you with these cards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By making me think your cards are really great after I've put down a lot of money.\" You answer dryly, further annoying the slobby beast. You failed to hide a smug little smile. You put in a large bid and the gnoll immediately folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I win something extra if I manage to clean you out completely?\" You ask in a mocking tone. Gloria just grumbles something about turning you into a cushion and farting in your face. Through a stroke of luck she finally manages to score a big win, evening the score out a lot. You were still in the lead, but you were going to have to keep paying attention. If you get cocky now, it may cost you dearly. You were in no hurry to fulfill her amorous fantasies about kissing you. Anything is still possible.</span></div></div>",

You had just managed to dodge having to endure sex with her. But after a few seconds her cheerful grin returned and she began to laugh. Was this part of her act, another bluff of some kind? She couldn't possibly have something even greater than a four of a kind. You look at the cards on the table. There was only one possibility. But what were the odds she could break out the precise two cards needed for a royal flush?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, little human, not bad.\" She said mockingly, laying down one of her cards. A ten of hearts. The nine, jack and king were already on the table. If she held the queen of hearts the gnoll would be the winner. You cross every extremity on your body, feebly hoping she was just pulling you around. But Gloria just laughed louder and louder. You felt yourself starting to sweat, your nerves barely able to hold on. Everything else, even her persistent stench, faded to the background as she laid out her final card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen of hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think I got the luckiest.\" Her voice was insufferable, smugness practically radiating of the foul monster. She enjoyed watching the color drain from your face. Already she could imagine what was going through your head. So much confidence, snuffed out in an instant. All game long that pesky human had been in the lead, but in one decisive blow she'd taken the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's two wins for me. You owe me a kiss.\" She states, still incredibly pleased with herself. Before you can mumble any excuses she continues. \"But let's save the smooching until after the final game. There's still so much to play for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong. If she managed to defeat you a third time she would have a free pass to stick your dick in her... You shake off the vile thought and concentrate on what was at hand. Come hell or high water you had to win. You had to pick a game you were certain the flabby gnoll couldn't beat you in. But this wouldn't be easy. You both had to agree on the third and final game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A third game...\" you mused. \"Any suggestions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could try wrestling?\" Gloria offered jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might as well lay myself on your bed in that case.\" You reply with a stifled laugh. \"How about hide and seek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, buster. Ain't many places I can hide this big belly and I'm guessing I'm not allowed to use my monster skills to hide in closets.\" She replied. \"Oh, I know. How about an eating contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes dismissively. \"You can probably fit me whole into that gut of yours. I feel you might have a bit of an advantage there.\" She pouted a little, but the hungry glare she gave you told you she was definitely thinking about what you would feel like inside her belly. After several more ridiculous suggestions like weightlifting, arm wrestling and competitive showering you finally managed to get in some more reasonable options.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tension was in the air. Though she had technically already won the wager, there was still much at stake for the both of you. Memories begin to trickle back from the last time you played Call of Duty against the slobby gnoll. She wiped the floor with both you and Dave. But you were years older and much more practiced now. This became readily apparent as you dodged her first volley and responded with a sharply aimed grenade throw. The blast gave you the time needed to flank her and with a satisfying burst of fire you drew first blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, the human knows a few tricks. Maybe I should stop holding back then.\" She boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying against Gloria posed a unique challenge. In the years you played against your brother and others online you usually came to expect a preferred strategy they would keep on using. But the gnoll hit you with a new weapon from a new angle every single time. It was impossible to predict her next attack, but you were ever vigilant. Though she frequently managed to score a cheeky kill through these varied tactics, you were just as quick in successfully fending her off. The score slowly trickled up for both of you, neither able to establish a convincing lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to the gnoll to see a focused stare unlike anything you've seen before. She was trying her hardest, fully concentrated on the game. You were certain the house could be on fire and she wouldn't notice. The loud crack of a sniper round hitting right next to you snapped you back into the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for witty comments or snarky taunts. Both of you fought like the world depended on it. This was your last chance to avoid having to fuck that slovenly gnoll. You were already on the hook for a kiss. And not just any kiss, but one given out of your own volition. The mere thought made your skin crawl. But realizing just how focused she was on winning the opportunity to bed you was almost as scary. Gloria wanted this. More than anything in the whole wide world, monster or human, she wanted to make love to you. The match was nearing its end and she was in the lead by only a single kill. You catch her surprise attack early and respond with a powerful volley of close range machine gun fire. The score was even, the next kill would end the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the level frantically, twisting and turning to make sure she wouldn't get an easy flanking kill. Suddenly you catch movement in the corner of your screen. You turn and stare right down a long pathway. Nearly on the other side of the map Gloria's character froze in its tracks too, turning to face you. The heavy machine guns you both carried were useless this far away, but that didn't seem to matter. You both stood motionless, virtual characters staring eachother down. You steel your resolve and breathe deeply. Your ears peak as you hear the gnoll do the same. This was it, the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was first to move, but you charged for her moments after. As you closed in both of you opened fire, the thunder of your machine guns breaking the silence. The screen shook with each hit taken, but you were landing just as many into her. Like two unyielding dragons the weapons roared until one fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat staring in disbelief as the screen went black. You knew painfully well who was the one to fall there and the post-match screen confirmed it. Slowly you turn to look at the gnoll. She was every bit as shocked as you, slowly realizing what this meant. The controller barely hung in her hands. As it slipped from her fingers and she could take the first relaxed breath in forever her eyes wandered down to meet yours. Gloria saw the fear and uncertainty in your subdued smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. Was. Epic!\" She said excitedly. \"I can't believe how close that was. And that final showdown, like a pair of gun-toting samurai locked in a duel. You weren't kidding about that whole getting better part either. You really made me sweat there.\" She wipes her forehead to illustrate her point. But as happy as you were for her, your mind was far more occupied with what was going to happen next. She felt a pang of pity, but she had won fair and square and she would see you honor the agreement you two made. However, there was no need to rush things. Maybe what the little man needed right now was a comforting hug. Hell, she wouldn't even mind another few games like that. She hadn't met someone this closely matched to her skill in forever. The night was still young, how does Gloria choose to fill it?</span></div></div>",

That was a close game. I've been practicing too since then and look how close it was. One bullet decided it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attempts to comfort you worked, kinda. While it was good to not only know how far you've come, but how close you were to beating her, it also stung hard that one bullet is what made it so you now have to have sex with a gnoll that smelled like a dumpster, on top of the voluntary kiss. Without thinking, you nuzzle yourself deeper into her furry embrace. It was weird, your eyes should be watering right about now, but for some reason, you can't smell anything. You can certainly still smell, but you don't smell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, we don't have to do it tonight, or even this weekend. We can just leave it as an IOU for a later date.\" She jokes. As much as you would love to take her up on that offer, it would be unfair to her.

I'm a man of my word and it would be dishonest of me to back out now. I promise I'll make love to you tonight.\" You could see tears forming in her eyes when you say this.

She flicked on the television and assisted in freeing you so you could watch too. She flipped you around, letting you use her belly as a beanbag and her boobs as a pillow. The gnoll didn't mind in the slightest. To the contrary, she kinda liked feeling your head brush against the sensitive surface of her chest. The show on the television wasn't bad, but it couldn't take your mind of what was awaiting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Gloria asks, feeling you fidget and squirm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" You reply. \"I'm sure me and Dave weren't the only ones to be babysat by you. So why do I get pulled into this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms wrap around you more tightly, pressing you into the soft belly. She coos softly, turning down the TV and whispering close to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're cute of course. Most kids I looked after tend to be horrible little brats. People don't call in gnolls and other monsters for well-behaved kids. I don't mind, of course. I'm not one to turn down a good meal.\" She jiggles her belly a bit to underline her argument. \"But you're so different from them. Polite, courteous, calm. I mean there was that whole shower incident but nobody's perfect.\" You roll your eyes. Was she still hung up about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't my parents notice if I've gone missing?\" You ask, suddenly realizing that this would probably raise a few suspicions at home. Her first reaction was a drawn-out \"Awwwww\", but after that the gnoll's tone got a bit more serious. \"You're so thoughtful. But don't worry about it. I'll make sure it's all taken care of. And no, I won't eat them or something silly like that.\" She giggled a little, but it left you mostly puzzled. Before you could pry further she laid herself out on the couch, carrying you along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just know that even if you choose to go back home after this, you're always welcome here. There's always a bed waiting for you. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even choose to have me as your mattress...\" She added a sly giggle. \"... or your blanket.\" The thought of being smothered under her heavy body again was offputting, but without the stench it wasn't the worst thing you could imagine. You still weren't sure if your nose had just grown accustomed to her horrid odour or whether she really had just stopped smelling as bad. Being this close to her should set your nostrils aflame, but all you could think about was how nice it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about I ease you into things a little. Let's start with that kiss you owe me.\" Gloria's voice turned sultry as she released her tight hug on you and urged you to crawl along her body. Carefully you dragged yourself up, draping your torso onto her soft bosom and feeling the jiggling, unsteady mass beneath you. You were looming over the gnoll's head, uncertain about how to proceed. She licked her lips and greeted you with her foul breath. The gnoll made it clear she was just going to purse her lips and wait. There was nothing else for it. You put this kiss on the line, now it was time to own up to your promises. With shaky arms you lower yourself until your lips meet hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nasty taste of gnoll slobber isn't nearly as bad as you feared. You remember this to be so much worse. With some hesitation your tongue starts poking out, exploring her parted lips and awakening the much large monster residing in her maw. Her tongue quickly meets yours and you both close your eyes, kissing passionately for what felt like an eternity. There were no heavy paws pinning your head down. You had every opportunity to break this off or escape, but you didn't. Partly because you made a promise, but even after you felt like you'd given her a kiss and then some you didn't stop. It almost felt like a challenge to you, to try and outlast the gnoll. Possessed with strange determination you simply kept going until finally you felt her paw near your shoulders, pulling you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gods...\" She gasped. \"If you wanted another reason for why you, I think this would do. Where did that come from?\" You look into her surprised smile and shrug. You had no idea. The awestruck gnoll continues. \"You should've made the third game a kissing contest...\" It made you smile that you managed to 'defeat' her in one thing at least tonight. It also helped you feel a little more confident about the deed you were expected to do later in the evening. Maybe it could even be a little fun? No matter what happens, it'll be something to remember forever, so you might as well try to enjoy it. Judging by her sultry smile she most certainly will.</span></div></div>",

Now past her head, she tosses the shirt off into the corner and begins to work on her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shimmy, she slowly slides down her pants, revealing a bright red thong riding between her cheeks. With the cloth down past her ass, she gives her cheek a smack, causing the flesh to wobble almost hypnotically. With the pants off, she kicks them over with her shirt. \"What do you think?\" You say nothing as you are lost in her body, causing her to giggle. \"I'll take your silence as a sign of approval.\" She says as she flops down next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

A strange, fuzzy beast, coated from head to toe in patches of dirt and grime. Her motley fur and inhuman size should make you feel grossed out. But amidst that grimy exterior were also two boobs that bounced and swayed more lusciously then anything you've ever witnessed. She let you play with them and you knew they were the softest thing you'd ever laid a hand on. Part of you wanted to reach out and touch their short-furred surfaces. The rest of her was similarly entrancing. The stench that singed your nose and turned your stomach before seems to have faded into the background completely, an irrelevance compared to the beauty laid out before you. It felt like a dream about to come true when her large paw came down for you, ready to hug you closer. Unfortunately, that wasn't quite what the gnoll had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Don't leave me waiting cutie. Wouldn't want those clothes of yours to get torn to shreds by an impatient gnoll, now would you?\" She cooed, tugging at your shirt. You didn't doubt for a moment that she would rip the clothes from your body if you don't get a move on. With all haste you shed your clothes until only your underwear is left. She was content to lay back and watch, but now she'd intervened and put a paw right onto your crotch, making you blush brightly. She carefully pulled and tugged the shorts away, throwing them into the corner and freeing up your manhood like she was uncovering a treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting for years to do this, little man. I'm going to make this a moment you will never forget. Just lay down and let Gloria show you the way...\" Her voice melted into a sultry hum as she rolled herself on top of you. Like a flabby avalanche her breasts smothered your head. You felt her wiggle a little, mashing your body beneath her blubbery belly and soft chest. You squirm as best you can in response and soon the immense weight is lifted. \"I could squash you flat a thousand times and still not get bored. Now prepare yourself for the main attraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slobby beast sat up, towering over your prone form. Her big belly completely obscured your view of her face, but your eyes were drawn elsewhere. Gloria sat on her knees, straddling you and between those parted legs you saw that her red thong had gone missing. Instead you saw a pussy that was dripping her feminine juices on to you. Her overwhelming full-body squashing had also provided plenty of stimulation to tease your member into a firm erection. The heady smell of her feminine musk was so thick it felt like it had its own weight, laying on you like a blanket. Slowly she lowered herself down, eager to finally make love to you. You gasped in unison as your felt the tip of your manhood press against the soft labia, quickly slipping between them. The warmth was overwhelming and Gloria wanted more. She calmly lowered herself until her snatch had completely swallowed up your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost to the pleasure. The intense sensation of your manhood being engulfed by the amorous gnoll was too much. Whenever she lifted herself up for another plunge your hips bucked instinctively, eager to please her. Not in your wildest dreams could you imagine surrendering to her like this. And you loved every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria simply let the little man shiver and thrash beneath her, enjoying all the satisfying little squirms he made. With her firmly in charge she set a steady rhythm. Already she felt her own heat rising. It wouldn't be much longer, a commendable result for a mere human. But she wasn't there yet. The gnoll prayed to whoever would listen that her little man had the stamina to keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the powerful heat overwhelmed you and you moaned aloud as you reached an overwhelming climax. The gnoll, spurred on by the sound and feeling your twitching member erupt, responds in kind. Her howling moan shook the windows and her pussy bore down on you so ferociously you feared for your fragile member's health. Thankfully she relaxed after a few seconds, letting a veritable flood of feminine juices wash over your cock, your groin and eventually onto the bedsheets. It took all her restraint not to immediately let herself flop down on top of you. She sat up far enough to let your wilting manhood escape. She then leaned to the side and flopped down onto the bed, bumping you up into the air. With a loving smile she looked you in the eye.</span></div></div>",

You start to kiss across the top of Gloria's breasts, hoping their feel and her moaning will get your soldier back in attention.

Gloria gasped a little as she felt your hands reach down and massage the sensitive folds. Their warmness and smoothness in your hands filled you with desire and your member stood as hard and proud as ever. With haggard breaths you heard her begging for more. Compared to her rough, padded mitts your slender little fingers must feel unlike anything she's experienced before. But you weren't down there between her legs to just fondle around a little. You line your cock up to the large snatch and plunge it in. The only way you imagined it being able to leave a lasting impact was to go all out right from the start. With all the vigor your legs still had you pumped your manhood in and out of her, smacking your hips against the wet pussylips each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll was breathing heavily, her heartbeat rising and the heat in her loins reaching all new heights. No monster lover of hers had ever done what the human so casually performed. His short stature meant his dick wasn't much for the gnoll, but he managed to make the most of it and then some. Gloria had feared she would need to do all the work and use some of her own tricks to have a shot at an orgasm tonight. But the plucky little guy between her legs not only brought her a successful climax already, he was on the verge of delivering a second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! yes... more... don't... stop...\" She said, her voice husky and heavy with carnal desires. Her legs twitched and shook as you rocked her world until those thick thighs slammed together. Like a flabby bear trap you were pinned between them, your manhood sunk as deep into her as possible. She squeezed tightly, immobilizing you. But rather than fearing for your life you felt more turned on than ever. The heat in your groin matched hers and after a strained grunt the gnoll moaned loudly, bathing your manhood in another climax. Gloria's warm feminine juices were rushing all around your member, easily coercing it into spilling its own load too. Even within the tight prison of her legs the warm juices found their way, leaking out along your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your whole body relax as her powerful thighs parted, letting you slump onto her belly. The gnoll laid motionless, basking in the afterglow of another epic climax. You take a few deep breaths before finally saying a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that... is how the human does it.\" You say with a smile. The gnoll giggles a little, putting a paw down on your head and stroking it gently. She felt your manhood go flaccid and slip out of her soaking wet love tunnel, prompting her to drag you back up along her belly until your head rested on her boobs. She leaned in a little and whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, I can go all night long. If there's one thing we gnolls have, it's... endurance.\" She spoke in a sweet, seductive tone. You gulp, worried about what you might have gotten yourself into. At the same time you also can't help but feel a bit sad for the gnoll. Your goal of leaving her breathless and satisfied after a night of passionate love went right out the window. Hopefully she was fine with what you'd delivered already, because you weren't sure you'd be able to deliver any more. The lower half of your body felt numb from the thigh squeeze and the intense pleasure. You look her in the eye pleadingly. Gloria coos at your puppy eyes and strokes your back with her large hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't be sad. I didn't expect you to be able to keep up. To be honest, I'm shocked you even managed to deliver me an orgasm, and you went and did two. That's impressive for someone of your stature to do to a gnoll.\" You smile at her comforting words, relaxing in her embrace.</span></div></div>",

Gloria grinned to herself as she looked down at your sleeping form. This was it. This is what she had waited for all these years since she met you. She knew that after what just happened, you would never want to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat astounded her most though was your nose. What once scared you away from her because of her natural odor, soon stopped getting in the way of things as you adjusted to her smell. Perhaps what they say is true, love is blind, and noseblind at that. Chuckling at her own joke, she lifted the blankets over both of you and wiggled into a comfortable spot, trying her hardest not to wake you. \"I can't wait for tomorrow.\" And with that, she joined you in sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wakes up first?</span></div></div>",

A strange, pugy beast-woman had taken you from your bed and abducted you. And you're fairly certain you had sex with her... twice. But as your senses slowly catch up something is wrong. This doesn't feel right, and you're confident your bed doesn't smell like this either. Slowly reality begins to creep in. Moreso when you reach out and pull away the blanket, only to reveal your vision is obscured by something else. On either side a large wall of soft mass is pressing against your head, reducing your vision to a narrow sliver. It was all real. Gloria, last night, the sex. All of it really happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still completely naked and removing the blanket invited a chilly breeze. You shiver as the cold air rushes by. Though you couldn't tell if she was awake yet or not, the gnoll seemed to react to feeling your shivers. The mattress below quickly starts closing in as Gloria rolls onto her belly, smothering you beneath her. You manage to call out to her before her immense gut muffled any noise coming from your direction. You felt her body shift and jiggle, the gnoll laying unsteadily in place. You cross your fingers and hope she will wake up soon. As much as you appreciated her efforts to keep you warm, this was a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for her to rise up, carrying you up with her. Your skin was glued stuck to her grimy fur and with a smug giggle she pulled your trapped limbs free. Finally your head was dislodged from her cleavage and she turned you around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead. Did you sleep well?\" She asked with a sweet voice. You nod feverishly, feeling rested and ready. Something told you that you were going to need it around her. It didn't take the slobby beast long to prove your right, pursing her lips and bringing your head close to them. Her morning breath was something else, a rare reminder that the gnoll could still be as horrifyingly smelly as when you first met. Nonetheless you persevere, planting your own lips on hers and letting her experience your morning breath too. As you'd expect it does little to dissuade her from passionately slobbering over half your face. After another tight hug she finally sets you down beside the bed. She stretches for a moment and motions for you to follow, not bothering to put on any of her clothes. You raise a curious brow, but follow her all the same, also leaving your clothes behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you'd imagine I've got to wear something when babysitting. Can't have the kids seeing all the goods too early and stuff. But in here, clothes are optional.\" She explained after seeing your curious glance. \"If you wanna wear em, fine by me. But if you wanna give me something to oggle I'm not gonna complain.\" The gnoll winked at you, making you blush a little. Hearing her compliments made you feel confident as hell and with a little spring in your step you followed her to the kitchen. It was time for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

Gloria loved your dumbfounded stare as she turned one of the chairs near the dinner table and sat down, parting her legs wide. She slowly dragged a finger along her pussy, a shiver running down her spine as the swollen, wet labia were stimulated. With her finger still glistening with her feminine juices she beckoned you closer. It became all too clear what she expected from you. Unsurprisingly such a lewd display had left your manhood steadily rising up. There was no hiding it from the gnoll. You were as eager to do this as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the gnoll, leaning down a little and reaching out towards the wet lips. But before you can touch her, the gnoll bats your hands away. \"No no, only your tongue.\" She coos, watching you look up annoyed. You roll your eyes and slowly bring your head closer. If she thought she was the only one that got to tease the other she'd be mistaken. The smell of her musk was hanging around you, seemingly urging you on even more. You stuck out your tongue and gently dragged it along her lower lips, holding it in place once your reached her clit. Her whole body twitched at the sensation. The taste defied description, a mix of salty and a strange sweetness to it. Whatever it was, you found yourself surprisingly thirsting for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.... human likes it, doesn't he?\" Gloria teases, gently stroking your head. She tried to sit as still as possible as she felt your tongue go for another pass. Soon the adventurous human began sticking his face right up in her pussy, plunging the tongue as deep as he could into her love tunnel. She gasped loudly, having to stop herself from interfering. The stimulation brought about by your agile tongue was beyond anything she'd expected you to be able to perform. It reached far, rubbing gently against the sensitive inner folds. Unsurprisingly it couldn't reach as far as your dick, but the pleasure it brought was on a whole new level. Words of encouragement devolved into haggardly begging you not to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling on top of the world, in spite of your face being pressed right up to a gnoll's vagina. You could hear her moan. She was so aroused not a straight word could escape her lips. You felt her pudgy body shiver with pleasure after each lick. She was on the verge and with one last deep push you brought her into a shuddering climax. If this is what she wanted in exchange for making you a nice breakfast then you would not disappoint. It helped that her feminine juices were remarkably tasty, though that might just be your brain getting hazed by her musk. Everything was going well until your felt both her paws on the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the split second you had you pulled your head back just a little and took a deep breath. Gloria pulled you back in and with a howling moan she came. The heat radiating of her snatch increased tenfold as the torrent of her climax surged towards you. You could almost hear it rushing through her body. She held you down with all her might, there was nothing else for it. You open your mouth and brace for impact. The first volume of warm, tasty release practically shot down your throat, barely needing to be gulped down, but after that the constant stream of gooey release seemed unending. You kept up with it, but only barely, fearing you'd run out of air before the gnoll was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gloria finally let go you were starting to feel faint, falling to your knees and clutching your gut. It had swollen a little from all the feminine juices now inside. You weren't sure what to do next, staring up at the slobby beast. She looked down at you with satisfaction in her eyes. But as she saw your sullen stare she began to feel a little bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... that was a little more than you bargained for, wasn't it?\" She giggled. \"Truth be told, I got a whole lot more than I expected too. That tongue of yours... wow...\" The gnoll saw your mystified stare curl into a smile, responding in kind. \"hehe, you still want those pancakes?\" The thought of eating another bite of anything made you feel queasy, but mercifully the slovenly monster seemed to expect that answer. \"I suppose not after the breakfast I gave you. I'll let you hold on to that one for a later meal then, as a little reward for the excellent job you did down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat at the breakfast table as Gloria wolfed down her own breakfast. It gave the overwhelming volume of 'food' in your stomach some time to settle. You still felt positively bursting at the seams after such a big meal, but at least it didn't make you feel sick anymore. After she was done eating the gnoll guided you to the living room and flopped herself down on the couch, picking you up and draping you on top of her big belly. There you two relax a little watching television, helping the bloated feeling in your gut pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do today, little man?\"</span></div></div>",

Gloria shuffles upright a little so she could look you in the eye again. With a big cheery smile she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play some games, but with a little dare attached?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another dare? Can't we just play?\" You sigh, rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think you'll like this one. Whenever I win, you gotta give me a kiss. But... I get to decide where you have to kiss me.\" She rubbed her heaving tits to further entice you. It sure sounded appealing, but you weren't so easily fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... but what if I win?\" You suggest with a cocky smirk. After yesterday's losing streak you were eager to get some wins on the board. What would Gloria be willing to reward you with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... how about this... if you win, I'll take real good care of that little cock of yours... in whatever way you tell me to...\" She puts a large paw on your butt, pressing it down into her belly. Your manhood was stuck between your body and hers, the short fur on her belly brushing against it as she gently ground it into the flabby mass of her gut. She even threw in the puppy eyes on top of that. How could you possibly decline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you weren't lacking for spirit, the gnoll had no problem continuing the winning where she left off yesterday, earning herself several sloppy kisses in a row. First on the mouth, just to get her in the mood. Then she shoved your head as deep as she could in her cleavage, making you kiss and lick the sweaty, hairy depths whilst she squeezed her soft breasts all around your head. Lastly she asked you to smooch and suckle on her perky nipples. The sensitive flesh shook under the gentle, wet caress of your tongue. Gloria even inadvertently leaked a bit of milk into your mouth. It was thick and creamy with a strangely sweet taste. Before you could taste more the gnoll pulled you free, directing you back to your game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it a stroke of luck, peerless skill or Gloria pitying you, you won the next game by a hair. She wasted no time reaching down and stroking your manhood with her pudgy fingers. But you knew what you wanted. Those soft lips that you'd kissed not too long ago, suckling and slurping around your member. The thought alone had you hard before her mouth even got involved. But when it did your eyes nearly bulged out of your sockets. The stimulation was not of this world as her puffy lips ran up and down your shaft whilst her tongue slathered and massaged it in ways you didn't think possible. In no time at all you were brought to a moaning climax, pumping your load right down her neck. In one big gulp she dealt with it all, cheekily asking for more. But she wouldn't let you repeat that. Not without scoring another win first. You played like a man possessed and the very next game ended with a resounding victory. But when the gnoll asked how you wanted to be pleased, you threw her a curveball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try... a handjob.\" You say with a naughty smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the balls on this one.\" Gloria replied, visibly impressed. \"You want to let the savage, beastly gnoll use her big, strong hands to jerk you off? You know these are for ripping and tearing, right?\" She said, waving her big fingers at you. Without a moment's hesitation you confirm your choice. When she firmly takes hold of your member a pang of dread shoots through you. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. Mercifully her grip loosens and soon she has you panting like an animal as she carefully massages your length in her hand. You splatter another load all over her hand, but the gnoll simply licks it off, seemingly savouring the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dinner time slowly creeps near the locations get ever bolder. Gloria has you kiss her armpit, her nose and even her ass. Thankfully a loving smooch on the asscheek was enough for that. In return you have her slide your dick between her boobs before asking for another blowjob. After a whole day filled with games and pleasure you are both spent. For dinner she can't be bothered making anything fancy, preparing a microwave meal instead. Horrid looking monster slop for her and a pizza for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evening gets started you two share a long and intimate embrace. Gloria is the first to interrupt your mutual staring-lovingly-into-eachother's-eyes session with a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we get a few more people involved? Pretty sure Tia's free today, or I can introduce you to my gnoll friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour concerns are quickly waved away as Gloria seems set in her ways. She does suggest you put some clothes back on for modesty's sake. You blush brightly before dashing into the bedroom and fixing that situation. The gnoll doesn't bother herself, explaining that monsters are free to wear as little as they want. Humans, on the other hand, will get some weird looks if seen naked. She leaned down and planted a sloppy kiss on your forehead for courage.</span></div></div>",

A distinct fishy smell got up your nose before your eyes adjusted to the dark. Slowly they revealed the monstrous form of Tia the kraken. She seemed concentrated on slithering one tentacle out from underneath the bed, but when the horrid smell of the portal opening reached her she looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys. Long time no see, Gloria. And is this the human you're always on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod sheepishly. The towering kraken slithered a tentacle towards you and raised it up to about your waist. There it hung, expecting something from you. With some hesitation you reach out, figuring this to be some sort of handshake. You grab the slimy appendage and it curled around your hand once. The strangely cold, smooth skin was unnerving. You shook 'hands' with the kraken, who spoke in a cheery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Tia. I don't think we've met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we did meet, but that was years ago and only for a moment. Nice to finally see more of you than just one arm.\" The sea monster giggled at your comments, before turning her attention back to the object of her affection. She slithered another tentacle up there, letting out a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Gloria asked with a curious raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. Dave has started to get real good at keeping his limbs out of reach. Stupid rules... I can grab him so easily, he's right there!\" The kraken pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on now, you know how much trouble you'll be in. No human is worth that.\" The gnoll urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knoooooow.\" Tia whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued bickering whilst you were thinking about Dave. Your little brother had gotten older, but he'd not become any less of an asshole. The amount of times you caught him snooping around in your room alone was infuriating. Then there was the money always mysteriously vanishing from your wallet. You're fairly certain he once even tried to hide a microphone under your desk to listen in on any personal secrets of yours. From the night terrors and ravings about a kraken he'd been spewing over the last few years you knew Tia had been haunting his nightmares for years. You should feel a touch of pity, but with all the shit he's pulled over the years, only one thing springs to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\" You say, interrupting the two monsters and causing them both to stare you down. \"...I think I might have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia's titanic brow shot up, curious to see what you had in mind. You walked to the edge of the darkness and crawled out from under Dave's bed. He was fast asleep, his room the same mess as always. From the other side of his bed you saw the kraken's tentacles looming over him. Their glistening, smooth shapes would be prime nightmare fuel if you didn't know their origin. You slowly began to lift the blanket off his legs, reaching in a pulling his leg to the side of the bed. As though she could see what was happening you heard Tia murmur with giddiness. Even with all the troubles at night, Dave was still a heavy enough sleeper to remain undisturbed by you dragging his leg to the very edge of his bed. Finally it went over the side and you ducked away quickly to not get caught up in what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once the slithering tentacles rushed down, wrapping around Dave's leg and pulling him under the bed. In an instant he vanished into the darkness, completely at the mercy of the monsters under his bed. You crawled under yourself, joining up with Gloria. The two of you sat back, watching the spectacle unfold whilst you snuggled close together yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd been weeks since Tia had successfully laid her tentacles on your little brother. Her affection for him was overflowing. She would have to thank you later for your help, as right now she couldn't think of anything other than Dave.</span></div></div>",

He turns his head as best he could to see you snuggled up in Gloria's arms. \"That's a sweet girlfriend you have there.

Soon she stops puckering her lips, unfurling her tentacles a little and smothering even more of your little pest of a brother in her kiss. Her tongue never left his mouth, further adding to his discomfort. Soon you witnessed the overwhelming display turn from kissing to suckling as his head began to pass her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've missed this so much Davey.\" Tia mumbles with her mouth full, pausing briefly before continuing her romantic assault. She closes her eyes, letting her tongue leave Dave's mouth every so often to slather the rest of his head in slimy saliva. But just his head wasn't enough for the enamored kraken. Soft slurping echoed through the darkness as you watched more of your brother disappear behind those lips. She smacked, slurped and suckled, sea monster drool leaking from all sides. Had her slimy tentacles not soaked Dave's pajamas the waterfall of slobber escaping her lips would. You had no idea what it must feel like to be on the receiving end of such a slimy spectacle. Not even Gloria's most extravagant tongue bath could get near this. You wondered what it might look like from Dave's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't touch...\" the kraken mumbled loudly before she twitched and a big slurp pulled in all but Dave's feet. Tia tried to fight it as best she could, but the titanic <i>GULP</i> that followed was inevitable. You saw your annoying little brother, now little more than a bulge, traveling along the kraken's body before disappearing into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for fuck sake, why does this always happen to me...\" She whined. \"Every time I kiss some cute bad boy they end up in my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're a monster, isn't that where you're supposed to put bad kids?\" Gloria joked, grinning at her friend's misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fair, how am I ever going to get a cutie like your boyfriend if I keep eating them?\" Tia sounded petulant, almost jealous. For her part Gloria just laughed. Watching the kraken trying to kiss your brother had been hilarious. Your gnoll girlfriend was already intimidatingly big compared to you, but those two were even further apart in size. You chuckled to yourself as you tried to imagine what sex with a kraken would be like. As though she could read your mind, Tia's large eyes suddenly fall on you, locking into an unnerving stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm... you okay?\" You stammer nervously, unsure of what the sea monster wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" She sulks a little, before getting back to her cheery smile. \"At least I got to give him a kiss, I suppose that's something. And I do believe I have you to thank for that opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot wide open. \"Hold up, what did you have in mind?\" You ask, feeling the sweat forming on your forehead. You'd just seen her gobble up your brother whole by accident. You really didn't want to share space with him in Tia's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to reward you for helping me. Don't be afraid. If you've been with Gloria all day and you're still able to walk you won't have any issues with me.\" Her tentacles began slithering towards you slowly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it's been all weekend...\" You say, flashing an awkward smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All weekend and he's still in one piece? Either Gloria went easy on you or you're one tough little human. Probably the former, since you're so cute.\" Tia cooed before turning her attention to the gnoll. \"Do you mind, Gloria? I won't eat him. I know how much you love him.\" You were a little peeved that the kraken didn't seem to consider your opinion of any relevance to this, asking the gnoll instead.</span></div></div>",

But you just watched her gobble your brother up by accident? What other kinds of 'accidents' could this clumsy monster be up to? Tia could clearly see that same spark of curiosity glimmer in your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. Don't be afraid. I know you want to find out...\" She said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, this 'thanking'...

Go get her, tiger!\" She said, planting a big kiss on your forehead. Throughout your little back and forth with the gnoll Tia had steadily been slithering her tentacles towards you. With Gloria's approval there was nothing stopping the kraken anymore. A thick, slimy tendril wrapped itself around your waist, but you threw up a hand, urging the sea monster to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get these out of the way first.\" You suggest, pulling your shirt off and trying to reach your pants. The tentacle unfurled and let you strip bare, but the moment you were done it coiled around you again and lifted you off your feet. \"You'll come save me if she gets me stuck, right?\" You yell at Gloria, who bursts into laughter whilst nodding at you. There was a strange sense of weightlessness as you were carried through the darkness under Dave's bed towards the looming monster. More tentacles joined in and soon you were wrapped up from your neck down to your toes in slimy, writhing flesh. It tightened a few times, but never painfully so. Tia's hug was as eerie as it was soothing, an embrace you wouldn't soon forget. But the kraken had so much more in store for you than a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles skirting in front of her pussy parted and you gasped at the sight of it. It was a slightly brighter shade of blue than the rest of her body, but above all you were awestruck by it's size. It stood to reason that a sea monster of Tia's size would have a pussy to match that towering stature. But these labia were bigger than your torso. They glistened a little already, another twitch of delight making them swell up a little in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly nervous you look up to the kraken and ask: \"So how do you want to do this, I just stick it in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of... I'm thinking... head first.\" She replies in a sultry tone. Before you got to ask what she meant the kraken laid back and the mass of tentacles caressing you brought you closer. Slowly the tentacles began to unfurl and retreat until there was only one left wrapped around your ankles. Tia had you dangling over her pussy. Slowly it began to fill your vision as she lowered you down, the fishy musk emanating from her snatch becoming ever more intense. There was no escaping it, no going back. You could probably cry out for her to stop or for Gloria to intervene, but your curiosity was too strong. You didn't back down before and you weren't going to now. You breathe deeply the musk-infused air just before you made contact with the glistening pussy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir surface was incredibly smooth, letting you slip between them effortlessly. It gave you the first glimpse of just how far Tia was intending to take this. Her love tunnel opened up before you and her soaking wet pussy easily began to take you in. Tia still had to push a little, but like a well-lubed dildo you sank down into her vagina with ease. The comfortable warmth enveloped you at a rapid pace until only your your lower legs were still outside, held tightly by her tentacle. Even submerged this deeply into her body you could hear the kraken moan. The walls shook and squeezed around you, like her pussy was trying to gently chew on its little human toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did the one thing you imagined the kraken would love the most and startled wiggling around. The huge sea monster reacted with another lengthy, lewd moan and a powerful squeeze of her inner walls. More and more of her feminine juices flowed all around you, the musk so dense it made it hard to concentrate on anything other than pleasure. Your cock was rock-hard, rubbing against the soft flesh of her snatch had brought you to the verge of climax yourself. Just a little bit longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tia moan in unison as you release your respective loads. Your efforts were quickly washed away by the tidal wave of feminine juices rushing through her love tunnel. Whether this flood ejected you or her tentacle simply pulled you back out didn't matter. The moment you were outside once more you gasped loudly, thankful for some sort of fresh air. Tia was too lost in the afterglow to comment, but Gloria nearly fell over laughing at the sight of you. You were completely drenched in the kraken's slime, thick wads of it still leaking off of you.</span></div></div>",

Or Gloria's earnest encouragement? There was something almost strange about her seeming so mellow about another monster suggesting to eat you whole. Maybe there really was nothing to worry about.

No doubt she could pulverize ships with that kind of strength in the mere tips of her tentacles, that's for sure. You play it cool as best you can when she carries you through the air towards her mouth. Before she lets you stare at that gaping maw she first puckers her lips and plants a big, sloppy kiss on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah! Thanks for doing this. Gloria found a real winner.\" The kraken smiled, seeing the gnoll blush from the corner of her eye. She hoists you up high, dangling you upside down over her face and opening her maw wide. You prepare to dive face first into that horrid darkness. Rows of sharp teeth line the sea monster's jaw, but her mouth was big enough you wouldn't get anywhere near them. Dense, fishy breath washed over you and her tongue twitched whenever another drop of her juices leaked off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia gasped lewdly as she lowered her second human meal for the day into her mouth. She didn't bother tasting him, as even his brief slide against her tongue revealed that you weren't anywhere near as tasty as Dave. The kraken plunged your right down her gullet and with a single monstrous <i>GULP</i> you were gone. She felt you sliding down her neck towards her stomach, her inner muscles trying to wrest you from her grip. But she wouldn't let you go, no matter what. Gloria too watched with rapt curiosity as the bulge you made descended down into the kraken's belly. The gnoll wondered if you knew she was only joking, feeling a touch of guilt on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe narrow passage made way for a cramped stomach. On the far side of it was Dave, grumbling and grouching to himself. He was covered from head to toe in slimy goop, not unlike yourself. When you called out to him he spat out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, that's what you get for hanging out with monsters. They're all the same. Always trying to trick you into their bellies.\" He hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to get you out. Grab my hand and you'll be outside again in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say that straight away? C'mere, asshole!\" He yelled jokingly. Right now he was just happy to have an out, no matter who helped him. You rolled your eyes and held out your arms. Dave grabbed your wrists and you grabbed his for a solid hold. Tia might have the best intentions, but no doubt her body was going to try and keep its food down. At this stage you also worry about something else. How were you going to inform the kraken you're ready to come out. First, let's try the obvious solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tia, I got him!\" You yell at full volume, hoping the sea monster can hear you from in there. You get your answer fast as you and Dave are rushed through the tight, fleshy waterslide of her neck and out of the kraken's mouth. You hold on tightly to Dave, feeling the walls around you trying to keep him down. Only when you're in her mouth does your grip fail, sending him flying through the air. Thankfully Tia catches him with her tentacles, leaving him gasping erratically from the wild ride. You're not given any reprieve as the kraken smothers you up to your neck in a slimy tentacle hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" She mutters ecstatically before finally returning you to Gloria. You all but flop into her arms like a ragdoll, making your gnoll girlfriend giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good friend.\" She whispers as she cradles you, planting a big kiss on your forehead.</span></div></div>",

You question what she's talking about before you see Tia lay Dave out on the floor in front of Gloria, with Gloria laying you down next to him. Dave thrashed and struggled to get away, resulting in Tia pinning him down with a tentacle while Gloria stood up and turned around. \"Remember this, boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it clicked in your head what was about to happen. Tia snapped her tentacle away from Dave, and in mere seconds Gloria sat back and butt bombed the both of you, grinding her cheeks side to side to get comfortable. You were now each trapped under a cheek, leaving your heads and shoulders exposed. Gloria let out a sigh of relief as she started to speak. \"Oh man, I forgot how comfy you two were. Okay Tia, they're nice and secure. Now you can smooch to your heart's content with no risk of eating them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that their plan? Had they discussed this while you were freeing Dave? While you pondered this, Tia licked her lips with her slimy tongue and began to lean in to you. She envelops both of you with one massive smooch while making sure to avoid Gloria's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again, Tia kissed you two, with Dave's being for obvious reasons and yours as thanks for freeing Dave. With each kiss, another layer of her slimy saliva coated you. Seeing as you two weren't going anywhere, Dave decided to speak up in between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're getting off on this, aren't you you, you freak.\" He spits at you, whispering so neither girl can hear him. Between your girlfriend's soft ass on your crotch and your previous experience with Tia, you couldn't exactly deny your hardening member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda.\" You admit, matching his whisper. \"But could you blame me? They're both sweet girls that love us and only want us to be happy. Plus, you can't deny how soft Gloria is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She also smells like a tire fire. Meanwhile, I get a giant sea monster that can unintentionally eat me with a simple make-out session. That also brings me to the fact that she just ate us both not even ten minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate you by accident. I went in to save you. I bet if you just gave her a chance, you two could work something out.\" You explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you would want me to stick it in a monster, wouldn't you? That way when mom and dad meet your girlfriend, you can bring me down with yo..gah.\" Tia had brought down an exceptionally sloppy kiss while he was speaking, resulting in him getting a mouthful of slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Gloria, I think that's enough.\" Tia announces. Gloria shifted her weight, allowing you two to move once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, I was just getting comfy. Okay then, the night is young people, what next?\"</span></div></div>",

Tia was aching to give him another slobbery kiss, but with a fearful tone he begged her not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no more!\" He cried out. The kraken either didn't hear him or ignored him. Only when you shouted out her name did she pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey?\" She spoke softly, her massive lip trembling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the love of God, please stop kissing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" The kraken asked, seemingly oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?! Every time you get your suckers on me I either end up in your belly or smothered in so many tentacles I die. You've been giving me nightmares for years now! I don't know if you're just teasing me or if you actually call this 'love', but I'm not feeling very loved here, soaked in your stomach juices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey...\" Tia's voice was shaken. \"Why did you never say anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When am I supposed to be able to do that? When you crush the air from my lungs with a huge tentacle hug? Or when I'm simmering away deep inside of you? Usually I barely get out a scream before I'm silenced and you just do whatever you want to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave felt the tentacle wrapped around his waist loosen a little, soon after joined by several others. Tia slowly carried him up to her face, a tear welling up in her eye. Slowly she brought him to her chest, holding him against her and whimpering ever so softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... I just... love you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave wanted to snap back with something snarky, but in a rare moment for him he paused to think. If he antagonized and rejected her now, a heartbroken kraken might turn vindictive. And he hated to admit it, but his brother may have had a point. Something about having a sea monster girlfriend was strangely cool. His mind was completely empty when it came to what to say in response to her, but one thing was noticeable. Now that she held back a little on the tentacles and just hugged him, this wasn't so bad. About as good a start as anything for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just... take it a bit easier then? I mean, this is nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... this?\" She said, wiping the tear away with a tentacle and tightening the ones around Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, no need to squeeze. Just you know... hold me?\" He stumbled a bit on his words. What do you say to a kraken like her? thankfully she understood and gently embraced him. The slimy, writhing tentacles all around his body still felt weird, but at least they weren't slowly crushing him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Tia, was it? I'm gonna be honest with you. All of this, it's really weirding me out right now. You're supposed to be the monster under my bed, not my new girlfriend, right? Then again, that doesn't seem to have stopped my perv of a brother. Fuck, I'm just... I don't know. You've been giving me horrible nightmares for years now, and something tells me you're not going to stop, no matter what I say. So at least for now, if you really want to show your love for me could we try more of this? You know, the gentle stuff that doesn't involve me gasping for air or sitting in your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia could barely contain her excitement at hearing these words. It took everything out of her not to squeeze Dave with all her might out of sheer joy. Instead she brought him up to her face and pressed him against her cheek, slowly rubbing him against the squishy smooth skin. This was going to take a lot of work for her, but for Dave it was worth it. With an amorous gaze she brought him to her pursed lips and planted another sloppy kiss on his face. She tightened her tentacle embrace to he wouldn't slip into her mouth again and with a loud pop she left his head soaked in her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the whole thing unfold sitting next to Gloria. When the kraken began to hug Dave the gnoll responded in kind, squeezing you tightly against her belly and slipping your head between her breasts. You both had to suppress an \"awwwww\" as the giant sea monster tenderly kissed your little brother. Your gnoll girlfriend leaned close and whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we give these two lovebirds some private time and head to your bedroom? I'm feeling all kinds of lust for you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly nod and you see her prepare to head to the smelly portal. Quickly you interrupt her. \"Or... we could just walk to my room? We're already in the right house, no need for stinky portals.\" The realization made Gloria chuckle a bit before whispering in your ear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but we'd best crawl under your bed before we get started, because I'm going to leave you a mess, loverboy. Wouldn't want mommy or daddy to think you accidentally dropped a vat of slime all over your room.\" You snicker a little at the mental image conjured by her words and nod. Quietly you two try to leave Tia and Dave to their thing, but the kraken's big eyes don't miss a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving already?\" She asks with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't want to disturb your moment with me fucking his brains out.\" Gloria boasts with a lewd smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, okay. It was nice seeing you again. Oh, and give your boyfriend my number. I owe him a little visit to thank him for fishing Davey out of my belly. Without him, none of this would've happened.\" She says, snuggling Dave up against her cheek again. Your brother still looked desperately out of his depths, but who knows? After your experience with Gloria, anything is possible. The gnoll just nods in agreement, waving goodbye before slipping out from under Dave's bed with you in tow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tia's attention returned to Dave, who still seemed uncomfortable in her tentacles. She tried as hard as she could not to squeeze him, was it still not enough? With a slight tremble in her voice she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Davey? Is everything alright? Am I hurting you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to the kraken, throwing up a nervous half smile. \"No, I'm good. It's just... Of all the ways I expected this monster under my bed stuff to end, this wasn't on the list. Like, is it normal for you monsters to have relationships with the people you tormented?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia let out a bellowing but girly giggle. \"Teehee, no, this is kinda special. I mean, some monsters like to seduce their victims, but I'm afraid that's not really something I tend to try. Something about people not being attracted to huge sea monsters. It's not like there wouldn't be perks to having a giant kraken girlfriend.\" She added with a big wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smirks and responds to humor her. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we give the best hugs. These tentacles were strong enough to sink even the biggest galleon, but unfortunately I'm a bit out of practice since they outlawed going after boats. But for you I'll get in shape again.\" She says proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man in her arms laughs awkwardly. \"Rest assured, Tia, you do not need practice on that. You've already shown plenty of times they are strong enough to hug me with fatal results. But maybe you can practice on what you're doing right now? You know, the gentle hugs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, Davey.\" She cooed, her tentacles shuddering with delight. Dave felt uncomfortable still in their wriggly grip, but at least they weren't squeezing the life out of him any more. He felt more of their slithering masses encroach on him as Tia endeavoured to smother him up to his neck in wriggly love, getting every tentacle not already hugging him involved in the action. But this time she was very careful, going as gentle as her large form would allow. After all the horrible nightmares he had endured at the hands of Tia, this was a surprisingly pleasant experience. She surprised even herself with how restrained she could be. Seeing a tiny smile break through his nervous grimace made it all worth it. She quickly brought him up to her face and held him against her cheek. Tia nearly dropped him when she felt one of his arms push free from her tentacles and pat the large squishy cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was playing along, but part of him began to feel worryingly at peace with all this. Slowly he turned to the giant sea monster and cautiously asked. \"So, slippery hugs aside, what else would I be looking forward to if you were my girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you need something done in your room, I could lend a dozen helping hands. Or maybe you're feeling a little ticklish?\" She crooned, poking his side with a tentacle. Dave giggled, pushing the wriggly limb away before being set upon from his other side. He grabbed the tickling tentacles, but Tia had plenty more to spare. She brought the young man to tears with laughter, dismissing his claims that she was cheating. Finally she pretended to drop her guard, lowering him for a moment to her own huge flank and letting out a roaring laugh as she felt his little fingers touching the sensitive surface. She let him have his fun before raising him back up to her face. She had teary eyes from all the tickling, but with a serious voice she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davey, would you be okay with me being your monster girlfriend? You don't have to answer me right away if you want to sleep on it a few nights. I know it's probably a lot to ask so suddenly, but I love you. If the past years have ruined my chances I'll understand and I guess I'll leave you alone...\" Her voice trailed off. Dave couldn't believe it, but he actually pitied the towering kraken. Was he really up to the task of making this work? His curiosity and his common sense were struggling mightily. Part of him really wanted to just rid himself of this incessant squid, but he couldn't help but feel sorry for the misunderstood titan. Is he willing to satisfy his curiosity and give this a try?</span></div></div>",

Dave thinks to himself before turning back to Tia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then Tia, if you promise to stay gentle about it and stop eating me, then I suppose I'll be your boyfriend.\" He called out. Tia instinctively tightened her tentacles around the boy, only for her to quickly realize her mistake and loosen up her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry Davey. I just got so excited when you said yes that I lost control for a bit. I promise I'll be extra gentle with you from now on. Now give me some fish lips.\" She puckers her lips and begins to lean in, only for Dave to flinch out of instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia stops her attempt upon seeing this, worried that she might scare him off if she reminded him of being eaten so often. Then an idea hit her. She raised one of her tentacles up to Dave's face. Dave opened his eyes and saw one of her suckers in front of him before it dove onto his mouth, sucking on his entire lower face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this sucker was going to town on Dave's face, Tia lifted up several of her other tentacles, revealing hundreds of similar suckers. \"That's right Davey, think of all these suckers as hundreds of pairs of lips, all waiting to smooch you silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave couldn't deny that not only was this much more manageable than dealing with Tia's normal lips, the feeling that it gave him was unlike anything he could've imagined. Finally, the sucker popped off his mouth, leaving a rather large mark on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have so much fun together Davey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Was she really going to be able to keep her promise and no longer eat him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, it's much later than I thought. You must be getting sleepy.\" The kraken said, her voice heavy with concern. Dave would probably be fairly tired indeed, but the adrenaline rush from being eaten alive had him awake as could be. He'd need it as another sucker, slightly larger than the first one, slid onto his face. It centered itself on his mouth and gave him a strange 'kiss'. He held on to the slimy sucker until Tia was satisfied and pulled it away with a noisy pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee, one for the road. Here, let me tuck you in.\" She cooed as she carried him on her tentacles back into his room. Dave was far too tired to start thinking about how something as titanic as her could hope to fit under his bed. He was just happy to feel the comfort of his mattress as the writhing embrace from her tentacles gently laid him down. Next the kraken showed off how handy she was, reaching out to fluff his pillow, straighten his blanket and grab him a glass of water, all at the same time. He heard her soft giggle from far down below. Lastly he noticed a tentacle wrapped around his phone. He'd left it unlocked and Tia had taken the liberty of adding her phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with my phone please.\" He said, slightly alarmed, but that just drew more giggles from the sea monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Davey, just giving you a way to call me when you're looking for your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week had passed and Dave was starting to come to terms with his situation. He'd met Tia twice more and even now he found himself in the comforting embrace of her many tentacles. She seemed eerily happy just to see him. With some caution he asked her what's up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been looking around in the library and I've got good news. You know how you have to dangle a leg over the edge of your bed so I can grab it? Well, there's an exception to that rule that lets me come and go as I please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smiled awkwardly. \"Ehm... is that such a good idea? No offense, but I don't think you'd fit in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, that's alright. I know that if I slide into your room it'll probably take your whole house down. But it'd let me slip in a tentacle to smooch you without you having to do anything for it. Plus, I could tidy your room when you're not around. I could even catch naughty siblings trying to sneak into your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave chuckled at the idea of his brother getting ambushed by Tia when snooping around in his room. \"Okay, that sounds fun. So what's the catch? What do I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia laughed again. \"It's so easy. All you have to do is tell me I have permission to enter your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, situations like this aren't exactly common. Not many children would invite the monsters from their nightmares into their room. You just have to be completely sincere about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave nods and clears his throat. \"Tia, you have my permission to enter my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken cheered loudly, mashing her boyfriend into her big cheek and smothering him with tentacle kisses and love all night long. For years to come their bond would strengthen. Dave's aversion slowly melted and changed into attraction. Soon not a night would go by without her slithering a tentacle up from under his bed to kiss him goodnight. As the weeks passed even his temper changed. He was still as annoying as ever to his older brother, but he seemed a little less abrasive.</span></div></div>",

Maybe seeing his big brother being so happy with Gloria inspired him to put in the effort with Tia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year ago, Dave finally felt safe enough with her to allow her to give him normal kisses, but she had come to enjoy her \"sucker smooches\" so much that she decided to keep mixing it up. Dave was fine with this for the most part as it meant he wasn't always at risk of sliding down her throat by accident. He did love her, but he still saw that as a valid concern. She had been very careful about that though, with it only happening once after she got a little tipsy and mistook him for someone else, which she quickly apologized for the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally Dave's eighteenth birthday. His brother had finally moved out to live with Gloria, and Dave had just finished up his cake and was now sitting in his room when he notices a tentacle slither out from under his bed and tug at his leg. Knowing what this meant, Dave slid under his bed into Tia's waiting embrace. \"Happy birthday Davey!\" She says with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tia.\" Dave replies with still a bit of nervousness in his voice. He then leans in to kiss Tia's lips, causing her to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy do I have a special gift for you mister adult.\" She says with a flutter of her eyelashes. \"But first, time for you to go in the cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Tia, not the cage.\" Dave replies to no avail. \"The cage\" was a little something Tia thought up a couple months ago. She would entrap him in about five or six tentacles, then used every available sucker on them to smooch every inch of him. It was weird if not torturously sensational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not giving you your gift until you go in for one minute.\" Tia says with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Dave decide? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright fine. but your gift better be worth it.\" Dave chuckled. Tia parted her tentacles wide, as if she was expecting a hug. He caught on quickly, but when he tried to get closer she planted a tentacle on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, take those off first.\" She said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave slapped his forehead, realizing his mistake. He didn't want to get his shirt and pants all ruined by the kraken's slimy suckers. He quickly obeyed and took off all his clothes except for his boxers. But when he tried to step closer he was stopped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something?\" Tia cooed with a gleeful smile. Before he could stammer out more than a bemused \"Huh?\" she continued. \"You're an adult now, so I don't have to hold back anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a pang of fear came over him. What was she playing at? Did she intend to do something with his... He'd fantasized about it but he didn't expect her to offer it so readily. \"A... Are you sure?\" He stammered, blushing bright red. Tia's tentacle slipped into the side of his boxers, a second tentacle sliding in on the other side. Their slimy coldness sent a shiver down his spine. With minimal effort they pulled the boxers apart, tearing them off his body with a loud rip. \"Okay then...\" He said nervously, stepping closer to the kraken's embrace. Once she deemed him close enough all her slithering limbs shot towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she would never harm him, being in the middle of a flurry of slimy limbs wrapping around him was still uniquely scary for Dave. They coiled around him tightly, ensuring he couldn't move a limb, before relaxing and letting the football-sized suckers do their thing. Their slick exteriors glide smoothly along his skin, sending a shiver of delight down his spine. Occasionally a sucker would line up somewhere special and stay put, like on his face. He cheekily gave these suckers a sweet little kiss. He'd put more effort into it, but his hands were literally tied. Tia didn't care. She loved his little squirms and squeaks as she held him in her cage of love. But ever since she invented it a few months back there was always one area that was off limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh...\" Dave moaned as the first sucker cruised past his exposed groin. It sent a noticable pulse of arousal through his manhood. This wouldn't be the first time he'd popped a boner from her cuddly embrace, but this would probably be the first time she'd notice. Another sucker slid along, pausing briefly to press down on his cock sensually. The soft, yielding flesh of Tia's suckers was amazingly stimulating. The slippery slime coating them ensured everything was well lubricated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you don't have to hide it any longer. I know how 'the cage' makes you feel, Davey. It's hard to miss that special little smell coming off you. Now prepare yourself.\" She said in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave wanted to ask \"For what?\", puzzled by her vagueness. But before he could act she planted a sucker on the tip of his dick and with minimal suction pulled it inside. He gasped loudly, feeling his stiffening member completely surrounded by the mischievous sucker. Tia had pulled in his toes or hands a few times before as part of her play, but this was on a whole different level. It pulsed and pulled around his cock in ways he could barely describe, but the result was phenomenal. He couldn't hold himself back for long, gritting his teeth to extend this bliss for another millisecond before reaching his climax. He shot several volleys of cum into the depths of the sucker, blushing brightly as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia smiled, feeling his body go limp after exerting himself like that. She kept on slithering her tentacles around him, gently kissing him all over with her suckers. The tentacle that helped to give him his first orgasm together was pulled out and the offending sucker brought to her large mouth. Though Dave couldn't tell precisely what she was doing, he had a good enough idea, wincing a little at her perverted tastes. The kraken suckled loudly on her own tentacle, drawing the cum right back out and murring delightedly at the taste. \"Hmmmm... finally I get to taste it. You've no idea how hard it's been to wait for this. Was it as good for you as it was for me?\" She cooed, her voice a little haggard from the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell... Yeah...\" Dave replied, still breathing deeply from the intensity of 'the cage'. Tia had slowed herself a little, but she still held him wrapped up in her slithery embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... was this my gift?\" He asked sheepishly, causing the huge sea monster to laugh loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no, Davey.\" She mused in a singing voice. \"This was just a little warm up.\"</span></div></div>",

Also, what's with the tentacle?\" He asks as he's lifted up by his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a figure of speech Davey. It means I'm going to be lowering you down and letting you wander around inside me. The tentacle is so I don't lose you in there.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places Dave right at her waiting lower entrance.

Go right ahe..aaaahhh!\" She moans as Dave wastes no time diving headfirst into her. \"So... eager.\" She pants at the sensation inside her. She hadn't expected him to be so enthusiastic about this.

But after the tentacles had treated him so well he knew he couldn't leave his girlfriend unsatisfied. The passage enveloping him was surprisingly narrow, letting him squirm and wiggle but little more. He half expected her snatch to be cavernous enough for him to freely walk around in. He didn't mind though, as the kraken moaned loudly with his every movement. He rubbed the soft flesh gently, causing it to undulate and squeeze his whole body. The walls were soaked in densely pungent slime, lubricating his cave exploring adventure. The tentacle around his waist struggled to stay wrapped tightly as he brought Tia to new heights of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh Davey... You're... the best... Just... More...\" Her words were slurred as she barely had control of herself anymore. Tia's tentacles twitched and shook whenever her boyfriend managed to find another sensitive spot in her love tunnel to massage. She rewarded his efforts by letting her pussy walls massage him back, gently squeezing him. There was no mistaking the raging boner he had, bringing a titanic smile to her face. He was as into this as her. Time became irrelevant as they enjoyed eachother in ways that seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little man deep inside the kraken's love tunnel relaxed himself as best he could, letting her take the reins. It wasn't like he could do much more than wiggle ferociously whenever the walls weren't bearing down on him. He could barely think straight, the overwhelming musk hazing his mind. It wasn't like there was a whole lot of blood flowing up there anymore either, his erection felt bigger than ever as the soft flesh caressed it and pushed it into his belly. He wasn't sure when, but he could feel a surge of warm fluids wash over his crotch. The erotic heights his girlfriend's pussy provided made the whole trip feel like one continuous orgasm. But Tia was about to show Dave from up close what a real climax looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earsplitting moans reached a sonorous peak as she bore down on him harder than ever. Dave was utterly immobilized in this profound embrace as he could feel an uncanny heat rise up all around him. He knew what was coming and braced himself as best he could. The rush of sexual fluids was intense, a raging torrent of kraken release bubbling up from her depths. There was no light inside her, but he could hear the approaching flood. Dave closed his eyes and let the torrent take him. It crashed into his face, the walls subsiding at the same time. The powerful rush of fluids surged all around him, carrying him back outside. But even kraken-sized climaxes only last so long. By the time the thick river of slime stopped he was still almost completely surrounded by her pussy. Only his feet felt the rush of air blowing past them. Tia remedied this quickly, letting her vaginal walls undulate just once to pull her boyfriend back in completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave felt comfortably cradled inside his titanic girlfriend. She was panting heavily, catching her breath after such a mindblowing experience. Years of pent up desire unleashed in mere seconds. He lacked the words too to describe what he'd just experienced. It seemed only the other day that he finally came around to loving this towering sea monster. Before that something like this would probably be as close to hell as he could imagine, being used as a sex toy by the monstrous kraken. But everything was different now. The only thing on his mind was the knowledge that this would be the first of many intensely pleasurable experiences with her. He brought his hand up to wipe the worst of the goopy residue from his face and called out to Tia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible... Your pussy is like... I don't know how to say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Don't sell yourself short Davey.\" The kraken cooed in return. \"Your cute little wiggles were amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best. Birthday. Ever.\" He said jokingly. Tia responded with a soft laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want to be in there longer... I don't mind.\" He knew she would be having a titanic lewd smirk on her face right now, matching his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I need a moment's pause to breathe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you? You've been in there for almost an hour already.\" Tia replied, surprising Dave. An hour? That's impossible. How could he not have taken a breath in an hour. With a reassuring voice the kraken continued. \"The less you think about it, the easier it is. Long story short, don't worry about air and whatnot in there, I've got your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave reasoned that he should be more surprised. But after everything he'd experienced today he couldn't pretend this was very outlandish anymore. It brought his attention back to what Tia was offering earlier.</span></div></div>",

You gulp, knowing that the gnoll's idea of a bath is far removed from what you would call clean. She took a firm hold of you, pressing you against the sweaty fur on her belly and chest. She sniffed your face before unleashing her big, slobbery tongue. Just two licks were enough to drench your whole face, but your enthusiastic gnoll girlfriend didn't stop there. She lapped along the sides of your head before dropping the pretense completely and just taking your whole head into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the damp cavern the foul smell of gnoll breath overwhelmed you whilst she meticulously soaked you in drool. She made sure not to leave a spot untouched and went over everything twice just in case. Surely it didn't have something to do with her enamored humming and moaning along the way and she just wanted you as clean as possible. Finally she releases your slobber-soaked head from her stocky muzzle and sniffs you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, better. But that was just the start of it. This gnoll is still hungry for more.\" She said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe away the worst of the drool and reply. \"Well, what are you waiting for? I'm not going anywhere. go right ah~ hahaha.\" You burst into laughter as she flips you about and licks your feet, the big tongue tickling your soles. You wiggle and shake in her grip, but the evil monster was unrelenting. Tears of laughter welled up in your eyes. Thankfully she moved on after a while, suckling on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had rigorously slathered your legs in drool she closed her maw around one of your hands. Like a strand of spaghetti she slurped the rest of your arm into her maw until her pudgy lips were wrapped around your shoulder. She looked you in the eye suggestively as she twisted and coiled her tongue around your arm. Gloria repeated the surreal experience with your other arm, moaning lewdly as she smothered it in drool. She flipped you around in her arms again, this time presenting your back to her slavering maw. She made short work of your back before pausing to look at your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a cute little butt, did I ever tell you that?\" She cooed. You wanted to give her a clever reply but your words caught in your throat as you felt her lips plant themselves on your asscheek. Gloria gave each of them a sloppy kiss before turning you around, looking you in the eye as she leaned in and pressed a big kiss on your mouth. You close your eyes and let her in, your tongues squirming around eachother. The taste of it was foul, but it didn't seem to register or affect you, pushed aside by the overwhelming love for the gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her lips depart, only to return a little lower on your neck. She opened a bit wider and took it into her maw, teasingly closing her jaws just enough to poke the skin. You wonder how many nightmares she'd caused this way, smiling at your girlfriend. She continued licking and slobbering all over your chest and belly until she reached her final stop. Gloria had saved the best for last and your manhood had gotten fully erect during the lengthy kiss. You gasped as her lips wrapped around the tip and in one smooth motion she took it all in. Her tongue snaked around your manhood, coating it in warm drool. The gnoll moaned softly whilst you were grunting and gasping, trying not to blow your load immediately. She shot you a sly look before her coiled tongue ever so gently squeezed the shaft. When it did the same to your sensitive head it was too much. With a ragged moan you climax, the gnoll's lips remaining fiercely locked around the base of your manhood. The salty taste made her moan in return and she gulped exaggeratedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm... that's a good boyfriend.\" She cooed, never relenting in her stimulation. She wouldn't stop until she was confident there wasn't a drop left in your balls, greedily swallowing it all. Finally she released your now flaccid saliva-soaked manhood, letting it flop onto your gut with a wet splat. She snuggled closely with you for a moment before setting you down between her legs. Your gnoll girlfriend leaned back a little with a suggestive smirk. You look down and see her pussy is every bit as aroused as your manhood was, dripping with feminine juices already and yearning for your touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy now.\" She said, moaning softly as you leaned a little closer. With an intimidating growl she continued. \"Give it to me, you little wuss! Do your worst!\" She was really aching for this. You wisely don't leave her waiting for another second. How do you please your gnoll girlfriend?</span></div></div>",

You've been all-around great to hang around with, but I don't think I'm ready to move out yet.\" You sputter, hoping she would understand. There was still frightfully little you could do. She had you pinned and she probably wouldn't have too many issues simply dragging you to her home whether you wanted to or not.

Her thick, drooly tongue eagerly explores not just your mouth, but streaks out over your face too, happily lapping up the sweet release she had showered you in earlier. Just when it looked like the gnoll had finished she took a deep breath and started all over again. The thorough and intense kisses left you nearly speechless, only a single word dripping from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much. Now that you've welcomed me into your room and given me permission I can come and go whenever I please. You don't have to dangle any limbs over the edge any more.\" She explains excitedly. \"You better watch out, 'cause I'm gonna be sneaking more kisses onto you when you least expect it.\" She adds with a devious giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you better believe that pussy of yours won't be safe. Now that I've had a weekend to taste it I want more.\" You boast in return, not wanting to be outdone by her promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria hugs you tightly. \"I like it when you talk dirty, little man. Here's an idea. You remember when we first met? How I 'protected' you from Tia that night?\" A sly smirk crept onto her face. How could you forget? She had smothered you beneath her to stop any limbs from dangling over the edge and falling prey to the kraken that was hiding under your bed at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's busy with Dave.\" You jokingly reply. The gnoll rolls her eyes. \"She is, but that doesn't mean you don't need a gnoll blanket tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nod in response and she quickly slides you out from under the bed, following right behind you as you lay yourself down. You knew what was about to happen, but there was still a very distinct tinge of fear running down your spine as you saw her looming over you, spreading her arms and letting herself flop down on top of you. In an instant she had you covered in jiggle, fur-coated pudge, only your head sticking out from under her. She was weighty as ever, but now she had no problems abusing her position even further. You were defenseless against her as she licked and kissed your face, thick drool leaking onto your pillow. When she finally finished she leaned in close and whispered in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna rush you, but my door is always open for you. Whether you just want to visit or stay the rest of your life. Now sleep well, little man. I'll keep you safe.\" She chuckled before shuffling her big body around to get comfortable. The sweaty fur ground against your bare skin, making you feel aroused. Even after everything that had happened these past few days she still manage to excite you with minimal effort. Mercifully she was too tired to take advantage of it and shortly after you were both fast asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After that spectacular weekend you and Gloria would spend many a night locked in passionate love. Whenever you had an evening to yourself a quick call was all that was needed for the pudgy beast to slip out from under your bed and into your arms. There were even a few more weekends spent at her place and many a morning where you woke up to the gnoll having snuck into your room for a slobbery kiss. Tonight would be different though. You had a big surprise planned for the gnoll and you were teasing her relentlessly with it through texts. When she finally came to visit she clawed her way out from under your bed, turned and flopped herself on top of you. You welcome her with a big kiss as she playfully dominates you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you little tease, what's all this acting mysterious about?\" She coos, grinding her big belly and breasts down onto you. You offer a cheeky smirk in return. It was hard to believe she hadn't noticed it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you seen what I've done to the place?\" You sputter out, your face drenched in gnoll saliva from her excessive kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously the gnoll sat up, scooting forward a little to ensure her boyfriend was still properly pinned beneath her. Suddenly it dawned on her that the room looked a lot more... spartan than before. Only the bed and nightstand were still there, the rest was all packed in boxes. She looked back down to the trapped, wiggling human and showed a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your folks finally got sick of you freeloading around here?\" Gloria laughs. You laugh with her until you both fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, kinda. I'm finally moving out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll be able to visit whenever I please without having to worry about your folks.\" The gnoll's smile grows as she glares at you deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... about that. I'm not 100% sure yet if I can live there, the paperwork isn't done yet. Also, I think they'd have some trouble with you visiting...\" You said with a sly smile. It went completely over the gnoll's head as a tear began to well up in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...after all, it's hard to visit someone if they live in your home.\" You added. Her look went from sad to puzzled. But as the penny finally dropped in her head the most joyous smile covered her face. She pulled you out from under her and wrapped you in the tightest hug of your life. She gave a high-pitched squee as she gave you a loving embrace so intense you feared your spine might give out. You could barely breathe, unable to warn her. You were in for this ride, whether you liked it or not. The overjoyed gnoll kept trying to talk to you, only to be overwhelmed by happiness and squeeze you even tighter against her body. Finally Gloria managed to calm down long enough to form a coherent sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... yes, you are so welcome in my place.\" She sounded over the moon. You offered a meek nod in return, her mighty hug not allowing you much more. Immediately a concern rose for her. \"So when will you be moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I told my parents it'd probably be this weekend. Think you can give me a hand with those boxes?\" You replied with a cheeky smile. It was the least she could do after nearly folding your spine double. The gnoll laughed loudly and set you down on the bed. She showed off her strength by stacking several of them together and lifting them all, commenting on how little stuff you had. She slid them under the bed and in mere minutes your room was empty except for the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uhm... now what?\" You asked, realizing you hadn't thought of this problem yet. If your bed is the doorway to her house, how would you get it there? Gloria just laughed it off and patted you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Dave home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I think he's downtown doing something.\" You shrug. Your little brother had his own things going on and you didn't really keep close tabs on him. From what you can tell he's still close with Tia, but he doesn't seem to want to talk about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this'll be exciting.\" Gloria said as she handed you a screwdriver. You had the bed in pieces in no time and she hauled them all to Dave's room. She crawled under his bed with you in tow. Thankfully it was empty down there. You dreaded stumbling in to him making slimy tentacle-y love to Tia, that would've been supremely awkward. One last hop through the portal later and you were in Gloria's house, ready to make it your home too. She carried your stuff to her spare room, which stood completely empty. Before you could unpack and get yourself settled in though Gloria picked you up and wrapped you in another hug, messily kissing your face. After applying this thick coat of drool she looked at you with a devious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made a few changes to the place in anticipation of you moving in. Admittedly it took a bit longer to happen than I expected, but I'm sure you'll love them. I know it's a big change to go from your clean human home to the Monster World, so I've set up a few comforts you might miss otherwise. They're not quite the same, but I reckon they're close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProudly she carries you out of the room to show off her work. What does Gloria show off first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The excited gnoll quickly paces down the hallway, holding you close to her magnificent chest. They jiggled and bounced against you, their distinct smell pleasant as ever. Overhead Gloria was talking to you enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I figured that the biggest issue was gonna be food. I mean, no offense but you guys are really picky eaters. Any 'ol plate of slop will do for me. That said, the way you all prepare those delicious garbage cans full of fine dining is something else.\" She rambled on, barely coherent at times. You just smile and nod, not wanting to dampen her enthusiasm. It brought an infectious big smile to her face. Gloria turned one more corner, entering the kitchen. It was about as messy as one would expect from a gnoll's kitchen. But to your surprise there was one corner that stood out. A smaller secondary fridge had been put in the corner next to a short cupboard. Both of them were remarkably clean. The gnoll finally set you down before finishing her monologue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I got in touch with a few old friends. One of them is a shapeshifter, so she can just walk into a human supermarket and buy anything you want. Go on, have a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the fridge door to find it packed with all manner of food. Some of it was familiar, but other items seemed like they came from completely different corners of the world. The same story was true for the little pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't really know where to start, so we got a bit of everything. Just tell me what's tasty and what isn't and I'll adjust the shopping list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's so much stuff in here... I don't think I can get through it all before it spoils.\" You stammer, not wanting to be ungrateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make that sound like a problem...\" Gloria replies, licking her chops. You laugh at her reaction whilst grabbing a can of soda and a cold sandwich. The gnoll's more serious expression returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm not gonna touch that thing, so if you want it kept clean that'll be your own responsibility.\" She states. You nod at her. Knowing her relation to anything clean you're surprised she went this far to begin with. It was more than fair for her to ask you to deal with this on your own. Shouldn't be too difficult. She grabs a mouldy slice of pizza from her own fridge and the two of you enjoy your quick snacks. Afterwards she goes to the living room with you in tow. She lays herself down on the couch and gives you a luscious glare. \"So? How do you like what I've done with the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a hard time deciphering whether she just meant the kitchen or if she'd touched up the living room too. Everything looked pretty much the same from your last visit. Then you realize the floor is a bit less cluttered and the salon table appears a bit emptier. You feel humbled in a strange way. \"You tidied up... That can't have been easy. Did you do that... for me? But you didn't even know I was moving in today. How long have you been doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know... couple of months now.\" Gloria shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... just... I don't know what to say... Thank you for doing all this to make me feel at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll didn't respond. Instead her smile grew wider and she parted her legs. Her pussy was already drooling in anticipation. Your heartfelt thanks must've really resonated with her. \"It's nice to see my efforts haven't gone unnoticed.\" She raised her arm, beckoning you closer with a single clawed finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how about you show me how grateful you are...\"</span></div></div>",

You begin to feel a little nervous as she tries to take off your pants. Not because you're afraid to be naked in front of her, but because you worry she might tear them to shreds if she can't get them off you. You held no illusions when offering yourself up to her that this would end up with you losing your clothes in one way or another. You look up into her big, loving gaze and politely suggest you'll save her the trouble. She huffs a little, but releases you from her snuggly embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quick about it, it's impolite to leave a gal waiting when she's thirsting for you.\" She said seductively, making it a little harder for you to take your pants off. You couldn't tell if it was her words or the smell of her arousal in the air, but your manhood seemed eager to get started too. It stopped just short of producing a comedic 'boing' when you dropped your pants. The gnoll eagerly licked her lips seeing how eager her housemate was to get going. With your pants still around your ankles she wrapped her sweaty arm back around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, now show me a good time, human.\" She rubbed herself with your body, dragging you across the greasy fur of her belly. Slowly you could feel yourself being moved towards her groin. Though you were familiar with what was coming next, it still felt magical. Before long her soaking wet pussy was brushing up against your leg, leaving a thick trail of her juices. Her guiding hands slowly aligned your body with hers until your cock met her pussy. It went in up to the hilt without any resistance. It still felt a bit surreal to fuck a pussy that large. It seemed hard to believe Gloria would even notice you, but the way her breath seized told you this was no act. This was every bit as exhilarating for her as it was for you. The wet folds bore down on the slender intruder, squeezing and rolling all around your manhood, providing a massage for the ages. Over the last few years she'd honed this talent to an artform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to thrust yourself into her, but between her size and overwhelming embrace there was little you could add to the act anymore. The gnoll was in charge, her hand on your butt to guide your movements. First slowly, then steadily picking up the pace. She moaned loudly as she got closer to finishing. Finally the gnoll hit her first climax, a torrent of pungent goop splattering all over your legs and groin. Your own orgasm was lost in the intensity of hers. She panted and moaned, smiling from ear to ear. She leaned back to see your own expression. It matched hers, causing the gnoll to pull you back up and smother you in big sloppy kisses. You struggled a little in her grasp. She liked it when you pretended to resist her advances. It made her passion burn all the brighter. Her slobbery lips provide kiss after kiss, her tongue happily dancing around with yours. After a few minutes of cuddles and kissing the gnoll happily announces she is ready again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gloria gets busy she decides to change positions. Instead of her sitting on the couch with you held against her belly she wanted to assert once and for all that she was on top in this relationship. She laid you out on the smelly seats of the couch. The stink of her big, fuzzy butt lingered from a thousand soaked up farts. The gnoll loomed above you, threatening to smother you completely beneath her. The big, drooling pussy hovered into position. The moment she felt like it was above your dick she lowered herself down. It was claustrophobic underneath her swaying belly. It landed on your belly with little fanfare, but when she just kept lowering herself the flabby mass of her gut began to flow outwards like a wave of fur-coated blubber. It smothered your upper chest and head entirely as her pussy made contact with your dick. The moment your tip had entered she dropped all pretense of subtlety and let herself crash down. In an instant your manhood was surrounded by the familiar warm wetness of her pussy. The rest of your body had to make due with her sweaty body smothering you into the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, That's the stuff...\" The gnoll moaned to herself, riding her housemate for all his worth. She was lost in sheer bliss, humping and bouncing to get the most penetration possible out of his tool. What it lacked in size it made up for in the intensity of the sex. No gnoll had even managed to make her feel this special. In this moment she felt like she was the luckiest monster in the world. The cork popped and for the second time in minutes a flood of sexual fluids erupted from her nethers. Only when she came back down to earth did she realize there was suspiciously little movement underneath her. The gnoll had put her boyfriend through worse than this, but still a tinge of concern washed over her. She hoisted herself on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't moving, your body covered from head to toe in stains, be it from her orgasm or from the dirty couch. Gloria put her hand on your chest, letting out a big sigh of relief to discover your were still breathing normally. Memo for next time: make sure boyfriend can get air whilst having sex. She thought back to all the previous sexy escapades. How close to KO did she push you those times? But guilt could wait as faint coughing was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for some breathtaking sex?\" She boasted, happy to take the credit for this rather intense surprise. If you didn't regret letting her do anything she wanted to you before you sure were regretting it now. Finally she leans down over you, her muzzle almost touching your head. Softly she whispers in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You up for round two?\"</span></div></div>",

Whilst your brain gladly turned every gust of air and creak of the house into a potential nightmare scenario, the reality was far more dull. Eventually you were simply too tired, finally closing your eyes and falling asleep. The thought of calling her never crossed your mind. It had been so long you'd forgotten you even had Gloria's number. More than ever before you're convinced that strange weekend was just a fever dream from a particularly bad flu or something. With the last hope for something different to happen shattered life resumes as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following years you finally make the big move and leave your parents' house, finding a tidy little apartment for yourself. You spend some time studying in college, where you learn all about industrial design as well as the many varieties in which one can enjoy some weed. You've finished your diploma a few months ago, but the job market is proving a challenge. Thankfully time goes by with ease as you sit in your home, stoned out of your skull most days. With some patience, a job opportunity will surely present itself. Until then, you were occupied with eating record amounts of pizza and staring at the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new lifestyle has a profound effect on your surroundings, as your home begins to get increasingly messy. Even after your parents announced they wouldn't visit such a pigsty anymore you felt no motivation to clean it. To the contrary, it only sped up the growing volumes of clutter stacking up in every corner. The tower of empty pizza boxes was already nearing the ceiling, a second one soon starting alongside it. This overall messiness extended to you as well. Your unhealthy diet had added a number of extra pounds, not enough to be considered morbidly obese but enough to give you quite a paunch. Your clothes were greasy and grimy, rarely ever getting changed anymore. No matter how much people told you that you looked awful or reeked of stale sweat, you greeted it all with supreme indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night you were sitting on the couch, staring with empty eyes at the television. You weren't following whatever vapid reality show was on there, far more enamored by the colors and lights of it all. Your brain was thoroughly infused with weed and you felt pleasant. Nothing much could bother you and you didn't feel like summoning a single ounce of care for anything. But somewhere in the back of your head there was something gnawing at you. An aching boredom and a desire not to be alone. With a broad smirk you grab your phone and begin flitting through the contacts. Many of the names wouldn't do. They'd already made clear they didn't want anything to do with you anymore. But then you came across Gloria. You tried as hard as you could to remember who the hell this girl was, but you only drew blanks. You sit for minutes, staring at your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was the weed talking or just your own curiosity, you decide to give this strange unknown contact a call. It takes a while, making you fear that whoever this Gloria was, she'd already gotten another number by now. But eventually the monotone beeping is interrupted by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"</span></div></div>",

So we\u2019ve been having a blast together so far, right?\u201d You both groan in response. Blast wouldn\u2019t be the right word, unless she meant \u2018ass blast\u2019. Before you could retort Gloria rambled on, \u201cSince you like hanging with one monster so much, how about I invite my friends over. It\u2019ll be great! You kids can meet all my friends, my friends can meet you two. It\u2019ll be great, one big monster party\u2026 or monster mash\u2026 or whatever\u2026\u201d That wasn\u2019t a good idea, in fact, that was one of the worst ideas ever. Once you regain your balance and crack your aching back you start to reply, \u201cB-but Gloria\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped as you heard her talking on her cellhphone, \u201cYeah Lindsey I know. The humans I\u2019m babysitting? They\u2019re great\u2026 well\u2026 one\u2019s a sweetheart, the other\u2019s short-tempered but he\u2019s fun to mess with. You\u2019ll invite everyone over? And you got the address? Awesome. So less of a party with friends and more of a full-on-rager, huh? Sounds great, see ya\u2019 soon sweetie.\u201d Your mouth nearly dropped as the gnoll clicked the end call button. It was one thing to find out monsters were real, another to have your little brother get eaten by a kraken-woman, and even crazier to have a wrestling match with a hyena lady\u2026 but now a group of monster 20-somethings are going to invade your house for the weekend and probably trash it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to Gloria and tug on her pant-leg, the oblivious gnoll finally notices your protesting, \u201cHey! Are you excited to meet my monster friends?\u201d You nearly explode in front of Gloria, \u201cGloria! You can\u2019t be serious? How many people\u2026 I mean\u2026 monsters are being invited to our house?\u201d The gnoll giggled and rolled her eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t be totally sure on a head count\u2026 but probably somewhere upwards of two thousand monsters or so.\u201d Yep, now your jaw dropped. The gnoll cackled at your expression and gentle bumped you with her hips, \u201cDon\u2019t worry I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll all fit in your house just fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retort, \u201cGloria that\u2019s not what I mean, you can\u2019t just invite a horde of monsters to my house, my parents are gonna kill me and-\u201c The doorbell rang, Gloria sprang up, \u201cThat must be the first slew of them! I\u2019ll get it!\u201d As Gloria stormed back into the house you yelled at her, \u201cThey\u2019re coming here for a party in the middle of the day?\u201d Gloria yelled back, \u201cWe\u2019re monsters, we\u2019ll party no matter what time it is!\u201d You pinch your brow in annoyance. This can\u2019t be happening, if monster teens and 20-somethings were anything like human ones, your house might be a soldering ball of cinders by the time your parents return. You had to do something to flush Gloria\u2019s guests out of the house. You run inside and\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was completely gone. You cautiously look under the bed to see it empty, with no little-brother-eating-krakens in sight. You got out of bed, wondering if it was all a dream. You shrug as you look around your room, completely in order. Maybe it was all just a dream? You certainly had no proof of Gloria being real, except\u2026 her phone number! You dive into your bed and search for the slip of paper she had given you. You searched and dug around, you even threw off your blanket and pulled your bed sheets of your bed\u2026 nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was too good to be true. It was probably your young mind over-exaggerating things. You groaned, defeated, \u201cI guess monsters aren\u2019t real after all.\u201d You then look down and notice the slip of paper Gloria had given you. You smile ear to ear as your eyes light up. The note read, \u2018Here\u2019s for putting up with my stink all night. I know you humans and your puny senses of smell aren\u2019t use to it. Ha ha. Anyways my number is 1-945-SCARE-YOU. Call me anytime Dave is acting up\u2026 or if you just wanna talk. You\u2019re a cool kid. Thanks for letting me be your babysitter. Big hugs, Gloria\u2019. You smiled at the note until a gust of wind blew it out of your hand. The note blew under your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got on your hands and knees to try and retrieve it. As you move your hands around in the darkness under your bed your blood runs cold once your hand lands on something big, fleshy and hair. Your eyes widened and you nervously chuckled, \u201cG-gloria? Is that you?\u201d You get a stern, deep and bassy, \u201cNope!\u201d Whatever monster was under your bed grabbed you by the hands and pulled you screaming under the bed. Everything was a blur after that. You opened your eyes to a dark night sky. You got up and realized you were in some kind of cemetery in a creepy neighborhood. You noticed Dave on the side of you, also knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake Dave awake and after he curses you out he realizes you two aren\u2019t home anymore. Dave asked, \u201cWere you pulled under the bed too?\u201d You nodded, \u201cHow long were we out. It\u2019s night-time again?\u201d You two were unaware that you were not in the human world anymore, but the Land of Monsters. Here, it\u2019s nighttime all of the time, you two just couldn\u2019t tell. You nervously look around, \u201cWe have to find a way back home.\u201d You two go up and exited the cemetery, walking around the neighborhood filled with old, dilapidated houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you noticed someone walking towards you, once they noticed you two they sprinted towards you. The person, or monster in question was a tall and curvy Ogress in a police uniform, \u201cHalt, humans!\u201d You look up at here with fearful eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s w-wrong officer?\u201d The Ogress was huge, casting a giant shadow over you two, her thighs were thicker than either of your bodies, she had an hourglass figure and flowing white hair, she also stunk to high heaven, almost as bad as Gloria. She grimaced down at you, \u201cYou should know well enough humans aren\u2019t allowed here. Regardless of age, a human caught in the Land of Monsters faces immediate jail time without a monster guardian to accompany them.\u201d You worriedly sputter out, \u201cB-but we didn\u2019t just come here, we were dragged here. The monster under our beds dragged us here.\u201d The Ogress ponders your words and responds\u2026</span></div></div>",

How on Earth did he expect to even compete? But of course, the smug look on his face made it apparent he was confident he could beat the massive hyena woman, easily. Meanwhile, the gnoll just laughing. \u201cWow! I\u2019ve never met anyone who actually agreed to arm-wrestle with me before! You\u2019re BRAVE, kid, I\u2019ll give ya that!\u201d She reared back and laughed, giving him a playful, gentle pat on the shoulder\u2026 which was still enough to make his arm sore. He was starting to regret agreeing to this already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they were sitting at the dining room table, their arms locked together\u2026 although it was a little difficult, considering just how huge the gnoll\u2019s arm was compared to his! You noticed Dave seeming increasingly nervous\u2026 while Gloria only seemed to be getting more excited! \u201cReady?\u201d She asked, while Dave could only sheepishly nod, wincing at just how tightly she was gripping him. \u201c3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026 GO!\u201d You jumped up, startled, at the loud SLAM as the gnoll instantly plowed Dave\u2019s hand against the table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave let out a startled cry at the feeling, clutching his sore hand against his chest as Gloria leaned back and let out a hyena-like laugh. \u201cHaha! Guess I win! That means you gotta do whatever I want!\u201d Her huge teeth were bared as she smiled, and Dave looks around nervously, having not heard this rule before. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I feel like going on easy on ya\u2026 so all you have to do is take a quick whiff of my pit!\u201d Before he could even protest, his cries were completely muffled as she wrapped one of her powerful arms around his head\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 with his face buried in her armpit! He braced his arms against her sides, trying his best to pull away, but it was futile. She was just too strong! All her could do was struggle limply in her grip as she laughed\u2026 until she finally let him pull away. By now, your brother\u2019s face was completely coated in her musky sweat, and he let out of a disgusted cry as he ran to the bathroom to wash off. You stumbled nervously when she turned to you, laughing. \u201cNow, THAT was fun! Now, don\u2019t worry, dear. I know this is your first time around a gnoll, and we can be a little... rambunctious. So I\u2019ll try not to bombard you boys with too many of my little \u2018challenges\u2019, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a moment. \u201cWait\u2026 what happens if WE win a challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs. \u201cWell, the same thing! I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea immediately fills your head. You can\u2019t spend the night with a\u2026 monster! Who knows what she could be capable of? And she\u2019s already stinking up the whole house with her horrid BO! But if you manage to beat one of her little \u2018games\u2019... you could just tell her to go home and leave you alone.

I know, let's get you some exercise, gnoll style.\" She rubs her hands together with gleeful anticipation. There wasn't a hint of malice in that big smile, but you were unsettled all the same at the prospect of gnoll exercise. With a slight tremble in your voice you ask her to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll be fun. Us gnolls don't really do your usual workouts. We just tend to fight... okay, not really fight, more like wrestling. Just a bit of rough fun between friends to get our bodies going. And well, the results can be seen...\" She flexes her arms. In spite of her somewhat pudgy gut and cuddly appearance, it's clear those arms put even the strongest humans to shame. \"Whoever taps out or loses consciousness first loses. Real easy, I'm sure you'll love it.\" She was just exaggerating, right? These monsters just beat eachother up until one of them was knocked out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria paced back and forth around the garden, trying to picture a space for wrestling. She grabbed a few old pieces of wood from the shed and rammed them into the ground with nothing but her great strength. In spite of her looking all over the little shed, nothing useful could be found for the ropes that might be strong enough to handle Gloria's bulk. You were just going to have to imagine those. Amidst all of this Dave tried to sneak away, but the babysitter didn't miss a beat and hauled him right back to the side of the ring, promising she'd sit on him if he moved another muscle. Dave was uncharacteristically obedient after being faced with Gloria's looming butt. With the work done the gnoll stepped back and looked proudly at her improvised wrestling ring. You figured telling her it was only four pieces of wood sticking out of the lawn might not be the wisest move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll have to do. The sooner we get started the better. I mean, just look at you two. All skin and bones, not a muscle in sight. Since you're both so weak, I won't bother with one on one. Both of you, get in the ring and show me what you've got!\" With a shiver running down your spine you approach the babysitter, Dave following just behind you. Gloria held out a paw and cheekily motioned for you to get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry boys, I'll go easy on you. Just don't hold back and give it your all.\" You hesitantly nod and charge forward, barging your shoulder into her thigh and trying to use that momentum to sweep her leg and knock her on her ass. It all sounded so good in your head, but in practice your mighty charge didn't cause her leg to move a hair. You grappled and pulled as best you could, but your adversary was simply too big and strong. Dave went at it with about as much spirit as he put into anything else. He grabbed hold of Gloria's other leg and tried to move it, throwing feeble punches and a few half-hearted shoves. It all looked pretty pathetic, but if the gnoll's toothy smile was anything to go by, she appreciated the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... it's worse than I thought. You two noodles really don't know what you're doing.\" She almost pitied you, especially knowing what was about to happen. \"Oh well, my turn.\" Your heart sank and you brace yourself for the worst.</span></div></div>",

She quickly got back on her feet, laughing at the two humans twitching on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, you can do better than that. Try aiming your attacks a little higher.\" Dave seemed to understand that he could go all out without worrying about hurting someone. He took all his frustration along and lunged at his enemy. She'd be sorry for the humiliation she put him through. It looked very heroic until he landed his punch right in her gut. The soft mass just jiggled as it absorbed his blow. Gloria responded by picking him up and rubbing his face in her sweaty armpit. He trashed wildly in her grasp, but she didn't let go until he had a generous facefull of her grimy sweat. She dropped him back down to focus on her next attacker, but you were already a step ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirect attacks were pointless against her. She was too strong and big to take down with a head on assault. You had to be clever. You ran past her and threw a heavy hit against the back of her knee. Gloria yelped, she didn't see that one coming as she lost her balance. Her big gut was now working against her, adding to the momentum. You didn't expect to topple her so easily, but this presented a new problem. The gnoll was slowly tipping over in your direction. You sidestepped as best you could but your legs were caught under the falling babysitter. You expected an angry counterattack, but when she grabbed you and pulled you free you were hoisted to her smile. She was beaming with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the stuff. You learn fast. Your brother on the other hand...\" She looked over her shoulder. Dave had snuck up behind her and was kicking and punching her in the back. The gnoll pitied his weak limbs, as he was closer to giving her a massage than dealing any damage. \"Well, I guess he's at least trying now, we'll call it progress.\" She rolled onto her back, surprising Dave and flattening him beneath her. Gloria sat up, and looked at the squashed boy lying in the grass. She still held you in one hand and picked him up in the other. She threw you both up in the air a little bit before catching you in a big hug. She held you so tight breathing was nearly impossible. You struggled as best you could, but it was clear this fight was close to finished. She squeezed ever tighter until neither you nor your brother offered much more than weak squirming. With her victims neatly subdued it was time for Gloria to claim her victory. She had to knock at least one of you out and there were so many ways to do it. The choice made her giddy with anticipation. What finisher did she have in store for you and Dave?</span></div></div>",

You felt so bad for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried down the sidewalk towards the neighborhood\u2019s swimming pool, which was only a few blocks away.

You gulped as your fears became true, it was summer after all, so a lot of people from your neighborhood were still around night swimming. As soon as Joyanne stumbled her way through the gate the multitude of human\u2019s in the pool freaked out and started to run. You even noticed amongst the crowd some of your neighbors and friends from school. They all scrambled towards any other exit in the area. Joyanne didn\u2019t pay much mind though as she nearly tripped into the deep end of the pool. She re-emerged with a toothy smile and a sigh of relief, \u201cOh, that\u2019s much better.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your friends from school, Mike, a boy one grade behind you ran up and pulled on your arm, \u201cCome on man, run before she eats us.\u201d You shook your head, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Mike shrieked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d You shrugged, \u201cShe\u2019s my babysitter.\u201d You blushed, embarrassed to admit you were being babysat but this really didn\u2019t register with Mike, \u201cJ-just\u2026 stay safe then. Try not to get to close to its mouth.\u201d He turned around and belted out of the gates. You groaned, tonight was going to be interesting that\u2019s for sure. Then you heard Dave whine, \u201cHey fish-lady, can I use you as a pool floaty?\u201d You groaned, \u201cDave, quit it. She\u2019s a person, not a pool toy.\u201d Dave bickered, \u201cShe\u2019s not a person, she\u2019s a monster.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyanne raised her voice, \u201cEnough boys. Shush. You\u2019re making me anxious, and the only way for me to calm down is to eat.\u201d Dave rolled his eyes, \u201cWell, what do you eat then, fatty?\u201d Joyanne smirked, swimming towards the in-ground pool\u2019s edge, \u201cFor starters little brats like you.\u201d All of a sudden you heard police sirens and lights flash behind you, \u201cStop! Police.\u201d You gulp, realizing how bad this night was going to turn out for you three. You turn around and gasp when you see a\u2026 monster in a police officer uniform. Two monster police officers, one ogress and one male basilisk stood before you. The basilisk showed his badge, \u201cI\u2019m officer Benjamin Scale and I\u2019m here to arrest Ms. Joyanne for showing herself to humans in a public setting. I\u2019ll need to take you two in for questioning as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave complained, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d The ogress raised a brow and grinned, \u201cThat\u2019s understood, but we still need to figure out why this monster woman was walking around the human world with no further Monstrous Supervision.\u201d The two monsters hoisted the Bunyip out of the pool and put her in handcuffs, Officer Scale brought Joyanne to the car while the ogress pulled out some kind of locket charm and opened a strange portal with it, \u201cWould you two cuties mind coming with me? Don\u2019t worry about Joyanne, the most she\u2019ll get for this is a fine and some community service hours. We have no previous offenses on her record.\u201d Dave shouted, \u201cOur parents told us never to go anywhere with strangers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogress rolled her eyes and put her hands on her hips, \u201cKid, we\u2019re the police, you\u2019re technically breaking the law if you don\u2019t follow police instruction.\u201d Dave stuck out his tongue, \u201cNo way. You\u2019re a monster. Plus you smell bad and look ugly. Why don\u2019t you go back to the swamp with Shrek!\u201d This made the ogress officer fume with rage, an angry grin formed on her face, \u201cWow, how discriminatory. Typical human. I always knew humans were stuck-up and speciesist, but I never knew they started this young. Alright kid, here\u2019s the deal, you\u2019re either going to come with me in piece, or I\u2019m shoving you two up my butt crack and taking you with me.

You both nod at Gina\u2019s request and you smile up at her, \u201cWe\u2019d love to go.\u201d Gina smiled back at you, \u201cCool. Cool. Let\u2019s go.

She pulled open the lid and pinched some of the grains from the container. She rolled them in her hand and blew them towards you two. The grains expanded into a thick, foggy smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dave both cough as the smoke envelopes you three. As it starts to dissipate, you realize you can hear faint bass-heavy EDM music in the distance, and people talking. Once the smoke is all gone you and Dave look around and realize you\u2019re at the old McWheller Mansion, a huge house on the edge of town, shrouded by a thick patch of forest. It was a huge estate that was abandoned after its owner became obsessed with hunting monsters and was hospitalized for psychiatric examination. All of the mansion\u2019s lights were on and party music was pumping through every room, but what made you gasp in shock was the party attendants. There was not a person like you or Dave in sight, conversing, dancing, drinking and partying in every room were monsters. There were tons of different monsters from folklore, movies and everything in between. You spotted some vampires, werewolves, wendigo, witches, dragons, cat people, snake people, basilisks, the loch ness monster, zombies, wyvern, and everything beyond and in-between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a weird feeling in the pit of your stomach. Part of you was amazed, another part excited to see all these creatures and be invited to their party, as well as a horrifying fear that one of these beasts might turn you into a party snack. You tap Gina on the arm, \u201cG-gina? Is this a party for\u2026?\u201d Gina interjects with a warm smile, \u201cMonsters? Of course, I mean I\u2019m a monster after all. I wasn\u2019t gonna invite you guys to a human party!\u201d Gina giggled as if this wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, or unexpected. You and your little brother gapped at Gina, \u201cYou\u2019re a monster?\u201d She smirked and raised a brow, \u201cUh, hello kid\u2026 blue skin? Not really typical for humans. What\u2019s wrong? Never seen a Frost Giant before?\u201d Dave asked, \u201cIf you\u2019re a Frost Giant, why aren\u2019t you really big?\u201d Gina smirks and replies\u2026</span></div></div>",

Eventually loud dance and electronic music started blaring through your house as multiple monsters both flooded the kitchen with their own cases of alcohol and raided your parent\u2019s liquor cabinet.

It'd be a shame to swallow him now, unable to taste him for the rest of the evening. She stood tall, easily towering over your house and eyeing your backyard. Carefully the fenrir stepped over your house. All the while she kept dragging Dave from one corner of her maw to the next, frequently brushing him against her big, sharp teeth. His terrified whimpering convinced her that he might have learned his lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the front door and dash through the house, Feya's ominous heavy footsteps echoing all around you. You hoped none of those heavy steps would smash through the house, or your parents were going to throw a fit. Did they know they hired an enormous wolf to watch you?

Questions for later as you threw open the back door just in time to see Dave again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful gust of smelly wolf breath Feya blew Dave to the front of her maw before letting him slide past her thick lips and onto the grass.

The gloomy one bursts into tears, Dave's comment apparently having hurt her.  You fear the grumpy head, now staring daggers at Dave, but you find yourself more upset by the gloomy head's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Dave?\" you say with a shake of your head, already reaching for the box of tissues and cautiously approaching the gloomy head, \"Here, don't take it personally, he's a jerk to everybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smirks at the effect he's having on the new \"babysitter\" even as you attempt to dry the eyes of the gloomy head.

Of course, it doesn\u2019t take long for you to notice something orders of magnitude more shocking\u2026 her wings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe boasted MASSIVE, gorgeous wing-like arms, with long talons instead of heads and vibrant orange feathers, just the same color as her hair! In addition, her legs from the knees down were covered in similar feathers, and also boasted talons instead of feet! On a more mundane level, she had dark skin, a petite figure, and she donned a blue hoodie and some jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at the stunned look on your face! \u201cHa! It seems my reputation precedes me!\u201d She laughed. \u201cYup! You\u2019re looking at the highest-ranking esports player in The Land of Monsters!\u201d You realize she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re stunned because she\u2019s a harpy\u2026 she thinks you\u2019re stunned because you\u2019re a fan of hers! You\u2019re too shocked by her appearance to correct her, of course, and she happily let's herself into your foyer while you\u2019re frozen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your mother tells me you boys are big into video games?\u201d She said with a sly grin. \u201cWell, you\u2019re in for a wild night! I\u2019d love to play with ya\u2026 although I gotta warn you, I\u2019m the best gamer around! I\u2019ll go easy on you, though\u2026 heh!\u201d You keep staring at her wings, wondering if she\u2019s wearing some kind of costume. But from the way she moves them\u2026 they have to be real! But how!? Didn\u2019t she something about The Land of Monsters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t long before Dave trotted in just to make this whole situation even more frustrating and confusing then it already was. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He raised a brow. \u201cWho invited the birdbrain?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself!\u201d She lifts one of her feathered feet into the air like a flamingo as she does a curt little bow. \u201cI am Ferise! Your mother hired me to babysit you for the night. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not one of those boring sitters. We\u2019re gonna have a TON of fun!\u201d Dave seemed ready to retort rudely, like he always does\u2026 but his tune changed when he noticed that bag she was carrying was stuffed with electronics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second...\u201d He paused. \u201cDid you bring some games?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I brought along a TON of games! Even some prototypes that haven\u2019t even been released to the public!\u201d She smiles, opening the bag and showing off all sorts of consoles and titles the two of you have never seen before. Dave\u2019s eyes light up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh! I like this sitter already!\u201d He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater\u2026 \u201cEugh? What is THIS?\u201d The harpy gags, as if disgusted, when she walked into your room and saw the video game you had been playing earlier still open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuhhh...\u201d You paused, staring at the screen. \u201cGod of War?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese graphics are absolutely TERRIBLE! I can hardly even tell what I\u2019m looking at!\u201d You let out a little gasp when Ferise pretty much rips your PS4 from the wall, wires trailing behind it as she tosses it away onto your bed. Before you can complain, though, she plops down another console right where your old one had been sitting! This one, well\u2026 it looked amazing! You had never seen anything like it before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was solid black, and it almost looked like it was in the shape of a penrose triangle\u2026 but surely, that was impossible, right? You were further impressed when she plugged the console in and turned it on, and the whole thing lit up like a lava lamp! \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I give you\u2026 the Trimonster!\u201d She smiled, announcing it just as the word \u2018Trimonster\u2019 appeared on the screen. \u201cIt\u2019s a super outdated console by monster standards\u2026 but way better than anything you humans have!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the home screen in awe. It was one of the most beautiful menus you\u2019ve ever seen. You sat down on the couch next to the harpy, as she handed you two, similarly cool-looking controllers. She, on the other hand, was using a controller specifically designed for her monster-like hands. As she showed you how the games menu looked, Dave pointed at the screen. \u201cHey! What\u2019s that game?\u201d He asked, pointing to the logo for the game currently in the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s Gluttonfest! That\u2019s one of my faves. Here, let me show you what it\u2019s all about!\u201d Ferise smiled. She tapped the icon\u2026 and the game INSTANTLY loaded up! You were almost startled when the theme music started playing\u2026 and the graphics blew your mind! It looked EXACTLY like real life! The frame rate was impeccable, the models were so unbelievably detailed, the fur physics were incredible\u2026 it was hard to distinguish this from the real thing! You both watch, excited, as she clicks on the multiplayer mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came across some sort of character select screen, featuring literally thousands of different monsters. \u201cGo ahead! Pick your monster!\u201d Ferise said. You quickly picked a big werewolf woman, admiring its incredible model and textures while Dave chose a huge ogre. Ferise chose a harpy, of course. Now, you didn\u2019t know what this game was about\u2026 but when she clicked \u2018random map\u2019, and the game loudly announced a map named \u2018Birthday Party\u2019, you really started to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match begins with an incredible, highly-detailed cutscene of a birthday party, in the backyard of a suburban neighborhood. It seems mundane at first\u2026 at least, until you jump a bit, startled, when monsters suddenly come crashing through the fence! It was the ogre, harpy, and werewolf you three had picked! Frightened, the children at the birthday party immediately fleed\u2026 and the match began! \u201cYou ever played hungry, hungry hippos? Well, this is sort of like that,\u201d Ferise explains as you start to figure out the control. \u201cWhoever gobbles up the most youngsters, wins! Although be careful - the more are in your belly, the slower you move, so you have to strategize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, WHAT!? You were immediately horrified at the premise... but Dave just laughs! \u201cHaha! Cool!\u201d He chuckles, moving his ogress around now that he knew the control. He moved over towards a kid who had been trying to hide under a table, and with a click of a button, his ogress reaches under the table and snatches him. In only a second, the ogress dangles the boy above her mouth and drops him in, the boy completely disappearing into her huge stomach. The photorealistic graphics only made the sight all the more horrifying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice one! Different monsters have different stats and abilities, so try to experiment!\u201d Ferise smiled, before demonstrating, her character flying towards a kid who was trying to hop a fence. The harpy moved MUCH faster, and could fly\u2026 but on the other hand, it took her much longer to swallow somebody, and it slowed her down more. You watched them both laugh and get to work, trying to gobble down as many people as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you realize you were way in last place! This game was horrifying to you\u2026 but you still didn\u2019t want to lose! Hesitantly, you moved the werewolfess you were playing to chase after the fleeing partiers. You noticed that your werewolf was about inbetween the ogre and the harpy in terms of strength and speed. All monsters have the ability to plow through walls and fences while sprinting, which is useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour werewolf has its own special ability - Pounce - which you use to pin a boy who was rushing into the woods! You hesitate, feeling a little nauseous, as your finger hovers over the button to eat him\u2026 before finally pressing down. With that, the werewolf\u2019s maw descends on him, and when she stands up, there\u2019s a pair of kicking legs dangling from her jaws - which quickly disappear down into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, the match continues. There are about two dozen targets in total, and all three of you compete to see who can have the most in their belly by the end of the match. Once they're all gone, the winner is revealed...</span></div></div>",

You thought this whole game had been extremely morbid in premise\u2026 so you sighed in relief when the round-ending scene was of the monsters spitting the kids out, unconscious unharmed, and tallying them up. \u201cWait\u2026 so\u2026\u201d You tilt your head, relieved and confused in equal measures. \u201cThey didn\u2019t digest them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. Of course not. Why would they?\u201d Ferise replied, waving a wing dismissively as if it was a stupid question. \u201cKids are tasty, but monsters don\u2019t just go around digesting them for no reason. That\u2019d just be cruel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she talks about them\u2026 it almost seems she considers monsters to be real. \u201cOkay, wait.

There\u2019s a monster standing right in front of you! Are you blind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a little grumble as you shake your head. Sure, the harpy might technically be a monster\u2026 but really, she was basically just a human with winged arms and feet. The monsters you\u2019ve seen in this game, though\u2026 they\u2019d be horrifying to ever actually encounter! \u201cNo, I mean like\u2026 that werewolf\u2026 and that ogre\u2026!\u201d You clarify<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. Those are definitely real, too. Pretty much every monster you\u2019ve heard of is real\u201d she nods, as if this was all totally normal. \u201cAnd they\u2019re hungry buggers, too! I once saw an ogress just like that gulp down THREE DOZEN little brat-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so\u2026\u201d You pause.  \u201cMonsters can actually swallow people!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d she shrugs nonchalantly. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m a little\u2026 small, but monster standards. So I couldn\u2019t swallow you without shrinking you first. But I can invite a friend over, if you wanna know what it\u2019s like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no thank you\u2026\u201d You shudder, shaking your head. She only laughs in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, enough talking! I want a rematch!\u201d Dave loudly and obnoxiously protests. Ferise smiles as she starts a new match, this time choosing the map \u2018Summer Camp\u2019. Ferise chose to play as a ghost, Dave chose to play as a demoness, and you chose a dragoness. All the while. though, you\u2019re silently considering what you\u2019ve been told. So\u2026 monsters are real, it seems. That was a lot to process. How many people knew about these things?

It\u2019s an ancient tradition. If there are so many brats, nowadays, it\u2019s because parents no longer believe in a good, sound spanking. Corporal punishment it\u2019s always the best thing to do to raise respectful children. Naughty brat must be straightened with a firm hand. On the other hand, I heavily despise child abuse, and there are no reason to be too strict with a normally well behaved child.\u201d<br>\r\nYou are not sure you agree with the demoness, but you think that if your parents had spanked David, he would have been grown to be a more respectful boy.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I see your Ruten?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\nThe sitter nods again, and takes out from the basket she has on her back a big and scary bundle of birches, united by red strings.<br>\r\n\u201cI use this only on real bad children.\u201d she explains, shoving it in the hair \u201cNormally, I prefer time out or a spanking without implements.

The choice is yours.\u201d<br>\r\nYou bite your bottom lip, but you decide to stay on your position \u201cI don\u2019t mean to disrespect you, miss, but I refuse to eat it.\u201d<br>\r\nKrampus sighs and approaches you, saying \u201cVery well. It\u2019s a shame to have to spank a polite boy, but you leave me no choice.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything, she catches you with her strong hands, she sits on the chair and drags you across her knees.<br>\r\nIn a blink, your trousers and your underwear are at your ankles, with the demoness that scolds you \u201cYou need to learn to obey your elders, Richard. Being polite it\u2019s good, and will save you from getting the Ruten, but it is no enough.\u201d<br>\r\nImmediately after, her hands falls heavily on your bare buttock. It hurts. It hurts terribly. And it\u2019s just her hand. Now you see why Davis is still crying after getting the Ruten. After few slaps, you are already crying yourself.<br>\r\nThe spanking goes on for some time (almost a minute, that in your mind seems like an hour) till your bottom is bright red.<br>\r\nThe demoness lets you stand up and takes up for you your underwear and your trousers, saying sternly \u201cWill you be a good boy, now?\u201d<br>\r\nYou nod, still sobbing.<br>\r\nYou and David both sit at the table, and start to eat the baby food. It\u2019s quite humiliating, but you must admit it is tasty indeed. After you have finished the bottle too, Krampus smiles satisfied.<br>\r\n\u201cThere. Was it really that difficult? Couldn\u2019t have you done it without a red bottom?\u201d she says.<br>\r\nWanting to avoid the subject, you ask her \u201cExists other monster, forgive the word but I don\u2019t know what other word use instead, or are you the only one?\u201d<br>\r\nThe sitter smiles, replying \u201cMonster is okay, Richard. We call us that ourselves. And no, I\u2019m not the only one. In Monsterland, the place where I come from, there are a lot of different types of monsters: werewolves, witches, succubi, vampires, shapeshifters, slimes, nagas, centaurs, ogres, nekos, gargoyles, trolls, kitsune, dragons, poltergeists, mermaids, driders, sphinxes, gnolls, bunyips, ahools, frost giants, feral wolves that can talk, three headed anthro dogs, rakashas, harpies, white ladies, goblins. There is even a strange dragon called Ninki-Nanka. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019m forgetting someone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d you asks \u201cThere are other of your race?\u201d<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, answering \u201cNope. I\u2019m unique.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCan we visit Monsterland?\u201d David asks, suddenly excited.<br>\r\n\u201cSure. But you must stay next to me all time.\u201d she says, and takes out from the basket on her back two strings that you immediately recognize: they are baby reins, like those that are put on children and are basically a human version of a dog leash.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d David exclaims \u201cI don\u2019t need them!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, child, you do.\u201d Krampus says, sternly \u201cMonsters are not evil, but the can turn hostile to an unaccompanied human. If you stay next to me, and with these I\u2019m sure you will, nothing can happen to you. With these one, the worst think that can happen to you is getting a spanking from me for misbehaving in public.\u201d<br>\r\nDespite the reins, Davis is still excited to see Monsterland, and you are curious yourself. However, do you really feel ready to there?</span></div></div>",
